Kind of secluded with bunches of trees all around.  It was about 9:30-10:00 pm and I had stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and decided to look up and I saw a small star(?) moving along slowly across the sky. A few minutes later I saw 2 very bright lights that looked like huge stars stream across the sky...almost like they were chasing each other. They were moving so fast I saw them about a split second each maybe? Now I watch x-files and unsolved mysteries and all that is going through my mind is abduction so I turn and run in the house. I sit there and decide it was 2 shooting stars that I saw. I went back outside and ever so often I would see these lights darting through the trees and across the sky. I say I was out there about an hour and I saw these lights maybe 7 or 8 times through out that period of time. Each time these ""sighting"" lasted between 10 seconds to maybe a minute. I thought maybe they were fireflies but the lights were white not yellow. And they moved so quickly with no sound at all...they usually started out in almost a straight path, then they would change direction instantly and just zig zag a little bit. They blinked every...2 seconds maybe? Not blink like an airplane but like someone turning on a light every 2 seconds and turning it back off after a split second. Its hard to explain...darkenss for 2 seconds and then light for a split second. I could usually only see them through the trees but a few times they came out in open sky and they were moving so fast that there was almost a small streak behind them that made them look oval shaped...either that or they were already oval shaped i dont know. I could not really see them for too long. The only way I could really have a chance to really inspect their shape was to guess where the next light would show and sometimes they would change direction and be so quick that I would just see it out of the corner of my eye. This is so hard to explain. It moved cross the entire sky i! n about 5 or 6 blinks. Then it would be gone and come back in a couple of minutes. Sometimes it would make an entire spuratic circle around the yard through the trees. Then I saw a 3rd shooting star zip across the sky in a split second. I guess it could have been fireflies...i dont really know their behavior. I know for a fact it was not any kind of aircraft known to man yet. Can fireflies move in a straight line almost, skip around very quickly at will, are they that fast and bright, do they blink as systematically as an airplane would...as on-point as a computer cursor is when it blinks? These things could move so fast sometimes I couldnt keep up. If anything...it was quite a light show. A few airplanes came through the area while I was out there also.  After about an hour the lights were gone.  I am going back out there tonight to see what I can find.  Maybe get a picture.  I had seen something like this before in the same spot but I was inside looking outside and only saw it for a brief moment a few months ago.  I have read the other messages posted here and there are a few that sound similar to what I saw.  If it wasnt fireflies...it was incredible...I have never seen anything like it.  PLease email me at ((e-address deleted)) if you know what I saw.",2002-08-16T00:00:00,35.9665,-79.345

I don't really blieve in aliens or anything making it to earth, but me and a friend saw the strangest craft one night. We were driving north on I-95 back home at about 10pm when we saw this ball of orange light in the northwest. I was the first to point it out, as I was the passenger. It looked like a meteor or something. I was a little freaked out at first -- I kept having visions like in the movies, where the meteor crashes to Earth and all hell breaks loose. But the 'ball' never hit. It sort of faded out and disappeared at first. My friend saw it too and decied to pull over to safely view whatever it was. A couple seconds later it was hovered almost directly over us; it was pretty large...larger than a helicopter and had no visible wings, more like a long triangle. There were no flashing beacons or standard collision lights except 3 dim white lights on the bottom. It hovered for about 5 minutes before this huge (about 1/3 the size of the craft it self) bright blue afterburn came out the back and it took off. In a couple of seconds it sped off towards the northeast and was gone for good. What was so strange was that there didn't seem to be much sound when the craft took off; I was expecting a sonic boom at the least, but nothing. My friend and I could not believe what we had just seen. About a half hour later in a supermarket, a woman overheard us talking about the event we had seen and chimed in that her son had seen the same thing at a soccer game.

It was a summers night back in 1954, I was just a kid. My father was working outside and I was hanging out with him, when it got dark my mother called me into the house to get ready for bed. I had been in the house for just a few minutes when my father burst into the house yelling ""Everyone come outside quick you have to see this"". I ran out the front door after my father and followed him to the end of our walk. He stopped and turned back towards the house and dropped to his knee,grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me around. There to the right of our house up in the black night sky were 3 luminus disc shaped objects traveling from East to West very slowly. I became so scared I ran back into the house at full speed with my father right behind me. He was trying to catch me to bring me back out to watch the lights but his foot steps behind me scared me even more. As I entered the living room he grabbed me and picked me up and said "" you have to see this you may never see anything like this again in your life"". He took me back outside and made me watch. The lights were behind the house by then so we moved to the driveway to the left of the house. There they were 3 pulsing discs glowing brightly gliding through the sky, silent, silhouetting the trees that were between us and the objects. A calm came over me as my father set me on the ground, as I watched the 3 objects I noticed something dropping out of the back of them it reminded me of the tinsel we put on our Christmas tree. This tinsel like substance was also glowing as it dropped out the back but soon disappeared a few feet under the objects. I just stood in awe watching them now really starting to study them I noticed that as they pulsed at the dimmest part of the pulse that you could almost see through them like they were semi-transparent. They flew along and finally disappeared behind a wooded area out of sight. Then as I stood there in somewhat of a trance I was startled by the sound of the night insects, the katy-did's and the like, all starti! ng their sounds together. It was then that I had realized that they too had been in a trance and were silent untill the objects were gone. It was a very strange night to say the least and till this day I have never witnessed anything quite like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have arbitrarily assigned a date in July 1954.

I believe it was in the late 60s that the event which I am about to describe took place. Late one evening, my father was listening to the Arkasas Traveler's baseball game on a local AM station.  At one point during the game the station broadcast that numerious people were calling in and reporting that a UFO could be seen in the night sky over North Little Rock. Upon hearing this, my father, mother, and one or more of my siblings went outside to observe. On that paticular evening, I was camping out with a friend in his backyard. His house was about a block down the street from my parents house. Not really expecting or looking for anything unusual my friend and I observed an object to the east traveling north.  It moved silently across the sky and and several amber lights that traveled in a circular motion around the exterior of the object as if it were rotating. We were in our early teens and did not really think too much about what we had seen. When I arrived at home the following day, my parents told me what had happened the previous evening and about the radio broadcast.  They too had observed the same object my friend and I had seen. In addition there was an article in the Arkansas Democrat the next day stating that jet aircraft at the Little Rock Air Force base had been scrambled but was unsuccessful in their pursuit of the object.  If anyone else has knowledge of this event and can relate the specific year and day I would appreciate it as I would like to find the article in the Ark Democrat archives.  In addition to this event there was another similar event that occurred in Jacksonville Arkansas in the late 60s where jets from the Little Rock AFB were scrambled to chase an object. This event was also documented in the Arkansas Democrat. ((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to obtain the exact date from the newspaper.

We passed through one field to another where I saw a very large saucer shaped object. One moment I was standing in the field next to this person looking up at this object. The next thing I remember was being inside what looked like a suergical theatre on a bed or trolley unable to move or react being examined by unfamiliar beings who appeared to be carrying out what looked like surgical or medical procedures. Later I found myself back in another field near the festival site feeling completely disorientated. The festival was over so I made my way back to London Much later I developed a cyst on the back of my neck which seemed to be infected. Eventually it settled down and I was left with a small lump on the back of my neck which is still there. There were also 2 symetrical marks on my abdomen near the spleen which now look like moles. At the time i did not think much of this nor associate it with what happened at the field. However I have decided to have these investigated out by my doctor ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were in the New River / Courentyne River area across from Suriname. At dawn we were awake by the noise of all sorts of animals causing a commotion by the river. we rushed from the bushes to the river and saw a large silver saucer hoovering over the middle of the river. It appeared to be drawing up water in a upside down funnel shape into a iris-shaped opening in the underside. We watched it for about 10 min. then suddenly the water spout fell back down and the craft shot straight up until it disappeared. The others with me were my late father, ((name deleted)) - a surveyor, ((name deleted)), my uncle - a guide in the interior and a Amerindian local guide named ((deleted)). A few weeks later in the same general area, we chased a loud sound overhead in thick forest and managed to get glimpses through the thick vegetation of a shiny object that suddenly disapeared. Our Indian tracker couldn't identify footprints we saw on a sandy beach we came upon that had a fire burning on the sand. It was just flames in a ball that had no obvious souce of fuel. We threw water on the fire but it did not go out. Eventually, we looked around and left. Things we observed at the ""campsite"" were that something with three legs was over the ball of fire. There were some fruits on the beach with bite marks in them. Our Amerindian guide could not identify the friut as from around the area. We saw the bite marks as small with round teeth marks. Some of the foot prints appeared to been shoed and others, smaller child sized were barefooted. Nothing was unusual about the footprints, they seemed human but were spaced close as if the person had short legs for the size of foot. Other claw shaped footprints seemed to have been frolicking with the small prints at the waters edge. ((The guide)), an expert in forest wildlife could not identify the claw marks. None entered the water and there were no prints coming to or fr! om the s andy beach. It was as if they just dropped down on the sandy beach or jumped off something in the water. The area seems devoid of wildlife, most unusual, not even insects were around the beach. This existed for about 20 feet in a circle around the beach camp area. Then at the perimeter of the circle life teemed as usual. On our way back a few weeks later, we visited the area again and saw signs that there were fresh footprints, the fruits did not show signs of decay and the area was still devoid of life. At the edge of the perimeter area, we found the carcass of a jaguar. The back legs were outside the area and was decomposing and the rest of the carcass that laid inside the area was still fresh and even the blood from it's mouth was still liquid. Animal tracks in the sand of the beach area stooped abruptly at the perimeter of a circle that was about 20' round.",2002-08-28T00:00:00,,

In late evening of mid June 1973 (best guess) I and my three daughters (aged ((deleted--preteens))) were watching TV when I noticed that there was a full moon and a clear sky so I took the girls out onto the patio to look at the moon.  Within a few minutes I noticed a craft pass directly overhead at an estimated altitude of 200-300 feet.  At the time I was a ((rank deleted)) in USAF working in flight ((deleted--involves flight activities)).  I had been in USAF about ((duration deleted)) years at that time and had worked with aircraft for about 7 years and could identify most of USAF flying inventory at that time.  After the craft passed over I told the girls that I hoped that that EC-121 was not in trouble and did not crash because he was way too low for normal flight.  My first impression was that it was a USAF EC-121 Radar Picket airplane which were stationed at McClellan AFB.  These planes were 1930's era Lockheed Super Constellations.  As we steped back into the house the program we had been watching had been prempted by a local newsbreak.  An unidentified craft had been reported in the Fair Oaks, Citrus Heights areas.  Upon reflecting on what we had seen I realized that there had been no engine sounds.  An EC-121 at 300 feet, assuming not all engines were out, would have been deafening directly over head. It is my contention that the brain does not immediately misidentify objects which it cannot readily identify; but initially attempts to identify such objects as a known object.  When I ponderd why I initially identified the craft as a 121 a number of clues came forward.  It appeared to be a medium gray color in the bright moon light the 121's at the base were painted gray.  It appeared to have a wing; however upon reflection I could not recall a fuselage, only a wing.  It appeared to have portholes with light emmanating from them. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for the excellent report!  Given your credentials as a USAF military officer, the report is particularly interesting to us.  If possible, I would like to pin down the date with somewhat greater accuracy.  Is there any way you could reconstruct the date, do you think?  For example, do you remember the program you were watching, by any chance?  Also, do you happen to recall the station you were watching that broadcast the news report?  Do you remember the phase of the Moon, perhaps?  Do your daughters remember the incident, by any chance?  If so, would they be willing to submit independent reports of their recollection of the event?  We have observed that different witnesses recall different details about an object, and all those facts help in understanding what was seen.  Finally, could you provide us with an illustration of the object you saw?  If your daughters could do the same, we would be happy to post them with your reports.   Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center!  Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) Hello Peter, I would very much like to help pin down the date but all I remember was that I am fairly certain it was in the summer and it was not oppressively hot that night as I recall so I believe it to have been May or June and the moon was full as I recall.  I am fairly sure of the year because we bought the house in summer of 1972 and I resigned my commission in ((month deleted)) 74 and I was working ((location deleted--West Coast)) by Summer of 74.  I put the patio in subsequent to the first summer we were there.  I have not a clue as to program or channel we were watching I am fairly certain it was one of big three ABC, CBS, NBC.  I have talked to my daughters about the incident in the past and they vaguely recall it but primarily because I have brought it up not because in left an impression upon them.  The image in my mind is of a wing with portholes with light emanating from them.  I can sketch such for you and email it.  I had another incident which took place at my parents home in a small village called ((town name deleted)), NY in early July 1978; I will submit it sometime.  At this time I am sort of busy moving my possessions from Maryland to Northern NY; have been at it for about 4 months.

I heard on the TV news a few years ago that others saw it too, but they reported it, and the local newspaper printed a story about it, only I never reported my sighting nor did I see the story in the paper. But that story is in the news archives here. After all those years, I found out others DID see it. Are there any others on this site that saw what I am about to tell? If they did, they will know the city where it occured, and you can tell me by e-mail. It was a warm summer night in August (somewhere between the 3rd and 6th) 1973, when my 4 children and I were out in our yard watching the stars in the sky. The sky was so unusually clear. Soon two very perfect cumulus clouds moved into our view above us. Really perfect clouds, like a Disney drawing. There were many other clouds far away on the horizon. But these clouds were seperated by ample spaces of black, star splattered sky, and were very close to us. As we were observing this beautiful sight, a huge, perfectly round very huge sphere started slowly inching its way out of the top side of the cloud on our left. It had a green glow to it like a radium numbered watch. I thought it was the moon until my oldest child pointed out that the moon was to the west, and as I remember it was not a full moon. Before long there was lightening in those clouds. But it never went to the ground. After a while the lightening started going back and forth between those two clouds, across the star splattered space between the clouds, and all the while that sphere was slipping out of that cloud till it was almost completely out. Glowing steadly, not a flicker but that steady greenish glow. I thought it might be a weather balloon untill that very active lightening that was dancing from cloud to cloud, struck the sphere and red sparks flew out in all directions at the piont of contact. Then the sphere started retreating back into the cloud where it came from, and it took as much time to retreat as it took to emerge before; till it disappeared back into that cloud completely. All this took about 35 to 40 minutes to happen. But the strangest thing I can remember is that those clouds stopped moving in the sky untill the whole episode played out. Then the clouds moved on. I told my brother, who was in the Air Force at the time, and he made such fun of me, I never talked about it again. Have you ever heard of any sightings like this before?

I go to sleep and sleep rather deeply during these times of uneasyness and wake up with the worst headache and body aches I have ever felt.

There is a table in the middle of the room with an instrument of some kind above it. The walls of the room are a weird kind of composition because when it is touched it is like a weird soft gel like substance.

This is a large flat area tapering off to a view point in a wooded area to the west.  The elevation is 5500-6000 feet. Clear weather near dusk. Visibility was about 30 miles. We were enjoying the wiew at dusk from the viewpoint,(facing west) we had been observing Navy E-A6 aircraft operating in  the area until about 17:00, a UH-1 was fire fighting south of Rimrock lake until about 20:00. My friend pointed out what looked like a triangular flying wing with a wingspan of about 30ft, and a depth of about 5ft along its centerline.  It approached from our right (North) moving at about 100kts, it was silent and had no discernable markings and was dark grey or black in color.  It continued south for about 30 sec then turned east as if following US 12 (highway) We ran back to the campsite and retrieved a set of binoculars and returned to the view point.   (3 min elapsed time)  after about 5 minuets the whatever it was returned and re-traced its prevous route. Both of us got a good look at it with the binoculars, while the light was poor we could see no protrusions or control surfaces.  It passes about 100 west of our position at an altitude of 6000-7000 ft (200 or so AGL) We assumed that we had seen an RPV of some type.  Both of us have military backgrounds.  Armor for my Friend and Air Defense for my self. We walked back to our campsite and saw the thing a third time.  It was proceeding east to west along Bethel ridge at a very low 100 or so feet AGL.  We were emerging from the trees facing onto the open or ""prarrie"" area of Cash Prarrie.  The Object reached a position near our camp.  We laughed as we thought some drone operator was trying to have some fun with us.  We discussed various rude things to do in return. The whatever it was slowed to a hover, and began a slow circle of our campsite decending to about 30 ft AGl.  it was traveling VERY slowly perhaps 5 kts it kept the pointed ""nose"" of the craft pointing at the camp as it circled.  it was moving far to slowly for areodynamic lift. Now becomming frightened we hid in some undergrowth as it continued along its prevous course, this took it very nearly over our heads.  I laid on my belly and watched it pass to our left.  again there was no sound. We took a quick survey of our camp discovering noting amiss, we then PROMPTLY packed our things and left the area.

The only sound, was a soft humming.  Suddenly, from somewhere on the craft, a beam of light shot out and directly onto my car. 1972, June. I was working the second shift in the local hospital in Sharon Ct. My mother who lived in Sharon was babysitting for my 5 month old son.  I left the hospital around 11:30, stopping at my mothers to pick my son up and her (she was coming to my home to spend the night). We left her house around 11:40pm enroute to my home in Millerton N.Y.. The night sky was very clear, staars in abundance.  A beautiful summer night.  The flashing lights of what we thought was an airplane caught our eye.  It was at a very high altitude, almost appeared that it was another star except for the colored lights, (blue, red, green)..To our horror, it started to ""fall"" from the sky at a tremendous rate of speed...I stopped my car and with my hands over my ears ( didn't want to hear the noise when it impacted against the ground)..watched as it plummeted toward us.  Then, right before our eyes, it stopped, just over the trees not 50 feet from our car. We were terrified, with my hands shaking I watched in shear fright as it hovered above the trees.  It was a saucer shape, metallic gray in color, with a dome that had what appeared to be rows of windows.  It was so close that both my mother and I could see inside.  What we saw will forever remain in my our memories!  They were not human!  Four or five beings with a grayish skin tone, and huge black eyes looked out at us.  Suddenly from somewhere on the craft a beam of brilliant, blue-white light, struck our car...this beam of light was so bright that it ""hurt"" our eyes, for about 15 seconds this light remained on my car and then suddenly it imploded back into the craft. Slowly the craft began to move directly over the car.  The only sound it made was a very soft humming.  I was absolutley terrified, my only thought at that time was to get my infant son home where we would be safe ?  I took my foot from the brake and proceeded to drive.  The craft remained at the same altitude and drifted just  about 100 feet ahead of me.  The road that I was on was a secondary road that joined with a major rt.  I intersected rt. 22 and began my 10 min. drive from there to my home.  The craft remained ahead of me at the same distance and altitude until I turned off 22 onto MaGhee Hill Rd., where I lived.  When I arrived at my house my mother and I could still the hummi! ng from the craft as it continued going north, above rt. 22.  The next day on the 12:00 news there was a brief report of "" a UFO "" sighting  in the city of Albany N.Y. about 50 miles from Millerton.  This sighting had been reported by two N.Y. state troopers !  It was seen about two hours after I had seen it.  They described the craft exactly as I did, same lights, speed, color, and ""it made a humming"" noise.  To get to Albany from Millerton one would drive north, on rt. 22.  I have always believed that this craft seen in Albany was the same one that I had seen two hours earlier as I drove home. This was my first sighting of a UFO, but it has not been the only sighting I have had.  Since that time I have had six or seven additional sightings. They have been different shapes, triangle, cigar..saucers.  There is no doubt in my mind that we are not alone here on this planet and we have not been for many thousands of years.  The technology behind the crafts I have seen, was and still is far to advanced for our world.",2002-09-19T00:00:00,41.9758,-73.5441

Were I live, they have a lot of police helicopters patrolling the area at night, so I didn't pay any attention. The light hit my van and as it did I rolled down the window and waved above my van. Even though I could not see what I though might be a police helicopter. I realized something was wrong. I couldn't here any helicopter blade noise! It was at that time I also noticed that the car behind me had slammed on it breaks and was stopped in the middle of the road a ways back. Also as I passed the intersection I noticed the person stopped at the light had his head hanging out the window and was staring at my van, as I drove bye. By that time the spotlight went out. I looked out my side window and that's when I saw the dam thing. It couldn't have been more then 40 feet above my van. It was the size of my van looked spherical. The thing was blinking rapidly about 3 to 4 blinks a sec. a red orange color. But the bottom of it was a real bright greenish blue. The whole thing was lit up. There was a fool moon out that night with a few clouds and you could see this thing as bright as the moon it self! About a sec. After I first saw this thing, it shot out in front of me. I hit the gas and followed it. I was doing about 60 chasing it, when we got to a park that was in that area. It suddenly went right, towards the park and stopped for a minute, above a big tree. I turned in to the parking lot almost flipping my van and grabbed my video camera from under the seat. I started filming! Thank God I had my camera in the car. It slowly drifted southeast. No sound what so ever. There were times it would just shoot off at real high speed and I would have to find it again with my camera. I drove to the end of the parking lot and got some more good footage. When I got there I noticed there were a! lot of people there watching this thing to. They started coming towards me.  I found out they were there in the park for a late birthday party. To my surprise they also had cameras! ! ! We all watched it dart around and accelerate away right in to a cloud. As weird as it sounds, when it did there would be lightning flashes but no thunder!?!? It did this a few times. We could see it go in (flash) then it would come back out for a few minutes. Then it would do it again, then (flash) but still no thunder. Then it just went away. I got every one on video and we all exchanged numbers.

At the time,  I assumedthat they must have been aircraft.  But it's been a long time since then,  and I haven't ever seen any airplanes,or whatever, that even remotely resemble the objects I saw.I have just recently gained access to the Web,  and being amused by UFO stories,  I found my way to a couple of theUFO pages.  While browsing at Rutgers,  I ran across some reports of ""triangular UFO's"", which made my hair stand on end.  Up to that time,  I had not heard of ""triangular""UFO's.  Here's what I saw in late August, 1974 while Iwas in the backyard of my house in Campbell, CA (South SFBay area).I was laying on the ground, looking through a pair of 20 power binoculars.  My feet were pointed east, and the binoculars were pointed slightly to the right of straight up,  at about the one o'clock position.  Something went through my field of vision, moving right to left.  I caught up to it quickly,  and saw two objects flying in close  formation,  one behind and to the right of the one in front.They were both the same size, shaped like equilateral triangles with straight edges,  flying point forward. Their color appeared to be flat slate grey,  against a deep blacksky.  There were no features, and I saw no lights, or glow of any kind.  They appeared to be illuminated by the citylights.

The craft in front appeared more steady than  the trailing one, and the distance between them fluctuated randomly,  varying from nearly touching, to a maximum of a triangle length.  When the rear one began to lag,  it would suddenly snap back to a comfortable distance from the front one.  My impression was that it looked as though they were being manually controlled by pilots, and as if they had very high power to weight ratio, and like they were somewha thard to control.I watched them for about 8 to 12 seconds.  During that time,they maintained a due north heading, and covered about 80 to 90 degrees of azimuth.  After I lost sight of them,  I waited for several minutes for any sound.  I heard nothing.The binoculars were 20x50, with a field of view of 157 fee tat 1000 yards. If you assume that the objects were about 100 feet long,  and took up about 1/3 of the field of view, then their altitude would be 2000 yards, or 6000 feet, and their speed would be 568 mph.  That seems pretty conventional,but I think I would have heard jets at that altitude.Furthermore,  what jets have a perfect equilateral sillouette?The closest thing I can think of (that would be flying in 1974),is the B58 Hustler.  But my view was clear enough,  that I could have seen the little bit of fuselage in the front and backof the delta wing.I probably blew the simple geometry I used for the altitude and speed calculations,  but I've given enough facts that one could calculate height and speed for any craft of a given size.

For version in Portugese, please see below.  PD)) Many lights flashing slowly Dear Mr., I am writing these lines, intending to contribute in some forms in the research of the Exobiological fenomena, than by any another motive.  What do I pass to relate from now on, really happened. They were, more or less, 11 hours from the night in middle part of 1974.  I was 15 year olds then.  Arrive at home in that calm and starry night... When I look at the high sky, I saw a big ball of an yellowish light  like a big brilliant ring dislocating slowly of northeast for southeast, followed by many other lights smallerer in size than it. The colors and tinges, that varied of the red alive one, to the blue greenish one. I don't remember for certain from the quantity of lights, but I am able to say that were more of ten. The lights were foggy, as in a sign of neon, and they passed to impression of somewhat strange, unknown. I begin to squeak for my mother, that seems to be sleeping in that moment.  The lights enlivened itself to the decrease altitude (I realized this because near there was a stone quarry of some 800 meters of height and the airport is relativamente nearby and we could observe the planes upon raise flight).  I imagined that the lights dislocated themselves to, at least, some 1500 meters of altitude, without a noise.  Only my frightened shouts  broke to monotony of that hot night of Vitória, capital city of the  Espírito Santo state.  The neighborhood where my mother lives today stayed in the island of Vitória, the place is called Joana D' arc. In the following day, watching the important, National TV News, that covers all the cowntry, I remember of the announcer  placarding the event in short and laconic form.  He said in the note that the objects were observed dislocating themselves of the north from the Bahia state in direction to the Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro stateS... I remember well that in the newspaper of the following day -  Headlines alluded to the fact, and a note said that an inhabitant from the Mountain Range - a place called SERRA - a neighboring city, that stayed in a plateau, to have observed everything of binoculars. Some years latter, already adult, I was in the Vitória Public Files, looking for newspapers from the epoch to find the correct day of the fact, but I did not obtain recollect correct date.  After very it find, I gave up and did not more I try.. Today, past so many years, I continue with the remembrance of that night.  What did I observe not itself looked with that already had seen.  That experience went very outstanding and decisive in my life.  I read and I research everything that am able to do about these strange phenomena. These are the my remembrances.. I would like that you did a research to verify to truthfulness of these facts.  I apologize by do not be able to say the correct date.  But, in fact, it happened. I take advantage of this moment to thank you for the attention and I say good-bye putting myself to the his entire arrangement. Considerately, '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' Prezados Srs., Eram, mais ou menos, 11 horas da noite em meados do ano de 1974. Eu tinha 15 anos então. Chegara em casa àquela noite calma e estrelada e...ao olhar para o céu, ví uma grande bola, de uma luz amarelada e brilhante que se deslocava lentamente de nordeste para sudeste, seguida de muitas outras luzes menores de todas as cores e matizes, que variavam do vermelho vivo, ao azul esverdeado. Não me lembro ao certo da quantidade de luzes, mas posso dizer que eram mais de dez pontos brilhantes. Comecei a gritar por minha mãe, que já estava dormindo àquela hora, a nossa pequena casa estava toda às escuras. As luzes movimentavam-se à baixa altitude ( calculei isto porque próximo havia uma pedreira de uns 800 metros de altura e o aeroporto é relativamente perto e podíamos observar os aviões ao levantar vôo). Imaginei que as luzes deslocavam-se a, pelo menos, uns 1500 metros de altitude, sem nenhum ruído. Somente os meus gritos asustados quebravam a monotonia daquela noite quente de Vitória, capital do Espírito Santo. O bairro onde mora aindo hoje a minha mãe fica na ilha de Vitória, chama-se Joana D'arc. No dia seguinte, assistindo o Jornal Nacional, importante noticiário de TV, que cobre todo o Brazil, lembro-me do locutor  anunciando o evento de forma lacônica e breve. Dizia ele na nota que os objetos foram observados deslocando-se do norte da Bahia em direção ao Espírito Santo e Rio de Janeiro... Alguns anos mais tarde, já adulto, estive no arquivo público de Vitória, procurando jornais da época para certificar-me do dia correto em que o fato se dera, pois não conseguia recordar a data correta. Depois de muito  procurar, desistí e não mais tentei... Hoje, passados tantos anos, continuo com a lembrança viva daquela noite. O que observei não se parecia com nada que já tivesse visto. Aquela experiência foi muito marcante e decisiva em minha vida. Até hoje leio e pesquiso tudo que posso sobre estes estranhos fenômenos. Lembro-me bem que no jornal do dia seguinte-- Manchetes aludiam ao fato e uma nota dizia que um morador da Serra, uma cidade vizinha, que fica num planalto,  havia observado tudo de binóculos. Estas são as minhas lembranças... Gostaria que fizessem uma pesquisa para comprovarem a veracidade destes fatos. Peço desculpas por não poder precisar a data correta. Mas, de fato aconteceu. Aproveito pra agradecer pela atenção e me despeço colocando-me à sua inteira disposição. Atenciosamente,",2002-09-19T00:00:00,,
I can witness to the actual size of a craft,Simi Valley,CA,1976-06-15T22:00:00,circle,10 sec.ish,"Occurred : 6/15/1976 22:00  (Entered as : 1976 22:00) Reported: 9/17/2002 1:49:57 AM 01:49 Posted: 9/19/2002 Location: Simi Valley, CA Shape: Circle Duration:10 sec.ish",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25110.html,"I can witness to the actual size of a craft I am 36 now, but when I was about 10 years old I saw a disk shaped craft glide between my home and my neighbors home, it was under the roof lines of our homes, and it was in a school zone area close to the inner city so our homes were very close together (I can't remember the address, but the street was Ulysses Ave, or maybe St., the elementry school was a block away, and it was/is called Arrora Elem., and it is on the left hand side of the road from our house, our house was in the bend of the road from there)  My room was on the second floor, and the craft was directly left from my window.  My window was facing my back yard, and the craft glided between my home and my neighbors home which was to my left (so if my house was facing north, the craft was gliding south to north -- I never knew the exact direction my house was facing). I remember thinking that something unusual was happening, and I felt as if something was coming.  Then I heard a whorreling sound, and I pictured (in my mind) my father swinging a long thick metal chain, about 20 feet of chain swinging around and around, then I thought of a hellicopter.  I then felt paralized, not out of fear, but something else -- but it wasn't alarming.  I then realized that this sound couldn't possibly be made by my father or a hellicopter.  It would have had to be so big, and spinning so fast that no one could make this sound with a chain.  I was surprised that it didn't wake anyone else. I was then scared, and wanted to stay very still because I knew that this was something that I have never experienced before.  Then I was sweating and couldn't move or speak.  The whorreling sound got louder and louder to the point where I was so scared that all I could do was wished dearly for the sound to stop. Suddenly, the sound stopped to nothing, and I became curious.  I was then able to get up and investigate what I had heard, but at the same time I knew that if I looked out my window that I would see what was there. And I saw it, I only saw about 3/4 of it.  It was a flat disk, like a freesbe, but had a definit point at it circumfrence an gradually raised to a top that was circular too, that center was about 1/4 of the craft.  It was a very dark ""shiny"" pewter color.  I remember circular lines like a music record from the rim to the center.  It had lights around the outside of its rim.  I remember thinking that it reminded my of Chirstmas tree lights.  I can't tell you the colors to be exact, but all I can say is that I saw every color in dots around the circomfrence of the disk -- colors that I would see in Christmas lights.  For example, I am sure I saw blue, green, red, and white, but I can't picture that in my mind.  I can't picture those colors in my mind today, as I did the moment after it was gone. It hovered, actually it hovered and glided with out a noise, it was perfectly silent as it slowly passed in between and under both of our roof lines, between our homes, and towards the front of our houses.  I watched it in a noiseless controled motion hovering, but moving in a steady pace, pass between my home and our neighbor's home.  I was at complete amazement, and awe until it past from my sight.  I also remember thinking that this is something that was special and real to the point where I should say something about it. Then I layed back down, as I was suppose to be sleeping.  I remember thinking that I was looking at something that wasn't anything I'd ever seen, and thinking that I had just seen something that no one on earth could possibly have created. I then jumped up again with a start because I realized that I could run to the front of the house to see this again.  I hadn't seen the whole thing, and I was so curious.  But, there was also a weird feeling that made me feel as though it was gone before I could have gotten there to see it.  I still can't put that feeling in words, but it was just like when I knew something was coming and didn't get up to see what was coming and making that noise, but this time it was gone.  I still kick myself for that today. I told myself that I would never speak of this because, no one whould believe me, and it was too strange. A few years latter, I realized that I knew how big this craft was, or how big it wasn't because it passed between our homes.  My experience was small compaired to the things I've seen and heard, but my story has a size that I haven't seen, heard or read before, and I could share that. I've been wanting to share this for some time now.  I still can't explain it, and I am very curious.  I am also curious because after that when our dog had puppies, we found that all the water that pooled up in our fenced back yard was toxic somehow, and the puppies drank that water died.  I don't remember how the adults figured it out, but I remember thinking a few years later that it was because of what passed through our yard and between my neighbor's and our home that polluted that water, could be a coincidence -- I don't know. Another strange thing is that I feel that somehow I brought them here with my thoughts.  I can't recreate this, as I have tried out of curiosity. But, whatever it was, and however it came, is a mystery that is always there. I've watched every show on this I could, and have read every book I can too.  There is just too much garbage to weed through, and I don't have the patience to keep up with it anymore, and haven't for years. I want to know what it was, and if that strange time in-between have anything to do with what we (my sister's) are going through now. I'd appreciate your contacting me if you have any information that will clear this up, or as I'm sure you can't, maybe let me know that I am not alone in this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We have assigned an artificial date in order to cause the report to sort to the late 1970's.  PD)) I have been trying to get more info for you on this siting.It was reported in the Verde Independent newspaper in Cottonwood,Az.,but they do not have the info in microfilm form and I started paging through the individual days circa 1976 and gave up.Too slow. On a particular night,a craft hovered above the Childs hydroelectric plant run by APS (Arizona Public Service).This plant was built around the trun of the century to supply half the electricity for Phoenix.It uses a famous spring source ten miles away that is piped to the vicinity and dropped through a long drop to power hydro turbines.A small group of houses surround the site.Three or four engineers and their families live here and operate the plant.The nearest town is Camp Verde,approx.25 miles of dirt road away.It is literally in the middle of nowhere.A famous hot spring is directly across from the plant on the other side of the Verde river.The date of the event was 1976-1979.I did not keep the article,but it was big local news,on the front page I believe.It hardly hit the papers in Phoenix.Two facts lend corroboration: the people who reported it and were interviewed were employees of the very conservative public utility APS.Just reporting the event could have caused these folks a lot of grief,possibly their jobs.Secondly,on a drive out to this area about a month later,I stopped to help a lady change her truck's flat tire on this remote road and she was the wife of one of the engineers.This lady had a typical western accent and beehive hairdo.Not a hippie at all.While helping her I asked where she was going and she said that she lived at Childs.I then asked her if she knew the employees that saw the craft hover above the plant.She said that she was one of them and that they not only saw it,they met the aliens personally.It's hard to discount someone like this,in my mind,unless they wanted to create attention and lose jobs.Not likely.Their report was that the craft hovered above the plant and sucked energy from it,causing the power dials to drop and create a very noticeable change in electric transmission,something they would have to report to APS of course.I am not sure of the time and duration,but the lady told me that she they did not want to cause to much trouble or get too much attention,so they! did not tell the news that in addition to this experience,they not only saw them but met them as well.I did not want to pry and forgot to ask what they dressed like or how they communicated(English?).I did ask what the aliens were like,and she replied,""THEY WERE JUST LIKE HUMANS ONLY THEY WERE VERY NICE,VERY PEACEFUL"" or something to that effect.It has been almost twenty-five years since then,but I have always thought about it.Last year I went to the Verde Independent and started paging through 1977,1978 and gave up.It took hours and page-by-page in those large bound volumes was difficult.As much I seem to remember that it was on the front page,it might have been on a subsequent page.I would like to know more and help if possible.I think that APS must have an archive department and could search as well.Perhaps the employees could be located and re-interviewed.The triangular craft sightings last year or so in Az. that was recently covered on FOX news on T.V. mentioned the many sightings of it culminating in F16 fighters going up to check it out over Phoenix.The show said that the sightings began in the Prescott area.Actually I have heard of friends who were out by the Hot Springs that night and saw them in that sky.The Hot Springs and Childs are about the same distance north of Phx. as is Prescott,only about 35 miles further east.",2002-09-19T00:00:00,,

For some reason I fainted or went out.  I heard a voice with a thick middle eastern accent tell me to open my eyes.  I thought to myself, ""why would Mark, my husband, tell me to open my eyes. I said no.  The voice said you must.  I finally did after the voice spoke firmly.  What I saw I had never before seen.  It looked like an insect. It was thin and white wearing a dark suite, more like a robe.  It spoke without moving its lips.  I couldn't tell who was talking to me because there was more than one.  The others were wearing jumpsuits. He kept telling me to look at him, but I didn't want to and I kept shutting my eyes.  He said I must not fear him but I kept screaming and hyperventilating.  He kept saying he would not harm me and I must believe that.  He kept looking closely in my eyes or at my pupils.  I asked him what he was .  Was he a snake ?  He said no, I am not a reptile.  Then I asked if he were a insect.  He told me to look at his arms and said something about his joints and were they like an insect?  I asked him if he were going to kill me or eat me.  He said,  Why? do you think you would taste good?  This may sound like I am joking, but truly I am not. I kept screaming and shutting my eyes.  I was on some sort of table, I know, your classic alien experience.  The others around me starting backing away. The taller alien, the one in the robe told them That is the fear, that is the fear you smell.  It was awful.  I kept going in and out and I was afraid for my baby.  They of course, took a long needle and stuck it in my belly button.  It hurt worse than anything I had ever felt.  It told them it hurt and one of the little mean things put his hand over my eyes.  I must have fainted because the pain went away.  When I awoke or whatever again I saw the one in the robe talking to another one.  Their backs were turned to me so I figured what have I got to lose.  I made fun of the back of their heads and told them they looked like basket balls.  ONe said, You are making fun of us?  I said Yes.  I want to go. He said not yet.  There was much more but this is hard to talk about and I need to stop now.  There were helicopters around the ship when I first saw them before I was awakened.

A north west car was dispatched to the call. Shortly upon our arrivial to our view piont, I along with my partner could see one object directly north of our position, placing it in the far west of the city's north end approx 3 miles north of us. A second object could be seen east of the first above the north centre of the city, this object was the same design of the first over the north west of the city. Both of these objects where hovering over the city, i would estamate at leat 1,500 feet above the ground and from our vantage piont we could see a bright white light in the centre of the craft and a blue light on top rotating in one direction as though it was mounted on the out side of a saucer and the saucer was spinning, there was a red light on the bottom this was a red light and moved in the opposite direction of the blue light that was mounted on the top. The blue light was mounted in the same way as the red light, as though it was on the end of a sauce. Looking further east and north of the city another object could be similar, however this object was estamated to be at least 5 to 7 miles away. When we looked south of our location we could see another object identical to the first three objects and this one was directly in line with the north west object if your drew a line directly south of the north west object. The object was was approx 3 miles south of our location and appeared to be higher above the ground, i would est. to be 3,000 feet above the ground. There was a second object in the south west of the city which appeared to be inline with the second north object that was over the north centre of the city. All the object where of the same configuration. Shortly after our arrivial, the unit in the north stated over the radio channel that a citizen had lent him a pair of binnocular's, and he stated that the craft was ""saucer shaped with blue light on the top and a red light on the bottom"". The north west unit then turned on his over head emergencie equipment (patrolcar lights - red/blue). It was at this moment that we saw the object in the north west bounce up and down several time, faster than any craft that I have ever seen, dropping altatude aprrox 500 ft in seconds and bouncing back to its originial position. Our communications section contacted the military base which wasin the city at the time, and two MP's in a vehicle attended our location. The airport was contacted by our communications personel and we where informed that the air port could not see any thing and had nothing on radar. The airport is located in the north east corner of the city and had a view of the entire city from the north east. Upon arrivial of the MP (military police) the witnesses the same objects. With in a short time the MP recieved a dispatch call from thier dispatcher saying that Spokan Washington had just been in touch with Ottawa and they said that they knew what the objects where and not to worry about them. After an hour at the site, the object in the south west part of the city began to move west bount, slowly at first then turned faster in a split second to a blurr as thoughit was traveling at warp speed and then it vanished. The next day the story was debunked in the local news papers, saying that the objects where stars in the sky and not ufo's. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We also lived outside the city limits at this time. Getting home, I turned on the TV for relaxing. Around 4 a.m., I felt I could finally go to sleep. My cat wasn't in the house and fearing the roaming dogs, I went ouside to look for it. I went out the back door, which faces east, walked around to the front, which faces west, looing down at the ground, under shrubs, etc. for the cat. The cat was out front under a bush and as I bent down to pick it up, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a bright white light light in the sky, which my mind said was the crack of dawn. Then as I fondled the cat in my arms, I realized that dawn would appear out in back, or the eastern sky, and this was west. I looked up at the southwest sky. There was a thick bright white trail, solid without separation waves, that a jet might leave. We have 3 big 'cedar type' trees in the front yard so I shifted my looking past the 2nd. tree, saw more of the trail, then past the 3rd. tree, saw more of the trail but followed it with my eyes to the north west sky. I was dumbstruck, startled to see an arrow head shaped object, glowing a brilliant white as with an enormous amount of heat,  at the head of the trail. It was moving slowly, as if encountering a force. It went on beyond my sight. The trail was still in tact and visible when I finally went inside. The object might have been heading towards Chicago... or beyond. It was huge, even from the distance. I'm sure it was as high as the commercial jet planes that fly over our house. A few years later, I read the front page of a 'scandal rag' type newspaper while waiting in line at a supermarket. It had an interview from a physcic who told about this object and another incident I'd seen, a storm where a huge black storm cloud hung over a power plant and lightening produced a constant stream of what looked like Hebrew letters. I too, saw that, from my workplace window. This physcic said a young man in the midwest had video taped that cloud w! ith hebr ew writing in it. So, guess I'm not the only one who saw both things. I was working at this business place from 1976 to 1986. By 1985, the cat in this note had disappeared and I had acquired other cats. I have vet. papers for all my cats but have never looked up ones for the cat of note to pinpoint date closer. I know it was July 25th for sure because I noted it was my sister's birthday. Lastly, the object was not chevron shape nor triangle so I said other because it looked exactely like an arrow head, with the notch in bottom center. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We had to go into town (approx 7 miles away).  I lived out in a very unpopulated area next to a Boy Scout Wilderness Camp.  Houses are several miles apart.  On the way into town about a mile and a half from my house I turn right to take the road to the Hiway into town and there sitting on the left side of the road, a road I drove at least twice a day for the past several years was a UFO.  We pulled up alongside and stopped, it was huge.  70-90 feet across 25-35 high.  Color:  dark gray, not shiny but almost a dull or parkerized type finish, smooth but not shiny smooth.  Typical of a nitrided or titaimum applied finished metal.  Shape.  Clearly saucer like with rounded edges and viewing ports (round) at the top.  Lite smoke or steam from the grass was drifting up around the UFO.  The UFO seemed to be bathed in a glow, even tho this was around noon on a clear day.  The glow was almost ultraviolet, it seemed to be glowing around the edges.  We stopped and looked at it, it being about 30 feet from the truck, then we ""got the hell out of there"".  We went down the road for about 3/4 of a mile then we went back and it was gone.  We got out and there was nothing but a large depression in the grass where it had set and the ground was warm to the touch.  As the days went by, I noticed the grass died in a large round area where the UFO had sat down.I have thought of this many times since 1964 and every once in a great while I see the guy who was with me, we have never talked about this to anyone since it happened.

My friend was made aware that sensors surrounding one missile silo recorded a rapid rise in ground temperature( from -25 to -30F to 50 or 60F} within the space of 5-15 minutes. Simultaneously all the sensors on perimeter ""fences"" showed that whatever was occurring had not been initiated by something crossing the fences nor had any of the ground sensors indicated anything had ""walked"" by ground passage up to the missile site. He said he was told that the missile silo cover had been set aside, that ""crew"" from the unknown craft broke into the missile silo, and some of its ""crew""  were examining the circuitry of the ballistic missile. At least one Observer on the U.S. military reaction team arrived to see ""crew"" scampering aboard the ""craft"". Apparently as is SOP, fighters  scrambled. My friend said when the radar target appeared on ""his"" radar scopes within a few moments of the reaction team's ""radioed"" report, it was travelling straight up at a speed in excess of 50,000 miles an hour. It disappeared by moving outside the range of the radar his NORAD shift was using. When he told me this he began perspiring profusely and was very nervous and discomfitted. As a decorated Vietnam combat veteran I know nervousness and a few things about fear. My friend was very nervous, a bit scared, and upset. If we had not been such good friends he probably would not have told me about this. He did know about one prior UFO experience I had - and before this happened used to give me grief about what I had told him had happened to me. Ever since that conversation I am now reporting, he has never made fun of UFO sightings or reports. When I read the report situated on your website I initially thought you were talking about what my friend had reported to me. I was very surprised that the date was 1975 because, if what my friend told me was true - and I believe what he said, it wasn't the first time missiles at Malmstrom AFB had been examined by unknown personnel from a craft whose origins were also unknown. From what my friend said, it had technology far ahead of ours. He said everyone was told the ""incident did't happen."" I'm afraid I can't be more specific because I am relating the comments my friend made. That is why I can't give you a shape of the craft or other details. He was watching this on various instrumentations, but others involved ""talked"" to eachother, swapping info {I would imagine} to confirm they weren't crazy. He was an experienced Fighter controller expert, so this was no novice relating the story to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

On a Friday night in August My Father,(An Episcopal Minister), mother, brother, the Bishop of Massachusetts, and I were returning home from a 7:00 PM movie in Exeter New Hampshire. It was aproximately 9:00 PM. We were driving along and suddenly saw a light in the sky over the mountains. My father pulled over to the side of the road so that we could get a better look at the light. At first we thought it was a spotlight shining on a cloud. But when we pulled over and stopped, we got a better look at it. It was a saucer shaped object. It was stationery, several hundred feet above a mountain. There was no sound from the object. One edge of the craft was tilted down toward us, and we could see across the top of it. In the middle of the craft was a very bright white light that seemed to pulsate and change colors slightly. From a bright white, to a reddish and yellow. Around the outer edge of the craft were bright white lights also. They too seemed to be pulsating, and changing colors slightly. White, yellow, and red. We watched the craft for a couple of minutes as it stood still above the mountain top. There were scattered clouds, and the craft illuminated the clouds closest to it. Suddenly the craft went from a dead stop, to completely out of sight in about 2 seconds. It took off upward in the direction of the farthest side of the craft, which was higher than the side facing us, and at about the same angle that it had been in while stationery. We all didn't know what to say or do. We pulled back onto the road and continued home. There was very little talk about it on the way home, but my brother and I kept saying to each other, ""I don't believe what we saw"". ""It was a UFO""!At the time I was 12 years old and by brother was 10. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,42.9661,-70.9881

To our left, I saw what first looked like a submarine in the sky, not a whole lot higher than six storeys. I asked my mother if she was seeing what I was seeing. We watched this huge dark grey cylinder, as close as grey can be to black, float silently over us, proceeding west. I saw it close enough to emphatically state that if there was any semblance of  markings, or the fusilage beneath a blimp-type airship, I would have seen it. There were no windows, gondola beneath, no sound whatsoever. When the length of it finally passed, I got up and ran to see the back and other side of it. At the back, there was an aperture - memory dosen't serve whether it was an arch or square or circular. But the other side of the cylinder's length was as unremarkable. I arrived at at least 1200 feet in length from looking at maps of Brooklyn. In its entirety, the cylinder from my point of view stretched from Buckinham Road to Stratford Road - 1200 feet. My mother and I compared our obsevation many times over the years. She says she saw a bulge in the center, thus in her eyes a cigar-shaped ufo. I saw a perfect cylinder, with a round nose and tail, the aperature issue kind of fuzzy to be sure enough to report upon. The only time I felt apprehension was when I saw the opening at the end of the cylinder. I thought I might be discovered seeing something I wasn't meant to see. The one thing we agree on is the hardest to describe. We both saw a dark, dark grey cylinder. We saw dark, looking at the side that floated past us, yet something told us there was light behind it, as if backlit. When I peered at the aperature, it was stone black. It is years later, and thanks to the internet, I searched for accounts of cylinder sightings, and it brought me here. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

There were bright orange, very luminous but the source of light could not be seen, the were rectangular, almost square with rounded corners. They each had a small flame in the back. They were large and were flying at a relatively low altitude about 1000 ft I would say. They were quiet (no sound), flew from one horizon to another in less than 2 minutes. There were flying all at the same constant speed, in a very organized way. They were flying in rows of 5 or 6 and basically were forming a matrix like unit. There must have been 3 or 4 dozens of them, may be more. They were hard to count because of their constant change of position of the trailing fleet elements to the front of the fleet. The most striking thing was that some of the ships in the last row would come out of the fleet perpendicular to the fleet, still moving at the same pace as the fleet, move forward with amazing acceleration, and get ahead of the pack sideways inward  to form an element of a newly formed first row. Basically the trajectory was linear and never did it curve, but rather changed directions at right angle! The next few, I kept observing the sky and there was a lot of activities.

It was over the valley low enough that we could see the outline of the top of the mountain range up above and beyond it. Well, we apparently weren't the only people witnessing this extraordinary aerial phenomena. A small private plane was coming across the sky toward the light to get a better look at it. As soon as the plane was a short distance away form it, the light turned itself off, dimmed itself into darkness. The private plane made a few tentative circles around where the object was and flew off. When it was a short distance away, the object came back on again, shining away in the exact same place. If this wasn't enough, apparently this shimmering star like object had attracted the attention of the local Navy P3 Orion subchasing patrol. One of these large military planes came over to take a look - and the same thing happened again! The light went out, the big plane made a couple of large, lazy circles in the area where it had apparently observed the object, and then when it left - on came the light again, in the same place! The next thing that happened about ten minutes or so later, we weren't quite prepared for. We heard it before we saw it - the military had scrambled a jet from one of the nearby military bases. We heard it before we saw it as it came screaming across the sky. So did the object, and apparently was startled by it. The thing all of a sudden glowed much brighter than it had been (""Oh, no!"" ;) and then quickly put it's shimmering light out again. The jet stayed there for about 20 min. or so, going from wide to tighter and tighter circles, and even doing ""figure 8's"". But, apparently, it gave up the pursuit of the object and we saw the jet fly off - and guess what happened?? The shimmering light came back on again - but this time, it had moved a short distance in the sky to another spot not far from the original one! And , it continued to shine. During this incredible experience, I had run the two blocks back home and had gotten binoculars. Through them , I had gotten a much better look at this mysterious object. It looked like a glowing pink disc or football shaped object, completely molten, with sparks coming off of it. It kind of reminded me of how an ember glows in the dark. I estimated it was about the size of a passenger car. The whole incident lasted about two hours, because we were kids and had to go home to bed, and probably got a little bored because the object was just sitting there shimmering and not moving. We didn't watch it leave, it was still there when we gave up and went home. I saw it in the exact same place again several nights later, shining away again, but didn't watch it again that night for very long. No planes seemed to be trying to molest it this time. And then, I never saw it again. My brother and a neighbor lady witnessed this with me. There also had to be witnesses in the private plane, the P3 Orion subchaser plane from Moffett Field NAS, and the pilot of the jet fighter. I haven't seen anyone else report this sighting, so I thought I would. P.S. Peter - please use this version - I corrected a few typos. Thanks!",2002-10-28T00:00:00,37.36315288383428,-121.9678734362307

It was a clear night, with a bright moon, but there were a couple of puffy clouds that were illuminated by the moon.

Then after looking closely, I saw it was a bright white cigar shaped object sort of falling at an angle like the hands of a clock from 1 to 2.  Suddenly it silently moved at an impossible rate of speed across a large arc of sky to end up behind a cloud.  It made no sound, and looked just very white with no other distinguishing features.

It appeared to have heat waves coming off the front and sides of it.  It did not appear to be spinning.

Our back yard ends about 50-60 feet at the edge of a mostly pine forest.  A light through a small gap in the trees caught my eye.  I got my 16X binoculars and went on the back porch to sit on a couch and brace my hands against a small ledge that runs under the windows to get a steady view.  When I focused on the light, I suddenly gasped at what I saw.  I saw a bright white light with four smaller, dimmer white lights around it that would form a perfect plus sign if an imaginary line were drawn between them through the larger light.  I believe I could barely make out an outline of an isosceles triangle, with the base about 60-70% of the length of the sides.  The corners were rounded.  This light configuration was toward the base of the triangle, centered along the centerline.  There was also another bright light, a little dimmer and smaller, along the centerline toward the point of the triangle.  I also believe I could barely make out a dim red glow in the center of the triangle.  I looked at the moon and it was out of focus.  I adjusted the focus one way and the moon came in.  I refocused on the object, and had to focus the other direction to bring the trees into focus.  This told me it was not a star I was seeing, but something between the trees and moon.  I went out the front door and across the street to see if I could see it above the trees, but I saw nothing.  After a few minutes I went back to the porch and all I could see was a star that was not as bright and in a slightly different location.  About a half mile through the woods in that direction is David L. Rainer Elementary School.  I would estimate the object was about 1000-1500 feet over the school.

Something caught my friends eye and for the next few minutes our attention was drawn to an increasing number of brown specks in the sky. There were four in total, emerging one by one on the horizon in front of us. They all moved in a straight path towards the opposite horizon, so we had a significant amount of time to observe them. They had an irregular, angular shape though the specifics are vague because they were so far away. Although they  all seemed predominantly brown, there were areas within each aircraft which were of a different colour. These smaller specks seemed to change appearance as the aircraft moved, as if there was something glowing or 'bulging' beneath each one. Their colour would shift through different shades of brown and even to black at times, while the basic angular shell of each craft remained completely unchanged. The craft made no sound. At one point, a regular aeroplane passe! d by so that we were able to compare the massive difference between it and the unusual objects we were seeing. The final object to pass seemed to get smaller before it passed from our view. All three observers are students, and were relatively clear-headed despite the time of the week.

I looked on this list and saw that several other people in the same town our friend lives in have seen this exact, or a similar object.

Recently realized I saw a UFO in the early 1980's and that it wasn't a low-flying, stealth military missile headed for the Pacific Ocean as I had concluded at the time. Was driving slowly on Wiley Lane, facing due north. A silver torpedo-shaped craft flew slowly and silently east-to-west just over the tree-tops, perhaps at 200ft. (Tall pines were growing on either side of the narrow street....appeared to be close to their tops.) There were no markings or windows or obvious sources of propulsion. Don't recall hearing any engine sounds. Was shocked that a military aircraft would be allowed to fly SO LOW over a populated area with the possibility of impacting buildings, tall trees or other small airborn aircraft!!!

It moved to the rear of my apartment building and we ran into my apartment which had a balcony.   My Parents and Brother were in the apartment and joined us on the balcony.  We saw it again moving slowly from left to right at about the speed of a blimp.   It had lights which appeared to circle the craft.  They were about the size of lights on a blimp but were not letters.  Letters would have been easily read as low as it was positioned.   What really convinced us that it wasn't a blimp was that after about 30 seconds of moving after we got to the balcony, it suddenly took off directly away from us and was out of sight within 5 seconds.

I suddenly woke up gasping at about 3:30am and heard my twelve dogs barking and found it strange to hear birds (at this time of the year they start at about 5:45am) so early and in the dark.I stayed in bed and my husband woke up and opened the window in the dark and we noticed that despite of the heavily clouded weather it was light as if it was full moon (I even thought it was much later in the morning). My back yard is quite big (80 meters long) and we cannot see the back wall from our window unless it is a very bright night. I waited for him in bed and paid attention to what was happening. He stayed at the window for about half an hour and I noticed that it was dark again and the birds had gone quiet and the dogs stopped running and barking. He went back to bed and told me what he had seen: our dogs were barking to the back of the yard, sniffing around the trees tracking something and our doberman was barking to the top of the wall. He looked up ready to take his gun to make some noise, for he thought someone was trying to invade our property. Then he looked up and saw there was a ""person"" standing still on the top of the wall. As he said he thought it was a person but our wall is about 2.5 meters high (+- 8 ft)and the person was as tall as the wall. He got so astonished that all he could do was stare. He said the person might have noticed being observed and walked very lightly to the corner of the wall and did not jump, just walked off the wall as if walking off the stairs in a house. Right after that, he said, it went dark again like someone turned off the light ( I noticed that too ). In the morning he talked to some of his friends (military) who later confirmed (unofficially, of course) that several people, including military people, reported the unusual brightness of the sky from different points of the city.

I also slipped on my glasses for a clearer view. The object made no sound whatsoever which was particularly note-worthy as the craft was clearly metallic and what appeared to be quite substantial in weight. This was no ball! oon. The craft moved north while following a perfectly parallel synchronicity with the telephone poles and the ground.It was moving no faster than 15-20 miles per hour so I had a perfectly clear view. Its lack of sound and perfect smoothness and machine-like precision were quite remarkable. I knew, even as I was seeing it, that this was something never seen on the 6 o'clock news.

One thing I noticed is the speed they were going but how fast they could stop. After a short time one of them headed towards the same way it came from it took off without turning like a plane would have to or helicopter. Then the second one left the same way.  It was a clear night.  I was very close 150 yards and the objects were above the trees not very high.

I started working this part time job in 1984 and also worked in 1985 so I guess it could have been in 1985 I am not sure.  I went to full time work in 1986 and I am sure it was not  during that time I was working full time for the church.  I hope this will help you in some way.  I have never said much about it as I figured no one would think I was telling the truth anyway.  I have no doubt to what I saw it was very clear that night and it wasn't that far away.

My wife and I live in fairdale 7 miles west of Montrose, PA. In a very remote area. We were in our garden on a bright clear day. It wasn't very windy but a steady breeze was blowing fron west to east (5-10 miles per hour) We were both facing north and looking at the ground when we heard a noise like wind swishing over something and turned around to see a large oval shaped sphere less than 100 yards away floating above the tree tops going against the wind. We stared at it . It looked like a giant ball of mercury going from east to west against the wind causing a sound as the wind blew around it. it slowly moved across the tree top behind some trees at the lower portion of our property. I tried to get a better look at it and walked down the field to see were it went. Then ran to the workshop and called a neighbor down the road where the craft was heading. He ran out side but could not see it. This thing had no lights , windows, motor or anything it almost looked like a blimp but was so shiny it looked like a polished mirror surface IT WAS NOT A BLIMP OR MAN MADE BALLON it just dissappeared behind the trees. The strange thing was we (my wife and I I) never talked about it until a few days or weeks later. I said to her ""what do you think that was"" and she said ""who knows"" Till this day we can't remember where our kids where or why we didn't react more freaked out by this experience. We remained very calm and went back to gardening At the time our kids were young some preschool and don't know why they were not with us in the garden or near by. I'm glad my wife saw it too or I would think I might have been hallucinating. It seemed the craft made no sound and we wouldn't have known it was behind us except for the noise the wind made blowing over it. Also it seems strange that we were'nt afraid of it. I have search the web for similar disciptions but can't find any. I have never seen anything so shiny in my life, just like mercury. no lights, windows gondala, propsetc just a silver sphere going agaisnt the wind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witnesses were husband and wife.

I looked to the sky and saw a spherical object that appeared as a bright yellow light and hovered in the direction of the Sangster International Airport. It hovered for approximately 5 seconds.  There was no engine noise.  Then, in a sudden movement, it moved behind some gathering clouds and disappeared.  I lived near the airport and was quite accustomed to seeing planes land and take-off, and hearing the noise of aircraft, everyday.  This was no ordinary aircraft.

I went back out and it was still there,   Next I went in and called the local troopers and told them to look in our direction and they might see it. I returned outside and it was still there.  Next thing I knew, my son had gone into the house and was returning with a gun, as he was frightened.  AT that point the object came toward us and rose quickly into the sky and just disappeared.  As it left, it appeared to be triangular in shape. I actually made another call, to a friend after I called the troopers.  I told her the horses were making noices.  Later she asked me why I said horses, because we had only one, and I told her it was because all three of the children were hearing noice from the nearby hill, which I did not hear.

This happened so long ago that I have never considered reporting it until I heard you on the recent sightings on radio show.  At the time I thought that ufo's had to be a ""flying saucer"" to be a real event. But some months ago, I read a recent report that sounded much like mine. I never forgot what happened but I didn't commit the entire night to memory either.  The date I gave is a pretty wild guess based on who I was with and when we would have been together. Here is what happened. My two friends and I were college friends/roomies off campus at Okla. State Univ.  It must have been early Saturday morning and we had been out chasing the ladies and the bars had closed down so we  decided to go out about 5 miles west of town to Lake Carl Blackwell where we liked to go to watch the stars for meteors.  We were just lying flat on the ground looking straight up.  I was laying with my head facing west and my feet to the east.  At some point I saw what I thought was a high flying airplane or jet (i.e. a point source of light, like a star) moving across the sky at a semmingly normal speed, from west to east. I saw it near my zenith and fixed on it for some reason. After it passed my zenith, it began zig zagging.  It was not ""arc-ing"" but was making definite hard angles. The relative distance the object moved from one ""cut"" to the next was about the size of a dime at arms lenghth. It did not speed up or slow down, it just zigged for about 30 seconds and then returned to a straight line until it passed out of sight to the east. I did not say a word and neither did my friends but about a minute after it had slowly disappeared I just asked ""Did anybody see that?""  Both of my friends raised up and said in unison, ""Did you see that too?""  I asked, ""Dale,what did YOU see?"" Dale described exactly what I saw.  DeWayne agreed that he saw the same thing.  We scratched our heads and then let it go. Now, we HAD been out on the town earlier but we were not intoxicated, certainly not to a point were it effected what we saw. I have never seen anything act like that before or since and spend alot of time outdoors wathing the night sky.  I've seen ""satellites"" just sort of fade in and then fade out, but never saw anything zig-zagging in or even arc-ing in any manor.

I lived in Dallas but was working on assignment in the Houston area. It was Thursday night around 8:00 to 9:00 pm and I was driving back to Dallas (home) on Interstate 45. I had just passed through Conroe going north when my Ford Pick-Up just quit running, at 70 mph all the idiot lights came on and that was it. I coasted as far as I could then finally stopped knowing that 2 associates of mine would be coming by momentarily on their way back to Dallas and I'd be rescued. I turned the emergency flashers on and went back and lowered the tailgate of the truck to sit on while I watched for my associates. After 10 minutes or so I looked up and noticed for the first time how beautiful the stars were out in the country without all the city lights to block them from view. I kept looking up until my neck started to hurt and then I remembered a 4 ft section of plywood that I had laying down in the bed of the truck. I also had several cement blocks among the other junk that seemed to always occupy the truck bed. I quickly got up and arranged the blocks so that they were under the plywood, holding it up at about a 30 degree elevation so I could lay down to look at the stars and still see the oncoming traffic. I laid down and began looking up at the stars. I had been watching the sky for about 30-45 minutes when I first saw it. It (the object) was really nothing more than a very bright light that appeared to be 10 to 20,000 ft. up. Nothing unusual, right? Nothing could be further from the truth. I watched this.... thing....for what seemed to be about 30 minutes or so and during that time it went across the sky in mere seconds.....it made right angle turns......it got bigger and brighter and then dim again, it crossed the sky once more from east to west then in mid-flight just seemed to disappear. I mean one second it was there, then the next second it was GONE! Now up until this point in my life I had not ever thought much about UFO's however I was beginning to re-evaluate my way of thinking. Anyway, with that over my attention now was re-directed to watching for my associates and getting rescued from my predicament. As I sat quietly and watched for my friends it became increasingly clear that there was far less traffic on this road than there should be at 10:00 pm at night on an Interstate Highway, 60 miles out of Houston. Up until this point it had not dawned on me to look at my watch since I knew roughly what time it was, but when I did look at my watch I got the shock of my life....IT WAS 1:45 AM. IT WAS ALMOST 4 HOURS LATER! Reality started to set in at this point.....I must have fallen asleep and missed my associates.....but I DID NOT FALL ASLEEP! I REMEMBER EVERY LAST DETAIL OF EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED. This missing time thing was real creepy but I had more important issues to deal with at the moment. I got on my CB radio and called out for anyone that could help. After 30 or 40 minutes of doing that, I got a response. It was a partially loaded Car Hauler and the driver said for 50 bucks he'd take me and my truck all the way to Dallas. What GREAT luck! In an hour or so we were loaded and on our way to Dallas. When we got back to Dallas we unloaded the truck and I thanked the driver and went into my house. Several hours later I went out to check the truck for problems. I got in and turned the ignition and it started right up. I never found any problems with the truck and it never repeated. It was a few years later that I heard about abductees and all that. I mentioned this to an acquaintance at work and this guy looked at me like I was a fool. He told everyone at work about it and then I was ""BRANDED"" The resident UFO Nut! It wasn't long before I was forced to quit this job and go elsewhere for work. I never mentioned this again before now. After this incident, my life took a nosedive into the toilet. It was weird. It was like I had a big sign on me that said ""UFO Freak"". I went from a 6 figure a year sales career in insurance to selling cars for a living. As incredible as this may sound, I lost my ability to sell that night. From 80 to zero literally ""Overnight"". I firmly believe that I was abducted that night. I don't remember any of it, but I know it happened....what else could explain the loss of time! If I ever find one of those people that can do hypnotic regression, I find out for sure. I hope that this is not too long but I know of no other way of explaining this to your readers. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have received many similar reports from across the U. S..

It was the night of the eclipse; also Seattle was having its air show. My daughter was at another camp playing cards and I had taken my three sons to a neighbor’s camp to watch the eclipse. When it was finished we headed back to go to bed. As we came under the trees at our camp sight we heard a strange rotary sound as though rock was being ground in a circular Mattoon upon stone. As the noise came closer it slowed in the cycles of the sound. It stopped directly above our camp and a white light, brighter then I have ever seen made a pillar of light down into the camp. The boys who were about eight ten and eleven began to scream in a horrified whale as I tried to run out to the creek so I could see the UFO. No mom they screeched at me as I tried to escape then and run to the river. They clung to me so horrified that I could only comfort them and tell them it was all right. Then the thing began to grind faster and faster and even faster as the light moved away from us. Finally it sounded like a great whirring insect. Friends of ours were coming home up the mountain. As they pulled in and the boys ran to them they informed us they had just seen an orange ball of lightning. No one in the camp area, and it was full had seen or heard anything and there seamed to be a laps of time. The following day I went into the small town to get groceries. I heard several people discussing the UFO they had seen the previous night. Two years later as I told my story around the campfire at our camp at Sultan Basin a fellow camper ask me if this had happened in Aug. I said it had and he proceeded to tell me of the experience he had had that same night. He said he had seen it and that it was large and disk shaped and had shined a light down into his camp. He said he had shot at it before it took off and disappeared into an orange ball and faded out of sight, He said it whirred. The following year my daughter saw a disk shaped object hovering above the horizen. She ran home afraid. She was seventeen at that ime and her friend also saw it. Through the years we camped at that same spot. At night you could hear a whirring sound like mashinery comming from a distance. There were many sightings throughout those years.

The object then returned a few minutes later and was eastbound in the same manner. I am not sure if it was only one object passing us and then returning or two seperate objects.  When the object flew over our car and down the highway ahead of us, it was almost surreal.  I wasn't sure what I had seen.  I asked my wife ""Did you see that?""

That part of Utah is mountainous and not well lit.  There was a mild snow shower occurring which also impaired clear view.  The object made no noise and there wasn't any kind of wind blast or anything that should be associated with an object of it's size and so low to the ground moving at such a speed.

An out of control disk shape ship with an interesting white light.,McAllen,TX,1995-03-28T22:00:00,disk,2 minutes,"Occurred : 3/28/1995 22:00  (Entered as : 03/28/1995 22:00) Reported: 9/6/2002 10:02:13 AM 10:02 Posted: 9/6/2002 Location: McAllen, TX Shape: Disk Duration:2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/024/S24882.html,"An out of control disk shape ship with an interesting white light. The UFO appeared disk or saucer shaped. As I first saw it, it didn't look like an experianced ""driver"" was driving it. The reason I say this is because it was kind of out of control for the first few moments I saw it. The only way to describe it is as if you throw a plate (saucer)on the table and it wobbles around before settling, that was what this was doing in the air. The ship was silent didn't make a sound at all and looked just like they put them on tv, disk shaped, with red, yellow, and blue lights all around and of course the white light. The ship was spinning clock-wise as I looked up at it and the white light was spinning around the ship counter clock-wise. The one thing that I've never seen or heard mentioned was the white light, that is tear or dip shape, didn't touch the ship at all. I always thought that the white light would be on the red, yellow, and blue lights if I were to see one but it wasn't, it was about two to three feet from the ship itself. I really can't describe it but the white light wasn't touching the ship and it seemed independant from the ship yet a part of it because even though the ship wabbled clock-wise with the spinning of the ship, the white light never missed spinning the opposite direction from the ship directly over the colored lights. Since it was dark and I've not thought of it much because I was afraid people would think I was a nut I'll try to describe the ship itself. I remember drawing it the next day and it seemed to be a metalic color and a hole on the bottom part, kind of like an opening maybe. Basically it seemed like two plates put together and a bowl on the top. It did spin out of control for awhile but seemed to have regained control after a few seconds after I was mentally willing it to stop or slow down, so someone else could see it. It wabble still but very slowly. I'm not sure but I personally think because of me willing it to stop and as I did and having it slowly gain control, I believe it is flown mentally and not with control handles or buttons. Even though I saw the ship for two minutes or a minute it wasn't long enough for me I wanted to see more of it yet there was a tree that was going to block my view and no one to see it with me. What I did was wait until it hit the tree and ran inside to get the nearest person I could see to look at the ship too. I got my brother and he walked out and said ""Holy Sh*t a UFO!"". I didn't wait to watch it leave I ran to call my friend who lived a few blocks south of me, the direction it was moving, and asked him to go outside to get a view. He didn't see it and my brother said it had quickly taken off. He said it kind of ""scanned"" the floor and took off, yet I don't believe him especially since he was young and it didn't sound like something that would have happened, plus the fact that he said it was a plane he saw two days later yet when he saw it, it was already kind of small as I pointed it out but still looked like what I saw only smaller.

I was traveling North on 82 which turned into 11 north heading toward Liberty when I noticed a flash of light and I thought it was just a passing car. I noticed that there was a semi-truck in front of me and headlights of a car behind me. I looked up again at the flash of light and intially I thought nothing of it and I thought it might just be a star but no sooner did I think that it shot out at the speed of lightning about 100 ft. and then it just came to a dead stop. I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and when I looked up the semi-truck and car were gone as though they had vanished into thin air. There was no place the truck could have turned and the car which should have went pass me when I pulled over never did. Where the truck and car went was beyond me. By now I was really wondering what that object in the sky could be. It had a long shape and looked like beams of lights with gaps in-between and a white light underneath it. I started driving off and I grabbed my cell phone to call the Liberty Police and I was talking to the sprint operator when my cell phone cut off. The object followed me and there was not another car in sight. When I turned off the by-pass into Liberty I could still see it then it just sped out of sight very fast in a NE direction.

I also thought that perhaps it was a plane, there is an airport about 5 miles from where we were, but it was too high to be in the flight pattern,on an inbound, or just after takeoff. There where no beacon lights so I honestly didn't believe it to be a plane,  I looked at it for moment and thought to look and see if the sun was coming up and possibly causing some sorta reflection.  The sun was still low in the horizon.  This took took perhaps a split second, when I looked back at the moon again the light was gone.  My husband pulled over to the side of the road to see if it had traveled over the top of the jeep we were riding in.  It was gone.

The event occured while I was camping at Lake Casitas. At the campsite me and couple of others were sitting down looking at the horizon star gazing. While we were stargazing a light appeared out of nowhere that resembled a bright star, much like Jupiter or another close planet. The light moved down right above the mountains, and hovered there for what seemed to be half an hour. Then the light moved to the east about 300 - 400 yards (hard to tell due to distance). The movement of the craft was instantaneous and very smooth. From my experience of observing aircraft no known modern craft is capable of this kind of movement. Then a second light appeared, exactly like the first light. It moved to where the first light was, then joined the first light. It stayed there for about half an hour and then went up and dissapeared. The first light remained in its original position for another 10 minutes, then also went up and dissapeared. It is my firm belief that these were UFOs. I was under no narcotics or alcohol, and have never taken hallucenegens. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I estimate the height in this way because that is what I thought the objects were, a bunch of private planes, i.e. a local flying club, out for a night flight around town (although I did not see any particular form or shape to the objects).  They gradually veered away from me (for them, they would've been making a right hand turn).  They may, in fact, have been gradually veering away from me from when I first saw them (being at night it was impossible to accurately determine if they were proceeding directly across my line of vision and then veered away, or if they had been gradually veering away from me from the start (moving laterally diagonally across my line of vision) and then veered ""more sharply"". 1) I say ""in formation"" because all though all the lights appeared to move in concert, or in a pack, there was smaller movement between some of the lights, like individual objects speeding up to keep up with each other and/or slowing down to avoid getting to close. 2) That the objects didn't make a sound, I attributed to their being down wind of me, i.e. the wind blew the sound of the planes away from me. 3) That no small plane I had ever seen before at night had ever been lit up like this and, in any event, probably wouldn't be if they really were out for a night flight, i.e. out to see the city all lit up at night, strange as this sounds, I didn't think anything of it. 4) In retrospect, I guess the only thing stranger than the sight itself, was my nonchalant reaction to it.  I certainly wasn't frightened, but neither do I remember being particularly awed, I seem to remember thinking: ""Oh, that's neat"".

I was driving about 70 mph in the middle lane, with a tractor trailer truck driving 5+ car lengths ahead of me.  The flash surprised me, and I hit my brakes as did the truck in front of me.  I began searching the sky for any indication of the object, or flash, but found none.  I simply witnessed this flash of brilliant light.  It appeared to me to be too ""thick"" to be lightening.  It also moved more horizontally than anything else, but again was headed north and angled slightly towards the sky.  After the flash, I saw nothing else. Having seen both man made, weather and astonomical natural phenomena before, I can safely say that this did not appear to be like anything I have ever seen.  If I were to wager a guess, I would say that the streak was perhaps 100-500 feet off the ground, and perhaps 1 - 10 miles away.  It moved at a rate that no man-made object that I am aware of could possibly reach.  I am assuming that the reaction of the truck in front of me, hitting the brakes when I did, and slowing down, was due to the same occurance. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object was round in shade, and had a row of lights around the base, the lights either rotated, or had a sequence of rotation. The object was travelling very slow, in an easterly direction out to sea. The house was situated 1 block away from the cliffs, which dropped to the ocean, so i was able to watch it travel for quite a distance out to sea. It sped up a little, out to sea, then for reason changed it's course to a southerly, direction, and took off out of sight in a near verticle climb. This has stayed with me for many years, and i can still remember the shape and coulur of the object. My two brothers had been outside with me, but i have never asked them if they had seen it also.

I remember being called out of the house to come and see something. What I saw was several lights, about 7 or 8, moving around in the Eastern sky. They looked no different than the stars, except that they were moving. They floated around each other for awhile, then one or two of them would streak off and vanish, only to appear in the opposite direction from where it went. Sometimes the objects would merge, then spread out from each other. This went on for about 15 to 20 minutes, it could have been more.

TO my great surprise, and genuine startled sensation, a person in Rochester, (which is not too far from where my stepfather and I originally saw this UFO, in Ethel, WA) described a very similar shaped craft and an unusual time disorientation feeling both my stepfather and I had experienced after the craft departed.  For whoever wrote about the V shaped craft, I want you to know, you are not alone in seeing this. Both my Stepfather and I saw it, and we saw it within very close proximity and in broad daylight. Here is my account of the incident:  My stepfather was picking me up from a friend's house at the top of the Hill on an old country road called Larmon road about 1 mile east from where the road meets into Hwy 12.  I remember I had rode the school bus up to my friend's house that day to go play on his go-cart, as it meant I wouldn't have to try and ride my bike up that incredibly steep hill.  We had left my friend's house and we were driving East back towards the hill, That is when my stepfather turned to me in the passenger seat and said quite casually, ""Look, a UFO.""  My reply was ""yeah, right"", until I looked past him and out the driver's car door window, then I actually saw it.  My stepfather slowed down the car as we saw looked in disbelief and eventually came to a stop there on the road.  There it was this huge upside down ""V"" shaped silver metallic craft.  It was hovering no more than 15 feet above the grass in an empty cow pasture right off to the left of the road.  I remember just sitting there in the front seat, looking at it, in total disbelief as to what we were both seeing.  It was there, in a field belonging to my friend's grandparents facing North of the road.  It cast a giant shadow on the ground, but I remember it looking as if it were just hanging there in the air, it was impossible for our eyes to comprehend, as it defied gravity, just hanging there.  The top of the ""V"" was facing towards the sky.  And in the center, I remember a circular domed area, and what looked like domed windows.  It was not a plane, as there was no noise, and this craft was a lot larger than a regular plane, or even a jumbojet, it was very big.  The house of my friend's grandparent's was just to the right of where it hovered, and it made the house look like a shed in comparison. We were probably no more than 150 ft from where it hovered above the pasture. I remember seeing the grass below it reflecting on the tips of both sides of the V.  It had lights, green, red, and blue.  I remember seeing the green light the most coming from the centermos! t point of the craft, where I had believed to have seen windows on the craft.  The light got intensely bright, and after that, I remember being suddenly startled and then suddenly looking out the window of my passenger window, as if something was there, I for a moment thought there was something there.  It was at this time that time seems to have skipped on us.  We both felt as if some serious time had passed since first encountering the craft, that we had something like a time hiccup is the best I can describe the sensation.  Like we hiccuped and we moved ahead in time, like we had been gone for hours, but somehow equated out to no time loss at all.  I have no idea if we were abducted, as I have no memory past looking out my passenger door window, I just remember being very startled and was compelled to look away from the light.  After I saw there wasn't anyone there, I looked back at the craft, and it was gone.  Suddenlt there was a noise, a very loud thundercraking sonic boom type of noise, but when we got out of the car to see if it had made the noise, there was nothing visible in the sky.  For a good five minutes, we sat on that road looking at a craft that was in no way shape or form anything I have seen before or since.  It was huge, and it made no noise.  We proceeded down the hill towards home and went back into the house.  When we got into the house, my mother asked quite sternly where we both had been, and we both said we just came straight down the hill.   She said that it had been well over an hour when my stepfather had gone up the hill to pick me up.  We lived no more than 2 miles from my friend's house.  We never reported it, but not long after that incident, My stepfather somehow developed a very serious and debilitating brain tumor and died three years later.  The effects of the tumor started to a few days after we saw that craft.  I do not know if this was somehow connected, but it did appear very strange when the right side of his body went dead and he started having seizures not long after our encounter.  So, to whoever saw this same shaped craft, you are not alone, My stepfather and I saw it as well. And I believe something else might have happened to us.  Although I have always been very healthy, I have the feeling that something else occured that day.  For whoever wrote their encounter regarding the craft in Rochester back in 1979 - 1980, I hope that these people will share my contact info with you.  It is because of what you wrote that compelled me to share my experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-08-28T00:00:00,,

Having 5 kids and a small 3-room house, to gain a little peace of mind, my mother would allow me and my brother, the two eldest, play outside after dark on warm nights.  In the fall of 1982, in Eidson, Tennessee, while playing hide and go seek outside in the dark, my brother (11) and I (10) saw a large group of round, multicolored lights in the sky that seemed to hover over a nearby moutain top.  My brother ran inside and told my mother who came outside after him while I ""kept an eye"" on the strange lights.  The three of us stared up at the lights while my stepfather and other siblings looked out the front door.  My mother decided the three of us would try to get a closer look while my stepfather stayed behind with the younger children. We hurried down the gravel road that ran beside our house to the base of the mountain.  We wanted to get a closer look before the lights should disappear.  At the base of the mountain, we saw two of our neighbors, a boy and his father.  They had spotted the strange lights in the sky, too.  They had flashlights and apparently had the same idea as we had of getting a closer look at the strange lights.  We all hurried together through trees and underbrush full of stickers to the top of the mountain. What we saw straight above our heads was a cluster of multicolored lights that weren't set in any apparent color pattern.  We were quiet and way out in the country, and the only sound we heard was crickets nearby, no unnatural noise such as an engine or anything else manmade.  We all stared upward, wondering what exactly we seeing.  The lights seemed to be of one craft.  The craft must have been quite a distance up because the flashlights fell on nothing when we shined them in the direction of the lights.  There were no stars or moon out that night; the sky and our surroundings were pitch black, so we saw nothing except the strange lights in the sky and whatever our flashlights illuminated.  The lights seemed to roughly form the shape of a parallelogram.  The craft seemed to be gigantic as the lights extended far across the sky directly above us, maybe as long as a football field.  The lights didn't move or twinkle.  They were red, yellow, blue, orange and white.  The lights didn't just form a rough outline of the craft, they were all over it. Since it didn't move or make any sound, and it was getting late, we all decided to go back to our homes.  Naturally none of us had any film in our cameras, and the nearest store was 30 miles away and probably not open that late anyway.  We peeked at it a few times out our windows before settling into bed and finally falling asleep.  In the morning, of course, the lights were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was fourteen years old, living in the family home, which was an isolated house in the middle of a field. Having grown up in that home from the age of four, I was familiar with all the sounds that would occur in and around the house. On several occasions I thought that I had heard noises, and I would grab an AR-7 22-caliber rifle that my uncle had given me and would pose with it in plain view in the front picture window to scare away anybody who may have been creating a noise by nosing around outside. Not the wisest thing to do, in retrospect, but I was a virtual child and thought that a show of arms might protect me when my family was away or asleep. On this particular occasion, my mother was asleep in her bedroom while I was awake watching television. I heard two distinct bumps on the wall of the house just outside the familyroom. I was so sure that I heard the noises that I not only grabbed my rifle, but cocked it to load a round in the chamber, which primed it for a seven-shot semi-automatic operation. I walked out the garage door and around to the side of the house, thinking that either there was somebody out there or that an animal of some sort was causing the noise. I looked around the corner of the house, and didn't see anything. Then I looked up... What I saw doesn't fit into any description of a UFO. The only way I can describe it is that it was a single swirling cloud much larger than my home, rising up into a funnel, which terminated in a brightly lit, white cloud. Inside the funnel there were both whisps of smoke and lightening, which went straight down the sides of the funnel, defying the flow of the clouds. I was so entranced by what I saw, that I hadn't noticed until minutes later that I had dropped my rifle. I grabbed it and ran inside my home to wake up my mother, who came outside in time to see the last remnants of the swirling cloud. I stayed awake for the remainder of the night, watching the news for any report of a strange weather phenomenon that may have explained what I saw, but no mention of it was ever given by any of the local stations. It's been over twenty years, and the wonder of that object has never left me. I've told very few people about it, since most people refuse to believe in anything unless they see it with their own eyes. I'm writing this now in the hopes that perhaps somebody has seen something similar and can help me understand what it was. In all the years since the event, I've never heard anything similar, weather-phenomenon or otherwise. I don't know if this constitutes an actual sighting, but it was the single most impressive sight that I've ever witnessed. The beauty of it defies description, but I've done my best to give an accurate perception of what I saw that evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-08-28T00:00:00,,

(I can't remember the exact date but I may be able to find out.)  We walked into the village I think it will have been about 2am and we went our separate ways.   I was walking for a while down a street which was well illuminated by streetlights and nobody else was around at this time when a circle of light appeared on the pavement in front of me, it was about 2 feet in diameter.  It was as though someone had held a really bright light above me almost and shone it onto the pavement.  Bear in mind the street was already well lit up and so this had to be a very bright light, but there was no visible beam just the circle of light.  I didn't step into the light but I did stop and look behind and up into the sky wondering what had caused it, I didn't see anything and when I looked back in front of me it had gone.

We have talked now and again about this for ten years now and still can't think of anything that can make a light like that.  Our friends don't believe us and say we were probably drunk etc, but I can assure anyone that we had not drunk anything at all.

A report was phoned into the OUFOR hotline and later submitted to the Review involving night time light activity seen by a man while traveling from Beaverton to Vernonia. Just after leaving a development area near Banks, the man noticed two unusual lights straight ahead just left of the road and hanging low to the ground. The brightness of one of them really stuck out. As the highway curved slightly to the right the lights stayed to the left side of the road the whole time. After driving for over ten minutes having these two lights within sight, the witness reports feeling as if the objects may have been as much as a mile apart from each other. The witness writes..."" The light I could see looked huge for the distance I saw it from. The white light was facing me and appeared to be heading in the same direction I was driving. It did not blink. I didn't think it was a plane. After passing the Texaco on my left, I got to the Hwy. 47 turnoff to Vernonia, pulled onto the Hwy. 26/47 intersection and out of the car. I could still see these lights right next to a street light in front of me. The brighter light was brighter than the street lamp. To get an idea on the distance between these two lights, I put my arm all the way out and they were two fingers wide. I then got out my binoculars for a closer look and was amazed to see the brighter light was red toward the top. It also looked flat on it's right side, and was pointed on the left side. It looked like it was divided between a top middle and bottom section. I couldn't tell if the brighter light was connected at all to the one two fingers away to the left of it. I couldn't see the same details with the light on the left as I did with the brighter light on the right. I took several pictures with an HP215 Digital Camera (it has 1.3mega pixel resolution).""

Sphere. This witness reports seeing a chrome sphere. Witness reports...""I had just stopped in a local tavern after work. Several individuals were going out and coming back looking at something in the sky they couldn't identify. I went out to take a look, and noticed a chrome sphere hanging in the SE sky at about 40 degrees from the SE horizon. It looked very high in the sky (jet level), but definitely in our atmosphere. The moon was clearly visible off the southern horizon, and the sky was absolutely clear. After watching the object for several minutes a small, brightly lit (glowing) red sphere appeared to the left of the chrome sphere. It flew to the right of the chrome sphere, then disappeared while moving quickly in a southern direction. The chrome sphere stayed visible for about 45 minutes, as other onlookers came and went. The object disappeared momentarily, and reappeared at about 30 degrees to the horizon, in a northeast direction. Holding my fist to the sky, it had traveled about four fist-lenghts. After that movement, the object appeared to be fading very slowly towards the SE horizon line. At approximately 18:45, a rice shaped object passed slowly across the sky directly in front of the chrome sphere. The oblong object left no contrail and had no warning lights. Shortly after this object (traveling from south to north) went out of sight, an airliner was visible traveling in the same approximate direction, but lower in altitude, leaving a contrail. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6/21/2002 5:15 p.m. Gresham, OR. Sphere...drawing submitted by mail. This is the forth report of the June 21st sphere from Portland/Lake Oswego. Two more reports to follow. The OUFOR hotline received another call regarding this particular sighting and a formal report and drawing was submitted through the mail. This witness appeared to be at a vantage point using a telescope so as to better identify the object. This is the drawing that was submitted based on that observation. The witness in this report writes...""It was slightly bulbous (i.e., not round, slightly bottom heavy) and did not seem to rotate because the positions of the dark lines which run from the top of the sphere to the middle of the sphere never changed. The projection at the top was actually at about the one o'clock position in the telescope. This round projection at the top would ""light up"", i.e., increase in brightness every few minutes to about ten times it's normal brightness."" While there was no mention in this report about the dark orbs that were seen from other parts of Portland and Lake Oswego, this could have been due to when and where the object was viewed. It also could be attributed to the long duration time in all of these reports as witnesses were watching the object at different times. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6/21/2002 4:50 p.m. Lake Oswego, OR. (Not far from Portland) Circle. This sighting appears to be the same object seen in Portland at 4:42, 5:15 and 5:45 p.m. The object is described as being a white sphere at around 6000 to 7000 feet. In this short sighting period it was described as being fixed, nailed in place and was the size of a BB held at arms length. The witness looked at the object with binoculars but were unable to determine any surface texture or tether should it be a wheather balloon. The witness called this sighting into the local radio show GroundZero that evening and two other sightings were soon called in to confirm, one with 5 witnesses. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6/21/2002 4:42 p.m. Portland OR. Object releases dark orbs...photographed. Friday afternoon this witness reports getting out of his truck after getting home from work and seeing an object in the sky. Witness writes...""I stood at the end of the drive and watched as it held it's position for 20 minutes. At that point I ran into the house and grabbed my digital camera. I ran back out to the end of the drive and it was still there in the same position. My neighbor across the street was out in her front yard and I called to her to come look at the object. I asked her if she saw something above the tree line. She replied ""Yes!"" and asked ""What is that?"" I replied ""I have no idea but I am not going to miss an opportunity to photograph it!"" I then proceeded to take the pictures I am sending you. My neighbor noticed that it was not round and that it looked like it had a wobble in it's movement or rotation. I started to take more pictures when my wife pulled in to the drive. I asked her if see saw the object and she said ""Yes."" She also asked what it was. At this time I looked back up at the object and it was starting to move, very slowly, to the East."" The object moved to the east against the wind. There was no noise and as he was looking through the lens of his camera, he noticed the object was ejecting small black objects to the north west...seven total...and then it began to move again. The couple went in the house and returned 45 minutes later to leave for dinner and watched the object from the car. ""As we drove across the hill towards Lake Oswego I noticed that I could still see the object and it still looked to be the same size. After dinner I made a quick scan of the sky and could not find the object"" the witness wrote. It was estimated that the object was at around 10,000 feet because of scale to passing aircraft in the PDX pattern and angle to horizon. Update: June 26, 2002... OUFOR team member and investigator Cameron Johnson followed up this sighting with some phone calls to the NOAA in Portland regarding weather balloons as well as a local police department for other sighting reports. He found that standard weather balloons used in Oregon are 3 to 4 feet in diameter and are taupe (tan) or red in color. The only place that the balloons are released in Oregon is in Salem and, during daylight savings time are released between 4 and 5 p.m. The balloon telemetry recorded the drift being to the South East from Salem. When asked about the possibility of a balloon hanging at a fixed position for a long period of time, he said that it was not possible because the balloons are in a constant state of ascent and the telemetry corroborated his statement. He gave an official statement that it could not have been a NOAA balloon. The attempt at finding other sighting reports from the police department yielded no results.

I watched it for about thirty seconds and saw the fingers move in a manner that assured me that it was not a inatamate object being blown by the wind.  I became frightened and hid in my sleeping bag.  I do not know how long they were there but when I came out of my sleeping bag about an hour later the light was gone and so was the Alien.

Staring at it for about 10 seconds, I then observe that it looks like a top hat and seems to be illuminated by the hotels light that gave it a light brown color. No light was coming from the object, my guess was it was probably between 2000-3000 feet high. It then made a turn and at the same time accelerated into the clouds. A manuever that made me think that I just saw an UFO. Still I verified by looking at the clouds how fast it is moving. No wind clouds moving real slow. A bird? They don't accelerate. Plane?

We we’re travelling eastbound on the downhill portion of I-44, with “Forest 44” on the right and Lone Elk County Park on the left, a mile or two west of Peerless Park in southwest St. Louis County, Missouri. The sky was clear blue and cloudless, with a fair wind. My wife was driving our car.  She was looking upward through the car windshield and said to me, “Look out your passenger-side window and tell me what you see.”  All I could see out the passenger window was the close-in trees…which is what I told her. She said that she saw a large (as big as a silver dollar held at arm’s length), round object that was dark gray with a silver reflective edge.  (The sun was slightly behind and to the right of our travel path at that point.)  She also said that she expected whatever it was to pass right over or in front of the car – from right to left – and that I should watch the other side of the road (while she negotiated the interstate highway traffic) to see if I could see anything. Only a few seconds later, we were on the flat portion of I-44 with a break in the trees on the left/north side of the highway.  I immediately spotted a highly reflective, glaringly silver, object seemingly “hovering” in the distance.  The object was oblong – about an inch long at arm’s length – and very thick.  It was much thicker (at least two or three times) than the fuselage of an airplane.  It had no appendages, or wings, at all. Since we we’re travelling at highway speed in the car, the object may have been moving at an equal pace in relation to the speed of the car.  However, I did not detect any movement on the object’s part in relation to the ground.  But, the object was well above the background scenery -- between 20- to 30-degrees in elevation, with clear blue sky all around it -- so there was no easy reference point. I only caught sight of the object for 2 or 3 seconds before an additional clump of trees obscured it from view.  It was only another couple of seconds before we passed that final clump of trees and the object was suddenly no where to be seen!  It was not seen again.  (Since she was paying attention to traffic, my wife was not able to look over in time to see the object that I saw on the north side of the highway.)",2002-07-01T00:00:00,,

There are 2 instances that night while shooting a local commercial spot (I'm not sure of the exact date by the way.)  One video clip shows a very small cigar shaped object similar to one I've seen in other video clips. It is maybe one inch long or so and pops into the frame at what seems to be around 60 in/sec (2 or so in into the frame if measured from the bottom, may have come from the top.)  Unfortunately this sighting is only one frame long (1/30 sec.) as it is the last frame of the shot. The second one is a little bit more valid.  As I was going frame by frame in another clip to find where I wanted to cut it I found one frame with what seemed at first to be a pair of headlights in a window reflection until it dawned on me that it was only one frame of video.  There were two very small round objects about 1/2 - 3/4 in apart apparently white in color.  What I found strange was that 1 sec 8 frames later the same two round objects, the same distance apart flashed again only for one frame about 6 inches or so away and once again 1 sec. 7 frames later about another 6 inches, traveling left to right across the screen before disappearing into the lights.  there are a total of three one frame (1/30 sec) flashes with a definite trajectory all equal in time and distance apart. The objects also stay the same ditance apart from each other. The rate of travel is not very fast (less than 1 foot/sec)so my guess is that these are very small spheres of light emitted from something even smaller than they are.  These spheres are too small to show any kind of detail even with a pro quality camera.

Of course everyone asked what i was on, nothing iv'e only told 4-5 people this. Warm summer night, clear skies no wind at all. I was bringing out the garbage out to the ally no one was around, dead quite. I lived on a corner lot at the time so I could see two blocks in either direction.  iwas looking up and around at the stars when standing east I caught something in the corner of my eye. About a block to my right five or ten feet over the tree tops which were around tweny five to thirty feet up was this thing.It floated in a absulute straight line past me vary slow 2-3 miles per hour, I was about five feet from the ally. It was lightly ulluminated in a yellowish color, with a black corner to corner stripe about 1.5-2 feet wide. The thing was about the size of a vw bug. There were no edges, seems or anything protruding from it.Ten or so feet long six or so feet wide. The closest thing I can come up with is the movie of Star Trek were they put spock into a cascate and sent him to some planet. Its shape was quit quite simular. I heard no sound from it, no trafic anyware at all, this was on a Sunday night.I watched it go past me straight down the ally and out of site. Istood the wondering what the hell was that, nothing can do that. I looked around to see if maybe someone else was around but nobody was there. I don't know what it was, I do remember I had An erie sense about it. Has anyone else seen this? I know it's weird but the more i've thought of this thing for the past seven years, I have a strange feeling it was some sort of probe, crazy huh.

The spot where it was hovering was over an old railroad bridge.There is no access for vehicles other than a dirt bike. I could make out windows on the object also. It never moved except the colored lights underneath it flashed. There were two adults in the car at the time. The driver refused to stop or look at the object.I think for fear. Both adults in the car were normal middle class workers. The driver had an expierance in the desert in Navada in 1982. That same evening many people witnessed the same object.

I was leaving a friends house at around 10:00 a.m. in July of 1994. Before getting in my car I stopped to light a cigarette. While I was smoking, movement in the southeast part of the sky caught my attention. I knew it was not a bird, or any conventional aircraft by the way it was moving. Its movement was very erratic, shooting one way and then another, and without slowing was making very sharp turns. It had to be very distant from my position; I can only describe it as a small sphere of intense white light. I called my friend and my brother outside to look at it. The morning was very clear, no clouds or overcast conditions. They saw the same thing as I did. We watched it for about 2 minutes when it was joined by another object of the same nature. The two objects looked to be chasing each other. After 1 minute of that, they headed off to the north/northeast. All of us followed them in my car for 3/4 of a mile (down to the corner gas station), and they were out of sight. All of this happened in the space of about 6 minutes. I have never seen anything like that again, and I doubt that I will again. I am not a believer in alien abductions, crop circles, life after death or anything else usually described as paranormal. I am a firm atheist and believe in the power of science over any God. The basis for all science is mathematics however, and it is mathematicly possible for life to exist on another planet besides our own.

Flying low to the ground. Had 3 white lights underneath. No noise. A friend of mine left my house at approx. 11:10 pm heading west on Herndon Ave.  It being a clear night, he looked out his windshield to see the stars. There weren't any. It was then that he noticed a large isosceles triangle shape directly above him. The object was about as big as a football field and had completely blocked out his view of the stars.  There were 3 white lights on the underside, one at each corner. The rest of it was dark.  It was flying (or floating) very close to the ground, approx. 100 ft. above him.  He said it seemed close enough to hit with a rock.  He pulled his car off to the right shoulder of the road and turned off the engine and radio.  He leaned out the window and looked up to watch the object.  There was no noise.  He couldn't see how thick the craft was. It hovered silently for a few seconds, slowly rotated to its right, then proceeded to slowly move towards the southwest.  Suddenly, it shot upwards and away at an angle with lightning speed going in the same direction.  He noticed a sulfer-like smell in the air after it left. There were no cars on that section of the  road at the time of his sighting.  He immediately drove back to my house and banged on my bedroom window.  Thinking he had forgotten his keys or had car trouble, I rushed to open the front door.  He looked me right in the eyes and said, ""I just saw a UFO!""  He was visibly very shaken up.  I went out outside into my driveway with him and he explained what he'd seen.  I looked in the direction of his sighting but could see nothing.  A few weeks later, we were watching an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" that dealt with the UFOs sighted in Belgium.  They showed a picture of a large triangular craft with 3 lights on the underside, and he told me that was something like what he'd seen, but without the red light in the center.  We decided not to report the sighting until now because he was too shaken up by it at that time.

PD)) Wheatland-Douglas 1983 CattleMutilations UFO's seen. While an undergradute student at the University of Wyoming, I had a job working at the University stock farm out in West Laramie.  My co-worker and I were called into the state veterinary labe which was across the road from the stock farm.  We were sworn in as livestock brand inspectors and were told that our intructors were told reschedule any quizzes or exams becasue we could be gone for up to 3 days.  So far, everything is legitimate our supervisor tells us that if we want to quit we can quit now but we had to tell him by the next morning - the pay was excellent.  We both acepted and were given physicals again including one for whering respirator gear.  On and off we were told to go to a ranch and pick up some diseased (brucellosis most of the time or bangs) or dead cow.  Later learned the normal crews were swamped with other cases, this where it gets weird.  These other cases were cattle mutilations and in 1983, WYOMING and COLRADO had their fair share. The incident that stand out occurred in April of 1983.  The first was near Wheatland, Wy. and there we picked up cows that had the skin from the jaw peeled back or the uterus lkiterally extracted out - with out any blood!  Oddly there were no strikes from scavengers or predators, what stands out to me and scred the hell out of me on this one was that there were 5 dead cows laid out neatly, no foot prints like they were dropped.  The affected meat was grey like it was cooked and the cutting was not done by a scalpel becasue I had seen and assisted in too many operations to note that. The other time occurred near shirley basin where there used to be a uranium mine.  this was scrub brush country, the rancher had 2 bulls that were castrated.  He admitted to us that he had seen it take place a couple of days before.  There was a ""helicopter"" black in color with a spot light, his horse was getting nervous so he decided to get over to his folks place and on the way would check some pens where he moved the bulls, before got there he saw the helicopter there withe the light on a bull and literally lifting by the beam, the bull swivelled by its nose at the lightin apparatus of the ""helicopter"", the ""helicopter"" turned into a large black heel shaped object and humming as it lifted the bull over the ridge, he heard some screams from the bulls and it came back and did the same thing on the other two bulls.  When he made it to his folks place his horse settled down.  He mentioned what he saw to his Dad aand Mom and they said look at what coming over our way and it was the big black heeled object, his dad wentto the truck and got a rifle out and took 3 shots at it!!!  The object wobbled and then sped away east.   These people were terrified, if it had not been for insurance they would have been screwed, these were prize bulls, now worthless. We had to drop them and bring them in. The last day on the job there were some US ARMY veterinarians at the lab - very hush hush you and my friend and I were debriefed (interviewed) about what we saw and heard from the rancher.  I aksed them waht was that the rancher and his folks saw and their reply was that it did not happen and that we were sworn to secrecy as livestock brand inspectors.  I got pissed off at one of them and they said they would arrest me if I did not shut up, I am by nature a very tempermental person and can turn mean quickly which is why I have no time for joking around.  These army characters were abunch of weanies anyhow.  The government is up to something but I don't know what they want with ripping up livestock.  I am not a loon just anormal citizen who came upon your number and e-mail address on the radio.  This is the Gods honest truth.  I don't want to be bothered by this again.  If I see one of those pencil necked Army veterinarians again he's gonna be asked some straight questions.  I am in the veterinarian supply business in oklahoma, don't need the publicity.

We lived on farming land. We were out playing at the edge of the field one day when we heard a strange humming noise, we looked up and saw a small saucer shaped object with few lights around it approximatley 7 or 8 feet above our heads. We stood stunned as it only hoovered above us, it seemed as though we stood there for a long time. Finally, I do not know why, but we stated running from it, at least 150, or 200 ft away from it. It chased us, swooping down close to our heads. It then left. The strange thing is we were stunned and amazed, but we forgot about it, I mean we did not fear or think about it anymore, It was something that came into our minds once every couple of years. I have had one other experience since that time. I was sleeping on the couch, and was awakened by a bright light flowing through the window, it looked as if the moon had fallen right beside me. I pulled the covers over my head, it still shone through, but it did not really bother me, I went right back to sleep. I will never forget what happened when I was nine though, the older I get, the clearer the memory is. I did not see aliens, all I saw was this saucer shaped object, and heard the intense humming noise it was making. I guess at first we were not scared, just in shock, for it seemed that we stood there for hours. Then suddenely we were filled with fear and fled. It followed us, swooping down at us, I have never ran so hard in my life. And I still cannot understand why after this happened it seemed like it was no big deal, why we didn't think about it very much, I mean that should of been enough to make you go crazy, but afterwards, it did not even bother us. We have rarley even discussed it.",2002-09-28T00:00:00,35.7049,-77.2597

I was about five, and the dreams lasted for 1-2 months. I drempt them in strictly black and white and a disturbing double vision. Besides that, I can remember being in a dim room laying paralyzed on a table. I tried to move my head to see something but was unable to. My eyes were able to move, but not my head. I can't remember any feeling in my body, so I don't know if I had clothes on or if I was laying on a metal table. I assume it was metal. I saw two of everything so my vision was very poor. I felt a presence so I continued to un-strain my eyes and lift my head, but I was unable to. I remember a celing probably 6-8 feet above me and a wall about 9 feet to my left. It was plain and didn't look like sheetrock. I tried so hard to look around but my vision was limited. These dreams lasted over a period of 1-2 months, from what I can remember just about every night. I have read information on characteristics of abductees and the majority are true with me.

I was working as a school district police officer and was sitting in the middle of one of the high school campuses, writing on my patrol log. I had the window of my truck down and was using the illumination from a security light on one of the nearby buildings to write by. The sky was clear, stars visible, no moonlight that I recall. Suddenly, the interior of my truck lit up like it was daylight. My first impression was that a truck with off-road lights had pulled up behind me and suddenly turned on all its' lights at once. This startled me quite a bit, as I did not hear anything, even with the window down. I looked up from my writing and into the rear view mirror, only to discover there was nothing there. I considered the possiblity of a police helicopter shining its' spotlight on me, but there was no helicopter noise. Also, the spotlight from a helicopter has a blue-ish tinge to it, and has an oscillating effect due to the vibrations from the rotors. There was no sense that the light source was moving, and it was white light, like daylight. I looked out the window into the sky to try and locate the source. As I looked around, I saw an irregular patch of white light in the sky to the northeast, about 40 degrees above the horizon. The shape was roughly elliptical, but had ragged edges. The patch of light seemed to be closing in on itself, and it disappeared as I watched it. The size of the patch when I first saw it was about 4 or 5 times larger that the full moon, but much brighter. I checked the newspapers for the next several weeks to see if there was any mention of meteors or other events which would explain what I saw, but nothing ever appeared. I grew up near several airports and a military aircraft factory, and am familiar with conventional aircraft. While I am not an amateur astronomer, I like to look at the sky for relaxation, and have seen various types of meteors and bolides. I have seen countless missile launches from Vandenberg AFB, and have been watching satellites since Echo 1.

I was looking south down the road and I noticed a point of light above the horizon, it did not appear to be a star as the light was different clearer and brighter.

At this point all I could make out was a pattern of lights, two in front one in back -like spotlights.  As I got closer the main road took a sharp turn to the right at this point I stopped the car to see if I could tell if it was moving.  It appeared to be hovering in the sky above an empty field. I also noticed that I could not hear any aircraft type noise, even though the car was running. I decided to take a left onto a side road which parelled the field. I drove about 100 yrds. and stopped the car to make sure that it wasn't moving. It was not, I turned off the car to find out if was making noise- it was not.  I realized that this was something out of the ordinary, I got out of the car and stood next to it and looked up at the object- dead silence.  It appeared as 3 bright white lights- two in front- one in back- hard to say how big- I guess 20yrds long, could not make out a profile.

One question I have is, can you detect a filler in the item? does it slosh like it's filled with fluid? or an uneven weight on any side of the item? Please don't open the item untill positive i.d. can be made. What I would suggest is to contact the US Army EOD unit at Redstone and they will X-ray the item, You will have to contact your local law enforcement and have them actually call the Army EOD unit because we don't respond off post unless called by civilian law enforcement.",2002-10-28T00:00:00,34.727967771639044,-86.62783879680786
Unidentified Sphere,Huntsville,AL,1984-06-01T00:00:00,sphere,,"Occurred : 6/1/1984   (Entered as : 1984) Reported: 10/13/2002 5:18:49 PM 17:18 Posted: 10/28/2002 Location: Huntsville, AL Shape: Sphere Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25555.html,"Unidentified Sphere Description:  Metallic sphere weighing approx. fifty-two (52) pounds with a circumference of thirty-two (32) inches.  It has what appears to be a removable disk, or plate, that measures six and one halve (6 1/2) inches across containing eight (8) small threaded holes and a larger threaded hole in the center.  I have never attempted to remove this part.  It has a gray metallic coating resembling a very hard Teflon like material.  Because of it's weight I assumed that it was constructed of steel, but was surprised to discover that it is not attracted to a magnet. History:  The object was found in the woods of North Alabama in the mid 1980s.  It appeared to have fallen a great distance as it was embedded in the ground (red clay) with only a small portion visible.  Soon after it's discovery, I contacted the U.S. Army at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL and gave them a description of the ball and my name, address and phone number.  I was told that someone would contact me, but never heard from anyone.  I then called NASA and gave them the same description and contact information.  Never heard from them.  I later called the Huntsville Police Bomb Squad division and was visited by two officers just minutes after calling.  After inspection they told me that it was probably secretly manufactured by the government as it had no markings of origin.  They had seen other stuff in the past including circuit boards with no markings that turned out to be such.  I asked them if they thought it could be alien.  They both had a big laugh and explained that this was impossible as it contained screws.... as if screws could only be a human invention!!  They wanted my permission to take it with them, but I decided against it as they explained that they were going to destroy it. (Their policy was to destroy any thing that they could not identify!).  Anyway, I have had this thing ever since and have never found an explanation.  Many people have seen it (I kept it on my desk as a conversation piece for years.) and have offered a few theories:  A simple weight, Time Capsule, Device used for tracking purposes, part of an aircraft and etc.  Some even believe that it may be of alien construction! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object is not UFO-related, but we would be interested to know what the object is.  We will encourage the owner to measure the threads on the machine screws, in order to establish whether they are a metric or English thrread.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Dear Mr. Davenport: Thank you so much for your interest and reply. First, to answer your question... Each of the screw holes, including the center hole does not admit a view of the interior.  The center hole terminates in the plate itself, while the other eight bores through two layers. I have not attempted to remove the ""Door"" of the Sphere.  I think mostly out of paranoia of the unknown content.  Could it possibly be radioactive, or maybe booby trapped with an explosive?  This ""Thing"" has never been x-rayed or monitored for any sort of emissions.  I would rather leave this to professionals. I have noticed, though, that it appears to have a hollow space.  If you strike the side with a hard object, it responds with a ""ping"".  Striking the side opposite the ""Door"" results in a thud.  This also leads me to believe that it's far too intricate to be a simple weight. Thanks again ((END FOLLOW-UP)) ((FOLLOW-UP)) Hello Thanks again for your interest.  Please feel free to use any correspondence that may help unfold this mystery.  I am eager to learn the origin of this ""Thing"" and very curios as to it's content. I have no clue of the type of metal the sphere is made of.  I can tell you that it has no magnetic draw.  This surprised me considering it's weight.  Obviously it is not steel.  There are a few places where the coating has been scratched.  These happened over the years that it was in my possession.  It was absolutely pristine when it was discovered and sustained no damage whatsoever from it's fall from the sky.  It was found embedded in red clay (the consistency of modeling clay).  So, it had a ""soft"" landing as opposed to hitting rocks or gravel, etc.  Most of the existing scars were produced by hammer blows or other hard objects.  Once a friend actually slammed it onto his concrete drive way in attempt to crack it open.  The only result was a cracked driveway! I have not had access to any Geiger counters or x-ray devices, but I will try the Film trick.  Thanks for that bit of advise.

My daughter,a friend and I were out trying to use a telescope I had recently bought, and were on a country road where there was no city lights to obstruct our view. Needless to say, we never got to use the telescope. My daughter was laying in the back of my station wagon,and started telling me that a car was coming and that I should pull off the road a little more to avoid being in the way. I glanced back at the headlights coming behind us, and even though something told me that there was somthing wierd about the lights, I started to get in the car to pull over more.  Suddenly, my daughter started to yell that it was not a car, and for my friend and I to look behind us. The lights that had been behind us, were now lifting up and over the car! My daughter wouldn't get out to see it right away, because she was afraid, but my friend and I were transfixed on the craft. It, was definetly triangular, it made NO sound,the lights were very muted on the bottom of the craft. It's size was VERY large. I would say, (I know ther are better terms) the size of an acre or a little more of land. It was crusing very slowly, about 25 to 30 miles an hr. heading in a southern direction toward Muncie, In. My friend and I were watching this craft going off into the distance, and questioning each other to what we had just seen, when my daughter started yelling again,that there was another one coming up behind us! My friend and I looked back, and there was another craft, exactly like the first, heading in the same direction as the previous one! We all watched this one follow the same course as the first, noting again that there was no sound, and although there were lights, they were very muted. The outsides of the crafts were very dark,and appeared to be one with the blackness of the sky. After that unforgettable sighting, we raced back to town and called the Muncie airport to see if they had heard any reports or seen anything on their screens, but they hadn't.

On this hot June night I had decided around 11:00pm to drive to my parents home in Summerfield, OK fropm my home in Norman, OK.  When I was about 3 miles from my parents house I noticed a bright red ight in the sky.  I could not take my eyes from it.  I drove faster to see what in the world it was.  As I was driving down this road, which is very rural, I noticed a car coming from the other direction.  As the car passed under the light their dome light came on.  As they neared me they were waving for me to stop.  Because I did not know the 3 males in the car and because of the time of night I did not stop.  It was a very clear, bright night with hardly any clouds in the sky.  As I drove closer down the road and closer to the light my radio went off and wouldn't work anymore.  The light was now lower in the sky, about housetop level.  It was red and glowed but did not give off light.  The light reminded me of the light given off by one of those glow-in-the-dark balls that kids play with.  It was elongated and seemed to undulate as it now moved down the road in front of me.  A best guess estimate as to size is that it semed to be about 9 feet long and 3 feet wide.  It dropped from housetop level to the level of a monster truck cab.  Once I was this close I all of a sudden did not want to catch up to it anymore.  I slowed down so that I would stay behind it and not catch up to it.  It was traveling down the road in front of me.  For some reason it now seemed very menacing.  The way I can best descibe it is the way you feel when a dog growls at you and you can tell whether it is a dog that will wag its tail and lick your hand if you talk to it or will back up its growl with an attack if you speak to it.  It was the bad one.  It seemed evil and menacing.  As I approached the intersection, it was now down to windshield level of my chevette car.  I stopped for the stop sign at the intersection and it kept going without stopping.  It is 4/10 of a mile to my parent's house form the intersection.  Half of this is! on the paved road and half is a private lane.  Where you turn onto the lane the pavement rises into a hill to continue up and around a curve.  The light was barely ahead of me when I reached the lane.  I was just barely idling along at this point, so as not to catch up with it!  While it continued up the hill I turned onto the lane and stomped on the accelerator.  I looked in my rearview mirror and saw it behind me.  I started honking my horn and as soon as I was in my parent's drivway.  The lights in my parent's house came on and they came out onto the porch.  I stopped the car and ran as fast as I could into the house.  It took my parents a long while to calm me down.  My mother and I stayed up for a couple of hours and I finally felt I would be able to go to sleep.  I fell asleep on the couch in  the living room.  There were no electrical appliances or lights anywhere near the couch.  At approximately 4am I was literally shocked awake.  The hair on my arms stayed upright for all of the next day.  When the shock jolted me awake and I woke up I saw the light at the corner window of the living room as if it were looking in at me.  At first I was so scared tht I couldn't even get my vocal cords to work then I was screaming for all I was worth.  My parents ran into the room, turnng on lights as they made their way to the living room.  The light seemed to dissapate and disappear.  I stayed awake till it was daylight and as soon as it was morning left to return back to Norman.  I have never driven alone in that part of the county again at night and refuse to do so.

Driving to Northern California, heading North on Interstate 5, just past the Hwy166 juntion(approx 1:00AM, Feb.1994), noticed an aircraft (to the left 200ft/100ft up) flying at the same rate of speed. At first only could see 2 colored lights, and a spotlight beam that did not reach the ground, noticed colored lights slowly turning (first appeared as helicopter losing control). As I slowed down, the object also slowed down and began to wobble, and then suddenly flew sideways across the Freeway approx. 50ft in front of my truck, I slammed on the brakes to a stop. What me and my wife, and another vehicle behind me are now watching, was unlike anything I've ever seen, wobbling up+down (like a fresbe does at the end of a throw), now on the East side, within 100-300ft from us. DESCRIPTION; approx 30ft diameter disc, rotating approx. 1 revolution-8sec, with a Triangle attached on the bottom (corners touching discs peremeter), but the triangle rotated twice as fast, approx 1 rev-4sec. Both disc and triangle rotated counter clockwise,then suddingly clockwise, and was dull grayish white in color, and no seams or bolts were evident. 4? colored lights were on the objects perimeter, the lights pulsed (no flash) red to yellow orange, and blue to green. There still was the bottom light beam (white), but saw no evidence of it when it flew in front of us.  The object made no sound, and its thickness was unclear, almost like it was 2 dimensional. The object appeared completely out of control, going up and down (sometimes extreamly fast), and still maintained its wobble. After about 30-45 seconds of this, Fear overrode Couriousity, as the object, several times, got too close, and I rapidly drove off. The other car that stopped, remained parked. We watched the object continue its dance as I drove off, my wife keep telling me to pullover to watch this object, but I didn't trust it. I admit I was scared, only because of its odd flight pattern, and also because it was flying object that was too close and erratic in flight. However I do regret not staying there to watch it, and hope too someday meet the occupants of the other car that did remain. We never reported the incident, mainly because of the reaction from those we did tell, and the fear of losing my job for accused mental unstability.

I was 11 or 12 at the time,he was 42.This happened over 35 years ago. First,none of us were on anything.We drove to the beach and parked in the tourist parking lot next to the statue of the Norweigan lady.If you've been to Va Beach you know what I'm talking about.We walked across the boardwalk,a few folks walking by,we walked down the stairs and hit the sandy beach.At this hour the beach almost vacant.We saw 3-4 stragglers and a guy surf casting.We could barely make out the comet.The fisherman cranked in his line and left.The wind barely blowing,calm,the ocean almost like glass.Soon the beach emptied and around midnight even the boardwalk emptied.We were standing on the beach alone.The comet grew in length and brightness and my father remarked we needed to move further north up by Cape Henry to lose the lights of the boardwalk.I reckon it was 1 AM.The lights were shining a good 50 to 100 feet out into the ocean a ways past calm surf.All of a sudden I saw a movement to the north came down from the sky,an object angling down and towards us.It was a flying saucer as clear as could be seen lit up in detail by the bright lights glowing off the boardwalk.The saucer was about 40 feet across and metallic grey but not shiny. It then veered out straight and leveled out less than 10 feet over the waves and continued past us no more than 30 feet eyeball to eyeball in front of us,kind of wavered a bit,I estimate the domed saucer was streaking by at 100 miles an hour,Zip! to the south towards the Virginia Beach fishing pier and about 30 feet to our right,kind of wavered up and out to sea,rose into the dark sky out of the shining boardwalk lights now masking our view of it's climb away.I wanted the dome to be lit up and looked as quickly as i could for objects in the dome and saw nothing. It was dark in there. We were looking right at it,our heads twisting like at a tennis tournament.I said ""did you see that?"" and my father asked the exact same thing ""did you see that?"" We both acknowledged each other that we had.So I was not dreaming (hallucinating it) nor was he.I said ""it was a flying saucer!"" and he repeated the same thing.We were very excited and the Japanese comet took an abrupt back seat.Now I have read about strange lights way up in the sky and objects and I understand why they are called UFO's but this was like wilderness camping and having Big Foot come over and take a steak off the grill.I mean this was not a UFO,this was a flying saucer.I do not remember the exact year I was 12 or so  but it was mid-60's.Oceana Naval airstation you might say but I am a very logical person and no way back then they would have a flying domed saucer object come from Oceana and not be heard at some point.Their jets are loud,still are. I am about to describe to this day is what we saw may be deemed as unidentified.This puzzles me and will until I die. The object was absolutely silent.Nothing.The waves were not crashing to drown out anything,it was quiet at 1 AM then in Virginia Beach,only a car or two going by every minute or so.What could have propelled an object at 100 miles an hour silently? It shot past us and we felt no air current off it and we saw no ripple on the ocean from it's passing.As it was climbing away from us,no noise at all.Nothing, like we were deaf.How's this possible? We stared up for lights,propulsion,anything.We saw no more,heard no more. I can only say it was like we were seeing it in a dream but we were wide awake and backed each other up what we had just seen only feet away lit up.In my mind I can see it as clear as the night we saw it.My father is now 79 years old and we talk about it every once in a while.We were very lucky to be standing at the right place at the right time.We eventually moved down the beach to the north into darkness and watched the comet's crash into the horizon of the ocean as the sun rose. It was an eventful night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",,36.837301342710994,-76.06194814578005

We got out of the car in the first place because the saucer shaped craft followed us from above for several miles. Everything was black that night and no one was on the road either that could see what was going on except us. It may have been around 23:00 hrs that the incident occurred. My sister doesn't remember anything at all, but the rest of were scared. My mother said that the craft followed her on every turn and she couldn't shake it off at all, that is why we got out was because it wouldn't leave us alone. We very luckily escaped with our lives. The craft appeared to have some type of trouble or something because it sort of wobbled only slightly like it may have been in trouble but we weren't going to stick around to see what came out of it so we left without delay.

During a period of several nights, points of light moved over and under the ocean water in various formations, which were later revealed to be lights attached to solid black elliptical flying objects. One night, I traveled with two other friends to Jax Beach to see what we would see.  As we stood on the beach, we noticed what appeared to be airport runway lights extending from the shoreline approximately 1 mile north of us to the east horizon.  My friends and I wondered how and why runway lights would be positioned over water to the horizon, as it really seemed nonsense.  Our attention was then drawn to the lights of what appeared to be an oil tanker moving south across the ocean many miles out to sea.  As the lights moved in unison along the horizon, suddenly these lights, which seemed to form the outline of a ship separated into two equal numbers and moved away from each other. With that occurrence my friends and I felt very uneasy and decided to depart.  I returned on other occasions to witness other equally unexplainable lights, which moved in and out of the water.  Following those sightings, I began to send Morris Code messages from the shoreline using my car headlights.  Messages such as: God is Love.  I sent the simple messages over the water for several nights; when a response was sent in Morris Code by way of a red light, which moved between two white lights moving in unison near the horizon.  The response message was:  God is.  Within several nights of that response,  I was given the opportunity to see the UFO aircraft that generated the ""lights"" on two occasions.  One following night, I parked my car on a beach access ramp facing the ocean and using my headlights, I sent my God is love message out over the water.  Shortly, thereafter, four lights arranged in a blue-green-blue-green pattern appeared on the horizon. I stepped out of the car to get a better look and the lights began to move very quickly toward the beach where I was standing.  The lights reached the waters edge at the beach and stopped.  The UFOs traveled from the horizon to the shore in less than 30 seconds!  At that point I observed that the aircraft were about the size of 737's and their shapes were elliptical and solid bl! ack with a one blue and one green light positioned on the outer edge.  Their appearance was difficult to see except when heat lightening flashed in the sky behind them.  The UFOs did not remain for long but this time more slowly returned to their position on the horizon.  The second sighting occurred several nights later and further north of Jax Beach in an area of the beach where houses or apartments were not constructed at the time.  Again, I used my headlights to send the Morris Code message ""God Is"" over the water.  Again lights appeared on the horizon and moved more slowly over the water until they were about 150 feet from the shore.  That time I counted six UFOs that appeared as before.  I walked down to the shore and waited for something to happen; however, I do not remember anything else occurring, except that they seemed to loose interest in me and slowly drifted out of sight over the horizon. ",2002-09-13T00:00:00,30.280529411764707,-81.40465

I was headed NO. on U.S. 17, coming home from work at approx. 5:45 p.m., just past twilight, when I first noticed it in the sky. At 1st glance, I thought I was looking at a helicopter, because it was so low to the ground and moving at a low rate of speed; (at 60 m.p.h., I was able to keep up with it.) It maintained a position just ahead of me and to the right about a mile away, maybe 300' in the air. as I continued to watch it. I noticed that it had an elongated diamond shape (<>) and lights that were not at all recognizable as navigation lights. The end points had continuously burning amber lights, while the top and bottom points were bright white and strobed in a fashion similar to those on an ambu- lance. As I got closer to my turn off, I noticed it was veering away from it's parallel course to me and taking a more southerly course, but still maintaining its slow pace. Approx. 9 miles after 1st spotting it, I turned so. on Halls Creek rd., and, as luck would have it, I was still hot on it's trail, following Halls Creek due south, as it moved east. I drove the length of the rd. (4.5 mi.) and came to a ""T"" intersection. I turned left onto Pitts Chapel Rd. with i t still in clear view, so I de- cided to pull off the rd. and get out to get a good  look at it. I was able to watch it un obstructed by trees for approx 30 sec. at 1st, it simply did what it had been doing all along...proceeding slowly, steadi- ly east, but just before it disappeared behind the woods, it did some- thing truly astounding that took away any doubt that it was a genuine ufo; although the craft never once wobbled, pitched or yawled, it did make some radical rising and dipping maneuveres. I KNEW then I was onto something extraordinary. MY pulse racing now, I pushed my car to its max trying to get as close to the object as I possibly could, turning on 4 different roads, over another 8-9 mile stretch, until I found a gravel rd. which turned off the paved rd. in the same direction of the craft. By this time (6:20-6:30pm), the sky was almost completely dark, and as I proceeded down the unfamiliar path, I noticed that the ufo had stopped about 1/2 mile away and hovering roughly 2-300 feet above the trees, I was awstruck by this monumental sight. Finally on solid, stationary ground, I watched it hover over the trees, occasionally darting side-to- side, and up and down in a floating kind of way. I found myself debating whether I could make it home to get my camcorder, but I was afraid that it would be gone for good, so I stayed there to take in the entire ex- perience. It stayed right there above the trees for several minutes, until finally, the four corners of the craft appeared to pull toward the center and consolidate, just before accelerating away from me to dis- appear beyond the tree line... I tried to resume chase, but lost all sight of it.  I don't know what it was, but I do know for a fact that it absolutely was NOT  a fixed-wing or rotary aircraft of ANY kind...and I can only hope that someone else saw it or video-taped it. I will never forget it as long as I live.",2002-11-20T00:00:00,,

At Between 5:30am and 5:35am i was delivering papers while walking through a local trailer court. I stopped to look up at the Orion constelation and find a star that usually appears to be flashing red, white and blue this time of year just bellow and north of it...I dont know why i do that... it is just is interesting to me.  This time I saw something that has permanently changed my mind about all the UFO stories. Just the south of me i noticed a VERY faint pumpkin orange glow and thought i was going to get to see a meteor start up as i turned my head slightly i realized that there were 5 very square shaped glowing patches in a v shape heading north slightly south and east of were i was standing. I intently tried to focus my sight on this and realized that as they were moving the stars behind were blocked out in a very black v area behind them and that the faint orange squares were more rectangular and bent over the leading edge of a wing like structure...try as i might i could not get any other visual ques as to the exact shape of what was going by right in front of me. I was trying to get an idea of the trailing shape but could not because as the stars would reapear behind it they seemed distorted, like in a mirage, by wave like disruption of the star light. I stood there fixed in total disbeleif of what i was seeing! As it passed almost over me and in front of me it made NO SOUND what so ever! I would guess that it was was about half again bigger than a stealth bomber(which i have seen flying over head at the Air Force Academy graduation twice, only about 40miles from here) and about 1500 feet off the ground, I had the impression for a second that it was a stealth bommber gliding but it was a little too big and there is no where close in that direction for it to glide to. as it passed to my left the orange glowing patches became almost impossible to see on the bottom edge of it and became smaller as though they were on the front edge of a wing but still absolutely no sound! I couldnt keep an eye on ! it after a few more seconds since there were no more visable stars in that area to see it blocking them. I stood there for 5 to 10 minutes looking all over trying to see if it would come back, but it never did. I would guess that it was traveling about 2 to 3 times faster than the C130s we have fly over us all the time and was about twice the wing span. I couldnt tell any thing beyond that it looked generaly like a flying wing since there was nothing but the 5 orange patches and the blacked out shape behind them. The orange patches were extremely faint, less bright than the stars of Orions belt, as if they were reflectors instead of lights, but i cant figgure out what they could have reflected since it is still pretty dark at 5:30am. I would love to know what it realy was if anyone knows. I would guess it was putting out a lot of heat to make the stars seem wavy but how does it do it with absolutely no noise? If thisv is government or visitor??? I would be quicker to beleive a government secret but I may never know for sure. If any-one does know please tell me mysteries drive me nuts!",2002-10-15T00:00:00,38.27602697368422,-104.66346271929824

I was traveling by car north on I-5 near Tukwilla (Kent), Washington. The object appeared directly ahead and above in my windshield and then traveled right descending down at a 60 degree angle. Because the interstate is elevated (and the Kent valley is below road level), this object actually appeared to impact below my line of sight within the Kent valley. In fact, it appeared so close I thought that if I could stop and park, I could walk to it. The color of the object was soft yellow with green highlights. It had a trailing ""tail"" classic to photo images of comets. However, in seeing meteors from a long distance in the past, this object's speed was well below that of an incoming meteor when observed from far away.  (Perhaps no more than 200-300 mph.)

The light moved smoothly and in a manner similar to how I've seen a meteor travel through the sky.  It seemed like a point source, and had absolutely no trail whatsoever, ruling out, in my mind, it being a meteor.  The location of the light as it moved was to the east of my vantage point, and I would estimate it's location, based on where I was and where it was, as being perhaps somewhere over the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay.  I heard no sound, although I was in a moving car travelling approximately 55mph to the South.  It was of very short duration, visible for no more than a couple of seconds.

I have witnessed many ufo sightings through the years, but never one so incredible as this one. At 11:00 am I was on the roof of my house fixing a roof leak. I have a beautiful view of mountains in the background. I turned to look up into the clear blue sky towards the west, (I automatically look up into the sky everyday and night. At first, I just enjoyed the view of the mountains but something caught my eye. A small glimmer in the sky. I thought it might be a star still visible but then I realized it just couldn´t be. I went for my binoculars and when I got back, the glimmer had gotten remarkably larger. When I looked at it with the binoculars I clearly saw that it was a gigantic metallic object with oval shape that was hovering. I am used to looking around the ufo´s that I see because usually there are more. As I searched around the object, I didn´t see anything at first, but then I focused a little better and saw several smaller discs surrounding the large one. I yelled to my sister and she joined me and saw the same thing. I continued to search the larger objects perimeter and I was astounded to see smaller discs flying in closer to the larger object which I will now refer to as the mothership. We counted at least 50 small discs surrounding the mothership. I was in total disbelief at what followed. During the next 45 minutes, we witnessed how the smaller discs entered the mothership, one by one until they were all inside! Then the mothership started to move slowly towards the south. I looked around again and spotted a second mothership coming into the picture, and they both took off so fast that I could not follow them. It was something that has had a profound effect on me and my sister, but the story doesn´t end there. What follows is also unbelievable. I spent the rest of the day in the hot sun on that roof waiting to see if they came back. I ended up with a severe sunburn. Later on, a friend of mine and his girlfriend showed up. I told them what had happened and of course they just laughed at me, but I wasn´t coming down from that roof. They decided to join me and my friend, looking through the binoculars towards the mountains all of the sudden spotted something. As we turned to look I saw that it was a large aircraft. No large aircraft fly in this area. The more we looked, the stranger the aircraft seemed to be. At a dista! nce it a lmost looked like the 747 that carries the space shuttle on it´s back. As it got closer in our view and became sideways to our view, I realized it was an AWAC plane! Mexico has no AWAC´s. It had to be from the U.S.! My friends were just as astonished as I was and now they started to believe my story. What was an american AWAC plane doing in Cuernavaca, Mexico? Then, two other things happened. It just kept getting better and better. Two military jets flew right over our heads! They were so fast and so loud that I couldn´t identify them but I could swear that they were two american F-16´s. Either way, Mexico does not have that type of aircraft. I know that this story sounds completely like it was from a patient out of an insane assylum, but I swear it is true. About ten minutes later (dusk) my friends became total believers when we saw a light coming over the mountains. It´s flight patterns were erratic and changed quickly. Not an airplane. As it got closer we could see it through the binoculars. It was a huge sphere, deep bright orange, I don´t know if it was the reflection from the sunset but that´s what it looked like. It seemed to be landing towards the east. I got on the phone and called a friend in the small town of Tepoztlan and told her about it, that it was coming her way. While on the phone, she described it to me as it landed somewhere over the mountaintop. So now we all knew we weren´t seeing things. Needless to say, we spent most of the night on that roof, without any further sightings. The next day, I got a call from another friend who related to me, that he had seen what looked like two F-16´s flying over northern Cuernavaca! Then I told him my story. We all got together that weekend to share our experience. No one else that we´ve told about this believes us, so, since then we have just kept it to ourselves, but one thing for sure, no matter what we have seen out there through the years, now I know for a FACT, that they truly do EXIST and they are HERE!!! I have heard of motherships before, ! but now I´ve seen them with my own eyes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-11-16T00:00:00,,

My guess is that it was 500 feet below us and the equilateral edges were maybe 60 feet or more per edge.  I reasoned that we were doing 580 or so and it was moving past at 100 kts faster.

It was about 3am on a hot and humid August night in 1995.  My ex-girlfriend and I were awake, talking as we began to fall asleep.  Then my ex nudged me and asked what the light was on the window shades (which were pulled down half way).   I looked at the shades and noticed a flickering light sort of.  I told it that it was probably heat lightning.  Then a moment later she nudges me again and asked me to go take a look.  Now the bedroom had two windows which were looking right into the back yard.  Also, there were some woods and a pond behind the house as well.  The pond was about 60 yards from the window view. I got up and went to the window on the left, and my ex went to the window on the right.  I looked out the window and saw what looked like someone walking in the woods with a flashlight.  That's what the flickering must have been.  I told her that either someone was walking in the woods or even might have been fishing in a boat and they were using a flashlight. She then told me to look to the left, that she saw a light on the water.  I looked and saw a light reflecting off the water from a house on the other side of the pond.  But then I leaned forward to look to the far left (which is not where she was looking)just to see if anyone else was out there. What I saw next shocked me.  In fact when I saw it, I couldn't even move, it's like I was paralyzed.   There were 4 balls of light, each about 4 or 5 feet in diameter, and each a soft but bright white.  The four balls were rotating around a central point, each spaced equally from the next.  The balls were rotating slowly in a clockwise direction, and as a whole, were also moving away from the house to the left behind some trees.  They were hovering above the water about 3 feet.  Before going out of sight, the balls began to pulsate in intensity.  After a couple seconds, they simultaneously changed color to blue then red, while still pulsing.  I don't recall which color they went to first, but those were the 2 colors.  All the time they were pulsating, rotating and moving as a unit in an easterly direction over the water.  My ex-girlfriend did not see these balls of light, because I was in such an immediate shock  I couldn't move and I couldn't tell her.  I was sweatting from every pore of my body. As soon as the balls of light went out of view, another strange thing happened.   We both witnessed this.  From above the trees where the balls of light had gone, a very bright white light began to ""scan"" the small patch of woods to the left side of the back yard.  My grandmother was living in a small trailer right at the water's edge at that time and the light had gone systematically left and right and down level by level until it completed...It even ""scanned"" my gandmother's trailer. In an instant, the light disappeared then instantly, our backyard had been systematically ""scanned"" as if the light was directly above our house.  Then, the light was gone for good. Notes on the event:  there was complete silence, no crickets, no tree frogs, no wind, no sound whatsoever, even the source of the lights was completely silent. I am a customer service rep and technical sales rep., a college graduate and I graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. in Medical Technology.  My ex-girlfriend was from Italy, she had a B.S. in humanities. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

A friend of mine took the photo and gave it to me. It sat around in my dresser for a while before I got it scanned and put it up on the internet. And then it was another couple of years before I found this site and decided to submit it. (I haven't been terribly interested in the whole thing.) Apparently, my friend just saw this thing go flying by and snapped a few photos. (The others were not as good, and I ended up losing them anyway.) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) OK, maybe this is the better way to go at this.... I'm really interested in getting a first-hand feel for how good UFOlogists are at recognizing hoaxes. I've placed this photo up in a couple of different places and asked people what they think of it. When I submitted it to you, I wanted to pose it as a real UFO photo (it is actually a hoax), and then see what sort of tests were performed on it. Apparently, my conscience won't let me follow through on that :-) I've heard stories of UFO researchers who have wasted lots of money on examining hoaxes, and I certainly didn't want that to happen here. (I figured my photo probably wasn't good enough to justify it.)  So basically....I've often wondered how easy it would be to dupe UFOlogists....but I guess I'm not the man for the job 'cause I just don't feel right doing it. I'm sorry for any trouble I may have caused. In Christ,  ((name deleted)) ((END FOLLOW-UP)) ((NUFORC Note:  The report and the photo are a hoax.

They were in a V position. One at the front, then two behind it, then two more, and then another two. Me and two other work mates were sitting outside my house having a cigarette and beer when i heard a strange buzzing noise. It was like a loud hum and sharp radio frequency buzz at the same time. At first we thought it was a car, then the phone, then our pages, then even the fridge or microwave. But we couldn't have heard that noise from inside because we were atleast 30 feet away from the house. A small flash like a comet flew directly over us, it was pretty high in the sky though. Then two more, and two more and then two more. All seven crafts flew over my house. We could clearly make out the shape of them. They looked like air-craft that the Navy uses but literally 50 times bigger. They dissapeared every minute or so and then re-appeared with one large lige on each of them. As soon as i got my video camera from inside and ran outside they had already been there for close to a minute. Each time they flew over us the noise they made got more high-pitched.

They all went different directions, and then the bigger one picked up speed (note that it never got smaller, so I could tell that the others came OUT of it), and went the other direction (started going west, then went east).  The others also picked up speed.  I realized that I was peeing all over the floor, and looked down very briefly (about a second, maybe two), and they were gone.  I don't know if there were any other witnesses.  I didn't tell anyone before this, because I have a reputation to uphold, and most of my friends would think I went insane... There didn't seem to be any lights or sounds, but there may have been.  I think it was pretty far away, and it was daytime.",2002-08-16T00:00:00,39.68000198902607,-104.7929670781893

Then they went  back out again to form the circle and repeated this process over and over.  At the end they joined in the center and, after maybe 10-15 seconds, the lights just ""went out.""

I spotted this cluster of yellowish orange lights with a large red pulsing light from a distance of about a mile away. The most peculiar thing about this, at that moment in time was the distance of the red pulsing light to the cluster of lights. The red pulsing light was hanging below the cluster of lights. This object/craft was heading west(towards us). I had the video camera with us in the truck. The model is a Sony TRV520 digital video camera with a 20X optical zoom. So, I found a good spot to pull over. My girlfriend and I both got out of the truck.  I grabbed the video camera and she grabbed the binoculars. After realizing that we still had the lens cover on the camera I was able to get the craft focused and zoomed in on it. This is the most bizarre craft I have ever seen. It flew under a star, and as it did, you can still see the star. Transparent? The craft is a cluster of small lights in a hexagon formation. There is a triangular portion in the front from which the large red pulsing light is affixed. I have video of the craft.

It was much brighter than the light that would normally come off of an airplane or from a radio tower with a warning flasher. I asked my room mate if he had seen it and said it had been there for a while and that he had been watching it with his girlfriend. For a while we just watched the constant light; it didn't appear to move at all. Then it began to float south of us for what might have been a solid minute, moving very slowly and at tree level. It then began to move up higher than the tree level, perhaps 600 feet into the air. It then continued at an extremely slow pace south and suddenly stopped and stayed suspended again for about 10 minutes. It then moved very hastily south and disappeared around the corner of our windows.

The date is not exactly accurate, it was sometime in the middle to late Feb of 2002.  The time of the occurance was roughly between 10:00 pm and 10:30 pm between Fargo and Hickson ND on well traveled Hwy 81 south.  There were two wittnesess to the event.  It was a Friday night, my girlfriend and I decided to go out to Hickson, ND for a few drinks and fun.  We left from Moorhead, MN (which is across the river from Fargo, ND) and proceeded across the river on the far south side of Fargo and turned on Hwy 81 south for about a 15-20 mile drive to Hickson.  Hwy 81 is a well traveled road, especially on the weekends, there are a number of small town bars that people enjoy within a radius of 20-25 miles from Fargo-Moorhead.  As we traveled down 81, we were having a calm - dissagreement about something, and noticed a group of red lights above the treen line some miles ahead(the night was clear, and black, but you could still differentiate the tree line from the sky line).  As we approached the lights stayed at the same location without moving, and became larger the closer we got.  My girlfriend asked if I saw the lights - and asked if it were a plane.  I replied that if it were a plane, it was flying very low, and incredibly slow (also, earlier that day 747 airplanes were doing touch-and-go landings at Fargo's Hector Airport- in the winter the winds are very calm - so they use the airport for training purposes - because were not the busiest location in America - but this was not a 747 on a training mission).  As we approached I slowed down (we were driving a Mercury Mountaineer) and the lights were from our left (heading south) to our right, half were red, and half blue, one solid row, no blinking/flashing of any kind.  We don't remember how many total colored lights were in the row, however we do know a few things for sure: 1.  we had not been drinking,  2.  we were of very sound mind and body,  3.  we were very rational  4. Hwy 81 is a busy road - and we were over half way (15 miles or so)to our destination ! - and ha d seen ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER VEHICLES - none from the north, south, east, or west NONE!  As we slowed down to where our vehicle was now under the object (we could see the row of colored lights right above  us) the colored  lights suddenly went off and two large - spot lights came on and lit up the entire area around us.  At that time my girlfriend put her head out the window and looked up and listened - all we could here was a dull hum - no jet engines, helicopter engines ect.  I never came to a complete stop, the vehicle was always moving but a very slow 5-15 mph once we were near and below the object.  We continued slowly until we came out from under the object - this is when we really started to wonder what it was - just a matter of seconds (10-15 maybe) we looked back and the lights were completely gone - nowhere in sight.  We turned the radio back up a little, and proceeded to Hickson - never seeing another car.  When we got to our destination, we talked to friends both seperately and together, and never mentioned a word about what we saw- it was like we were thinking about it, but for whatever reason, never mentioned anything to anyone else.  After closing, we headed back to Fargo-Moorhead, and saw numerous cars on 81 and the other adjoining roads - at that time we began discussing what we saw.  The next morning, we each took a sheet of paper and seperately drew the object from what we remembered from the previous night.  We then ""compared notes"" only to find we had both drawn virtually the same object.  I would just like to again say, we were both of sound mind and body - and still are - what ever it was - we had never seen before - and couldn't explain it.  There were too many coincidences that night - no traffic anywhere, over a 20-25 mile drive with many conecting roadways, homes and BARS, on a Friday night, just south of a community population of close to 200,000 - where nobody takes a bus - everyone owns at least one car - most have two or three, not to mention snowmobiles - it's a big deal to ! ride sno wmobiles from bar to bar is this area - no snowmobiles = ZERO activity in this area - VERY VERY VERY STRANGE.  We can't explain it, but I have an idea it wasn't a normal everday object or occurance. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-06-12T00:00:00,,

This was about 8:47.  When I continued to look at it, it changed shapes again and I little kind of another alien ship came out of the bigger alien ship.  They were, what it looked like to me firing at each other.  I say this because they continued to shoot beams at each other.  My kids were frightfully scared because they saw the beams hit the ground and they thought they were going to get hit.   These six minutes seemed to last a life time.  They seemed like they were there for more like thirty minutes.  After they were done fighting they crashed into each other and as they fell from the sky the alien ships seemed to disintegrate into thin air.As the alien ships were falling from the air they made a distinct high pitch ringing noise that was one of the loudest sounds I have ever heard in my life.  After this was all over I looked up into the sky, it was very dark outside.  When this ended it was about 8:53.  There was a kind of streak that was looked to be left from the descending alien ships.

It had no wings and I could see the outline clearly. I was filled with a sense of foreboding but hoped as it came out of the cloud it would be something recognizable. As it came out of the cloud, it was still a rectangular shadow! It did not make sense to see a shadow on blue sky but I have no other description. It made no sound. It made me very afraid and then I realized there was a line of cars waiting for me to move and I had to look away. This shadow object was very scary and I almost started crying.

Out of ALL those stars, I look RIGHT AT THE ONE STAR [LIGHT?] THAT TURNED OFF! Just like a light bulb. Weird. I didn't notice anything strange about the star, until it went out. There were other stars around this one, but it was the brightest star in that small cluster. What are the odds of that? There's a small airport nearby, but I heard NO engines. This light DIDN'T move and it seemed to be in space, NOT within the atmosphere. Two seconds of observation isnt long enough to get detail on the object other than star like. I stood there listening and watching for any sign of an aircraft strobes and lights, but I saw and heard nothing.

Left Fargo, ND at 4:45 pm for meeting in marshall, MN ealrler postponed that day due to winter storm warnings.   Took I-29 south, at approximtely 1845 hrs topped the ""buffalo ridge"" and was travelling along the Waubay nat'l Wildlife refuge.  Shortly thereafter a large antenna field used by the US NAVY had its antennae strobes on, the weather was much better above on the ridge than towards north down the ridge to Peever, SD.   Sky was 20% cloudy but extremely windy and with a -35 degree fahrenheit temperature (the reason I know this is that the interior of that cars windows will begin to fog and ice up about 1 inch down and around the sides; at -40 they are completely iced over in side the car) the sky was partially clear, able to see some stars.   I was in the process of passing a slow semi-truck when I got neck and neck with him on I-29.   I thought the driver was asleep but instead saw he was slowing down, I discerned he was looking at something, so I glanced in the same direction West by Southwest.     The appeared to be the reflection in the strobes of a very large aircraft over the antenna field.  The reflection revealed at first a shiny silver surface, possibly the side or bottom of a fusilage but this 'craft' was moving extremely slow and was huge, at least 100 ft in length.   As I finished passing the semi-truck, under several near instantaneous bursts of the antenna strobes  the was a 3-4 blue then purple colored lights which revealed the top of the 'craft', was slightly flat and the bottom was curved.   Severl seconds later, there was an intense flash from the object, while the strobes that blinked were blinking were bright this flash was like a welders arc, I mean damned near blinding if it had not been for the extremely short time of the burst.    I saw trhe trucker flashe his lights at me and put his cab light on pointing to the west at the antenna field.   I heard a loud thunderous bang, similar to hearing a heavy metal object fall like at a foundry or steel mill, only muffed by the dista! nce and wind.  I got off at the US Route 12 exit going across I-29 to the Conoco truckstop.    It was approximately 7:15 pm when I got because I pulled up to a pump and topped my gas tank off.    I told the attendant, a woman what I saw, that an airplane exploded in the air.   She said that i ought to call the sherrifs department, just then the trucker came in and went through the same story with the cashier.    After I phoned in what I saw so di the trucker.   The dispatcher said there was a depuites car in the area.    The Sherriffs depty came in at 7:35 pm, his car was spotless, as was his uniform and overall appearance; HE did not have a South Dakota accent.  As  the trucker and I were giving our  statements a rancher and his wife came in all excited about the the loud explosion and huge plane that fell.    When I explained to the Sherriffs Deputy that I saw no flames or crash on the gound-the rancher said he did not know the Sherriffs deputy cutting into our conversation.   The trucker and ranchers wife asked where he was from and he got flustered becasue as it turned out the uniform and car were recognized as belonging the the local sherroiffs department , the cashier was listening all of this we were the only people at the truck stop and the cashier spoke that the deputy was not from around here, he said eh would explain once he got our statements, later explained that he was on loan from near Aberdeen, SD.    Once we gave our statements he said that we saw a satellite re-entering the earths atomosphere.   For being a Sherriffs Deputy he unusually well informed, he said we would be contacted by the USAF after giving our name, age and phone number (he noted the sex of each of us, independently of his questioning).    I do not remember the daqte of the phone call but it was mid February, ""an official representative of the US Air Force told me I saw a satellite re-entering the earths atomosphere"".   I was also told not go to any newspapers or media, the tone was not of a threat but practically a dare!   This! the fir st time that I have seen this website.  I am not loony, I have a Ph.D. am an Eagle Scout and was going through my old financial files when I stumbled upon an old expense report with some notes of what I saw attached to it.  To this day I do not if the 'craft' I saw was a satellite re-entering  the earths atomosphere, a military plane crash or a ""flying saucer"" badly in need of a tune up.   However, I know a coverup when I see one.   I checked on the Sherriffs Deputy, later found out he did not even exist, know one matching name or description was on any Sherriffs department in the area, this I did on my own.   The sherriffs department did not even have a record of the dispatch after iasked further.   Who in the hell was that Sherriff's deputy?  What was going on with that flying craft?   Why in one of the most severe and dangerous winter storms?   Why were there not more people at the Truck Stop? ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date of incident apparently are precise.

First off, I have about 10 years behind a telescope, and do plenty of CCD imaging, and have seen everything from Weather balloons and satellites, to Venus in all phases and although I never had a chance to image anything unusual, I have seen plenty of oddities that I couldn't explain. My trip to Cancun prompted me to take a look at the night time sky and see a whole new bunch of constellations, and when my wife and I were walking the beach, I noticed 3 or 4 points of lights, very much starlike, but moving in such a crazy fashion at 90 degree angles and at light streaking speed, notice I said light streaking, because that was exactly what I saw, dispelling any possibility of a ground based beam of light pointing upward. They left a streak like tail when they moved. They danced among each other, there may have been more, but I was focusing in one area. They also seemed to move 3 dimensionally upward, another thing hard to duplicate with ground based lights. There was no sound, no other color, just a white point of light.. I have seen laser shows, but I have never seen a white laser, unless the goverment has these, but as far as I know Green and red are the only ones.... These also definately weren't satellites, those move in deliberate slow paths, one direction, no change in direction... Some people will say, you saw a meteorite. Meteorites also move in a streaking fashion, and other than one bouncing and skipping along the outer atmosphere, they too move pretty much in one direction, and last for at most 3 or 4 seconds where most last a few tenths of a second. I would say I was pretty amazed at what it was, because I like to think at least I have a clue on this subject, and not try to pass off a badly focused Venus as a UFO. There are many hoaxes I see that are easily explained, like pulsating ufos in video cameras. Unless manually focused to infinity, just about all cameras will make Venus or any bright star pulsate, and give it an orangish glow. Bet you will rarely see a video of a ufo with a tree or house for reference in view, I saw one on the news and it was Venus, it moved in unison with the tree in the front yard, and the person tried to say it was a UFO, and the journalist who did the story got an earful from me. He says, it was right there for 3 hours, then it was gone... Low in the southwest sky, big tip off right there. In any case, what I saw was pretty obvious, and though I don't intentionally look for Ufo's, I do know that what I saw in Cancun was far beyond anything I had ever seen before. I also mentioned this to a few people in Cancun, and my Dive instructor says he see'e them all the time when out doing night dives, away from the localized light pollution. That's why I assume there could have been many more.\ Based on comparison with area stars these points of moving lights were around 3rd magnitude. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The company I was employed by had a rather large Government contract to build the first fully atonamous UAV.  Over a two year period others involved had seen strange metallic balls during the day and red orbs at dust during the course of the program.  My personal experience took place on night while we were planning to launch the vehical.  My flight crew duties that evening was OB1 (ground observer 1), I was tasked with driving a Hummer (Hum V) on a specified course while the plane would lock on and track me while driving with various systems we were developing.  I and our chase acft. had just cleared the crew for take off when I noticed a light at eye level out in a field to the left of the hangar and runway. The light sort of wiggled and then disappered as I asked one of the other pilots with me in the hummer if he had seen it.  He responded by saying see what, of course it was gone and I just blew it off, when suddenly the light appeared agian and I once again said to my freind what is that when simultaneously a huge what looked like lazer light very white almost blue colored shot out in a giant fan configuration such as maybe a giant scanner.  I remember the light slowly crossing the two GCS's (Ground Control Stations) and eventually slowly scanning everything on the filed with one slow mechanized sweep.  When it finally got to us my partner had ducked under the dash of the Hum v and was trying to stay out of the scanner? If that is what it was, I thought well it can't be harmful so I held on to the steering wheel and let it scann me, I don't think it did any perminant damage, but it was very interesting it closed after it past us and it wiggleda bit and disappeared.  My freind and I were the only two to see it because we were the only two facing it, although it did scann everyone on the field.

Then the one on the left silently took off in a zigzag to the left at about 150 MPH, which is something boats can't do. The other two just vanished a few minutes later.

At approximately 12:30am (early sunday morning) June 30, a bright white object proceeded in a flash, much like that of a ""shooting star"" or an object burning up in our atmosphere.  The object was seen coming from the west, in an upward direction and then disappeared briefly.  Then to our surprise, the object reappeared and began to move at a high rate of speed over our heads, flashing on and off at equal intervals of approximately 1 second on and 1 second off, in a straight line in a south-east direction over Mary Lake in near the town of Huntsville in the Muskoka region of southern Ontario, Canada. The flashing on and off of the object was observed as a streak of intensely bright light in the sky, indicating a high rate of speed.  It was very cloudy and the only bright object in the night sky was the planet Venus.  This object had a light intensity that was much higher than that of any star or planet in the sky; I would equate it to the light intensity of a full moon on a clear night, concentrated at a single point streaking across the sky. As the object passed directly over our position, it became much brighter, suggesting it would have been only a few thousand feet above us (not any higher than a commercial airliner would fly) The object flashed on and off about 4 or 5 times before reaching beyond the other side of the lake just above the treeline and lowering in light intensity (as the object was seen just above the treeline, this was a greater indication of the low altitude).  The object then immediately flashed and streaked in a west direction at an angle that appeared to be less than 90 degrees. The object did not have time to slow down, nor did it appear to slow down when it immediately changed direction approximately 1 second later and moved east (in the opposite direction) at a high rate of speed.  The object then made yet another immediate change in direction approximately 1 second later, streaking across the sky, just above the treeline in a west direction.  It then made one final immediate change in direction approximately 1 second later, streaking east and then dissappearing below the tree line following this final streak of light. The only possible explanation of what was seen as the object flashed east and then west four times in immediate succession would be four completely different meteors entering our atmosphere at equal intervals of time, in alternating directions and with the same angle of incidence into our atmosphere (as the object moved or ""streaked"" back and forth at incredible speeds it seemed to retrace its previous path; in other words, the streak of light created was always parallel with the surface of the earth and the same height above the treeline).  The possibility of this object infact being multiple meteors in the specific formations witnessed is an extremely unprobable occurrance, thereby strongly suggesting that this object was not of this earth or of any physical phenomena that we could scientifically explain.",2002-07-26T00:00:00,45.3334,-79.2163

It was a very clear night and I was out in my parents back garden watching the stars with 2 friends. We were actually talking about strange things we had seen in the sky over the past few years. I had only told them both about a time when I woke up at approximately 03.30 and for some reason went to the window of my bedroom and looked up to the left of my window and saw 3 very bright lights flash in the sky one after the other in a trianglular space apart. They were about as bright and large as a street light if it was about 100 metres away in the night. One flashe dthen a second later another and then another. I thought it was pretty mad and tried walking my girlfriend incase it happened again but nothing happened after that. So this night a few weeks back I was telling my friends this story. I know this sounds like pure bull buts it honestly isn't. I had told them my story and it was about 20 minutes later and I was facing both of them talking, when from roughly the same spot in the sky the same type of yellowy bright lights flashed again. Again they were from a north easterly direction and seemed to be the same distance apart. This time however there was only 2 of them. To give some idea of distance they were about the length of a standard pen apart if you held it at arms length from you and looked at the sky. There was no particular shape that I could make out.

I am a air freight pilot that flies smaller, twin-engined aircraft at night. I am building experience to fly for the airlines. I saw something strange on my way out of Kansas City International Airport the other night, July 2nd, delivering my load of freight. I have ALWAYS been one of skeptism and thought UFO's were bogus lies from people with nothing better to do....until now....... I saw a solid oval, NO blinking lights, or colored lights, moving rapidly across the sky from EAST to WEST. I've seen thousands of satelites before and I know for sure this was NOT a satelite. Why?? Because this object was about the size of a dime moving across my windscreen/windshield. Also, it travelled from directly overhead (where I intially saw it on climb-out), to slightly above the horizon (about 1 thumbs width with your arm stretched outward) before I lost it in the haze. The object travelled this total distance in less than 3 minutes time. My estimate - 250 to 300 miles. It had a soft, medium, white silouette light which illuminated the entire object. I was climbing out of 4500 feet at the time......my guess was that the object was in excess of 50,000 feet. I inquired with ATC, to see if I had any potential conflicting traffic, he panned his radar out to include all altitudes, and then he said nothing was on his scope execpt for ""a few low altitude targets that were in bound to K.C. International."" The ATC controller and I both laughed a bit over the frequency about it and then nothing was said. It has been at the front of my mind, each day, since I saw the object.",2002-07-26T00:00:00,39.100835139760406,-94.56447929264118

I immediately ran to my deck (I was at home)--I also noticed many neighbors on their decks.

There was absolutely nothing. I mean --this sounded like a freight train--like a jet was about to crash directly into us, like it was flying just right over head---the only time I've ever heard anything HALF this loud was in NYC on 9/11 (I was about a mile away from ground zero)--so I just don't understand what it was.  There was no plane in the sky--there was NOTHING in the sky for miles around.  We all looked and looked.

This siting occurred on Besant Road, in Miners Oaks, a part of Ojai, CA at approximately 10 p.m. in the evening on May 27th, 2002, Memorial Day. Weather conditions were quite clear, beautiful stars and a nearly full moon just rising.  There was some humidity in the atmosphere that gave a slight halo to the moon, as well as to the object of interest soon to appear. My girlfriend and I took an evening walk, looking at the stars, waking east, with the moon just peaking through the silhouettes of trees ahead and to the right a few degrees.  We were discussing the large amount of water/ice just discovered on mars. I was just commenting about how the prospect of life on other planets would affect many people's religious beliefs and how it would shake up the world …when my girlfriend called out for me to look up …and said that she had just seen a big pulse of light! I looked and saw a very bright star or planet, brighter that any object in the sky with the exception of the moon.  It had a small visible halo, the only planet besides the moon that did, and was basically a very brilliant single white or yellow/white light.  There was no blinking or movement. At first I thought maybe this was the ISS reflecting or a possibly very large satellite. From the time I saw it, the light sat frozen in place for what seemed at least 5 seconds, then suddenly it began to move.  Its intensity began to dim quickly, the halo vanished, and then it then appeared more similar to a satellite in motion, except that it reduced in size very quickly, so quickly that in approximately than 5 seconds it was gone completely. To the eye it appeared to be going away very fast from the earth's surface. Specifically, I was facing east and the object was positioned overhead and forward some, maybe 10 degrees East from directly overhead and slightly to my left or North, surrounded by a group of stationary stars. It moved diagonally toward my right and forward or in a generally southeast direction slightly, and at the same time outward very fast. It was positioned near a small cluster of stars, maybe three or four fairly bright ones, but none comparing to it in intensity.  They were my reference for the object's motion. The total length of its movement in the horizontal plane appeared to be less than 10 degrees while the movement outward appeared infinite.

It was a clear sunny day aside from a lot of glare and haze. I had some fairly dark shades on (sunglasses) as did Charles. I was looking at the spot where the suns corona was flaring out from behind the beam and saw a white spot fly at a very rapid speed from south to north in a straight line it appeared to be at a higher elevation than all the jetliners in view and moved many times faster in apparent speed. I was sort of stunned but wasnt sure if i really saw what i saw, then a moment later another object on a similar trajectory moved from the apparent position of the sun across the sky from south to north. At this point my friend asked what was going on and i told him to sit in the same position with the sun occluded and tell me what if anything he sees. sure enough over the next few minutes we saw another four objects like the first two one of which was on a curved trajectory angling from south to a north west direction. The apparent size visually was the size of a BB held at arms length with a well defined shape the color appeared white. i want to point out that if we took off out shades the glare in the sky was such that it would have been impossible to see anything at all.

The fireball broke apart into ""three, flaming-orange chunks"" northeast of our position on I-25. A friend and I were returning from Denver to Colorado Springs after attending the Colorado Avalanche vs. Ottawa Senators game. We were driving on I-25, headed South. The night was relatively clear and brisk. The temperature was about 20 deg F and there was fairly extensive snow cover along the interstate. I also believe the moon was prominent on this night because it was unusually light outside for the hour. My friend and I were talking and listening to the radio when, all of a sudden, all hell broke loose. The ENTIRE sky, from the Front Range to the eastern horizon, erupted with a pulsating, incredibly bright, white light.  Due to the steep angle at which the object approached us, its speed, and it's approximately S-SW to N-NE flight path (which roughly paralleled our path on I-25), we were unable to observe it directly. In other words, the roof of our vehicle was in the way of our view. However, as the object travelled NE and neared the ground, it came into view out the drivers side window. We then observed the object break apart into 3, flaming-orange chunks to our NE just beyond a series of bluffs (about 5 miles away I would guess), at which point it disappeared. We heard no sound during this event, probably because of engine/road noise and because the car stereo was on. I hate to say this, but my absolute, first thought when I saw the pulsing light was that we were being abducted or attacked by a UFO. My second thought was that there was no way it was lightening (too cold, wrong time of year, clear skies, no storms around, etc, etc.). My third thought was ""someone get this damned roof out of my way so I can see what the hell is going on!"". And then, I finally realized that it must have been a meteorite which broke apart into at least 3 large pieces. Needless to say, this event was all my friend and I talked about the rest of the way back to Colorado Springs. Once we got to town, we started hearing radio reports regarding what we had witnessed. Apparently, it was a meteorite, complete with sonic bo! om heard all along the Front Range.

They appeared to have no single light. They glowed. On 3/11/98 at 10:03pm cst, my wife and myself were standing in our back(south-facing)yard, in the southwest side of Colorado Springs, Colorado. It was clear, moon nearly full, calm wind, 20 degrees. I looked to the west at about 30 degrees above the horizon at a group of stars to the north of Orion. As I turned back to face my wife something caught my attention inn the corner of my eye. I thought that it was a star cluster I had at first overlooked yet, there seemed to be movement. I turned to the west to squarely look at the object and discovered it to be moving at a steady rate of speed and altitude, from south to north. A path which came directly over Cheyenne Mountain and continued along the front range mountains until I could not see it any longer due to houses, etc.. When I first noticed that it was a moving object, I brought it to my wife's attention. She too percieved the same U.F.O.. At first sight it appeared to be a single chevron or delta winged configuration. However,the object consisted of seven cylindrical sections. Each cylinder tapered to nearly a point on each end. One in the lead with three others on each side. They were of a consistant grayish tone with perhaps a slight aura around each one. It was impossible to estimate the size or speed. First impressions were of a craft the size of a B-52 at about 5,000 feet, cruising at a speed consistant with approaching an airport for landing. Although, it easily could have been much larger and at considerably higher altitude. It was completely silent. There were no external lights. Preconceptions of aircraft flying with their wings perpendicular to the ground, at first, gave the impression that this was also true for this group of objects. Although it may have been a formation stacked vertically. I don't know. I'm suggesting this because of the moon light at the time. The color of the objects were consistent with moon glow reflection. A reflection which seems unlikely if the craft were side by side with one another. The overall shape of the seven objects appeared to have little or no foreshortening, which I would expect from the angle,if they were flying horizontal, side by side. I don't know. The entire event was 10-15 seconds long. At about 6 seconds into the event, the upper or eastern three objects broke formation for about 1 to 2 seconds before regrouping as they origonally were. The break in formation was rather wave-like in it's movement. The first object from the middle, moved first, away from the center object and slightly forward. With the next two objects moving outward slightly. And the outer- most object moving slightly further apart still. Then they all reversed the sequence to resume the original formation.

At first iI thought it was a airplane but then it moved from side to side and then it got as small as a star then it got bigger again.  it started to move away so i walked down to the end of the street to get a better look at it.  The light started to get bigger and bigger and i started to make out the shape of what it looked like.  As it got closer to me i started to run away.  It was shining 4 or 5 spot lights around were i was but just for about 3 sec. then it was following me and then it crossed {behinde me which was the road i was standing on} it looked like a top hat but all the coners were cut of like if u take a square and off a coner of it, and it had just to lines for the door going from the bottom of it to the top.  It also had little windows around the whole thing.  As i looked at it as i was running it was coming down on a angle.  it was about a 100 feet from the tree tops. It had lights all around the whole ship and one on the top of the ship. As it got closer it had a mist of the color cyan around it.  As I ran back to my house with my dog i noticed i couldn't see it anymore because the trees were in the way.  When i got back to my house I told my dad what happened.  We went looking outside my dad saw the bright yellow light in the distance and it was heading north then dissapeared.  I have attached a picture that i have drawn of what i saw.  I would like to know if u had any pictures that looked like this one and if there was any other ufo sightings in that areaaround that time.

Between 23:50 & 0:20 on 04/25-26/98, my brother and I observed a peculiar object moving around in the southern sky, approx. 40 degrees above the horizon.  The object was seen with the naked eye and 7x35 binoculars.  It was a dull red, more of a glow than an actual color.  it had an apparent length of maybe .25-.5 inches.  The shape was like that of a disk seen almost edge on.  The object was symetrical, appearing fuzzy at the edges, and the center was more focused and somewhat brighter.  These details were seen only through the binoculars, not the naked eye.  It maintained the same color and shape and orientation in the sky (meaning the object's flat shape stayed flat relative to the earth's surface, horizontal, never vertical or whatever).  It moved towards the north slightly, maybe only a few degrees.  As seen through the binoculars, the object hovered at times and jiggled or moved only slightly.  Then around midnight the object abruptly moved to the southeast, almost 45 degrees, where it stayed for about a minute, then quickly moved back to where it was before in the south.  I had a difficult time following the object due to it moving so fast.  It stayed around 35-45 degrees above the horizon.  The stars in the background (in the binoculars) were very out of focus, meaning the object was close to us, how close, it's difficult to say, a few hundred feet or thousands of feet, I don't know.  The object moved out of focus twice, causing me to adjust the focus of the binoculars.  It appeared to move closer, slightly growing in size, then back, all within a minutes time.  Then around 0:20, it dissapeared. I was a physics major in college, and I do a little amateur astronomy as a hobby, so I know the difference b/w a star or an airplane or a meteor or whatever and what it was that I saw.  I really have no clue as to what it was, but by it's motion and shape, it was NOT man made or some natural phenomenon.  The weather conditions were good, a little haze around the horizon, but clear otherwise.  So we had no trouble seeing the thing.  I am nearsighted, that's why I could not see it without the binoculars, but my brother has better vision than I, and he could see it quite well w/o aid.  My brother is 15 and I am 21.  We live in a rural area, so there are no extranious lights or other sundry things around that could ever be mistaken for a ufo.  Airplanes do come over our area quite frequently, but at high altitudes.   Because we see planes as often as we do, we definately know the difference b/w one and what we saw.  Plus, the object didn't blink like the lights on a plane do.  Or move in a specific pattern, either.  Simply moved around and glowed the same shade of dull red the whole time, staying in the same general area, except when it moved over to the southeast.",2002-09-19T00:00:00,34.0697,-83.1111

It suddenly was joined, in apparent tandem flight, by another object of the same size except this second object was blinking.

The second object with a blinking light was much smaller than any high-flying airplane. There was no jet sound; the night was quite quiet.

I believe it was Phoenix.  Anyways the orange lights all appeared in a line across the city.  After the ordeal the military came out with there own statement saying they were flares I believe. The ufo footage was taken by a gentleman from his house. Amazing as it may seem I saw the same colored lights that night in Monterey, CA. It was around 9:30 pm. On my way back home from class I was driving east on Highway 68 near the Monterey Airport.  The night was clear with no moon.  While looking off to the southeast I saw what appeared to be two stars of orange color. However, they were moving together at a fixed speed while I was driving. I lossed them for a few seconds in the trees and then there was only one.  As I drove further passed the airport the orange light kept on a straight path at a moderate speed. It looked like the UFO was flying at the speed of a small plane.  While driving about a mile east of the airport I was right under the UFO. The light did not change course nor was it landing at the Monterey Airport. It kept right on its path going north-northwest of the airport. Now you are wondering why this is interesting and if there is any truth to this. Well one interesting clue about the UFO is the lights. The UFO did not depict the normal aircraft light pattern on an airplane. No wingtip lights were visible or flashing. Nor was there any headlights visible through the entire experience. The object(s) were a round soft orange color. They looked so much like a star at first that you could have easily assumed they were. Another thing when I drove under the object it still was orange all the way around. Still no wingtip lights were visible.  In addition, normally when an aircraft passes you at night it should be dark from the rear since the headlights are pointed in the direction of flight. Anyone think this is not a normal aircraft?",2002-10-28T00:00:00,36.38391818181818,-121.84402222222222

We noticed this light come up from the ground in a northerly direction.  The light was quite faint and obviously about 7-10 miles away. (The reason it caught our eye was because there had been a lot of police helicopters in the area, the weeks prior to it due to a rising crime rate.  Knowing that if it was a police helicopter and it came overhead they would probably call the ground troops to get us out of the locked park) The light went from side to side and up and down and we still thought it was a helicopter.  Then suddenly two more lights rose from the ground and the first one shot up at a tremendous speed.  The other two start moving eratically too, so we carried on observing for at least an hour, some of the lights disappeared, but as soon as they did another few came from the ground.  By now we had ruled out a helicopter and maybe thought it could have been a Harrier jump jet. Some of the brighter lights had smaller lights shooting out of them at very fast speeds, then flying upwards and disappearing.  There was also on only two occasions a blue searchlight type light beamed down to the ground in a cone shape.  However this light was ommited from absoltely nothing and quite some distance from the moving white lihts. Suddenly one of the white lights got really bright as if it were pointing towards us. So we paid attention to that one, it started moving slowly to the right and then stopped after it had got considerably closer to us.  It stayed hovering for about 2-3 minutes then jumped upwards, darted downwards and from side to side.  That then made us realise that this was no conventional aircraft of any known kind. The light then got even brighter and started moving in our direction, as it got closer we could see that it had two round shaped bright headlight type lights at the front and flashing red and green lights on the bottom.  The carft did move as if it was finding it difficult, tilting from side to side.  It was about 100ft above the ground as it passed over our head so we got a real good look, it was a shiney dark yellowy coloured matchbox type shape, with a pyramid or roof shape on its underside, the flashing green and red lights were on the peaks of the roof shape.  There was no sound apart from a strange wering sound. BUT To top it off as it past over our heads it morphed into a green tailed and green passenger window lit 747 at the same height off the ground(around 100-200 ft), a plane at that height makes a massive amount of noise but there was still none. Once the UFO had changed shape it gained altitude and almost completly disappeared within seconds. We bothed looked at each other and were speachless, also as we walked home there were thousands upon thousands of white star lights in the sky moving around almost like the underside of the spaceship in Independence Day the Movie.

We both worked at the galleria.  It was kind of an over cast day with sunlight.  The clouds were towards the north east.   We were talking like we usually do when I noticed something in the sky.  I said to my buddy ""look up there"" and pointed.  I said to him ""what the hell is that"".  not in an alarming sense but just curiousity.  I happened to swear a lot at the time.  we botth watched it for about maybe 8 minutes.  then it moved a lot closer and fast. Based on watching  helicopters from the local national guard unit  and also watching airplanes flying to and from the local airport, I had and idea of the relative altitudes those vehicles flew at. and also how long it took to get from one point in the sky to another at their respectful altitudes.   Well  this thing  was flying higher than a helicopter.  but not as high as an airplane.  It was maybe flying at 2 times the height of a typical helicopter flight.  Anyways it covered a distance of maybe 5 to 8 miles in about a second.  Oh before it moved closer it was just sitting there.  anyways,  I said ((deleted)) and my buddy said ""damn!"".  we never saw anything move that fast in our lives.  We continued to stare at it.  I started to  make jokes by saying aloud ""hey aliens over here!!"" :)   Well it was easier to see the object now.  It stood out among the dark clouds when the sun was shining on it.  The way it looked was like highly polished aluminum.  You know like wheels on a car or a polished stainless steel muffler.  Being that it was so visibly define,  I noticed that it appeared to be rotating. not the very top of it just the middle hull.  I think it  was rotating counter clockwise.  Anyways we watched it for about 2 more minutes.  Then i heard the door at the entrance of the mall. We were standing outside one of the interior corridor doors.  Well i looked over to see who was coming out ( just out of natural human curiousity). After i glanced over I immediately returned my focus to where the o! bject ha d been in the sky.  I asked my buddy where it was.  He said that he didn't know.  He was watching it the whole time even during the time I looked away.  He said that it just dissapeared.  We've told some people about it.  Some just laugh at us and think we are silly.  Other people know we wouldn't lie to them but are still skeptical or just dismiss it.  I would be skeptical about such things myself until I would actually witness such a thing.  And that day I did witness such a thing.  There have been three anomalys in the sky that I have seen in my life.  Two were at night.  one of those i don't remember.  Another friend of mine told me about it cause he was with me.  It happened about 10 years ago.  When we both seen this light in the sky and it moved irratically.  The other time i seen somthing at night was another light.  This white light was higher than an airplane and it moved from horizon to horizon in about 30 seconds.   The long story I wrote here  was the first time I saw anythiing weird in the daytime.  My father in-law is a truck driver.  he has made a delivery or 2 to the research facilities near the mall.  He only told me of this after i told him what me and my buddy had seen.  He said they have some shady things going on there.   So, if the thing we saw was an alien craft or a man made research project, I'll never know.  But what we saw that day was definitely nothing I have ever  witnessed before. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD))",2002-10-28T00:00:00,40.31809857142857,-78.90465428571429

I was sitting with my wife in an open restaurant. I was facing east. The moon was at half-moon stage and at about 45 degrees from the horizon. There were no noticeable clouds in the sky. At exactly 22.00 hrs [local time] I suddenly saw 3 lights travel from south to north in the sky. They were bluish in colour and seemed luminiscient. The light was not flashing but rather glowing. The lights were in a triangular formation with a large one at the front and two smaller ones at the back. They did not move individually but seemed to be in perfect formation. They passed just below the level of the moon. There was no sound at all. They seemed to just glide at a very high speed. The sightinglasted about 12 seconds and I just managed to show it to my wife too. I did not discuss this with anyone except a friend who  believes likewise. This incident was then reported in a local newspaper. It also stated that there were reports from people from a town about 270 km away of having same sighting at exactly same time. The airport of my town has the airstrip aligned in east-westerly direction. So most aircrafts coming in to land come in low from a south-westerly approach. Also the restaurant is about six kilometers away from the airport so the incoming aircraft is low enough to see the sign on its tail. I have never seen a aircraft go from south to north before. Also there are no flights at the specific time. And since I am a fairly regular customer of that restaurant and prefer the same seat I am aware of flights passing in and and out over my head. I 39 years old. My wife is 38. Together we manage a Kindergarten and Primary School. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)),2002-10-28T00:00:00,,

The sphere didn't seem too large, we thought maybe it was some sort of weather balloon or small blimp.  It was stationary for maybe 10 seconds then it took off very quickly in a straight line heading south eventually dissappearing  into the horizon over downtown LA.  It moved in the direction the wind was blowing so we didn't think too much of it at first, though it did seem to move much faster & in a much more of a  straight line than would be possible by mere power of the wind.  Then about 30 seconds later, an identical one appeared & repeated the same pattern.  This continued for several minutes.  All in all, we saw 5-6 of these spheres do the exact same thing & in what seemed like a precise pattern & timing.  It was very curious indeed.  I didn't think to report it until now.  I just saw an online news blurb about UFO's in which there was a photo of an incident in Arizona about 5 years ago that looked somewhat similar to what my friend and I saw last year.

I never liked to tell the story because people looked at me as if I were crazy. The only reason I feel compelled to write about it now is because I happened to watch the show Sightings yesterday and I saw something that made my hair stand on end! Here is my story: I was coming home from a date with my boyfriend on a spring night in 1985. It was around 9:30pm. We lived in a rural area of Ashland, Ohio and were driving down a country road to get to my house. When we first left his house, we both noticed a big orange light in the left corner of the windshield. It was much bigger than a star but smaller than the moon. We were very curious but continued to drive and observe it. We both had the distinct feeling of being watched...It did not seem to move and remained in the same spot for at least 2-3 miles. Suddenly out of nowhere, it moved just as fast as lightning..until it was directly over our car. I can tell you that there is no plane in this world that can move as quickly as this object did. At this point, my boyfriend decided to stop the car to see it more closely..we stopped on top of a hill and this object was right over the car...It came down slowly and the lights consumed our whole car, the neighboring fields and the road...It was probably the size of half a football field. It was shaped like a triangle and had lights at each corner. It also had a light coming down from the center of the bottom of the craft. We stood there frozen on the road for what seems like an eternity as this thing just hovered over us. There was absolutely no sound or wind whatsoever. Then, just as quickly as it appeared, it shot straight up into the clouds. All you could see where lights disappearing in the clouds. This is my story and I am finally glad to get it off my chest. I am not crazy and I know what I saw. There is no mistaking something that is no farther than the top of a rooftop. What I saw on Sightings was exactly what I saw that night in 1985.",2002-09-13T00:00:00,41.0168,-82.3228

I was heading home from a visit to my sister in Long Beach, Long Island, and I was travelling due north on the Bronx River Parkway into Westchester. As I pulled around the 180 degree turn off the north bound Bronx River Parkway(while facing due south for a moment), I immediately saw what at first seemed like jet far to south over the congested sprawl of the Bronx. As I to continued due west on the Cross County Parkway, I could spot the usual lights of other planes; as the N.Y. metro area has lots of air traffic.  I couldn't help but notice viewing this same object to the south as it was getting closer and seemed to be travelling approximately in the same direction as I. It looked at first like a horizontal line of lights; as a large well lit jumbo jet; I said to myself, ""gee,  wouldn't it be great if that were a UFO"". As I continued on the Cross County Parkway west, I could see it was gaining on me, and our path's were intersecting. When decending down the hill to where the Cross County joins the Saw Mill Parkway, I was startled as I looked up to see, getting closer and closer from my car window, an object about 1000 feet up that was a flat, black rectangle with six groups of lights configured  in a triangular pattern. The six groups of multi-colored lights were symmetrically placed in rows that were evenly spaced along this football field sized rectanglar object. 2 groups in the front, 2 in the middle, and 2 in the rear; spread out and disernable as groups. Each group of lights was of a slightly different tint or color, mostly whiteish with some being pinkish or reddish. It was generally an overcast night with some low level visibility which explains why I could have seen it so far away at first. I distinctly remember that it was also a moonless night. The large rectangular shape was clearly defined against the muddy low cloud cover as illuminated by the omnipresent static greenish-pink urban glow. This thing was not a group of planes or a blimp. It was a solid rectanular platform, and I descibed it to others as being easily as big as a football field. It also struck me odd that it was completely silent. I estimated that it was travelling at about 60 MPH as I slowed my car to almost a stop  with my head sticking out the window looking up in amazment. There were other cars slowing down and pulling to the shoulder to watch it also. As my route north up the Saw Mill Parkway was heading directly in it's trail, I watched as it travelled northwest diagonally over Yonkers with it's distinct 6 red rear lights stretching it's stern width. I don't think it was moving much faster than a car, as I visually followed it's path over the low land valley of Yonkers over the ridge while towards the Hudson River. This is a very hilly ares with multple views, even the far horizon of the palisades with it's famous FM tower to the west. I quickly manuvered through the back street and up the hill to my destination as I was on my way to my grandparent's  house which sits high on a hill, and commands a great view of the Hudson River, Palisades and the Hudson valley to the north. The six 6 red lights across it's stern were clearly visible for at least 20 minutes as it cruised north up over the Hudson. The next day the local paper had some story about a ""UFO"" or ""Strange Lights"" observed by numerous people. I was confused by the story, because it seemed un-related to me as the people interviewed  described it as being ""greenish in color"". Also, I found it strange that the news story mentioned that the sighting location was over the vicinity of the town of Ardsley; which is further northeast. I've told this story to a lot of people over the years, and I'm telling it to you the same way.  I can remember this incident as vividly as if it had happened yesterday and I swear it to be true. I always assumed that it was some ""U.S. government"" flying platform possibly on it's way the the Air force field at Newburg  N.Y. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in October 1987 is approximate.

It was as if it was pulsing bigger and smaller towards us and then away from us. We both ran away into the house and I remember before I ran indoors I got on another fence to check if what I was seeing was real. I started to cry when I saw it from this view and ran indoors. We told our parents to come out to see it and after about 2 minutes after we had convinced them to come to have a look the red light in the sky had gone and was nowhere to be seen.

My windows where down and no sound of a engine where heard.I have always wanted to believe in ufos but could not untill I saw one as for my wife she never did believe,now there is no question.This my first and only sighting and report.This was not a distant light nor any craft capabale of flight known to modern avation as far as I know it.The craft crossed the road again in front of us and we watched it slowly go out of sight.

The sky was full of clouds which gave us a good idea of how low they were, and the wind was blowing fierce enough to push anything around that might have been floating...but these things weren't moving at all.  We couldn't believe that nobody else was pulling over to watch these things.  There was a trucker about 100 yards ahead of us that had pulled over, but that was it.  Eventually, two of the lights moved off to the right over a field while the other one remained stationary over the interstate (we were in the south bound lanes by the way). As the two lights began moving over this field they began dropping some kind of glowing red objects.  The objects would fade out before they hit the ground but they continued to drop them at a rate of about 2-3 per minute and did this for about 10 minutes.  Then they stopped and the one hovering obove the freeway joined them and they moved north and up until they were above the clouds.  That was the most amazing thing I have ever seen and I wish I would have had a camera on me.  All my friends who saw it freaked out to the point of denial, trying to make up excuses as to what they could have been.  One guy even convinced himself that they were parachuters with some kind of fan that kept them aloft and could move them in any direction they desired.

WHERE. Mahogany Hammock, Florida has a boardwalk trail popular with hikers and bird watchers. There is a large parking area which is also very popular with local astronomers during 'new moon' weekends. The land is flat with groups of trees being the only things sticking up here and there. (see park map at www.nps.gov/ever/map.htm) WHO. Approx. 25 people where in the Mahogany Hammock parking area during this sighting although I am not sure if only a half dozen people actually saw it. The rectangular shaped parking area's longest sides run on about east/west orientation, my wife and I were set up on the north side near center with our 12.5"" and 8"" inch telescopes. Observing conditions were clear and steady, visibility unlimited, very dark, no moon, an excellent and cool nite. Everyone was busy observing or photographing Messier or NGC objects.  The usual lone observer, mingling small groups, and muted conversations were all evident. By the way, dark adapted eyes are needed for deep-sky 'visual' observations such as nebulae, distant galaxy clusters, etc. and no white lights were allowed. Only very dim red flashlights were seen around the area.  I should mention that deep-sky observers avoid viewing the planets since their brightness will ruin 'dark adaptation' for a long time. If by accident anyone opens a car door and white light is seen...angry screams always follow! Dark adaptation is guarded by all. Anyway, it was one of those perfect nights you rarely get...especially on the weekend...so everyone was head down into sky charts or squinting into eyepieces on their quests to log as many objects as possible on their personal observing ""hit lists""! I came to believe this is one reason why only a few of us saw the craft or were even interested enough to look at it! I still can't believe only a few of us said anything about it. Thankfully, my wife was there. We both saw it, and this fact has made my homelife easier as I probably would never mention it if I would have been alone. I mean people think you are crazy or something, you know, because of all the official 'denial' going on about these things. Anyway, please excuse my ramble, but it does point out the irony that this happened to people who know the sky and know what is up there! WHAT. The details as I remember them. Sometime around midnite I heard a man's voice to the west of me say, ""There's something flying over there!""  So I looked about due west and also saw this bright object hovering just over the trees about a 1/2 mile away. It may have actually came up out of the trees we don't know for sure. At first glance it was bright with orangish/goldish color. At second glance, a few seconds later, there were no navigation lights, no strobe lights, no sound! It was a glowing disk and it wasn't flying in the sense of 'aerodynamic' flight. As a former private pilot I am aware of the factors of flight: when lift and thrust overcome weight and drag anything will fly. Also, the FAA regulations require red (left) and green (right) nav lights on the wingtips and white strobes and all aircraft. This disk was a 'craft' but it was not flying. Floating along through our atmosphere in spite of gravity is a better description (than flying). As an amateur astronomer, I can tell you this was not Venus, not Jupiter, not the Moon and not swamp gas. It was a low level sighting of a craft that was moving about 10 mph. We observed it for about 12 minutes or so until the trees obscured it as it slowly disappeared to the south of us in the direction of Flamingo, FL. I should mention that it changed direction twice. I first saw it above the trees to our west. It was heading east, at us. Then it slowly headed ESE just missing us to the south of our position and only about 1/4 mile or less away. This was our best view as it remained just above the nearby treeline for the length of the parking lot. I quickly lowered my telescope enough to catch a glimpse, but the focuser didn't move enough to focus clearly at this short distance and the guide scope was a Telrad which has no magnification. However, we could easily see, with just our eyes, that the basic shape was a slightly domed disc looking about twice as wide as it was high. It had its own colorful luminosity yet it was metallic looking, sleek and strangely beautiful I thought. My guess at the time was 30 feet diameter craft and about 16 feet high with the domed part being on top.   We were on the north side of the parking area and so we had the best angle of view over the trees to the south. This may also explain why the people in the other parts of the parking area didn't or couldn't see it. As I am writing this, I am thinking this may be the biggest reason why not everyone saw it. Also, it is interesting that being among many astronomers that nobody, including myself, hollered out for everyone to 'check this thing out'...fear of ridicule probably..or disbelief at what we were looking at... who knows why!  So, by the time it was passing close along the treeline in front of us, I knew this was no airplane, no blimp, no balloon. Oddly, at the same time, there was a small private plane flying (I flew Cessnas) a few miles away to our right and we could hear its engine and see the navigation lights and strobe but the disk shaped craft that was gliding by us was much closer and was not making a sound! Eventually, the disk turned south and went out of my sight. It somewhat paralleled the park road that leads past West Lake and then to Flamingo, FL. My last view of it was when I was standing on the bumper of my van and stre! tching t o see it go behind the distant treeline several miles away. It was at a very low level at that time also. TIME. Feb 1989 PS. It is funny but we never thought or talked about this sighting for many years. No special reason why. It's just that...you know...you have to get up the next day and go to work, and put the kids through college and all that. So it goes into the back of your mind for later recall if needed. Since then, but only recently, I have been reading up on the UFO topic. When I heard an interview with Travis Walton and Mike Rodgers, it hit me that the description of the craft they saw in 1975 sounds identical to what we saw in 1989 and I just wanted to put it in writing. I realize that this is an old sighting but I just wanted to add my two cents and say, ""I know they are out there!"", period. Thanks, and keep up the good work.",2002-11-04T00:00:00,,

This is an update to my earlier report on the same object(s).  After speaking with my friend who was also present at the time of my sighting, she believes the date was more around 1989.  The weather was warm enough that we were not wearing jackets. We wre just leaving my parents home and were joking about the UFO reports that had been in the news lately.  When one of us looked up we were shocked to see the very thing we had just been joking about.  As stated before, the object moved from the south-eastern sky towards the north-western sky.  It was low flying, slow moving and utterly silent.  All lights were white and remained so for the duration of our sigthing.  They were led by a single light, trailed by a 4-5 other lights forming a 'V' shape.  No apparent craft shape could be seen, only the somewhat hazy lights.  The object was below cloud level and flew directly over our heads and seemed very large.  My friends guessed about as wide as the width of a football field.  As it passed over us, it continued straight and steady on its course then the lights proceeded to go out in what appeared to be a random order.  As soon as the lights were out, we had no idea where it went.  ~ Less than 20 minutes later this same evening, my friend and her parents reported the exact same thing happening again.  She lived at the time about 3 blocks west of the original sighting.  She told me it was of the same shape, size and light patterns and moving in the same way and the same direction as the sighting we had shared.  ~ Later reports in the newpapers claimed that officials said that helicoptors or military craft was in the area at that time and that is what everyone was seeing.  Helicopters flying in formation seemed to be the primary explanations, which I don't buy for a minute.  Silent, low-flying helicopters?  I don't think so.

I saw a very, very, bright light, so bright the only thing I could imagine was a chrome jet or airplane , reflecting the sun in a very freak fashion.  Definitely bigger than a landing light apporoximately at 45degrees from the Southern horizon.  I thought it was a plane, but it was strange enought to pull off the road.  I watched as traffic sped by , everyone in a scurry going to work or holiday shopping.  The craft turned, the light was gone, but it just didn't look like an airplane, jet, but yet flew as if it could be.  The light was sooo big for the plane or craft to be so far off, that I wouldn't even ID it within a minute.  I watched it travel off on a Northwesterly direction, but still couldn't discern a clear image of a conventional aircraft.  I then was told by a friend that all planes are painted.  Whatever it was cause a very bright white ball, and if it was a glint from the sun, it was a very freakish event.  I am saying it was a UFO in nature to me.  Wish I had the camcorder.

One of them was a bit larger than the other and it looked like it was red colored.

I looked carefully if the objects could be connected to the ground, but I couldn't see that it was the case. If the objects really were standing up there, it cannot have been objects from our earth.

I was on a Delta AL flight from Dallas to New Orleans, climbing out of DFX over the eastern suburbs of Dallas.  I was seated well aft of the wing on the starboard side of the plane with a clear view of the ground.  I noted a light shining on the ground at about our 4 oclock position.  I at first thought it was a police helicopter shining it's searchlight on the ground.  It was traveling in essentially the same direction and speed as our plane (B737-800).  I suspected it may be a light from our aircraft, but eliminated that possibility when the light went under some scud...and the scud was back-lit.  It would reappear on the next opening in the scud. That happened several times.  We were in clear areas for long periods of time when it would look like it would do zig zags at right angles to our path and then return to the same direction as our path.  None of these manuevers were in tune with aircraft attitude changes, except for it's general direction.  I called it to the attention of a man seated next to me and he too followed it's progress and witnessed it going under a thunderstorm cell and reappearing on the other side of the cell as we passed by.  He too had no possible explanations for the light.  Once in a while it would flare out to a wider area like a flashlight being raised slightly, but most of the time it gave the appearance of a cars headlight shining down a wooded road..with the flashing as trees obstructed it.  The squared nature of its movements would also give the impression of a car going on checkered board roads.  But, we were now moving at a ground speed of 525+mph and at 30,000+ft.  The light would not be as bright going through towns, but one could follow it's progress through them in the same general direction and occasional zig zag.  It would appear more brightly out in the open country.  We came upon a real strong band of thunder storms and the light went under them and except for one break was not sighted again on the flight.  Clouds obscured the ground on the descent into MSY, ! but when the ground did appear, the light was not there again.  All in all, probably the most interesting flight of a flight filled life.  The thunderstorm band was spectacular, it was the night of the devastating tornados just NE of our flight path. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the passengers witnessed.  If the report is accurate that more than one passenger witnessed the alleged light, and that it did, in fact, disappear behind clouds, then it could not have been a reflection from the inside of the aircraft.  Had it been a daylight flight, a possible explanation of the sighting might have been the phenomenon known as ""Broca's Spot,"" in which a spot is seen on the ground where the plane's shadow is cast, but this phenomenon does not occur at night, obviously.  We are confused by this one.  PD))",2002-11-20T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

I was staring in the sky when I went out to smoke a cig in the yard, and then, probably in the southern part of the skies I have suddenly saw a strange thing - it looked as if a new star in the sky has lighted up. Maybe this star was there in the sky already for millions of years, so I thought then that this might be only some kind of mispercepcion of the eye. But then, this ""new star"" gradually started to become more and more bright. I could even hear the sound of it - it was something like a humming sound of mid-frequencies, but it gave me an impression like this sound is very far away - or should I say - this sound was like a plane sounding, but very far and contextual. On the other hand, this sound was very interesting, even relaxing and somehow hypnotising - maybe it was only because I like minimalistic music style. OK, it doesn't matter for now. The next thing that happened, was even more strange - it was really something. This ""new star"" - after it reached some kind of certain level of brightness - started moving - or floating - in the sky. I don't know how to explain in the words, but this view was really fascinating. But the most amazing thing - it was the figure, that this star has drawn in the sky (it left no trails, no nothing). this figure was that of a question mark - like this - ?, but with no point at the bottom. after making such a figure, it started to become less and less bright (i.e. the reverse process of the beginning has started) untill it has reached the same level of brightness as in the beginning, and went back to its place - the place in the sky, where it has appeared (or maybe it did not appeared - I don't know). But then, the thing happened, that really shaked me - this little star, after going to its place - actually was in one of the three corners of bigger triangle in the sky - i.e. in each corne! r of thi s triangle there was a star, although, there were no lines, no nothingwhich was connecting those corners. So, after all the thing that I saw, could be named as the ""spy, sent out for investigation from the corner of the triangle in the sky, the origin of which - I am 1000% sure - was xtraterrestrial.",2002-11-20T00:00:00,,

I was walking outside to get the morning paper, and I looked up to admire the stars in a clear sky. I saw a flash or light that appeared to be at a very high altitude. The light would flash rather brightly every 1-2 seconds, as the object moved across the sky at a very high rate of speed. The object flew in a straight path with no unnusual maneuvers. What really got my attention was the intensity of the light flashing, and the high rate of speed of the object. I am a licensed commercial pilot, and I am familiar with the flight characteristics of both civilian and military aircraft, and I am not familiar with any aircraft that can travel at that rate of speed. The flash of light was different than the high intensity strobes you see on aircraft. It was more like a yellowish/red pulse. The object was not visable between flashes, but it was amazing the distance that the object traveled between flashes. The object traveled from the west to the east, and the trees finally obscured my vision. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))  Thank you for your interest. The object (light) was moving from the West to the East. The object appeared to travel in a straight path. The speed of this object makes me doubt that it was a satellite, or other debris in orbit. When I first saw the object as it flashed, I fixed my eyes towards that location as it disappeared. I was shocked to see it reappear much further away from where I had originally seen it. I have had two other unusual sightings in the past, so I am kind of keep an eye out for unusual activities in the sky. One of the sightings was in the 1980s when I used to fly a considerable amount. We were flying a Piper Navajo to Key west late in the afternoon and we witnessed an unknown craft of rather large proportions at 10000 feet. It was partially obscured by the clouds but seemed to be stationary. It was definitely not a Lenticular cloud. The sighting was very brief. The other sighting that I had was in 1997. I was traveling on Hwy 278 Near Savannah River Site in South Carolina when I saw a glowing object maneuver at low altitude at a slow steady speed, and abruptly shoot straight up into the sky. Again the sighting was very brief.  This about sums it up. Thank you for your attention. Regards,  ((name deleted)) ((END FOLLOW-UP))",2002-10-15T00:00:00,33.4584832733813,-82.04117769784173

I was not overly suspicious intially, however, when I walked past my large bedroom window nearly an hour later, the 3 objects were still ""in a holding pattern"" and had not moved much.  My curiosity took hold and I continued to watch these objects more closely, noticing slight vertical movement and some side to side, as well as a turning motion, detectable by a ""spot light"" appearance that was easy to follow.  You could visibly see the beam of light it cast on the tall pine trees, and other objects it hightlighted as the light moved around on the ground.  I made my husband, whom has aa pilot's license, take a look at what I was watching. He is comfortalble with his knowledge about aircraft and the type and colors of lights used and he was not sure what it was...??? He said, jokingly, maybe the Airforce has Stealth's out doing training missions, and decided not to let this mind go crazy with what he witnessed. These three objects also cast a large triangle ""spot -light"" image together, as well as alternating red and white flashing lights.  These objects continued to hover but noticeably moving about mainly an up and down pattern.  I couln't believe what I saw next.  It looked fairly close in proximity, however it was grounded"" or in the tree-line but definately not up in the air.  Viewing what I would describe as some kind of communicating, interacting, or transfering of energy, or light, or light source, electricity, or something.  They were responding only one at a time with the ""ground source"" with flashing, mirror like explosions of light with the ground source giving off an orangish, red but yet silvery strobe bright light that was visible for miles.  After this went on for 30 min or better, the object seemed playful in moving around a bit more in relevence to distance moving.  Then if slowly ascended into the southeast rising higher and higher, I was very amazed an unsure of what exactly I was wathching, and before I went to bed I took note of how the other 2 objects were still flashing and spinning slightly, and I noticed they had remained pretty stationary, with a slight pull towards the place of the prior object.  I wish I could have waited this whole ordeal out.… ((NUFORC Note:  We are baffled by this report.

A senior Malaysia Airports Berhad (MAB) officer said the revolving camera was focusing on the Terminal Two area at about 7.06pm when those monitoring the surveillance were caught by surprise by the object “flying” across the scene within seconds before disappearing from the screen. An immediate check with the radar station showed the object did not appear on their screen, except for a Malaysia Airlines (MAS) Fokker aircraft taking off three minutes earlier.

I don't know its altitude, but it took up half my windshield! first of all, i'd like to say i'm very excited to share my observations with this site(which i just discovered). In roughly august 2001, i was driving northbound on highway 53 through hermantown. when i got to the dopplar radar, my friend's dad(itting shotgun), pointed to a ""airplane"" on the left side of the road. i thought nothing of it at first, but then realized it was much too large to be a commercial jet and started watching it. the craft continued to cross the highway directly over my car. i stopped right on the highway(as other motorists sped by!) the craft took up over half my windshield relatively-wise and i saw it clear as day. the most striking characteristic to me was that the craft did not seem aerodynamic at all! it was like a triangle, blocky ship(like a triangle brick, very thick)ttom. it was not smooth and was covered in what i can only describe as""piping and ductwork"" this thing looked like it should just drop from the sky like a brick. it was equilateral with had a large white light on each corner and a blinking red light in the center.i got out of my car to listen and there was no noise. i know this thing landed just over the treeline, not more than 500 ft from hwy 53! it was right next to the ANG base(which is definitely in operation, by the way) on the right side of road by Pure Pleasures and the national weather service Dopplar station. this was the most exciting thing i have ever seen and it gave me newfound faith in the strength of the US military. if this thin could carry troops or tanks, it will change warfare forever. i watch the sky by hermantown everytime i drive by it; and i'm willing to bet this craft lands here every day around 10-1030. i have seen the light pattern numerous times(app. 4-5)n, but never anywhere near as close as my first sighting. this ship has enormous capabilities, possibly cloaking( in one daytime sighting, the ship seemed to be the same blue as the horizon, only the bright lights showing) it also moves very fast(one evening sighting, the tri-light pa! ttern wa s over the treetops traveling south parrallel with the highway seemed to kick it down and go really fast towards hermantown. this light pattern was as big as a nickle relatively speaking.) sorry if this message is too long, but i'm excited that theres an organization that studies this type of thing. i dont want to jeopardize national security, but this craft is real and I personally believe it is based out of the hermantown air national guard base. your investigators best time would be between 930-1030. there are numerous business parking lots right along the highway. If i owned a camcorder i'd be there already! i just wonder why this craft has been stationed up here so long(at least one year) i hope this information leads you to an equally as amazing sight as we were treated to.

I  got my girlfriend to get me fieldglasses and i had to adjust the focus quite a bit by then the object was far east an then the light speeded up considerable and vanished. I went back on to what i was doing (sorting out dirt and sand on a plastic container) and I dont know weather ten minutes or half an hour past i raised my head after hearing some people two adults and a few kids walking on the sidewalk in front of me saying look at those lights and I got up and there where 4 lights similar in size as the one I saw early, but this time they where comming from the west south of the texas line from the direction of the mountain towards and on top of juarez(not to high up but close tothe grownd maybee 100 to 200 feet up?) down town one after the other one maybe half a mile a apart from eachether and while they reach more or less the same point where the previous one passed by . they formed a square and then the one from the far and upper left and the one on the bottom right I think started distanciating from the other two creating a rombo (in spanish terms )or an square buth of irregular sides. while this was going of I focuss one of the lightswith the fieldglasses and after focussing the shape is like an yelloing orange shape bowl almost like dark burning object a total circle but at the shape of almost a half moon patern seems to apear like more solid shape. I did not have time to explored the other three because the kids close tome wanted to look at them too but they appear to be of the same size after geeting my glasses back I think regaing lookin at the same one and lost the other three the one in question kept goin east but now under american soil and straight east just south of freeway ten and norht of the rio grande. The moon was close to full and this thing was at the same height and very small compare tom the moon size but i can compare the size to alinner plane lights. after I no longer colud see the light at plain sight I steel was able to find it with my fieldglasses and it seems to be maintaining the same speed.

Faster than any bat or bird. It had a dim glow and pulsated and flew in a straight line. It made no sound. I was very excited and my heart was pounding. I knew what I saw. I ran into the house and told my wife that I just saw a ufo and to call my mother and tell her to get her cam-corder ready. (She lives next door.) When I went back outside, about 20 seconds after that sighting, I looked back to the exact spot where the ufo originated in the sky, and saw a bright light going the same direction as that ufo. It was a white light and it moved straight briefly then dropped down very quickly and came back up in a counter-clockwise movement and back to the point in the sky where it came from. both sightings combined lasted only about 2-5 minutes. It was just amazing. This is a genuine report. Although this is very odd, my wife has witnessed a daylight sighting of a trianglur shaped ufo at low altitude 2 years ago and my mother and 4 other witnesses saw a cigar shaped light type ufo around 1974.

Port Charlotte, Florida. On the night of October 9th, 2002, at about 11:45 EST, while walking the dog, I noticed a blue colored object moving across the sky very fast. There were no blinking lights or any other colors on the object, just a solid dull blue color. When I first noticed the object it was almost directly in my line of sight (I was basically looking straight ahead, then noticed it) and was at about 50º in the eastern sky. I really don't know how far away it was, but if I had to guess I would say it was maybe 2 miles away at an altitude of between 5,000 and 8,000 ft. This object was about the size of an asprin at arm's length. There were two commercial jets in the area at the time. One jet had passed directly over head about 30 to 45 seconds before I saw the object, at about 15,000 feet, if I had to guess. The other jet passed over about 45 seconds to a minute after I saw the object, at about 70º, and and altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. All three were headed in a southerly direction. More than likely both jets were headed to Southwest Florida International. This object did not leave any type of trail nor did it descend at any time; instead it kept a steady path across the sky, parallel to the ground. I could not hear any noise from the direction of the object, however the faint sound of the first jet that passed over could still be heard during the sighting. I could really appreciate the speed of the object when the second jet passed over. The jet seemed like it was just crawling across the sky compared to it. I was able to view the object for a total of about 6 to 8 seconds. The conditions were completely clear at the time. I really couldn't make out any definite form or shape but if I had to label the object as resembling any distinct shape, I would lean toward it being more ball shaped than anything else. It definitely did not appear cigar or tube shaped.",2002-11-16T00:00:00,26.98100661157025,-82.11690661157024

My 'window' of observation is rather confined because of large trees in the yard. The back of the house also blocks views to the west, as well.  In addition, clouds were just moving in from the northwest and beginning to obscure the sky. I did, however, have a good clear view of the sky immediately overhead with Vega shining brightly.  I decided to grab my binoculars and folding cot and enjoy the night air for a few minutes. I had just laid down and gotten comfortable when I noticed a 'star' of nearly the same magnitude as Vega and just to the southwest of it.  However, this star was moving.  I quickly put the 10x50 binoculars on it, but it still remained just a single bright point of light.  It was moving on roughly a south to north track at about the same speed most satellites move, but the unusual brightness suggested to me that this wasn't a conventional satellite.  I've observed the International Space Station pass overhead and it was comparable in brightness. As I watched the object move further north, it faded out as it moved behind the thickening cloud cover.  I quickly took note of the time and went online to www.heavens-above.com, a web site that provides orbital observation information on hundreds of space objects from the ISS to Russian space junk.  I found no objects that coincided with the time, magnitude [brightness] and track of this object that would have been visible from my location.

The BLT Research website is <www.bltresearch.com>.  PD)) A triple-ellipse ""thought-bubble"" crop formation found in  rural Gardiner, ME, investigated by BLT Research Team Inc. At about 2 am August 4th Witness #1, who had gotten up to get some water, observed a bright white flash of light followed by a small (perhaps flash-light sized) BOL down low over a hayfield across the street from her house.  The BOL bobbed around over the crop for several minutes, then seemed to come closer to her location, then ""went straight up in a beam of light"" and disappeared.  At approx. the same time a neighbor (Witness #2) whose house is approx. 75 yards away from the hayfield, got up because her dog was barking loudly and repeatedly; she observed that the dog was facing the hayfield as he continued to bark for about 5 minutes. Witnes #3 (the wife of the hayfield's owner), who lives several hundred yards distant, woke up sometime after 12 midnight and heard a strange ""metallic-type"" noise which lasted only a few moments:  ""I have never heard that kind of noise before."" At about noon on August 4th the hayfield owner's 16-year-old son went to visit his grandmother whose house is immediately adjacent to the hayfield and discovered the new crop circles.  The boy notified his mother and step-father, who called the local police; the officer who examined the field told the family that he did not think the circles were ""man-made"" and suggested they notify UFORC  ((National UFO Reporting Center--PD)), which they subsequently did. UFORC then notified the BLT Research Team Inc. of the event. On August 5, 2002, a BLT field-team arrived at the relatively rural location; both team members have investigated crop circles in the U.S. and in Europe, and one has extensive experience in many countries over 10 years.  A thorough examination of the circles and extensive interviews were carried out. The hayfield is on a dead-end street with perhaps 8 houses along it.  The field is about 2 acres in size and goes up-hill into a large, partially open area; the house of Witness #1 is immediately across the street from the field.  Witness #2's house is about the same distance away, but behind a row of trees which border the field on that side.  Three contiguous, flattened, ellipses were discovered in the lower (2-acre section) of the field, with their edges just touching, creating what crop circle researchers call a ""thought-bubble"" design. Largest ellipse was 65' at its widest point; middle circle was 35' at its widest point; smallest circle was 25' at its widest point.  The centers of all three ellipses were considerably off-center.  There was a slight curve to the overall design, perhaps 20 degrees. The plants (grasses and fescue with goldenrod, Queen Anne's Lace, clover and milkweed) were fairly gently laid over, with the thicker-stalked plants such as milkweed clearly showing bending at the base.  No broken stalks were found.  All plants were swirled clockwise and it could not be determined whether the swirls had begun in the centers or ended there.  The initial impression of the crop lay was of fluidity, with a clear undulating character to the flow of downed plants. The majority of the flattened plants were grasses (not the cereal crops most typically involved) and the stem nodes of these plants are so small that no real evaluation in the field can be made of stem-node change (such as elongated apical nodes and/or expulsion cavities in the lower plant stem nodes).  The only visible significant change in any of the flattened plants was the bending at the base of most of the larger-stalk plants, such as milkweed.  No plant or soil samples were taken in this case, largely because of the plant species involved. No compass deviations were noted inside the 3 ellipses and no cell-phone failures or camera malfunctions occurred.  A stop-watch check (where one stop-watch is left outside the formation and the other taken in with the field-team) revealed no time differences. Photographs taken with flash cameras the evening of the 5th in the now 2-day-old event produced multiple ""anomalous"" light phenomena (recorded on several different cameras) typical of those seen in flash photos taken at other crop circles around the world. The field-team's evaluation here leans toward this event being ""genuine"" (not mechanically produced) because of the following factors:  (1) Node-bending at the base of the thicker-stalked plants and no breakage at the base of any plants generally (especially the hay, which was dry and ready for harvest); (2) the fluidity of the overall crop lay, with at least two layers noted in several places; (3) the fact that all three downed areas were markedly elliptical, rather than circular; (4) the fact that all ellipse centers were markedly off-center; (5) the presence of a double-center in one ellipse; (6) the animal disturbance; (7) the eye-witness reports of unexplained light and noise phenomena at the same time during the night the formation occurred; (8) the remoteness of the location and our character-assessment of the people in the near vicinity.

I didn't trust what I was seeing with my own eyes. My husband and I were spending the night at the home of friends, in Keystone, Colorado.  This is a resort town in the mountains and because it's far from city lights the night sky was filled with stars against a pitch black sky.  I awoke about 4 in the morning and because it was chilly I decided to close a window.   I looked up at the sky and was in awe of the stars.  One particular star looked a little brighter than others so it caught my attention.  As I stared at what I thought was a star--I thought I saw it move.  I kept staring...and finally realized that it was moving...not a lot--but up and down and sideways.  Then shortly after fixing my sights on this ""star"" and noticing that it was moving--I saw a short burst of white light.  I kept staring and watched as every few minutes other short bursts came from this star--but not always from the same spot.  Sometimes to the right...sometimes to the left...sometimes above the ""star""--and occasionally (very occasionally) from further out to the side...further than most times.  My mind was racing for an explanation.  A UFO was not the first thing that came to mind.  Frankly--nothing came to mind other than sheer wonder.  So I sat down on the bed and just watched...for maybe 15 minutes.  Finally I thought I'd better wake my husband because he simply would not believe me if he didn't see for himself.  So I woke him up and got him to come to the window.  He also saw what I've just described but had no explanation.  Unfortunately he had taken a sleeping pill earlier and wasn't as thrilled with this discovery as I was...or as curious.  He went back to bed but I kept watching...and wondering.  After about 30 minutes I noticed something that took my breath away.  Another ""star"" of a lesser intensity was located directly below the one I had been watching...and it was moving IN TANDOM with the brighter ""star.""  Each moved slowly one way then another--up a  little then down a little.  So I started searching the sky for other ""stars"" that moved like these and found ! one more to the right.  It didn't move in tandom but it was moving just like the other two.  All three ""stars"" exhibited the light flashes I described earlier and in the same patterns.  Occasionally I thought perhaps I saw a red light but that's tough to tell for sure because I was staring for an hour at this display.  At one point I did see what I thought was a very fast ""shooting star"" to the left side of the two moving in tandom.  It's not that unusual to see a shooting star when the sky is that dark, but usually they don't move as quickly as this one.  And also, normally you can track them in the sky at a longer distance than what I saw.  This was so quick and short I questioned if I saw it at all--but I'm sure I did.  I sat there for about an hour all total--and I'm not sure what time it was although I'm guessing all this started about 4 in the morning. (It was so dark I couldn't find my watch and there was no clock in the guest room.)  Finally, the sky was starting to lighten with the rising sun so the ""stars"" were fading and so was I.  As much as I hated to, I went back to bed.  I told everyone in the morning what I saw and I was so grateful I had woken my husband to support my story.  (Not that no one would believe me, but my husband is a very respected, retired businessman.  Definitely ""no nonsense"" and not one to say he saw a UFO.  In fact, he still maintains there has to be some logical explanation.)  As for me, I'm 54 years old, and semi-retired.  I don't quite know what to think, but I know what I saw.  I've never said I believed in UFOs, but I've always left room for the possibility that it is possible.  In fact--when I returned from the mountains this afternoon, I went on-line to find a ""UFO Reporting"" site and this was the first time I've ever even typed in ""UFO"" on my computer.  It isn't something that interested me--until now.  So--that's my story and I'm sticking to it! ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the excellent report.  We believe that the first possibility to be addressed would be a celestial body, possibly a ""twinkling"" star.  PD))",2002-08-16T00:00:00,,

I then moved my eyes around the sky and noticed a second object to the right of the first only a few degrees higher. At this point I called over an acquaintance to verify what I was witnessing. She confirmed the two objects. I then looked around 20 degrees above these two objects and saw 3 more of the same type forming a triangular formation. At this point more people from the party I was attending observed all 5 objects for at least 7 or 8 minutes. They looked like period sized white dots appearing to be about 20 to 40 thousand feet above us. They all maintained a stationary position for the duration of the event. For a few moments both I and the first person to corroborate what I was seeing saw what appeared to be movement from all the objects as they continued to maintain their original stationary position, like a group of helicopters hovering above highway traffic. It appeared as if they had some sort of black second hand that extended out just partially beyond the white spherical body and move quickly back and forth from a zero to 10 second position, imagine each object to be the center of a clock and the moving part was a second hand quickly moving from zero to 10 back to zero repeating this pattern again and again for a few moments.

Also saw several shooting stars…very nice.  As the night wore on and into the early hours of the morning, I saw a number of satellites/orbital objects.  Characteristics:  very very dim, some fading in and out.  One object in particular caught my attention.  A very dim satellite/object moving near the zenith (top) of my field of view, slowly dimming even more, then suddenly, a relatively weak strobe (bluish light, same color as object), followed several seconds later by a very very bright strobe (astoundingly bright), followed by perhaps another several strobes of various intervals/intensities.  Object faded, and was very dim to begin with. I have seen beautiful satellites before which are apparently tumbling and reflecting the light back to me in the proper manner to give me a “light house” effect…that is a rare treat.  But a strobing satellite ?  Do some satellites come equipped w/ strobes ?  My thinking is a military spy satellite with a given wavelength HID strobe where a high gain can be applied to that wavelength to amplify the illuminated image relatively free of noise.  Another theory is just an ordinary function of satellites so a ground observer can do a quick and easy visual check to verify proper functioning of the satellite (in other words, just another cheap easy, fail safe check…why not).  My final theory is that it may be part of a function to freak out paranoid terrorists (and I DO HOPE it freaks them out!).  Any thoughts ?  This is the second time I have seen this sort of thing.  The first one I ever saw was just a bit after 9-11-01, and was observed over St. Paul, MN.  Looked like a satellite, and then one HUGE strobe flash (brighter than the one I saw over the lake).  These objects all looked like satellites to me.  Very dim, moving, tiny tiny stars, very difficult to see and follow.

One night this past April, a week after Easter, my friend and I were in Maui, Hawaii.  We had rented a Ford Mustang and were joyriding one humid evening after dinner.  We had been all over town, ate some pineapple, and were on our way home when we decided it was too early to turn in for the night and we kept on driving. We had the top down and the system up, listening to our favorite Usher song, as sped down the road.  For some reason, we turned down a road we were not very familiar with, and with each passing sign, we got a little more nervous.  It was an unlit rundown road with no other cars. We knew we were miles outside of town, but we didn’t care. We were having the time of our life until the road drastically began to narrow and we passed more peculiar signs, warning against trespassing.  Either we thought nothing of it or we were feeling brave that day, none the less we resumed our adventure to the lava flow and kept on driving. As she drove I was gazing at the stars. I shouted in excitement when  I saw the most amazing shooting star of my life. Like a jettisoned rocket it flung across the sky, and I quickly made a wish. It began to fade, then to my surprise the star didn’t burn out, but stopped suddenly, and went back in the direction it had come from.  The star got brighter and now my friend had stopped the car, and we both watched in amazement as this bright object flew across the Heavens.  It was the strangest thing I had ever seen.  What I had first thought was a beautiful star, had turned into a phenomenon.  My friend right away shrilled “ALIENS!” As soon as she said that, a bone chilling fear ran through my body.  The bright light came closer and closer and I was screaming for my friend to turn the car around and go home.  The road was so narrow that it took us a while to turn around, and now it was apparent that there was what appeared to be a large, oval spacecraft headed right towards us at incredible speeds. It made a loud humming noise and had bright lights in a sparatic pattern. The! lights were very bright and some were colored. My friend was so frightened and frozen in shock that she couldn’t drive. As it came in closer the engine of the car turned off. She frantically turned it back on. I was pushing her foot on the gas petal, and as the motor revved loudly the spacecraft neared. It hovered above us for about a mile, as she drove as fast as the car would go, and I thought I was going to die. But as we neared the town the spacecraft sped out of sight.

We we’re travelling eastbound on the downhill portion of I-44, with Forest  on the right and Lone Elk County Park on the left, a mile or two west of Peerless Park in southwest St. Louis County, Missouri. The sky was clear blue and cloudless, with a fair wind. My wife was driving our car.  She was looking upward through the car windshield and said to me, Look out your passenger-side window and tell me what you see.  All I could see out the passenger window was the close-in trees which is what I told her. She said that she saw a large (as big as a silver dollar held at arm’s length), round object that was dark gray with a silver reflective edge.  (The sun was slightly behind and to the right of our travel path at that point.)  She also said that she expected whatever it was to pass right over or in front of the car  from right to left and that I should watch the other side of the road (while she negotiated the interstate highway traffic) to see if I could see anything. Only a few seconds later, we were on the flat portion of I-44 with a break in the trees on the left/north side of the highway.  I immediately spotted a highly reflective, glaringly silver, object seemingly hovering in the distance.  The object was oblong about an inch long at arm’s length  and very thick.  It was much thicker (at least two or three times) than the fuselage of an airplane.  It had no appendages, or wings, at all. Since we we’re travelling at highway speed in the car, the object may have been moving at an equal pace in relation to the speed of the car.  However, I did not detect any movement on the object’s part in relation to the ground.  But, the object was well above the background scenery -- between 20- to 30-degrees in elevation, with clear blue sky all around it -- so there was no easy reference point. I only caught sight of the object for 2 or 3 seconds before an additional clump of trees obscured it from view.  It was only another couple of seconds before we passed that final clump of trees and the object was suddenly no where to be seen!  It was not seen again.  (Since she was paying attention to traffic, my wife was not able to look over in time to see the object that I saw on the north side of the highway.)

Oregon UFO Review Case:  Daytime cattle mutilation...same animal hit twice.,Christmas Valley,OR,2002-05-05T15:30:00,,,"Occurred : 5/5/2002 15:30  (Entered as : 05/05/02 15:30) Reported: 5/26/2002 12:09:51 AM 00:09 Posted: 6/12/2002 Location: Christmas Valley, OR Shape:  Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23020.html,"May 5, 2002 on a ranch about 15 miles south of Sand Springs, a 2400 pound bull worth $2,000 was found in a shallow crater not far from the water trough. His owner, Fritz Morrison had been at the water pump at 12:30 p.m. and his bull was laying beside the trough chewing his cud, seemingly well and content along with several cows. But when Fritz returned only three hours later at 3:30 to do more work at the pump, he found the bull dead, stiff and the left eye had been removed and was ""bubbling"" moistness from it. Fritz then returned home to retrieve a chain to pull the animal away from the side of the road so as he wouldn't have to look at it as he drove by each day. When he returned around 5:00 or 5:30, he found that a complete mutilation had occured on the dead bull while he was gone. The tongue had been excised deep within the throat, the testicles and shaft had been bloodlessly removed leaving penis stretched out on the ground, and the rectum was cored out. One ear was also missing.  Three days later, Keith Bumpass, Deputy Sheriff of the Lake County Oregon Sheriff's Office was contacted and an investigation was launched. Keith was put in contact with Dr. W.C. Levengood of BLT Research, a consultant for OUFOR. Dr.Levengood suggested looking on the animal for signs of small dark particles of dried blood. Although the bull was black, the Deputy Sheriff found a small amount around the rear of the animal. Those samples were sent to Dr.Levengood in Michigan and the results of the preliminary tests are that they are probably pure hemoglobin particles, indicating a processing of the blood had taken place during the mutilation process. Bovine Hemoglobin is a component of blood. The presence of hemoglobin indicates that a processing of the whole blood has occurred. The usual procedure for isolating hemoglobin from whole blood is rather complex. It involves separating red blood corpuscles from the lighter plasma components by centrifugation. The plasma is siphoned off and ether is added to the corpuscle paste, causing the cells to burst. Another centrifugation removes the ruptured cell envelopes and leaves a clear red solution of hemoglobin. With mutilated cows, every other component of the blood is totally disintegrated with the exception of the hemoglobin. It's turned into its elemental form. Assistant Director Eric Byler of OUFOR spoke with Deputy Sheriff Keith Bumpass the morning of May 21st and it now appears a second cow has been found. The Deputy Sheriff found the animal the day before and went out to take pictures and further investigate. He said that it appears that the animal had been dead for several weeks and it was thought that it probably went down around the same time as the first animal back on May 5, 2002. The cow also had all of the signs of a classic cattle mutilation including the tongue surgically removed at the base of the throat, the utters missing and the rectum cored out. Cattle mutilation expert and OUFOR investigator Jean Bilodeaux has been notified and will be workin!  g closel y with the Sheriff's department on further cattle finds in this area of South Eastern Oregon. Byler was also in contact with Colm Kelleher of The National Institute for Discovery Sciences and a top priority of securing a veterinarian to contract out with NIDS was discussed.  The owner has agreed to turn over any future Bovine to OUFOR that is found and verified as being alive 24 hours or less before being found. The animal will be brought back to Salem for extensive necropsy work as paid for and contracted out through NIDS. As a side note, we at OUFOR are very pleased and appreciative of the combined cooperative efforts of the many outstanding organizations who have come together to work this case as it unfolds. Those organizations include the exceptional data gathering talents of Linda Moulton Howe, Colm Kelleher of The National Institute for Discovery Sciences, Dr. W.C. Levengood of BLT Research, cattle mutilation expert and OUFOR team member Jean Bilodeaux, and most of all the work done by Keith Bumpass, Deputy Sheriff of the Lake County Oregon Sheriff's Office who took the incentive to ask all the right questions and sent samples to the right places. We look forward to working with this talented investigator for Lake County in case of future animal mutilations that may come within the next few months.

The craft moved silently down from the sky. It was very high up and moved far too quickly to be a plane. It stopped, and then moved around a bit more. We could now see that it was an oval shape and had blue and red lights round it. Out of nowhere another craft appeared, the same as the other one. They way it moved explained that it couldn't be any kind of our air transport. The two crafts stopped and hovered. They started flashing to each other; it looked like a kind of Morse code. Suddenly a beam of light shot between them both. It only lasted a fraction of a second. A third craft appeared. It also moved about a bit then sped of at a high speed until it got so fast we could not see it. The second craft did the same. We watched the first craft carefully as it zigged-zagged across the sky. It moved in a triangle shaped then moved quickly across the sky, accelerating as it went, then disappeared. We didn't know what to say to each other. We all decided to go home our separate ways. When I reached home, 10 mins later, my brother was in. He thought something was wrong, as I was as pale as a ghost. I explained and he believed me because I wrote down what happened and drew a picture of where the crafts were, my friends also did this and the stories matched.

To my best recollection, this event happened on the night of 9/11/99, around 7:00-7:30 pm.  I was 15 at the time and my mother was driving me to my dance class in a local town (we live in a rural area around it).  We had barely left home and were driving down the dirt road.  It was fully dark by now, and I don't think the moon was out that night. We were having a casual conversation, when I looked out the window to my right (direction was north)  I must have looked at exactly the right time, because I barely had to turn my body to see the amazing object travelling alongside the car.   From the ground it was about 35-40 degrees up, and couldnt have been more than 50 to 60 feet from the car.  It was close enough that I could see the outline of the dark surface against the sky, and it had 4-5 orange-yellow lights covering the hull.  It must have been travelling around the same speed as the car, because it seemed stationary even with our motion. (we were travelling east) The oval-saucer shaped object stayed alongside us for about a minute or so, then quickly the lights dimmed and it dissapeared as fast as it had came.   I ended up telling the story to my mom about 2 years later, since I have seen strange occurances off and on since then.  Most of these occured in the fall/winter months.

Suddenly, the entire group came from a very long distance to a position directly over us. They had to have covered 20 miles in a matter of seconds, and then came to a stop. They then split into 3 groups-3,3,1, and began swirling in circles. Then they spread out across our field of vision in the sky, and came back together suddenly. They then went back out over the ocean and came back again, then turning immediately north, and disappeared up the coastline. We were not under the influence of any alcohol or drugs, and the neighbors in the house next door witnessed the exact same event.

As I was looking at a blinking star vertically above my head, I picked up a shape mooving South west to North east. The object covered about half the sky during it's travel in about 4 to 5 seconds. It was more or less following the ST-Laurence river at about a mile from the shore. My first impression was of a plane at low altitude since it travelled quite rapidly (more common at low altitude about 1000 ft). The unusual shape and lack of sound convinced me that it was not a plane (I'll talk later about the shape). Then I tought it could be a few large birds. Again I could not see any wing moovement and at that time of night large birds do not fly in my area. The shape of the object was triangular with the tree corners glowing. The glow was 3 circular lights and were not bright. The glow from the light (not blinking) was not at the tip of the triangle but slightly inside. The object had no contrast or defined edges. I could tell it was triangular because the shape sometimes overlapped the surrounding stars (during it's travel) revealing the shape. Basically the dark triangular object with glowing circles travelled smoothly without a sound. The object travelled smoothly without stopping in the night. The size of the object was hard to define since it was not very bright and I did not know at what altitude it travelled. Hold 2 fingers one inch apart and hold your hand above your head, This was the approximate size of my observation of the object. I work in the aircraft industry and I know a lot about them.

The light appeared to be moving within the cloud because of the way the shadows shifted within and without the cloud.

For some strange reason, I never brought it up to the attention of my two friends who were still talking to each other.

This sighting happened when I was ten years old, my apartment window faced south towards the landing pattern of Laguardia airport in NY.  I was used to seeing the planes land at night and was familiar with the slow approaches from the south and the west to east patterns of planes landing.  I was also familiar with the airplanes turning in the final approach to the airport at night.   What I witnessed or thought I did was a disk shaped object with illuminated window panels and blinking red and blue lights on the outer edge of the object traveling east.  At first I thought it to be a blimp traveling west to east or an advertising plane - I had also seen these at night.  What struck me as strange was the speed, sort of a slow deliberate and perpendicular path that was too straight.  I witnessed this and thought the distance to be at least a half mile away which would make the object huge.   From my vantage point the object moved slowly and did not produce the jet sounds that I could make out from that distance that airplanes usually made.  I still thought it was a single blimp until it reached the far eastern edge of my view and another similar object entered my view from the east but moving in a gyroscopic fashion - at the same plane of the horizon and perpendicular direction.   I became excited as the first object stopped dead still and seemed to wait as the second object approached from the west.  It was too much for me to believe and I watched for several minutes (about three) before I left the window to get some water and regroup.   I returned to the window and to my surprise both of the objects had left the area, I remained watching for a long time but did not see them again.

It crossed our path on a diagonal, moving very slowly.  It continued (as best I am aware of) without any pauses. I stopped just because it caught my attention.  My mind raced to explain what I was seeing.  The best I've been able to come up with is a helicopter with an all-glass front that was illuminated so brightly from within that nothing was visible except the light. But this doesn't explain the hardest part to comprehend.  It made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I'm not sure of how long I stood there frozen in my tracks.  I could not move.  I was scared and wanted to run, but I could not move. Next, I was walking (not running) home again.  The last I saw it, it was directly overhead.  I did not turn back to see it once I could move again (which makes no sense to me at all).  I had no fear of ""it"" following me.  I fully remembered all of what I've written here; there was no amnesia of seeing this light.  The moon doesn't move that quickly across the sky and the fluidity of the movement (in my opinion) rules out anything like ""swamp gas."" ~~~~~~~~ I saw another light in the late 70s in Virginia; it was green, smaller, and higher in altitude.

I was sitting on the grass in the front yard our ranch-style home waiting to be picked up by friends to get an early start to go surfing. It was quite dark, as there were no street lights yet in this area, and our house did not yet have yard lights. I suddenly realized that there were none of the usual night sounds (crickets, far away dogs barking, etc.). It was so quiet in fact that I could hear the blood pumping in my ears. I was suddenly compelled to look up over my left shoulder in a northwesterly direction (I was sitting indian style, facing east).  My eyes rivited on circular black shape that blotted out the stars behind it. Its apparent size would be that of a 33 1/3 record album heald at arms length (large!).

We had not been drinking and I do not do drugs and I was a corporate executive in downtown LA at the time.  I entered the Pomona Fwy just east of the 605 Fwy at Hacienda.  I headed east looking to catch the Orange Fwy North to the San Bernardino Fwy.  i noticed as I got on the Fwy what looked like headlights or landing lights for a jet coming in and it seemed low to me.  The traffic started getting slow and I began to notice the lights closer to the fwy and wondered if not a plane going to LAX if could be lights for workmen or perhaps a movie being made, which is common in the LA area.  As I got close somewhere near the Orange Fwy connection what I was observing was a huge object with many lights on the bottom just hovering about 100 feet over the freeway.

The time of the year is approximate. Being that the only thing I can remember as far as the month would be arround September or possibly even October. The area I lived in was mostly farmland and the fields got plowed just before winter after the crops were harvested. I lived on route 2 Twin Falls,Idaho in a big two story home surrounded by bean and lettuce fields. It was arround 8 o'clock or so when my two brothers and myself went out to go clobber each other with dirt clots in the bean field just left of the house. The sun had just barely set wit hjust a hint of purple left in the sky. That was when the low hum and the mistlike clouds came. Kinda like a fog. We all looked up and saw a craft right above us in the field. It was about 100 feet or so high. Again this is an approximation, being I was only about 8 years old when this happened so it could have been lower. It had one main large light which made a beam shooting straight down. It didn't burn or make us feel weird or anything it was not brilliant. The beam was about the strength of a good maglite flashlite. There were off center on both sides of the light in the middle a row off smaller colored lights which changed color. We were in awe as I can remember just standing there looking at it. Off in the distance we heared sirens and soon we heard my Father pull up to the house in quite a hurry. We looked away from the craft to see our Father and the flashing lights comming down the road. When we looked back and I know it was very quickly looked back. The craft was gone. Now the strangest thing is that my Father saw this craft near the south hills as he was comming back from a customer sight, he leased farm equipement, he called the air force and they were chasing this thing. How it came to be coincidentally above us when he got home is odd. We do recall that there was some time loss because when we got back inside it was 10:45. We were not outside that long, there is just no way. The air force did investigate this sighting and questioned us and my Father the next day. I have yet to get any information from the air force on this investigation. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-05-14T00:00:00,42.433109230769226,-114.5794446153846

The pilot must have seen the disc about the same time, as the airliner made a sudden turn toward the starberd side, changing its course to a north direction.

Looking through binoculars, another male 65 years old, sighted small lights below the planet.

A fourth light came into view on the left, as if something were rotating.  Another female, 65, saw the lights through binoculars.  The lights seemed to be at approximately 20,000 ft.  The observers had been playing bridge in a mountain cabin, drinking only coffee; first observer had stepped outside for a breath of cool air, then called the others to come and see ""the bright light in the sky."" The four observers are retired from their professional fields: a teacher, a writer, a photographic processing lab owner, and a printing company owner.  The first to notice the ""bright light"" was able to see it with the naked eye.  The other three observers needed the binoculars to see the detail of three lights in a row.  One of the observers noticed that as the lights approached, a bright halogen-type beam of light seemed to be aimed down at the earth below from a point just above the three lights.  As the lights approached very high in the sky (approx. 20,000 ft) they seemed to move sideways several times as the binoculars moved...as though the lights and observer were somehow interacting.  This ""interaction"" was very brief---perhaps 20 seconds---and then the lights were gone.  Afterwards, all four observers talked about what they had seen.  The teacher saw something but felt the binoculars were too unsteady to say what she saw.  The retired owner of a printing company was the first to see the thrr horizontal lights, first with the naked eye, then with the binoculars.  The writer saw the lights approach and then the halogen-type spotlight, and then a fourth light appearing on the left of the other three, as though rotating into view.  The photo lab owner saw the horizontal lights but later decided they were just reflections on the lenses from two distant lights that illuminate the driveway in this otherwise pitch-black mountain setting in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

When it was over the field, there were two lights on top, and one in between the two on the bottom.  It made no noise and for some reason, it didn't really try to get away from me.

After realizing that it hadn't moved in the 5 minutes I examined it through binoculars and quickly called my roommate (who described the same thing).  See description below. After calling my roommate upstairs I stuck a pair of binoculars in his hands and, before telling him what I saw, I asked him to describe what it looked like to him.  Through the binoculars he saw five or six lights arranged in a compressed oval pattern.  Through the binculars each of these lights seemed rather faint, but with the naked eye it was very bright and impossible to miss the colors flashing between red, blue and white (the colors changed rapidly, more than a strobe light even).  To my surprise, he was seeing EXACTLY what I was seeing.  We watched it for about twenty minutes and, before we decided to give it a rest, what was originally five or six lights had become one -- perhaps whatever it was was moving farther away, although it seemed to hold the same position for the time we watched.  (I continued to watch it from my bed -- I'm in a loft and have a terrific view of the sky.) If I had to pinpoint an exact location of the light, I would place it at at least two miles away in the SW sky over Lake Michigan.  I'm on the North Side, so I guess that would put it parallel with the Lincoln Park/Gold Coast area.  It could easily have been overlooked by people on the ground, but once they saw it I guarantee it would have raised an eyebrow. I don't know what it was, but I definitely know what it wasn't.

The land over which it moved was flat delta, barren of trees and homes.  The object emitted bright pulsating light, flashing on and off every second or two. I (age 47, professional) was driving north on highway 49 having crossed the Mississippi River into Arkansas from Missouri.  My father (age 77) sat in the right passenger seat.  My mother (age 74) sat behind him.  It was a dark, clear night.  Stars were visible.  On either side of the road were flat delta rice fields.  I don't believe there were any trees.  No homes were in sight.  The road ahead was straight and flat.  I had a clear view ahead as far as the eye could see at night.  There were no headlights ahead.  Behind me I saw the distant headlights from a car far behind.  I noticed bright white flashing lights a few hundred yards ahead, up and to my right, somewhat higher than I might expect to find the tallest treetop.  My first thought, as I recollect, was that I was seeing a light tower.  I was really rather paying scant attention to it at the time.  At about the same time I first saw the object, my mother asked, ""What is that?""  I then noticed that the object was moving in the opposite direction in which we were headed.  I remember thinking that it must be a plane.  Again, my attention was not full; I was not particularly interested.  I watched as it flew by and out of sight.  I again directed my attention to the road ahead.  Then in the seconds that followed, for the first time I began to focus more intently on what I had just seen.  I turned back to see if I could catch sight of the object but I did not see it.  I thought then that my inability to see the object was due to the restricted view, limited to the back window and rear-view mirror.  As I gazed at the road ahead of me, the image of what I had seen sharpened.  I realized I had seen a large circular object with a panel of bright white light spaced evenly along its side.  The lights pulsated every second or two.  The object seemed to have a shell of bronze/silver metal.  This was the first time I had the thought that I had seen a ""UFO.""  I turned toward my mother and asked, ""What did you just see?""  She, too, described a large circular ob! ject with bright white lights around it.  My mother had a somewhat longer look at the object.  She watched the object move from the window to her right.  As she described it, she turned to her right to follow the object's flight when it suddenly disappeared.  Neither of us had heard sound.  What made this sighting especially intriguing to me is that my mother had seen this object.  Although I'd never before laid claim to observing a UFO, I do maintain an interest in the phenomenon.  My mother, on the other hand, has no interest in such things and would not believe in the possibility of UFOs and visitations (of course I realize that a UFO would not necessarily imply otherwordly objects).  My mother remains convinced that she did not see an airplane or other aircraft she might identify.  She was rather stunned in fact.  At home, later that evening, my mother and I drew what we had seen.  The drawings were essentially similar, the slight difference likely accountable to the different perspective in viewing.  I might add that my father did not observe anything unusual.  I attempted to account for that.  He said that he was neither asleep nor had his eyes closed, but I'm not certain of that.  I know, sadly, that my father has lost his sharpness of mind over the last several years (early stage dementia is suspected).  I also know that there was not any fuss as the event unfolded.  Other than my mother's simple question, ""What is that?"" no other words were spoken.  My father's attention was not called by these words.",2002-09-28T00:00:00,34.4797,-90.6977

I was sitting in a swing in my back yard, reading the newspaper. (There is a high 8 ft. fence on alley and next door house; garage and back of house make up other two sides). Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement of a light.  This light was about 3-4 inches in diameter, single light, moving in a slow circle; my left to my right side.  I looked up to see if there was an airplane/ helicopter, or anything shining into the backyard.  No!  I got up from the swing, and went to the top of 4 stairs to see if anyone was focussing a mirror into the backyard, or using a blashlight, or checking me out with binoculars.  No to the top of four stairs to see if someone (from the Condos across the alley) was focussing a mirror into the backyard, or using a flashlight or checking me out with binoculars.  No! I sat back down and watched this light move around in a slow circle, about 3 feet from the swing.  I watched for about 5-10 minutes.  What caught my interest is: at the time of the day, on daylight time, this part of the yard, garage are in shade.  This light then srarted out of it's circle -- going left to right, across a wooden trellis fencing on the side of the house (3 feet high) and continuing .  Then this light deviated and started back right to left, then changing back and I was focused on it totally, as this circle stopped at 2 of my potted plants, with herbs in them, and then continuing on.  What REALLY caught my interest was when this light started out of it's circle and begin to enter the open garage side door.  The light changed tactics and moved two feet of the left of this garage door, and two (2) prominent eyes shaped like oblong spheres, stopped and looked directly at me.  During this time of my concentration and these eyes looking at me I felt a sense of uneasiness, as if those eyese were assessing me.  I later said to myself....""It was like a Mexican Stand-off""!  I have no idea how long these eyes focused on me!  And suddenly the eyes, the light was gone!  I will say again, that this part of the garage/yard were in complete shade.  There is a rather large tree in the corner of this backyard that shades this area. About myself.  I am 72 years old, a college graduate, and a former teacher.  I have never particularly been interested in UFO's or read much about them.  I know what I saw, and I can't explain it.  I did take a copy of my email to my son, down to the local Fire Department.  I talked to the Assistant Fire Chief, and left a copy of my email to my son with him.  I have recently completed what is known as a class in ""Community Emergency Response Team"" which necessitated taking over a month's training in Disaster Preparedness, as one focus.  Unfortunately, after I had visited this Assistant Fire Chief, someone from that office, called my son, whose's telephone number was on his business email address.  Basically, the call was to alert my son, that I was ""spreading rumors about this town,and this person thought my son should know what I was doing!  The idead!  If I had listened to my son, and his bridge buddies (many of whom are former teachers in this town), I would have published that email in the local newspaper.

Again, as to the report of an eyewitness statement on the Rense.com site ""UFO Emits Light Beam Near Tyrone, PA"", I have no clue as to what this was. This took place 14 kilometres from the City, 2 kilometres from the major international airport. I am NOT a nutjob and I have a life. I had dropped my cousin back off at his house by the beach after a dinner party,  approx.3am. As he was unlocking the door and turning off the alarm I had gone around to the back of the building to empty a somewhat full bladder into the sand dunes. As I looked up at the stars (as you do) there appeared to be oval shaped glowing ball of gas within a kilometre away. It appeared to be about 100 metres across ( hard to tell ) and was very bright red/orange colour, about half a kilometre off the ground. At this stage I had blinked several times and looked from the sky to the ground and back again to check my eyesight. When I realised that it was actually there I yelled to my cousin to come and have a look outside. When he did, I directed his attention upward to which he yelled at the top of his voice ""What the hell is that?"" Within about one minute of us standing there watching this solidly defined shape, it emitted a very thin beam of light straight down from the middle of the object to the ground, (the focal point of the beam at this time was obscured to us by the sand dunes).  There was no sound at all. My cousin, gamer than I, scrambled up the sand dunes to see where the light beam was going/coming from? Originally we thought the beam was coming from ground. By the time my cousin had beckoned me up onto the dunes I noticed that the light was coming from the shape overhead as it ended on the beach sand with no accountable light source in sight. As we watched this oddly for about five minutes, the beam of light stopped abruptly and the once defined ball of gaseous orange/reddish thing slowly over a period of about thirty seconds, dissipated from sight. Again I state, big believer in we are not alone in the universe, ( considering its size), NOT a believer in little green men coming to visit us. I presume some form of  atmospheric gas occurrence is responsible, just what kind and how. Very very similar sounding to the gentleman's experience in Tyrone,PA.",2002-10-28T00:00:00,,

I am hoping perhaps someone here can shed some more light on this for us.  My son was driving through Pennsylvania with his co-driver.  Suddenly he noticed a black square in the sky.  It was like a black square hole in the sky.  It was not like a craft, but a ""hole"".  Clouds were moving past it, but it was not moving at all.  He had seen another of the ""holes"" in another state, but I can't remember which state it was.  It was all within days of each other.  About 2 years ago, another of my sons experienced a sighting of a rectangle box shape black ""fog"" crossing the highway he was diving on.  Several witnesses were present then because they all got out of their cars and watched this ""thing"" cross the highway.  It was approximately 3 to 3 and one half feet tall, and approximately 12 to 14 feet long.  It was lying on its side, floating across the highway.  People noticed that you could not see the lights from the cars through it.  This occured around 10:00PM (22:00) and was on Hwy. 69 South of Lufkin Texas.  At the same exact time, my sister was traveling on Hwy. 69 NORTH but was just about 15 miles south of Tyler Texas at the same time, and saw another one of these things crossing the highway there.  The exception in this case was that it was standing lengthwise and crossing a 4 lane highway, leaving the highway and traveling out of sight into a pasture.  This sighting happened at about the same exact time the other one did, but they were 85 to 100 miles apart.  Neither my son nor my sister told anyone else about the event, until they told me at different times.  I had to tell them about the other one seeing it too.

OFF IN THE DISTANCE, I SAW BLUE AND YELLOW FLASHING LIGHTS IN THE NORTH BOUND LANE. I FIGURED THIS TO BE AN ACCIDENT AT FIRST WITH THE FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL ON SCENE AND A WRECKER. (THE FHP HAS ONLY BLUE ON THIER LIGHT BARS, WHERE THE LOCAL POLICE HAS RED WHITE AND BLUE. THE WRECKERS USE A YELLOW LIGHT.) I THEN NOTICED THAT THEY WERE TRAVELING NORTHBOUND, WITH A HIGHWAY PATROL CAR IN FRONT AND BEHIND A SEMI TRACTOR PULLING AN EXTENDED FLATBED. THE SEMI TRACTOR HAD A YELLOW FLASHER ON TOP of it. THE VEHICLES WERE TRAVELING AT A RATE OF SPEED, THAT I GUESSED AT 75 TO 80 MPH. I THEN PASSED THE VEHICLES IN THE AREA OF BLANDING BLVD, WHICH IS AN AREA THAT IS WELL LIGHTED. THE SEMI WAS PULLING AN EXTENDED LOW BOY TYPE FLAT BED TRAILER WITH AN UNKNOWN CRAFT ON THE BACK OF IT. THE FRONT HALF OF IT WAS COVERED WITH A TARP THAT WAS LOOSLEY TIED AND WAS FLAPING LOUDLY AT THE TRAILING ENDS. FROM THE SHAPE OF THE TARP, THE FRONT APPEARED ARCHED LIKE A BOW ON BOTH ITS HOROZONTAL AND VERTICAL AXIS. IT THEN NARROWED ON ALL SIDES TO A FLATTEND ROUND MIDDLE AND THEN FLARED TO TWIN CIRCULAR RINGS(SIDE BY SIDE) THAT WERE APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET TALL BY 3 FEET LONG. THE OVERALL LENGTH IS PROBLY 65 FEET, AND IT WAS TAN IN COLOR. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO BE RESTING AT A 10 DEGREE ANGLE TO ONE SIDE.

STATUES PROVIDE THAT OBJECTS THAT NEED TO BE COVERED MUST BE SECURE. NORMALLY IF YOU SEE SOMTHING BEING HAULED WITH A TARP ON IT. THE TARP IS FASTENED DOWN SO AS NOT FLAP IN THE BREEZE. AND THIS TARP LOOKED OLD AND STAINED. 4. WHY COVER JUST THE FRONT OF IT? MY THOUGHTS I FELT THAT THIS WAS A CRAFT OF SORTS TO PROVIDE TRANSPORT. I FELT THAT THIS CRAFT WAS BEING HAULED AT NIGHT TO CONCEAL WHAT IT WAS. AND THAT THE TARP THROWN OVER THE FRONT OF IT WAS AN AFTER THOUGHT. THE TWIN RINGS APPEARED TO BE SOME TYPE OF PORT, AND APPEARED TO BE ON THE REAR END OF THE CRAFT. I DID NOT SEE ANY BLACKENING AROUND THESE REAR PORTS.

Someone might find this interesting or may have had a simular experience.My son turned 4yrs. on july 4, 1999. For about the last year he has been talking about the 'people up there' (while pointing upwards). At one time he was crying and saying he wanted his own body back that the people up there had taken. This continued for several days untill he said he got his body back. He has told my wife and I about the people sticking him in the back with needles and of rides in space ships. Of course this could be just a very good imagination except for something odd that has been happening lately. One morning about 4:00am he comes into our bedroom, climbs on the bed, opens the blinds at the head of our bed and starts waving and saying bye. I work night shift but this woke my wife up. He has also woke my wife up a couple times lately to talk about space ships or to ask her if the space ship is coming to get him. Always at 4:00am. One day while playing with my son my wife asked him! what he wanted to be when he grows up. He is very intelligent and knows what different people in different professions do, to an extent. He said he wasn't sure. She asked if he would like to be an astronaught and he informed her that he didn't need to do that because he already has a ship and that the 'people' are showing him how to fly it. We found this incredibly nerve wrecking because not long before we found out my wife was pregnant with him I had a very strange experience. Basically, I had a dream I was part of a 2 man crew piloting a 'UFO'. There were several things that were extremely wierd about this dream that made me wonder if it was really a dream. I told several people about it and of course they laughed about it. It was quite a good laugh for them until about 2 weeks later when the local news reported that there where a number of UFO sighting and abduction reports in the area I was living in during the past 3 weeks. I don't get laughed at much anymore about it! . The experience/dream I had was not of being abducted but of being a functioning member of a 'alien' crew like my son has been reporting to us. He doesn't give specific details of the ship or landing 'base/planet'like I remember. I just find this strange. If you know of a professional researcher who would like to know more about this please forward my e-mail address to him/her/them. Oh, the night he was born or the night after he was born, the local news showed a video by a local person of 5 UFO's appearing to land in the mountains close to us.",2002-09-13T00:00:00,36.32375334420881,-82.35638939641109

In the late 80's I lived next to a US Marine air base and helicopters were always flying overhead.  I dont mean the little news helipcopters but the but huge kind.  Super Stallions and some other kind.  Anyways, I first thought that it was a helicopter cause these werid lights where just hovering.   But I would be dammed if I couldnt hear the helicopter.  Once thing I remember about those big helicopters is you can hear them and feel them when they fly that low to the ground. I couldnt get a good fix on the shape of these lights because of trees and homes, but about 30-40 yards from my home I got a very very close look at this ""thing"".  I stopped the car, but kept the engine running and opening the window and I couldnt hear a thing, nothing silence except for the neighborhood dogs barking.  The object was no particular shape.  The closest we could come up with was the lights made it look like the letter ""T"" upside down. I turned the radio off and still nothing but silenec. By now my son, but now gave his full attention to this thing. We stared at this thing and we both remarked that it was nothing like we ever saw before.  My son kept saying it had to be a helicopter.  We were looking toward the northeast approx. 100 yards away from us and was flashing colored lights in not particular sequence.  After apprx 5 minutes a section of this ""thing"" separated from itself and kep! t hoveri ng while the main section took off in the sky toward the east.  Then after a moment or two the smaller of now 2 sections took off after the larger section.  We took on after it  and watched it move very fast across the sky and out of our vision.

Well, it was pretty weird and I feel even weirder talking about it. I wish I could remember the exact day and month, but I think is was in the middle or late part of June in 2001. My father brought it to my attention in our front yard. Facing north-north east and looking approximately 65 degrees up we were staring at a fairly large sphere that was orange/red in color. At first I thought it was a star in the early evening, but quickly brushed that aside when I saw other stars near it. They were basically dwarfed in size. I am familiar with the sky in that area as having lived there for many years and watched the stars and meteor showers with my father over the years. soon my mother joined us. I ran to get my fathers binoculars and when I came back, our neighbors had pulled up and jokingly asked if we were trying to find aliens. When we pointed to the sky, the neigbor ran inside to get HIS binoculars and him, his wife, and my family all wached it for almost an hour. It did not move, nor did it change color, yet at the end of the hour, it quickly faded away (while looking through the binoculars, it was an intense bright, hot orange/red and as it faded it shimmered a shade of sliver....maybe the sun relecting off a craft???). It was not a reflection of the sunset off a star, as I have often watched the sky over the years and previously noted that the stars in the rest of the sky were quite small in size in comparison (I have always been intrigued by astronomy and took several classes in college). I have no clue what this was, but there were 5 adults watching this ""phenomenon"".... one ex military, one working in media, one school teacher and 2 nurses.

I had just taken a picture of a commercial jet travelling west to either Perth or Adelaide simply because I liked the look of the vapour trail. I started watching two feathers floating in the air. They were joined by a spider web and meandered about on the very light breeze. There was not a cloud in the sky. I then spotted what I thought was another white feather or possibly a thistle down floating in the same vicinity. The quite odd thing about this object was that it wasn't floating about aimlessly like a wind born object, it was going dead straight from west to east across the sky. It was difficult to focus on because it was a fair distance away. I stared at it for a few seconds before realizing that I'd better take a picture. I moved out onto the lawn I took one photograph despite the size and distance. As I stared at it longer it diminished in size and eventually stopped eastward movement. I realized that it was heading directly upward from my position at this stage. It's movement was possibly an arc from the point I first observed the object to the point that it disappeared from view directly above me. It made no noise. Left no trail. It appeared to be round in shape with no wings. The object is too small to discern properly, it's obscure to say the least.

I was watching two Navy Jets (trainers orange/white) practice formation flying and then begin to dog fight.  They were having a good time of it and all over the sky.  I am not sure of the altitudes, but it was probably never lower than 8,000' to 10,000'  I was watching them with my binoculars for about 45 minutes to an hour.  The sky was clear of clouds, but a bit hazy.  I was looking to the north with the morning sun behind me.  The two jets joined up in formation and started flying to the east by northeast.  I guess flying  back to the Naval Air Station in Kingsville.  As I watched them depart, an object slowly entered my area of vision in the binoculars.  The object was moving in the same direction of the departing jets, west to east, but moving much slower than the jets.  Maybe 150 mph based on the jets speed in departing.  Hard to tell.  I heard no sound, but had heard the Navy Jets very well all morning.  The object was in the shape of a long cylinder.  It looked to be narrower in the center and the ends were the same thickness.  The narrow center section of the object was a hazy red color while the rest of the object was silver.  The front, middle and back section were all about the same length.  I know the object was about 3 to 4 times the size of the Navy Jets, because while I was watching the object, the two Navy jets returned and buzzed the object two times (under and over) before departing again to the east by northeast.  I could hear the jets after the first pass, but nothing ever from the object.  The object did not have wings or a tail that I could recognize.  The object continued to the east at a steady rate of speed until I lost sight of it.  I don't know why, but I got the feeling that the object had been watching the Navy Jets practice too. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the individual who submitted this report, and we found him to be quite credible, and we suspect he is an exceptionally good witness.  He is a former military jet pilot.

On Saturday morning November 9th I took my family to the reservoir at Sugar Hollow near White Hall, Virginia just outside of Shenandoah National Park (park was due west of our position).  Our position was approximately 78 degrees 44' longitude, 38 degrees 07' latitude. I was using a digital camera to take photos of the kids and scenery and did not notice any object in sky while on site.  On Saturday evening I was reviewing images on the computer and noticed a distant object in one scenic shot of mountains due west. The dome-shaped/triangular/??? object appears in only one shot taken at 11:51.  The other shots I took were probably spaced 30 seconds to several minutes apart, most of which were in the same general direction as the shot with object.  My first thought was debris on the CCD sensor (highly unlikely, sealed housing and all other shots clean) but I do not believe this to be the case. If this is indeed an object and not some kind of digital ""noise"", I estimate that its position places it somewhere over the National Park or beyond. Obviously, I have no information on possible movements, velocity, etc., however, I think object is slightly blurred, which would indicate very high rate of speed given distance to object and sunny conditions  If object is real I probably did not detect it on site because I was taking pictures with CCD camera through low res. LCD viewfinder I have absolutely opinion either way about the existence of UFOs but do feel that there is no reason to suspect other than an earthbound explanation for such events - whether or not such an explanation can be readily obtained in all cases.  There is a county airport some distance away and hot air ballons are very popular this time of year in the county.  If it were a balloon, however, I would have likely imaged it in one or more photos I took before and after the one that recorded the object.

When she told me this, I automatically looked up to see if I could see one too. At the same time, my daughter and I were looking up and we both said, ""Oh my God,what is that""? We both were looking at an object that was boomerang in shape, no lights, gray or dark-sky color, and made absolutely no sound at all. This craft was headed north and was immense in size. It was so big that the only way to see its shape was by the fact that it was blocking out the stars behind it. The event passed and my daughter and grandson left. I returned to the house to try to continue watching a movie with my neighbor. Later, at 1:00 a.m., I asked my neighbor to walk outside with me; I wanted to look again. As we walked off the front steps and looked up, my neighbor yelled and pointed up. There was the craft again! This time, the object was moving to the southeast and was directly above the house. It seemed to be in the same ""orbit"", as earlier I had noticed the Little Dipper was nearby the object the first time and then as the night wore on, the position of the stars had changed too.Again, the object was near the Little Dipper. Another note; the neighborhood dogs were barking frantically when both events occurred. I do not know if this is significant or not. I was always a little skeptical but have tried to keep an open mind about these things. Today however, I am changed. I really want to know if anyone else saw this craft or not.

I thought it might be an airplane with a light on either wingtip, but the lights were not flashing, and they seemed to be moving too fast for an airplane.  As I watched, the two lights converged into one, and then changed again so that one appeared to be following or chasing the other.  The rear light seemed to be ""swinging"" back and forth behind the path of the front light.

Up until 1:00 AM the weirdest thing I saw was a dumb guy climbing dangerously on a large tree.  I had no expectation of a UFO sighting then nor at anytime.  After the 12:00 fireworks and some music and laser lights (which were disappointing), I decided we (me and my friend) should start leaving, as the crowd was incredibly huge.  We walked through part of downtown DC including the George Washington University to the Foggy Bottom Metro Station.  As we got near the station the crowd swelled again as people try to get to the few escalators going down.  It took a very long time to get to the escalator, so I stood and listened and people-watched.  At about 1:00 AM there was the sound of explosions and it made me ""jump"".  It was just the 2nd round of fireworks being launched from a barge in the Potomac River behind the Lincoln Memorial.  Thank God it wasn't real bombs.  All we could see were the flashes of light behind 12-story buildings and some reflections in office windows.  The fireworks lasted about 6 minutes, and after about 2-3 minutes of fireworks as I was inching my way along in the crowd, I noticed near the western horizon what appeared to be (a) shooting star(s).  I was not looking directly at it though.  I said to my friend, ""What good timing for shooting stars!  It's great to see that during the fireworks.""  Then I saw more, and this time I got a better look at what they were.  (It also occurred to me later that the ""shooting star(s)"" never ""burned up in the atmosphere."")  I saw a pair of dark but lit cylindrical objects ""flying"" in formation from NW to SE passing almost directly above me.  Definitely not meteors.  They looked identical.  They moved at high speed, but I was able to see them well enough while they lasted, since I was now looking for more ""shooting stars"".  Less than a minute later a single cylinder moved from WSW to ENE at about the same speed and had the same appearance.  I then ! said, to no one in particular and not loudly really, ""Am I seeing UFOs?""  My friend was either caught up in the fireworks and/or crowd and didn't notice anything.  No one said anything after my last comment, but then very few people around me would have been able to hear me with so many people jabbering and the incredibly loud, echoing fireworks.  At this point I was almost at the beginning of the escalator.  I guess ""resistance is futile""; I felt I had no choice but to get on the thing.  If I could do it over again, I would have grabbed my friend and tried to get out of the way so I could hang around and look for more of these things, whatever they were.  I have searched the Washington Post's of the last few days but have not been able to find anything on any UFO sightings.  I am now searching the internet for the same (for the first time) and happened upon this site.  I hope this helps me resolve what it was I saw.  I am keeping a wide-open mind and not jumping to conclusions.  Anyone else?  Please speak up if you saw them.  Thanks!",2002-09-06T00:00:00,38.907575087012276,-77.02499886426087

It was moving in a straight line, much like an airplane would.  Then, I noticed another one, same size, same description, but flying towards the first object.  I thought maybe they were planes flying at different altitudes, because it looked as though they were going to have a head-on collision.  I became anxious as I thought I was going to watch a plane wreck mid-air, but just as they were going to hit, they VERY QUICKLY (much faster than an airplane ever could) spun off in opposite circular directions.  They danced around each other in circles, occasionally disappearing then reappearing.  The most I saw at one time were 4.  Then, and actual airplane passed through my area of vision (flying much lower than the objects) and as it did, the objects disappeared totally.  After the plane had been gone for about a minute, one reappeared and continued to dance around, and another appeared.  Sometimes there were two, and sometimes one.  During the course of this, I stood up to observe, and sat down, and laid back down, just to make sure I wasn't contorting my body in a way that was effecting my vision.  But, these objects were clearly in focus, not just light spots created by poor sight.   Finally, I decided I had seen enough and wanted to leave.  I'm not one to make up stories (as most people probably say), and though I believe there is something out there, I NEVER thought I'd ever see anything like this.

On the afforementioned date, the BBC switched their coverage to a Washington studio for a live interview with their Election Correspondent.  The time was approximately 08:47 (GMT).  The correspondent was seated in front of a window, through which a backdrop of night-time Washington was clearly visible.  As the interviewee was speaking, a UFO slowly 'drifted' in from the top left corner of the window and hung motionlessly for the rest of the interview.  I would describe the object as disc-shaped (as viewed as a near side-on angle) and was a soft blue colour.  I have e-mailed the BBC to see if they could identify the 'object' as a reflection, etc. but, as yet, they have not replied.  There were two observers to this incident - myself and a housemate.  I am currently a first year psychology PhD student, aged 27 and my housemate is a research fellow, having recently completed his PhD in the same subject.

My friend dropped me off at my house at 9:27pm one evening in january of 2001 it was most likely after the 10th, but before the 14th (which is the day I went back to school).  My friend and I had just gotten back from town when I stepped out of the vehicle and then he left.  For some reason both of my parents came out of the front door of the house and out onto the side walk.  I asked them why they came out and at that exact moment all three of us looked up at the sky (it was a very clear winter night, no clouds at all) we saw a very large and strange circular object flying overhead.  The only reason we noticed the object was because of the different array of lights (it did not make any noise, but an airplane would flying so low).  My mouth gaped open because I knew exactly what I was and so did my mother.  My father was very skeptical, but we all concluded most diffinitely it was not an airplane, helicopter, stealth bomber, weather balloon or anything we had ever seen before or anything else that people blame these accounts on.  The circular craft flew very slowly and did not make any noise.  The craft was at a very low altitude (I will venture to say 300 - 400 feet) and we watched it for about 3 minutes as it passed over the trees and out of view.  I know what I saw and no one can tell me any differently they just dont make planes circular in shape and that large.  And another thing the craft had a sort of central piece that did not move, but the outer circle of the craft seemed to be spinning very slowly around the central part i could draw it for you if i had some paper.  My mother and I have told people that we know about this account and the only people that seem to believe us are the other three people we know that have had similar accounts.  I did not know about this website or i would have posted this account much earlier. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))",2002-09-06T00:00:00,37.7781,-80.0591

Aug 5/2002 in Toronto, Canada. It traveled along its length, unlike a bird. It seemed to be illuminated in red from below but there were no blinking lights. I first observed the object  directly overhead but it did not seem at all to be among the stars; it seemed much lower. Though it was not streaking, there was no trail, the object went very rapidly, no more than 2 or 3 seconds and disappeared in the bright haze of the lower horizon in the ESE.  The trajectory seemed mostly straight although halfway through, the object seemed to adjust its course slightly.

I had been sitting outside for about 20 minutes, preparing for an evening of star gazing with my 10 inch telescope. I've been looking up at the sky during the day and during the night ever since I can remember (I'm aged 50). I was looking straight up at the stars when the object appeared. There had been occasional airplanes crossing my field of view shortly before and after (but not during) my sighting. This object was much lower and made no noise which I could hear. Although in a large built up city, the stars are still quite visible overhead. A few minutes later, when my wife joined me, we saw a small speck, a satellite go past the star Vega. As an astronomer I have observed satellites, man-made objects (ISS), comets and meteors moving through the night sky.

It moved in a zig-zagging, back and forth manner, at very high speed. At least 2 to 3 times the speed of satellites I had observed, and about 1/2 the speed of a meteor. Within 3 to 5 seconds, the object disappeared behind the trees. Altitude: Very high. Earth orbit, or near earth orbit. Size: Apparently very large. Possible dark or hollow center. Couldn't tell for sure. Also on the same night, I saw at least three bright flashes of light in differant locations, at differant times. These were very brief, lasting only 1/2 to 1 second each time.",2002-08-16T00:00:00,,

This light was flying roughly 100 meters over our roof top. It took a projectile path  with a trail of light. The trail went aound 100 meters. The object then disppeared in mid of sky. The night was dark. Hence the shape of the object could not be established. The next morning we came to know that many people saw the same object and it had landed and wounded a few people with scratches on the front parts of the body with the feeling of electric current shock. This was not the first incident of the kind. But the similar incidents have been reported by the media covering 250 km and 200 affected people. The whole area is terrorised with the similar kind of reports still pouring in from different parts of the area. We  are a fggroup of engineers but unable to understand the phenomena.

Then a second later, it took off to the right (south) at about 300 MPH (with no sound or acceleration time), and then disappeared behind the bottom of a cloud. If it would have continued on it's course, it would have popped out from teh other side of the cloud in a couple of seconds. Then the storm that was approaching us started to lightning.

It was VERY bright, much brighter than any stars or planes and moving much slower than the satellites we often see. We drove the two blocks home, still watching the light move in a northerly direction and at varying but still very slow speed. I called my husband to come out and look. He thought it was odd also, not like a satellite. After 5-7 minutes it began moving more to the northwest then west. During this time we also saw a satellite for about one minute (moving much faster that the orange light) and a plane quite high in the sky. We all noted that the plane had the green and red side lights and white strobe lights that all registered aircraft are required to have. During this time I also attempted to call the tower at the local airport (about 2 air miles away to the east). The tower was closed as there are no scheduled flights that late in our area. I remained outside with my husband and daughter while using the phone and watched the light. After about 15-20 minutes it began to fade and appeared to drop lower in sky in relation to the horizon before disappearing from site. We noted that it was moving too slowly for an aircraft to remain airborne and was completely silent. The following day, I contacted the local airport tower and was informed that our facility does not have RADAR.

On 6/8/02, at around 8 PM, during clear skies, I saw a vapor trail, about 1/2 inch wide, that had begun at about 40 degrees above the NNE horizon which then, ascended almost straight upwards towards the zenith, but at a slight angle towards the east, of about 5 degrees.  At about 10 degrees below the zenith, this vapor trail made a sharp turn of about 90 degrees and at this point, it appeared to continue on, parallel to the ground, moving straight towards the SSE.  It seemed to have crossed directly over my neighbor's house and it seemed unusually low for a chemtrail. This vapor trail was about 2 inches wide, overhead. I was mowing grass at about 100 feet west of this house when I noticed it.  As I mowed, I saw that it spanned about 2/3 of the way across the sky but no further. It seemed to have stopped, as though, it were freeze framed. At the very front of this horizontal vapor trail, I saw a motionless and intensely, luminous, white diagonal line that was about 1/2 inch long at arm's length. It was tilted upwards at about 50 degrees, towards the right or towards the south. This luminous line had a small, yet, definite, dark area at its mid center. I observed it for about 90 seconds and it maintained its position, just to the left side of a tall tree. Using the house and tree as a guide, I noticed no movement of either this luminous white line or its vapor trail.  I never saw any of this vapor trail being made although, it  should have been within my visual field while approaching overhead.  Everything about this sighting seemed motionless, as if, freeze-framed from my first observation to my last. I'd looked away for about 30 seconds, to turn my mower around and when I looked back this luminous diagonal line was gone. Although, the chemtrail remained, its vapor stream abruptly ended at the exact location where I last saw the luminous, diagonal line hovering.This luminous line's shape was thin and rectangular but visually flat and without a shadow side. It had perfect symmetry with clean, sharp edges! . Nothin g wavered or dimmed. The horizontal vapor trail was rippled, as if, composed of many small clouds, placed side by side. The vapor trail seemed unusually sparse, semi-translucent, soft-edged and light-violet-gray in color. It wasn't an opaque white. None of this horizontal vapor trail was reflecting any sunlight. The sun was at the opposite side of the sky at that time. I saw no clouds, haze nor other vapor trails. I didn't see anything about this sighting wink-out,  fly away nor move. This wasn't a normal flight path.  The winds were calm but I didn't watch the chemtrail dissipate, either. I just forgot about it and kept mowing.",2002-08-28T00:00:00,40.6974,-80.3735

I remeber he was telling me that a town right next to us, Dunedin, FL, had one of the highest recorded UFO sightings in Florida.  I shrugged this off, and started strumming the guitar, looking out into the ocean.  I was facing North West when I noticed 1 light far off into the distance, in the ocean.  At first glance I thought it was a star or satellite, or even a plane.  The sphere was barely a speck, red in color.  This made me consider the fact of a plane even more, until I saw it turn.  The turn was not a curved or graceful turn whatsoever, it was like the object shifted.  It was at one spot one moment, and all of a sudden, it dropped a good distance, then shifted to the left immediately.  I pointed this out to my friend, and we were both amazed.  We watched this light and 3 others that joined it for a good half hour, sliding up, down, at sharp angles, almost as if they were following a line, instead of a curve.  During that time, we saw one aircraft fly past, and the four red lights seemed to group together until it flew past their general area.  It almost seemed like the four lights were playing with each other, chasing and being chased.  Then, they started heading in a north, northeast direction, and kept going in that direction until they faded out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The sky was mostly clear with unlimited visibility.  I spotted a silver spherical object in the sky approximately 2/3rds of a mile north of the road over a farmers field.  It was approximately 200-300 feet above ground level.  At first it was stationary with no apparent movement in any direction.  I thought it might be a ballon, although it was perfectly round with no protruding parts of any kind, such as a gondola.  After a few seconds it began to move towards the east at a speed of perhaps 70-100 MPH.  It passed over the village of Kettlebridge moving below the line of hills east of that village and I lost sight of it.  It was clearly not a conventional aircraft and clearly not a ballon.

I would guess it was roughly  the size of a very small airplane compressed and traveling steadily at about the same speed as a small plane.  I was stunned and thought it had something to do with being the 4th of July and at first thought it looked like it was following the airplane.  We were also to be on high alert for terrorism this day.  I watched it for about a minute with nobody else to yell to come see.  I thought about calling 911 but thought they'd think i was nuts.

It had the luminosity of Mercury or Mars (certainly not as bright as Venus or Jupiter).  If it had been still it could have easily been mistaken for a star.  However, it was its type of motion that distinguished it from a star, a terrestrial aerial vehicle or a satellite.  It was heading from north to south and traveling quite erratically.  It wobbled on an irregular basis from left to right, sometimes speeding up and sometimes slowing down.  Sometimes the wobble was a long slow move to the right; sometimes it was a quick, short burst.  Sometimes it went a short distance backwards, but mostly it moved forward.  If it had been someone driving a car I would have said they were drunk as a skunk, weaving all over the road.  It did not move in a straight line with a consistent speed as a satellite; we heard no sound and there were no other lights (i.e. wing or landing lights) as an airplane.  Its average rate of speed, although erratic, was generally consistent and not very fast.  It traversed 40% of the sky in 3 minutes, and if one held his or her fist out at arm's length, it would have traversed the width of the fist in 10-12 seconds.

I looked around the top deck and no one else seemed to be witness to it.

Oregon UFO Review Case:  Crop Formation appears in Forest Grove wheat field.,Forest Grove,OR,2002-07-05T00:00:00,unknown,unknown,"Occurred : 7/5/2002   (Entered as : 07/05/02 unknown) Reported: 7/22/2002 1:33:53 AM 01:33 Posted: 7/26/2002 Location: Forest Grove, OR Shape: Unknown Duration:unknown",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23856.html,"Crop Formation appears in Forest Grove wheat field. On Saturday July 13th, Assistant Director Eric Byler and investigator Phil Simmons returned to Forest Grove to talk with the owner of the field and get permission to go in and take a look. At that time the owner commented that he had heard the formation may have been discovered by others as early as Friday July 5th but that he did not personally know of its presence until it hit the news on Tuesday July 9th. Investigator Carol Pedersen from The Center for Crop Circle Studies has been out to the site to collect samples for Michigan biophysicist, Wm. C. Levengood. Levengood has been examining crop circle plants and soils since 1989. To-date, three papers presenting the research findings have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, as well as more than 100 lab reports on individual crop formations in the U.S., Canada, England, The Netherlands, Germany, Australia and Israel. These scientific papers and laboratory reports outline the physical abnormalities discovered so far in the plants and soils, clearly indicating a causative agency other than human-directed mechanical flattening of the plants, suggesting instead an energy system which emits microwaves and associated unusual electrical and magnetic field. Although some instances of the phenomenon known as “crop circles” are apparently created by people, scientific analysis of the affected plants and soils indicates that slightly more than 90% of formations tested have a more interesting—and more complex—causation. Tuesday July 16th update... Oregon UFO Research has received a preliminary report from the main investigator in this case, OUFOR consultant Carol Pederson of The Center for Crop Circle Studies. The findings she observed while in that formation along with new witness testimony strongly suggests this formation may in fact be authentic and casts serious doubts on the sole testimony of 17 year old Logan Richardson who claimed that teens he was acquainted with made it. Not one of the teens has come forward to identify themselves and the day they were supposed to have done the formation is later than the actual discovery date. A few items of interest that should be noted. 1) A witness provides testimony that the formation appeared as early as Friday July 5th...this pre-dates when the teens were supposed to have created the formation. 2) No one has personally admitted to making the formation. 3) Another witness reports seeing the formation on Sunday the 7th of July. This witness had some knowledge of the phenomenon and looked for a trail leading in...none were present. Monday morning, July 8th she noticed a path leading into the formation. 4) Wheat heads were intact during the investigation and spilled out when walked on. 5) Stalks were bent but not broken. 6) Elongated nodes were observed but no blown or bent nodes. 7) Lay pattern indicates the swirls were made from the outside in. 8) The formation was aligned exactly N-S by compass reading. 9) It should also be noted that this formation is very similar to one that appeared in Washington State in 1993. With the exception of the Hillsboro Argus newspaper, most of the media reported that this formation was a hoax based on one teens testimony minus anyone admitting to it. The press also attempted to make a connection to the upcoming Mel Gibson film ""SIGNS"" as a possible reason for it's appearance without any evidence to prove the Forest Grove circle was a hoax. While a hoax is always a possibility, some of the information gathered during the investigation points away from this and we should all wait until the samples come back from the Laboratory of Michigan Bio-physicist W.C. Levengood before making any final conclusions. Past analysis have shown that 90% of formations tested gave positive results of being authentic. We are also grateful for the hard work and dedication by Carol Pedersen of The Center for Crop Circle Studies. Carol has worked for many years investigating formations in the state of Oregon and is the best in her field. We at OUFOR have our hats off to her detailed investigative talents and are fortunate to have her as a consultant for Oregon UFO Research. We will post more information when the tests are complete regarding the authenticity of this formation.

We guessed a radio tower at first, then, as we neared decided it was far too bright.  Next we guessed a plane - again, it was too bright and we could not see any strobes.  For about 8 minutes we tried to guess as we drove closer and closer to the object. Finally, after nearly 10 minutes, we closed in on the object and it flew past us.  It was triangular and had four lights - all of them white.  There was a white non-strobing light on each top with a large circular light in the very center that was very, very bright.  This must have been the light we were trying to identify only moments earlier.  The object made no sound as it passed by at an estimated 500ft or so from the ground.  It was moving east, past us. My friend and I, being younger childern, became quite upset and my father pulled the car over after voicing a ""what the hell was that?"".   My young friend and I watched as the aircraft flew past and crossed over the highway.  We thought it was coming back around so we both screamed for my father to get back on the road, nearly in tears.  We were quite frightened. I am now a certified private pilot so I am familar with aircraft lighting and identification.  Based on my experience with this subject I can say that what we witnessed that night was not an aircraft.  I don't know what it was.",2002-05-14T00:00:00,44.2,-77.03329999999998

I cant confirm this is the exact date of my sighting. I had an inclination to see if anyone else saw what I saw in approximately the same time period. I surfed through the listings on this sight and was surprised to find a listing during the approximate time i was looking for. The description of the event was exactly the same as what i saw. I was coming home from a sports practice. I was about ten years old. There were three other people in the car including my mom. The practice was in acton and we saw the craft about ten minutes into the trip home to chelmsford. All of us joked about it being a ufo cause the trip took a by a small airport along the high way. It wasnt until we saw the craft moving in untraditional ways to a normal aircraft that we were a little taken back. The craft moved extremely fast and agile. It would pick up speeds that i had never seen in a normal aircraft and then instantly turn around the other direction... as if it didnt have to slow down to turn around. I realize helicopters have this capability basically, but there was no noise, and the speed and liquidness that the turn around was, could not have been a helicopter. This craft remained in view for at least a half hour all the way back to chelmsford center where we lost view of it. One specific thing about the craft is we could vaguely make out a trianular shape about it. Chelmsford is about 30 minutes north of boston.",2002-05-14T00:00:00,,

I was about 1km directly north of the airport. The object appeared to be approximately 60 feet tall and perhaps 20 feet wide. Sort of a rounded rectangle, it appeared to be grey in colour. It couldn't have been more than 150 feet off the ground. At first I thought it may be an unusual hot air balloon. Except it had no basket at all. I then noticed it was moving very slowly away from my position to the south. I watched in amazement for about 10 minutes as it slowly disappeared over the southern horizon, the Niagara escarpment.

My ex-wife and I were sitting in our car in a gravel pull-off next to an old 1-room schoolhouse on a country road just outside of Xenia. She had just picked me up from work and it was about 11:30 PM. We had pulled over for a few minutes to talk  and to switch seats as she said she didn't feel like driving. While we were talking she pointed out in front of the car and said ""Look at that."" There were 3 white lights in a perfect triangle formation straight out ahead of us and just above the tree-tops. The trees are I'd say no more than 1/8th of a mile straight out from our location. At first they looked like very bright stars and other than being in a perfect triangle didn't look much out of the ordinary. Then the light that was on the lower right of the formation began performing some very radical movements. It would do 2 or 3 short tight loops and then shoot straight up or down and then back into formation. It was one of the strangest things I had ever seen. Very fast movements. This went on for a few moments and then the whole formation began to move slowly in our general direction. My ex-wife was a little scared at this point and I was beginning to feel the same. I decided to start the car and head toward Xenia. I did a U-turn in the road and accelerated heavily. A few seconds later my wife became hysterical and grabbed on to me. She said ""Oh my god it's behind us"". I looked up in the rear-view and there it was. From what I could tell it just looked like a very very bright spotlight with what looked like 2 smaller lights right and left of it. I remember seeing a bit of orange around the edges and a glowing green on the bottom. Thats the best I can describe it. It appeared that it was extremely close behind us. I did notice that the ground ahead of our car was lit up as well. At one point the light seemed to be swinging like a pendulum in an arc while chasing us. I was truly horrified. I didn't even notice that we had reached the end of the road where it ""T's"" into another road. I hit the brakes just a! bout whe n we were passing the stopsign and we went off the road into a large field. The ground was very dry and there wasn't much of a ditch between the road and the field so I was able to get the car back up onto the road easily. We weren't hurt and the car had only very minor damage. Once we got back onto the road I noticed the light was gone. It was a very scary thing and my ex-wife still doesn't like to talk about it. It took her days to recover emotionally from the incident. We told very few people about it, however I did report this to a UFO researcher in Cincinatti sometime in 1999. He sent me an email informing me that my report was one of SEVERAL describing the same type of craft and incident in our area in the summer of 1993. Seems we were not alone in this. If any of you out there have any knowledge of these events I would like to talk to you. j_dog25@mindspring.com From what I could tell the objects made no sound. The light emitted did not look ""normal"" it was very pure much like L.E.D. light. At first sighting the objects were about the size of normal bright stars in the night sky. The one that appeared close to us in the rear view mirror took up about 1/3 of the rear-view mirror's area. The car did not seem to be affected by the objects in any way.

I'm not exactly sure what I saw which is why it has taken me this long to relate this story to anyone. It was approximately 2100 hrs of that evening. I had just finished flying a trip into Boston's Logan airport. The weather was warm and there was a broken cloud deck above Logan with bases of about 10,000ft and the tops ranged from 10,300 to 10,500. We had just come from Quebec so I knew pretty well where the clouds were hanging. I was walking from the airplane to our operations area in one of the large hangers on Logan's North ramp.  I looked up through a pretty good hole in the clouds as I was walking and noticed 3 objects in the sky just above the cloud tops.  The first two were in a tight echelon formation and the last one was trailing about 1/2 mile behind.  Whatever they were, they were trianglular  in form with rounded corners.  Their coloration looked black except for that they glowed  red much like a caste iron poker would glow once heated.  They approached from the west and were heading east a a high rate of speed.  Their size was emmence as from where I was standing they appeared to be a good 1"" long. They were in snd out of the cloud t adjusting for my prespective that  would have them hughe.  I called a close friend at the approach control to see if they had picked up anything.  They had not. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

((deleted)),  Thank you very much for the excellent, and fascinating report!!   I do not know what it was you witnessed, but I agree that the objects were ""anomalous.""  I know of nothing in our military arsenal that looks like what you saw that night.  Is there any way you might be able to reconstruct the precise date of the event, using your flight logs, for example?  If possible, given the quality of the report, we would very much like to pin down all the detail we can.  You might be interested in another report from the New England area from an airline pilot.

Well, I have always struggled with the whole U.F.O. phenomenum, real or not? After this sighting which was my first and last good sighting of an U.F.O. i tend to beleive in them a lot more. But still feel that this could have been man-made, but a U.F.O. none-the-less. Nice bright blue sky, with about 10 to 15% of it dotted with puffy white clouds that you can not see through. I had just pulled up to a stop light, facing south and was just looking at the sky, when I saw a Fairly bright silver, apparently reflective type orb emerge from one of the clouds moving east at a very slow rate and then it appeared to stop. As I looked at it I knew i had never seen anything like it before and had this really odd feeling of being watched. I looked around and remember seeing only a couple of cars to my right and the people had not noticed it, and I felt the urge to call out to get them to look up at what i saw, but as I looked back up, the orb was moving back to the right, (west), and went back behind the same cloud it came out from behind to begin with. It did not reappear on the other side, and when the light turned green I crossed the intersection and pulled over on the side for a few minutes keeping an eye on the cloud I saw the orb emerge from, but did not see it again. Well I live in a military town and on top of that there is a small airport to the south of my town so I have seen many different types of Aircraft over 30 years of my life in all different weather conditions and of course there are times when you see things that are a little different but always upon closer examination you knew what they were, jets or copters or flares, and commercial aircraft of course. From the size of this object and comparing it to all the other flying aircraft I have seen in the skys I would say the object was 10 to 15 ft in diamater, of course its hard to be sure of that aspect. But this defied anything common to say the least, the clouds were moving just perceivably to the west, so the object actually stopped or slowed down emensely and retreated back to where it came from even though the cloud was moving away from it. But that was the closest cloud in range to the object. Also the object made no sound that i could hear with my windows rolled down. Which was also very unusual. I told my wife and little girl when i got home and they were slightly amazed because they know i do not get excited over anything, and also told a couple of friends about it, and then about a year or two later, we saw an episode of sightings on the fox network that had a video of an almost identical sighting as mine, but in a different state and different time. And I said there it is that is exactly what I saw! And the object on the video behaved in exactly the same manner.",2002-05-14T00:00:00,34.635224117647056,-98.47288176470587

I stepped out onto my back deck at about 10:10 P.M. to enjoy the nice, cool, clear night. A couple of minutes later, I noticed a bright, white light moving somewhat towards me from the NNW. I thought that it was strange to see the landing lights of an airplane near my house, as I am not in the flight path of the airport or the Air Force base. The object appeared to be flying at about 10,000 feet and moving at a medium speed. I watched the entire time as it passed just to the west of my home, flying in a SSE direction. The intensity of the light stayed perfectly consistent as it moved toward me then away from me. As it passed, I realized that if those were landing lights, then they would fade as the object passed me, but the light stayed just as intense, so therefore it could not be forward lights on a plane. So then I wondered if it possibly was a helicopter with a spot light, but why so high and there was no obvious beam pointing down, it was just a solid intense light. Then the light disappeared in mid air. At that point it was a few miles south of my home. Then I realized that there were no beacons whatsoever on this craft. I never heard any engine noise, and it was too dark to see if it had a shape. I just thought that it was odd that there were no beacons and how the light just disappeared in mid flight. This was unusual for an aircraft, even a military aircraft, NOT to run its beacons and to be equipped with a light so bright in all directions.

I thought it was the stealth bomber B17, or maybe the blackbird sr71, but the way it was just suspended in the air and the way it came out of the clouds and desappeard have me thinking to this day.

I was stationed in NORAD Mountain Complex and knew that the goverment had information about UFO's when I was working there. I have never told anyone about that until now.  I'm not someone looking for attention, the reason I'm writing....I have been having dreams of late that are very strange.  Let me say that I don't watch si-fi shows..well I have seen old Star Trek shows, but that was years ago.  I'm someone that believes that if you can't prove it logically why talk about it.  In fact one show I really enjoy is Arthur C. Clarks show.  Anyway back to the dreams..I have seen several different kinds of spacecraft and they don't look like any thing thats been shown on tv.  I have also seen them with military aircraft that have been retrofitted.  I know they have been retrofitted because I know military aircraft designs that exist, (due to the fact I lived on a military airstrip in Colorado Springs (Peterson Airforce Base).  The planes are working with the spacecraft in going after us.  To tell you the truth, I'm starting to feel very stupid telling you about this, but what the hell..I've already started.  I relized in my dream that the military aircraft had some type of spray comming from them that made myself and the people around me sick..I can't really explain why..it just seemed that way in the dream. Last night I saw a new type of spacecrat,again, nothing like I have ever seen on tv.  The dreams are starting to bother me, do a lot of people have dreams about ufo's?  Are my dreams a result of to much tv? Like I said before, I'm not someone who is a si-fi nut. I can't disclose my identification due to the fact that it could cause me problems.

I was the featured speaker for a meeting at a clubhouse that hosts meetings of our organization. During my talk, which was about my life and how I got sober, I happened to mention, humorously, that I had always felt like an alien in my family, and in the world. I even had a little alien doll with me that my daughter had given me as a joke. After my talk, which ended at 8:30PM CST, I was standing around inside the building chatting with some of my fellow recovering folk, when one of our brethren came into the room where we were and yelled: ""Hey, (my name)...Your people are here!!!"" Several of us went outside to see what our friend was yelling about. To our surprise, hovering over Lake Mendota, very close to the house, four light objects were hovering silently. They hovered in a staggered formation for a few moments, almost like motorcylists riding on a highway. One broke away from the the others and drifted slowly toward the roof of a large apartment building next to our clubhouse. It hovered over the apartment roof for a few moments, winked out abruptly, and just as abruptly reappeared with the other three again. All four objects pulsated, changed colors, and alternately grew dimmer and brighter as we watched them. There were no noises associated with them, although several of our group were noisily making jokes about them. We were all pretty amazed, albeit somewhat skeptical, and thoroughly curious. Eventually, one by one, they all grew very dim and disappeared from our view. The even took approximately 10 minutes. There were roughly about 20 of us in the parking lot. I would estimate the distance between us and the lights to be about a quarter of a mile...maybe. It's hard to judge distances at night, particularly in that neighborhood. I do not know what the lights were or what they might have meant.

A UFO scared a couple from the Netherlands saturdaynight (province of Brabant, the town called Bladel) So reports the Newspaper The Telegraph. De twee verklaarde tegenover de polite dat de vreemde bol hen drie kwartier lang achtervolgde op de provinciale weg. The two stated to the police that they were chased by a UFO, a ball shaped light, for 45 minutes on the province road. ""Ik ben zeer nuchter in die dingen.

Ik durfde niet meer naar huis."" First we thought that it was the lasershow of a nearby disco and we joked about it but when it kept following our car we realised that something wasnt right and we put the car on the side of the road. The light circled above us. When we drove again it went with us. This repeated for six times. When we went left, the UFO went left. The light was very bright and my wife said pull some more gas but that didnt make any difference. As we drove faster the ball shape craft transformed into a stripe of light.

It was also noted that the object had no external lights, but appeared to be illuminated from within, not flickering, but a solid steady light. The size of the object was thought to be about the size of an automobile. My wife also stated that the object was flying so slow as to almost appear to be hovering but was clearly moving from west to east across the sky, the object had no sound whatever, but both witnesses believe that the object seemed to be powered as even a balloon floating with the slight breeze that night, would have drifted quicker than this object. Both witnesses were very insistent as there are many blimps in this area, that this was not an airship, as by law they have navigational and blinking becons and are loud. Both insisted this was something strange and feel that it was definately not a balloon of any sorts or other conventional aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Then it flashed brightly as if it had exploded, but then continued on its dowaward path unitl it got within about 15 degrees of the horizon.  At that point it faded out and disappeared. This entire event lasted only about a second. I just happened to be looking the right way when it appeared.  The object was white in color and left a straeking trail behind it.  There were aircraft in the skies over Dallas, and this light was much brighter than the lighes of air traffic and was traveling much faster. I almost expected to next see an explosion on the horizon, but there was none.  At first I feared that might be a rogue ICBM.  (Shows you what kind of times we live in now.)  When I saw no explosion on the horizon, I decided it must have been a meteor. Thinking it must have been a huge meteor, I turned on the AM news station to see if there were any news reports of the incident.  There were none.  I thought that I would certainly read accounts in the newspaper of many people observing the object--especially since it was so brightly visible in the middle of a big city. Surely scientists must have detected such a large object entering the earth's atmosphere.  And surely earthquake sensors must have detected the impact.  But over the next few days I saw no media reports at all. It may have crashed into the earth in the next county, half a state away, or into the Gulf of Mexico.  It was not a flying saucer, but it was certainly unidentified, so that makes it a UFO.

It was just after 9pm. As I stood there, I looked up into the night sky as I often do, admiring the stars. It was a clear sky, and off to the far north-northeast, something caught my eye. It looked like a distant shooting star, but that soon became unlikely to me, as it was moving horizontally in what seemed then to be from north to south, and it did not burn up and disappear as would be expected. About two to three seconds elapsed, and I found my eyes focusing in on a silent, shadowy, blur approaching my location overhead. It was in the shape of what resembled a boomerang, about the size of a hang glider, or even slightly smaller. I was surprised to realize that it was actually at a very low altitude. I felt myself grasping to identify it, and trying hard to decide that it was simply a flock of travelling birds. I believe that what I was trying to call birds were actually 5 or 7 small, dull white lights, and as the object came nearly directly overhead, I could easily see that these lights were on the V-shaped outer edge of a dark gray colored craft. In fact, the craft appeared to be made of a similar material to a B-1 stealth bomber, although it definitely was not a B-1. It was traveling north-northeast to south-southwest, at perhaps 75 feet above the treetops. The craft was moving too quickly for a flock of birds, and yet considerably slower than what would ordinarily be the stall speed of an aircraft, perhaps 45-50 mph. Again, the object was completely silent as it passed nearly directly overhead, very stable and steady in course, at an altitude which I later realized would have been below normal radar detection. My experience was of an object that was only perhaps 8 feet across at best, and this was most puzzling of all. I would not say it was large enough to carry people. I live in a suburban area, and watched it disappear over the neighbors' treetops soon after passing over my! head. T he lights may have changed color, but I am not certain of this. Curiously, I've only had one other UFO sighting in my life, when I was an older child laying in the yard looking up at the stars, maybe fifteen or twenty years ago. That object was almost exactly the same as the one I saw recently, and I finally feel vindicated that the sighting I had then was indeed not a flock of birds.",2002-10-28T00:00:00,44.039544983277594,-123.12515735785954

On Friday, March 29th, at approximately 17:45, I observed an object that I firmly believe to be other than any conventional aircraft I am aware of. This event was witnessed by my sixteen year old son and my 14 year old daughter as well. I am a retired police officer who is not given to flights of fancy, so it is with careful thought that I bring this event to your attention. We were traveling west on Colorado 36, approximately four miles west of Last Chance, Co. when my son first noticed the object to the north of the hiway above a pasture. At first I thought it must be an aircraft either enroute to or departing Denver International Airport, approximately seventy miles to the west of our position. However, as I began to watch the object I could tell that it was not moving and that the distance between  it and my vehicle was closing as I approached it. In about five minutes I was parallel to the object which was over a pasture approximately three hundred yards from the hiway. I stopped the car on the shoulder of the road to get a better look at the object, still thinking that there was an explanation such as weather balloon, helicopter, etc. It soon became apparent to me that it was not a balloon, as it was absolutely unmoving in a breeze that would have easily moved an inflated object (10 to 15 m.p.h. out of the northeast). It also was not a rotor craft. The object appeared to be slightly oval shape, with a ""dull"" metallic look to it. I turned the engine of the car off and there was absolutley no sound from the object. This is a very sparse farming and ranching community with very little traffic of noise pollution of any kind. The slight wind was in the direction to have brought any sound toward my vehicle. The object appeared to be 25 to 30 feet in diameter and close to 10 feet thick at it's midsection. There were cattle grazing in the pasture, not directly under the object, but only 100 yards or so to the east. They seemed to be completly unaware of it's presence. It was dusk and getting darker as we ! watched the object, still trying to decide what it might be. Another vehicle approached from the east and slowed as it passed us, an elderly couple who were obviously looking at the same thing we were. The vehicle declined to stop, but rather accelerated and proceeded west. My daughter began to get a little upset and asked if we could leave. I could tell she was frightened and when I looked to the back seat, she was looking away, choosing not to even look at it anymore. As I told her we were leaving, the object illuminated, again without a sound. I don't mean some lights came on around the perimiter or flood lights. I mean the entire object itself ""glowed"" an orange-red color. Even though there was no sound that I could hear, when the object lit up, the cattle suddenly bolted, all at once, in different directions. I've seen cattle shy from noise or threat before and they all turn  to run from the percieved threat. These cattle were running into each other like they had no idea which way to go. At this point, I became concerned for our safety. I don't know why, the vehicle never moved or did anything of a threatening nature, I simply was afraid for my children and myself. The vehicle started without hesitation and I left heading west again towards Denver. My daughter was now crying and my son's initial excitement had also been replaced with a quiet uneasiness. I continued to watch the object as best I could as we left, but it was dark enough now to make it hard to see. The illumination had only lasted for maybe 2 or 3 seconds. My son caugh the last glimpse of the object as we crested a hill. It appeared to be in the same place as it had been. After talking with my wife and a few close friends, I decided to keep quiet about the sighting. I now regret that decision because it may have ben easier to find out who else migh have seen this if I had come forward earlier. In my profession people tend to discredit these types of subjects, as well as the individual making the report. If you have recieved any information regarding the incident my children an I had that evening, would you please advise me?

Search coordinator Point Township Fire Chief Leon Geise said six teams with K-9 dogs planned to resume the search at 6 a.m. today, with more volunteers beginning a ground and air search at 8 a.m. ""It's not an easy thing to have to leave,"" he said of the decision to temporarily call off the search. ""We need some closure and we don't have it."" Sees left his RD2 Northumberland home at about 5 a.m. Sunday to go scouting for deer on a portion of his 80-acre property, according to his brother, Ty Sees. ""When he didn't come back by 12:30 p.m., four of us went out looking for him,"" Ty Sees said late Sunday afternoon. ""It's not like him to be gone this long."" Harold ""Brub"" Sees joined the initial search that yielded no sign of his son. ""We covered the area he normally covers,"" the elder Sees said. ""We hollered constantly, but didn't see or hear him. ""Todd knows this territory like the back of his hand. What bothers me is that he's been gone too long."" Clad in a white T-shirt soaked with sweat, Brub Sees also worried how his son was coping in the intense heat, which climbed into the 90s by early afternoon. A coordinated search effort began at 2:30 p.m. when Northumberland Borough Fire Chief Josh Newbury received a call from Sue Sees requesting help in finding her husband.  Newbury said Todd Sees was planning to go scouting on the ridge with another person who later decided not to go out.  Although no one saw Todd Sees leave early Sunday morning, his 18-year-old son, Nick, did find his four-wheeler on the west end of the ridge two miles from their home at about 12:30 p.m., Brub Sees said. Todd Sees is an avid outdoorsman who's known to ""walk for hours,"" Northumberland No. 1 Fire Department volunteer Nate Fisher said, but he's never stayed out for so long without contacting family.  ""The heat, that's what scares me,"" Fisher said earlier in the day, adding that no one is certain what, if any, provisions Sees took with him.  Ty Sees said his brother usually grabs a can of Mountain Dew and dresses in camouflage when he's gone out on similar excursions. Some volunteers speculated that Sees may have slipped on a rock and is unable to call for help. ""It very rough terrain and there's thick brush,"" Geise said. ""This is going to be a slow and methodical search."" ""Be aware, rattlesnakes are in abundance,"" he told the volunteers preparing to head out on the search from the command post at the base of the ridge off Geise Road. However, the group had to wait several hours while three tracking dogs from Northstar Search & Rescue of Selinsgrove and James Shaffer were sent out into the heavily wooded area to try to pick up Todd Sees' scent. By 6 p.m. a state police helicopter from Hazelton had flown over the ridge looking for the missing man and Geise was requesting bloodhounds be brought in to assist the other canines in the search. At about 7:45 p.m., the bloodhound was on the scene and Geise decided he had to send the 25 volunteers out on foot to begin a sweep of a 6-square-mile area. ""It's been fruitless so far,"" the chief said an hour later.

Point Township police began investigating the death of Todd Sees after his body was discovered Aug. 5 in a wooded area at the western base of Montour Ridge about 150 yards from his house. An autopsy failed to conclude a cause of death and toxicology tests were ordered. ""Right now we're on hold until we get the test results,"" Point Township Police Chief Gary Steffen said Tuesday. The blood tests are expected to take another four or five weeks, he said. ""It's just a waiting game,"" Steffen said. ""Something certainly caused his death. The answer has to be in the blood."" Sees was reported missing on the afternoon of Aug. 4, hours after he left his home on an ATV to go scouting for deer on Montour Ridge. A family member found the ATV about two miles from his home, but there was no sign of Sees. About 200 volunteers, along with tracking dogs and searchers in helicopters, looked for the missing man for several hours. About 30 hours after he went missing, Sees' relatives stumbled upon his body in a densely wooded area of the ridge about 150 yards from his house. Northumberland County Coroner James Kelley said the autopsy revealed Sees had been dead between 24 hours to 36 hours, but found no signs of trauma or of coronary disease. n E-mail comments to mmoore@dailyitem.com  Investigation into man's death a 'waiting game' By Marcia Moore The Daily Item NORTHUMBERLAND Investigators are still awaiting toxicology results to determine what killed a 39-year-old Northumberland County man found in the woods near his home last month.

I leaned closer to the window across my husbands lap to get a better view. I told him to look but he could not see anything. I kept trying to point it out. He accused me of making a scene. I watched and wondered if I was seeing a UFO. I sat back and thought about it, and when I leaned over to look again I noticed another aircraft flying towards the silver oval. This other aircraft looked like it was painted in military camouflage. I tried to tell my husband again, but he was scorning the idea. The clouds began to cover my view so I could not see anymore. What makes this odd to me is this.... Earlier this year I had a dream that I was chasing some sort of aliens that were jumping and swimming along the coast. I was running along the beach with a flashlight trying to get a better look at them. I never did catch up to them. After seeing the UFO I went camping with family on the beach 2 weeks later. I heard something out in the water with headlights. I grabbed a flashlight and it was deja`vu. I was running along the beach with a flashlight chasing something that was in the water.

The view was most sharp and clear, and the cylinder was probably more than 10,000 feet up, and perhaps several thousand feet below our plane (maybe much closer, depending on actual size).  The visibility was clear and sunny - I could see the farm squares below.  The object was a deep but bright orange-red.  It didn't seem to have a real cone of a nose, but more blunted.  There were no wings and nothing being exuded out the rear.  I pictured something like an old fashioned cylindrical 500 gallon water tank but twice or three times as long and painted red.  The paint didn't even give a feeling of sophisticated, just heavily enameled. I thought of a large military missile, but could not conceive of how it would be propelled in the air.  Because of the plane motion the object almost appeared to be still, but the ground scenery way below changed at a different rate as the ground relative to our wings.  I saw it for perhaps 30 to 45 seconds - when you are observing something that doesn't belong, time can be a difficult thing to judge ... I did not look at my watch, though I specifically examined its relationship with the plane and the ground.  I looked back and forth from the ground out from front of plane to back, I looked at the other people in the plane, and noone was paying any attention, then I went back to observing the object.  The scenery below was farm rectangles, with rare farmhouses and barns, which were tiny compared to the relatively near cylinder.  It struck me as odd that since I was in the air, not my normal world (I am a land lover), then perhaps it was wrong of me to make any assumptions about what was right or wrong about the appearance of this object in the air below the plane.  The noise of the turbo prop was so loud that it was impossible to talk to anyone else, and by the time we landed around 4PM in Fort Smith I was totally absorbed w! ith the new terminal which had just opened that week.",2002-11-04T00:00:00,,

Above the Lufthansa which was banking northward toward Logan Intn Airport from the east, was another, higher altitude aircraft heading in an easterly direction. Farther up, above the higher aircraft I noticed what appeared to be an orange light.  It wasn't much more than a speck in the sky and I'm amazed I had even spotted it. It was very high up but seemed to be reflecting the sun's light making it appear as an orange light. The sun was on it's way down but the sky was still bright.  Nothing was giving off that orange glow when the sun is setting, not even the higher altitude jet-liner which was just white(no vapor trail). The light appeared to just be hovering.  I sat and watched for maybe 30 seconds when I had decided to run in the house and grab my 30X Spotting Scope and alert my brother to what I was looking at. We both got outside and the light was still at the same spot in the sky.  As I tried to get a better look at it with the Spotting Scope, it began to slowly move NNW which caused me to have to jump of the back porch to keep it in my sight as I feared it would go behind the tree overhead.  My brother was having a bitch of a time spotting this thing by the way. As I wormed my way through off the deck, the object stopped just at the edge of the leaves of the tree, luckily, since I was nearly pressed up against the house trying to get the thing in my scope. Once it stopped, I managed to get it in my scope and saw it to be a cylindrical object, orange in color, possibly from the sun reflecting off of it. At this time I had my brother jump of the deck as well and used the leaves as a reference point for him to look and then he finally caught sight of it. Seconds later, it slowly drifted off to the NNW and dissapeared behind the tree. I ran out to the front yard but failed to find it again. I was thinking it to be possibly the International Space Station but, to my knowledge, the Space Station doesn't stop then move on again,,,does it?  Would it even be possible to see the Station during daylight hours? ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  The ISS is sometimes visible during evening hours, but it does not stop.

The direction I was facing was South-Southeast, the sun was at about 60 degrees off the horizon to the West. This object was not reflecting light from the Sun however. The blinking pattern was like this: Flaaash,pause,pause,pause,Flaaash,pause,pause,pause,Flaaash - The flashing was longer than a standard strobe flash and the movement of the object was kind of hover like, slow movement towards the West/SouthWest. I ran inside to get my video camera and when I returned, the object was still there. The size of this thing and relative distance would be about the size of normal star in the night sky.

I looked up because the sun glinted off an airplane very very high in the sky.  Below it I noticed a very dark, but not totally black, object moving southwest slowly in a straight line. It looked small - because of the altitude, I suppose, though I had no context to determine its true size or altitude.  Holding my arm straight out and up I'd say it appeared 1/4 the size of the nail on my little finger.  It was a dark rectangle, almost a cube.  It appeared to tumble slowly once in a while because sometimes I could catch a glimpse of blue sky as if it were not just a cube, but a very thick U shape.  Hm, that sounds weird.  Maybe it would be better to say that the solid shape had a bite out of the edge and I could see the blue sky through it when it presented that face to me.  It did not reflect light, it had no wings, there were no lights on it, and I couldn't hear it.  There was no trail.  It was high off the horizon and traversed maybe 50 degrees; it was never near the horizon.  When I first noticed it, it was maybe over Lake Forest Park or Lake Washington.  I was looking north.  I watched it until it got to a bit south of NE 104th St where I was standing on 15th Ave NE, but farther west.  Then it appeared to stop, though it could have been going due west and only appeared to stop since I was looking west by then.  Then after 15 seconds or so, it very slowly, slower than it had gone southwest, started going north, though it may have only looked like it was going so slow if it were actually going northwest.  It was slowly getting smaller.  At that point the bus came and I stopped watching. I thought it might be a weather balloon (not that I've ever seen one) but the shape was not round and unless there were upper altitude winds blowing straight southwest, the line of travel didn't seem consistent with a balloon drifting around.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  P.S. I am not a UFO enthusiast.",2002-11-04T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

The two lights were extremely large, very white, not blinking, twice as big as any large planet I've ever seen, and obviously following each other -- they maintained their distance from each other and traveled the same course. We were struck first by the size and brightness, but then by the fact that there was no sound --- we waited for any jet/commercial airline sounds to catch up to the visual, but it never came [several commercial airlines had crossed the skies earlier]. After a couple of minutes the first one started dimming, then completely disappeared.  The second light did the same a few seconds later.  There were no clouds in the sky, and all stars around these lights were visible the entire time.

((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE)) Dear Mr. ((deleted)),   The object in the film traversed, I estimate, not less than 60 degrees of arc, as viewed from the video camera, in 11 frames of video.  Video cameras collect 30, or sometimes 60 frames, per second.  Hence, the object captured on video by FOX 23 covered 60 degrees in approximately one-third of a second.  The ISS does not do that while in orbit.   Do you concur with my analysis, please?    Cordially,    Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) Mr. Davenport,   I'm afraid I would have to disagree, given the location it's quite possible that the flight path trajectory of the ISS would have been similar. http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/elements/index.html ((NUFORC RESPONSE)) Direction of view, perhaps.  Elapsed time, no.     Please see the entries at <www.heavens-above.com> for stats on sighting  the ISS, and all other bodies in orbit.   The ISS is usually visible for up to 4-5 minutes, when it passes overhead, or within 30 degrees of overhead.    The object in the video was visible...I repeat...for 1/3 of a second, during which time it traversed 60 degrees (est.) of arc, or roughly speaking, 180 degrees of arc per second.    The ISS, when viewed from the surface of the Earth, passes overhead at approximately  1/2 degree per second, or less.    Hence, there are from two, to three, order of magnitude (!!!) difference between the ISS and the anomalous body in the film, vis-a-vis angular velocities.

Because of the full moon and because of city lights visibility was very good. While looking northeast we noticed what looked like a string-like cloud in the very distinct shape of a bommerang moving towards us. It immediately caught our eye because it hung so low for a cloud and it moved at a steady clip. We kept watching it expecting it to dissipate but instead it continued on a steady path southward and began morphing into different shapes, ungulating as it moved in the way a deep-sea jelly fish might move. But this thing was much more elastic, at once spreading out like a string then shaping into a V, curling its tails around then gathering into more of a cloud shape and again stretching out. It sometimes broke up into little tails or simply stretched out uniformly, like someone pulling at taffy. It felt as if it was scanning the city, never rising, never dropping, justing floating by at a constant speed completely silent. We thought we saw faint lights at the ends of the tails and it shimmering in general. We also smelled a distinct acrid burn in the air, almost like an electrical fire, that would appear, disappear then reappear (in keeping with the ungulating nature of movement?). Our first reaction was it had something to do with the meteor showers, a ""terminal burst in the lower atmosphere"". But then, not knowing what that looks like, I would expect that to have the characteristic of linear progression i.e. dying out, like striking a match. Instead this thing was in no way disappearing. It had the feeling of  living matter and we watched it continue its path through the city till it passed from our sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded credible to us.

While watching the Leonids, my son (14) and I saw an object aproximately 4 times Jupiters diameter cross from east to west in a somewhat irregular motion. Time from initial discovery to loss of visual contact was about 20 seconds. The object had a strange sort of movement that I think can best be described as a jerky, low frame rate film with maybe 1/30 second gaps between movements. The color shifted from gold to brown to orange. The overall effect was a muddy orange coloration. The objects direction was straight at first, almost like a satelite's but traveling at about 2 1/2 times faster across the sky than a satelite would normally be seen travelling. The object turned slightly south east for the last five seconds that it was seen. The object slightly dimmed after the small change in direction for about two seconds. It then turned SSE for no more than probably 1/4 second and instantly vanished completely. During the first five seconds or so, I was looking at the object with my naked eye. For the next maybe 15 seconds, I followed the object with my 15 x 70 astronomical binoculars. Visually the object looked like a dim but larger than Jupiter object with light intensity changing +/- by as much as 1/3. When seen through my binoculars, it had a totally different look. Through the binoculars the object looked like a giant autumn leaf flying through the air as though alive. Again, while seen through the binoculars, the object had a beatifully fluid although slow frame rate movement. I say fluid because the frame rate of the movements remained pretty consistent.

In the process of watching the sky my daughter thought she saw a star move across the sky.  She asked me to look and to my surprise I also saw what appeared to be a star moving across the sky.  It was not a shooting star because it did not seem to be falling but moving in a horizontal direction over the sky.  As we were watching this happen we saw another object, that also looked like a star moving towards the first object.  We continued watching and proceeded to notice several of these star looking objects moving all around.  They appeared to stay in pairs except for one that stayed seperate from the others.  As we watched them move we saw them come to abrupt stops in mid-flight and seem to be suspended in air.  They would make right angle turns and also appeared to be doing 360 circles within there air space.  They were not spinning in one spot but literally doing a full circle in the area and would go from that motion into either a 90 degree turn or shoot straight across the sky.  They almost appeared to be ""dancing"" across the sky but always within what seemed to be their ""area of space"" and in pairs except for the lone ""star.""  It was simply amazing.

I have never seen a UFO although I have been looking for one for a long time. Early this morning from about 0520 to 0610 I was out in an open field watching the Leonid meteor showers. At approximately 0545 I noticed a bright, very high object traveling across the sky. I was standing at the edge of a treeline to my back, which blocked my view from the SSE to the NNW. When I noticed the first object it appeared in the sky about 75 to 80 degrees above the horizon, the moon would have been about 30 degrees to my right. It traveled in a straight line across the sky. Since the sun was about to come up I could see the arc of light that the sun made in the eastern sky. The arc extended from the ENE to ESE. The first object traveled across the sky ENE. I first took it to be a satellite but I have seen satellites before and this one seemed to travel faster than the ones I have seen before. As it reached the upper edge of the arc the sun made it disappeared from view. About 5 minutes later another bright object appeared in the same area of the sky and traveled in the same direction, same speed and the same altitude as the first. It disappeared from my view in the same area of the sky, which would have been about 40 degrees above the eastern horizon. I think the thickness of the atmosphere caused it to be hidden to my view. All this time I was seeing the meteors as they entered the atmosphere and burned up. The third object appeared in about the same area as the first two about 5 minutes later but traveled more in an easterly direction. I know there is a lot of space junk in orbit so I can’t discount that. But I don’t think that many satellites would have traveled across the sky that close together in time. It took the objects about 20 seconds to travel the distance that I was able to observe them. There were other aircraft in the sky at the same time but they were airliners and much, much lower in altitude. Do satellites orbit ! in this direction and do they orbit in these numbers and this close in time? The objects were definitely not meteors or aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing satellites, which were being illuminated by the rising Sun in the east.  However, please see other reports for this date, which seem equally serious-minded, and which apparently do not describe orbitting satellites.  PD))",2002-11-20T00:00:00,28.8791,-82.2193

Now we have recently seen it as early as 7-8p.m. and in different areas around where we live.Do you think it could be some new type of craft that the govt/army might be testing?

Some time between 11:15PM and 11:30PM Saturday night, August 18th, my sister noticed that a few of the stars overhead were moving.  We had been relaxing on the backyard deck, watching shooting stars along with my wife, father and father in law.  I couldn't think of any reason any of the ""non-shooting"" stars would be moving and asked her to point them out.  She did and said she was a little bit ""freaked out.""  There were 3 lights about the same apparent size and brightness as an average star.  They were moving in a triangle from west to east and seemed very high in the sky.  None of the lights were pointing in the direction of travel ; they seemed to be moving with what would be the bottom of a right triangle at the front.  They were traveling slightly slower than a satellite.  A satellite would be the closest thing I could think of to describe this phenomenon but I've never heard of satellites traveling in formation (perhaps they do?).  In retrospect I don't know if it was one object or three, it didn't strike me as a single object at the time.  Had we not been looking directly at the stars for some time we would definitely not have noticed them.  They were silent and if they had stopped, would have been blended in completely with the night sky.  Very unspectacular compared to the shooting stars we'd seen all night but very unnerving.  You had to watch them for a few moments to fully realize what you were seeing.  We watched them travel across the sky for 5 or 6 minutes and they disappeared behind the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Several similar reports for the evening on this date.  We suspect the objects may be the three satellites that have been reported to NUFORC on many occasions, and which we believe are part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system.

The first report stated that a large ball of flame was noted passing by the aircraft at their 10 o'clock position.  After the object passed by he reported a large, visible contrail along the object's downward path. The first aircraft reported the object as a daytime meteor. The object's downward movement and contrail was confirmed by at least three other aircraft. No geographic references were noted in any of the reports so I can't tell you exactly where this all happened.

It buzzed my neighborhood moved to hover above some trees which I am guessing to be about 400 yards away. After a while it went off into the treeline and dissapeared out of sight.

I looked down my street ( I live in a small village about 1 hr north of NYC at the foot of the catskill mountains). All of a sudden I saw an orangish(?) ball of light go from left to right across my street. It was pretty fast, but from what I can recall it seemed to be about 100 feet over the rooftops and I would guess about 200 feet away, but the distance could have been deceptive. It seemed to be about the size of a basketball. It vanished about 1-2 secs later behind the house on the other side of the street. There DEFINATELY was no sound of engines. I'm not really sure if I want to call the police and ask if anyone else had seen anything. They'll think I'm nuts ! I would love to know if anyone else had seen anything. I'm not sure if it was Fri or Sat night , but it was before the recent snowstorm. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a date of January 26, which is not possible.  We have requested clarification.  We assume he may have in mind the dramatic fireball event seen on January 20, 2002.  We have amended the date here.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) This is from the guy who posted a sighting in Goshen, NY. Again, I am sorry about the mixup of the dates. I checked several sources and the date was DEFINATELY the 18th of January!  I know you said dates were very important, so I checked with several people as to the date of the storm over the long Martin Luther King weekend. It occured approximately 10:30 the previous night- the sky was clear and it hadn't snowed yet, so that would definately would have been the 18th. If you have any questions, you may e-mail me back at this address. Sincerly,  ((name deleted)) ((END))",2002-09-06T00:00:00,41.3789,-74.3637
