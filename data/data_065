At approximately 8 pm last night, while grilling on my back deck, I noticed four airplanes flying due north in a straight line, directly over my house, at an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 feet. These were large commercial jets, likely 737s or larger, and from my vantage point were separated by no more than one mile. While we live smack-dab in the middle of a very busy air-traffic corridor, we never see commercial planes traveling this due-north trajectory (instead, most commercial jets pass over us at a lower altitude, heading west on final approach to MacArthur or Kennedy airports). And these planes were VERY close together -- as I said, no more than a mile between the first and fourth in the line, and probably less than that. In fact, the third and fourth planes almost seemed to be jockeying for position, racing extremely close to each other before falling into line. Worthy of note: All four appeared to have their anti-collision lights on full and were very bright. I suppose my eyes could have deceived me; this could have been a military formation heading north toward Connecticut, or perhaps the planes were not as close together as they appeared. But I've lived near major airports my entire life, and I believe I can identify commercial airliners; I also believe they were traveling at the same approximate altitude, and most certainly the same speed. My 6-year-old son also witnessed the jet formation. I noticed a triangular UFO was reported last month in Riverhead, which is our town here on Long Island (Wading River is our hamlet). I doubt that report was related to this event, and these planes did not appear otherworldly in any sense. But it was very, very strange to see commercial jets flying like this, and I thought it was worthy of mention.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,40.9406,-72.8348

It was definitely not a plane as it was not moving.  I'm unable in my knowledge to come up with a rational explanation.  My sister, who was driving, noticed it when I pointed it out, but as she was driving, she had only caught a few brief glimpses of it.  My other sister was as oblivious to it.  As background, we make fun of her for never being able to spot or find anything.  As we were turning off the highway, the object went out of view due to a hill obstructing our quickly changing view.  The object was shiny, glistening high in the sky.  I'm not familiar with the stratosphere or troposphere and find it difficult to describe it's height above ground.  It was high, but within what I would guess is the troposphere.  It was farther in distance from us, across terrain, compared to it's distance above the ground.  Much farther.  The shape wasn't very definitive in form--the closest thing I can compare it to being a polished stone.

Well first of all please at least see the pictures I have a lot of them  this encounter may sound a little unusual but it did happen and I haven’t slept for 2 days taking pictures and preparing this report ha-ha because I’d really like some feedback on what these are and what I should do   It isn’t anything new however I have visited Mt. Rainier but it’s a disclosed location and I go to the sattva sanctuary at Mt. Adams where all are welcome to “sky fish” as we call it…   Anyway long story short because I have plenty of pictures…. I was outside in my backyard….and I noticed a light...the light turned orange within a few seconds and started to flare a bit then disappeared as a series of smaller white lights “kind of like smaller twinkling stars” started appearing and forming a quadrangle or half diamond shape. I knew then that I was dealing with the same lights I go far off into the woods to see….so I immediately grabbed a camera and started taking pictures  The small white flickering lights stayed in the sky for awhile as a couple slightly visible orbs or orb like entities started flying around the backyard….you could just see them but it was hard….so I started taking pictures…..and there were a lot more than expected….at one point I took a picture of my brother and it was terrifying what came back.  The largest orb “the one you could see visibly best” kept following me…I have the pictures he followed me right to the sliding glass door…then went over to the kitchen window and waited….I didn’t know what to do I mean it’s obviously an intelligent being…so I didn’t say anything out loud but I did say….you’re welcome inside come in and maybe try and interact?  Well sure enough it came flying through and another one behind it “I have pictures of all of this” a lot more came in than expected and sort of started just cruising around….but at one point they started building these holographic type structures…you could BARELY see them with your eye…but you could see them rather well with a big flash on your camera... All that happened after that is they made these beautiful elaborate transparent structures “I have pictures of all this” but then I noticed once they were finished….creatures started coming out…and not the friendly kind “I have pictures” some pretty scary looking and very strange things….it almost seemed like hologram like they were just manifested images not actual reality because some of the entities and creatures were just so different and unreal…  Anyway I still see a lot of orbs….no weird pictures of anymore creatures I just try and stay positive…my friend was saying they could be something called reptilians these evil aliens who are from another dimension…however these did seem like they could be either from another dimension or at least light spectrum…but I wasn’t too keen on the idea they seem pretty harmless….a little frightening at times….but harmless….I hope  If you have any further inquiries or would like to come visit infrared cameras REALLY help so does any type of night vision….I’ve been using a basic camera and I can see a couple orbs and other funny shaped light structures flying around almost every picture I take…I have about 300…don’t worry I won’t send them all…  Thanks for your time guys  This is not a joke either please at least look at the pictures before you think its all nonsense….thanks,2010-02-14T00:00:00,47.4061,-121.9953

At this moment I started glancing as the stars and the moon, as it is at its brightest today.  I first noticed a very small, faint cigar shaped object going by at a relatively steady speed in between two stars, my first thought was it being a satellite, and instantly told my girlfriend who was walking with me to look upwards, she had some trouble seeing it as the object was relatively above us, and there were no objects in the ground to help give an idea of its precise location.  After a few seconds she managed to get a small look at it, before her eyes gave way and got teary, making her look away and loose sight of the object.  It was at this time that I first noticed a very disturbing behavior in the object as it made a very small zig zag across the sky, and then proceeded to join about five or so objects in a kind of formation, these! other objects appeared to have suddenly emerged as this happened or maybe my sight was so fixed upon the amazing maneouver the  first object had just made.

At times the middle light would expand outward to the left (northeast) and would become milky and poorly organized.  It appeared to remain stationary and then moved slowly toward Nubble Light and then moved back toward Kennebunk Beach then back again toward the Nubble Light where it remained until it disappeared.  The Coast Guard thought it might be a tanker with halogen lights waiting to enter Portsmoutn Harbor.  The strange thing was that because of the full moon and clear skies though we could clearly see the outline of the Nubble Lighthouse we were never able to see any outline of a ship even with binoculars or the telescope.

This day, January 30, 2010 at approximately 19:00 hours, I as well as two others were witness to a UFO flying overhead. At the base of the Oakland Hills, myself as well as three other friends, were on the outdoor deck of a penthouse on the fourth floor of an apartment building. Our focus was on the horizon just over the hills due to the reason that a friend mentioned that the moon rises so quickly at night over the hill. While we were waiting as we observed the glow of the moon thru the fog rolling over the hill, two of the three friends went into the house (the residents of the apartment.) I remained outside because at 25 years of age I had never witnessed the moonrise before. While the other and myself were anxiously waiting for the moon to peak over the hill he shouted, “ A UFO, a UFO!!!” I immediately looked to where he was pointing and I saw a triangle shaped object. It was three translucent reddish-colored orbs in a symmetrical “pyramid” shape. The top! of the triangle, the point, was at the head of the direction it was moving. It was moving at a higher rate of speed at an altitude higher than that of planes that regularly fly over the same area. Its rate of speed during the sighting never wavered. It remained at a constant speed throughout the sighting. At the time it was in our field of view, there was not one other plane or object in the sky. The only things in the sky in view were the stars. When he shouted, the male resident of the apartment raced out to the deck (back patio) and immediately saw the UFO. He was the only one who said he “heard” it. Myself as well as the other fellow who first observed the object did not hear anything. It was just “gliding” thru the sky. I have never seen anything like it. It was funny or odd to me that several minutes after the sighting, as we were all in amazement of what we had just observed, I noticed the sky began to fill up with airplanes flying overhead. This was odd to me due to the fact that when the UFO was in the sky there were no other objects present except the sky and stars. Several seconds soon after the UFO traveled out of our field of view, is when planes began to fly in their respective patterns overhead.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,37.80316672771673,-122.2309960927961

My grandfather and I were flying on a plane from Milwaukee and stopping in Atlanta, GA, from there to go to Cancun and on to Cozumel.  It was about 6:30 in the morning, and we had just taken off.  The sky was dark and clear with very few clouds, and it was my second time on an airliner so I was looking out through the window.  As we were passing over a town outside of milwaukee, I noticed a large spotlight passing over a few neighborhoods.  The yards and streets that it passed over were brightly illuminated.  You could see the grass in the fields and chimneys on the rooftops and such as they were being lit up as the light was passing, and you could see the outline of the light.  I looked to see a helicopter or even a plane generating the light but I could not find one.  I told my grandpa to look over and check it out and he said he didn't know what it was either.  I was tempted to ask a flight attendant but noticed they were pretty busy, so I just let it go.  The moon was out and full, but i've never heard of the moon creating such a focused, concentrated light of which I saw. I followed the light up and you could see the light was in a conic, searchlight projection, but nowhere was there anything to be making it.  No tower, plane, or helicopter.  The light seemed to be shining down from about 1-2 hundred feet up.   I followed the light for a good 2-3 minutes and then it dissapeared.  It was sort of making the same path as the plane, except that it had more of a wavy pattern slowly angling away from the plane and it moved very quickly. It came back into sight again shortly after and then it just vanished, like if someone just flipped off the switch.   I don't know if anybody else had seen it, but it was clearly something strange.  If it were being emitted from some sort of aircraft, the plane had amazing stealth technology because the only thing seen was its searchlight.

I find myself in a very desolate part of New Mexico on Highway 60 heading east.  I am on the road so early because I couldn't sleep, I am sure with anticipation of the very long drive to Denver ahead of me.  I have driven up to Eager Arizona to see a friend, stay the night and head out the following day.  It was suggested to take 60 because it's a much prettier drive than Interstate 40.  I had done that so many times, I could drive that in my sleep, a new route was in order.  However, because it was so very dark, I didn't see much.  The occasional fog patch and lone vehicle heading in the opposite direction.  I could see silouettes of the landscape and there was snow on the ground that dimly luminated my surroundings.  I was awake.  Very awake.  Just finished a large cup of coffee, listening to Sirius stand-up comedy (satellite radio) and driving very fast 75-85 mph.  I was alone on this road. Judging from some of the signs I had passed, I thought I was coming up on a small town and slowed down a bit.  I started to gain on a mini van and decided to hold back and not pass until we went through the town.  Being the kind of driver I am, I am constantly looking at my surroundings.  Both side mirrors, rear view mirror and of course, straight ahead.  Not coming up on any town and I start to think about passing the van.   I look in my driver side mirror and there is suddenly a vehicle directly behind me, only more toward the center of the two lane highway than in my lane.  As if it were thinking about passing me.  I'm thinking, what the...I did not see anything in the distance, had not gone around any curves, nothing obscured my view of several miles behind or in front of me.  I did not pass any roads either for somebody to get on to the highway.  My first impression other than how freakishly close it was to my tailgate, was that is was the grill of an older model 80's, boxy Chevy truck.  I never saw a truck, just what I have illustrated on my drawing.  It was directly, 3 - 4 FEET behind me.  We are traveling at maybe 75 mph. .. I'm thinking, pass me buddy.  I look in my rearview, see only the lights (not all of them), side view, looks like it wants to go around.  I move to the right to indicate he is cleared for passing. Look again, it's right on me, look forward to make sure I am not too close to the van which is at a very safe distance, then look back to see where it is.  It vanished.  I even slowed down to look behind me to see where it went, no dust from going off the road, we did not pass a road to turn (going to fast and it was far too close to me to make a sudden turn), there were no ditches, no tail lights behind...nothing.  Just gone. At the time, I wasn't thinking UFO, but I thought the grill was odd and the lights weren't the average color or placement. Why didn't I see the shape of  the truck I thought it was?  Why were the main headlights a soft orange and why was there more than one turn signal light? Honestly, I did not see the whole thing, just what I could see in my drivers side mirror at a very close range.  There is no way it could have come up so fast without me seeing it.  I was going very fast and was on the lookout..(I didn't want a ticket for speeding). After it was gone, my mirror was really dirty, foggy, I rolled the window down and tried to wipe it clean. It wouldn't clean up, just smear. AND, I felt a tremendous need to sleep. I could not keep my eyes open.  I rolled the windows down, thinking the cold air would keep me awake until the sun came up.  Didn't help so much.  I fought it and finally came upon a very small town just as the sun started to come up.  I pulled over, where there were several buildings and some activity and gathered my thoughts.  At first, I thought maybe it was a ghost truck, don't laugh.  I did think that.  Then as I drove on it occurred to me Roswell was just over the mountain range...really??  could it be??  It all really struck me as bizarre, the way it happened. The rate of speed, how it suddenly appeared, how close it was to my truck and the way the ""truck grill"" looked, not quite right..and, how it suddenly vanished. Do I report this?  If so, to who?  As I showered, I checked for any weird marks..you just never know.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,33.8974,-107.02609999999999

It was not a gradual transition as with an iridium satellite, but instantaneous, as it something had switched on.  About a second after it turned white, it began making a conical shaped wake which spread out from the object and dissipated.  The object itself began leaving a thin, white trail behind it as well.

I’m curious to know if my first report was classified a hoax or a joke, and that’s why it is being ignored. I mean I have far better things to do with my time than make stuff up. I read somewhere during the extensive research I’ve conducted over the last year and a half, that a witness is more likely to be credible if he or she only ever files a single report; though credibility sharply decreases the more reports someone files.  The reason given is that UFO sightings are so statistically rare that it is highly unlikely a witness will ever have more than one UFO sighting or experience.  I can’t say for sure about anyone else, but I know that in my case that for some reason the tiny patch of sky visible from my house, as well as once at my friends house and twice at my job last year, has been teeming with highly unusual activity.  Last night that act! ivity continued. I was outside over by my car that I share with my grandmother; whom I also take care of, and of course I was sky-watching. (I saw something 8 summers ago that has had me intently watching the sky ever-since)  I was facing north and looked over to my left(north by northwest of where I’m standing) and saw something flying in an extremely erratic fashion. It had a flashing white light on it that for the most part was in one second intervals; though the pattern was somewhat irregular.  Every time the light would blink off, when it blinked back on the object had moved an insanely long distance.  But it wasn’t simply traveling forward. It was moving forwards, backwards, diagonally and side-to-side. I’ll put it to you like this. If this craft had a solid light instead of a blinking light, the pilot could have written its name just by maneuvering.   I’m sure you are familiar with what happened at Stephenville Texas, right?  Yea it would have probably looked a lot like that.  I stood there and watched for about 2 or 3 minutes as this object darted around the sky the same way an electromagnetic charge instantaneously jumps from pole to pole.  If there was a human pilot flying this object, unless he is using some unknown super-technology, he or she would not have been able to withstand the G force required to make manuevers like this.  The oddest thing is that the object should have passed out of view; and if it was moving straight it would have. Instead it was moving in every possible direction, but never the same direction for very long.  Finally I just laughed and said to myself, “show off!”   The funny thing is that it isn’t the first time I’ve witnessed something very similar. Like I said in my last report I stopped filing reports after the first one to MUFON last year. No one is willing to come near NJ because of Morristown, but all that would be water under the bridge if I could just get an investigator with some high-tech cameras, video-recorders and infrared equipment to come down here and set up shop for a! night or two. Forget for the moment that almost no one sees stuff like this on a regular basis, because for once there is someone who really does.  I have a 141 IQ, am highly educated through collegiate and self-taught means and my vision is 20/15. I am a writer, work as a waiter, have an elderly grandmother to take care of, and absolutely no time to take out of my busy day to file a fake UFO report. Why would I ridicule a topic that I have extensively studied and found to be extraordinarily credible; based on things like the disclosure project, the Rendalshim Forrest incident, O’Hare Airport, the 1951 incident where dozens of UFO’s buzzed the white-house, the “battle” of LA, combined with what I have seen with my own eyes? I’d give anything if someone would come down here with some good image-recording equipment because whatever is going on down here isn’t normal, by any stretch of the imagination.",2010-06-23T00:00:00,,

The trees are fairly close, within a mile, but the object was obviously much farther away and higher in the sky. It moved toward the east at a steady clip, moving from due north to nearly northeast within a matter of  2 minutes. At this point, now in the northeast, it began to ascend. The UFO climbed then disappeared momentarily, for maybe 5 seconds or so, and then reappeared much smaller and still climbing. It had gone from being visible at about the size of a pea, and once it reached it's highest point it was the size of most noticeable stars in the sky.

My friend and I were outside my house smoking a cigarette, looking up at the sky to determine whether or not the wind was blowing from the east or the west.   While we were looking up in the sky, we saw 2 enormous formations of 10-12 individual lights.  They appeared to be very high in the sky, as they moved southwest, and the other branched off and moved southwest.  They were moving at an incredibly high rate, moving accross the entire sky in less than 10 seconds.  The formation was that of a V, and was slightly distorted.   The lights seemed to not be moving still while flying, but rather dancing around a bit while going very fast.   They eventually ran accross the sky, and disappeared before they actually left the horizon.  They just seemed to melt into the sky after awhile.  Also, everything around the V seemed to disrupt as well.  The clouds along with the starts out seemed to dissapear and reappear and fluctuate as the V went by.   We at first were convinced that it was the shape of a stealth fighter, and since our proximity to the CIA as well as Quantico meant it was simply just a plane such as that.  However, we decided it couldn't be that, because those planes do not have active divises to hide like that.  The lights were just dots in the sky, slightly larger than normal stars in the sky.  They were moving at an incredible rate, and had no other comparison to anything on Earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I live in Claremont, Ca, a suburb of Los Angeles, a city that lies against mountains, on the other side of those mountains is desert.  I believe we are stationed in a path on the way to a military base, as I have often seen military helicopters flying over, and we are stationed on some sort of air travel path as many vehicles fly overhead often.  I noticed that it was a very clear day.  I was standing looking westward, which I consider to be Los Angeles, and I noticed a bright white light in the sky.  Which is unusual, as you don’t usually notice lights in the sky during the day.  It was metallic and white looking and I thought it moved unusually.  It was extremely bright and from a distance just looked like a spot/metal.  It was very far in the distance and seemed very high, so I thought if it moved closer I could tell if it was a plane or a helicopter.  As it came nearer and closer, I noticed there was a red tint to it as well.  I thought it maybe a blimp.  As it moved towards me, along this northeast path, along the mountains, and the same direction as the weather clouds today, it became brighter.  The white/diamond light became stronger and it also flashed red.  The lights were unusual, more high-tech than most planes or other flying objects.  The shape was cigarish.  I became slightly frightened as the light was very bright.  It continued moving on its path over my home and along the northeast latitude along the mountains, and continued until it was out of sight.  The entire time was approximately five to seven minutes.  I did not have the time to go inside and get binoculars in order to get a closer view.  I have seen an unusual light at night one other time, but this was by far the rarest and most unusual sighting.  The movement was also strange, as it moved in a very fluid and smooth/high tech manner.   As far as I could tell, it was not emitting sound that I could hear.  I have heard other auditory flying vehicles in the air ! since I sighted it, but I cannot see what craft is emitting that sound. I tried to do a quick research as to weather this could have been a weather balloon, but my immediate response that I’ve found seems to be that weather balloons do not emit light.  My background is mostly that I have an interest in many things, but I do have a slight knowledge of ufo subject matter, and I do sometimes listen to coast to coast, and sometimes read on the internet.  I noticed when I went on your website and looked at other sightings that someone in Rancho Cucamonga has written to you, which I find interesting as that is a neighboring city, although we saw two different colors of lights, we did see things in a similar time area.  I will try in the coming days to keep an eye out, and will possibly try to go outside tomorrow at the same time.  I have to say, today’s visibility is exceptional, and visibility here changes day to day and hour to hour.  Yesterday it was overcast.  Also, smog, clouds, being against mountains, etc. influences.

We left the store around 10:15 pm. My store receipt reads that we checked out at 22:10:13. It was the fourth of July and there were many fireworks in the area.  We were driving west.   As we turned south toward our neighborhood, I noticed a red and orange fireball just above the trees to the west.   It seemed to have a red center with a orange misty glow around it.  It was about the height of a street light and from our point of view, the outer glow looked like the size of a basketball.  It was difficult to tell if the ""glow"" was part of object or due to viewing it through the windshield. I traveled a block south and turned west on a street toward our neighborhood.   I turned a street earlier than I usually do to get a better look at the object.  When I came to the next intersection, 1/2 block distance, we saw the object above a house to the south.  We turned south.  I told my 11 year old son to keep an eye on it as I drove.   I traveled the length of two more blocks (still going south)  and then turned west again.  The object was now above the houses on the south side of the west bound street.  We drove two blocks to our house.  I pulled into the driveway.  My husband was in the yard with the kids.  I jumped out of the car and pointed it out to my husband.  It was south of our house in the sky at about a 45 degree angle and getting small but still too bright to be a star - and it was orange red.   We  watched it get smaller assuming it was getting further away.   It took several minutes before it disappeared. I went inside and the family continued to shoot  fireworks.  I would estimate I was in the house ten minutes when my  son came in and said ""Dad needs you.""   When I asked why, my son said, ""The orange light is back"".   Sure enough.  In the same spot it disappeared it appeared again  It looked like a very bright orange star.  I watched it for several minutes then came inside.  My husband reported it moved slightly to the west and then grew small and disappeared again. What drew our attention to the object was the  fourth of July fireworks in our area.   As we were driving home and nearing our neighborhood, we were watching the fireworks.   A large firework in that area lit off but this orange ball didn't move.   We expected it to explode and it didn't.   At first I thought it was a street light on fire or a fire in the trees.   Then as it floated above the houses, I wondered if it were a parachute type firework that was on fire and I was concerned about where it was going to land. When we first saw it, it was floating about the height of the street light and below the trees.  It climbed to float above a one story house.  Soon it was above the larger two story houses and when we finally saw it in the distance it seemed to be very high in the sky. We zigzagged in a south and west pattern to our home.  The object seemed to move south - southwest.  My vehicle was moving slowly at a 15 mph estimated speed.  The object moved ahead of us and I would assume it moved a quicker speed than our vehicle,  but not much given that it dissected our route.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,41.51069365079365,-97.34733968253967

The street we were on ran north and south. A red fireball appeared in the northern skies, directly north of us, and we initially thought that it was a flare someone had shot off.  The red fireball continued to fly overhead and to the south-south-east.  It was definitely flying lower than a commercial airliner but higher that a local police or news helicopter would be flying. Its altitude was more like what the local military jets fly.  Its flight speed was also similar to what U.S. jet would be.  Also, it did not emit any noticeable jet, propeller, or helicopter rotor sounds.  Once it was almost out of site, it appeared to increase altitude and head back northerly along the same path.  We then notice two additional red fireballs coming from the same northern location and travel along the same path as the first.  I ran into the hou! se to get my binoculars and viewed the crafts as small single balls of reddish light; no other shape of the craft was apparent in the dark night sky.

He agreed that this was a strange red light indeed.  We live below a flight path of the airport so we often see incoming planes in the distance, but usually the planes we see have many red and white lights that are constantly flashing.  This object had one big red glowing light (perhaps a distant orb but all we could see was a bright red light).  We talked about the possibility of a satellite, but it was so red, and seemed much closer. It moved slowly across the sky.  There were occasional fireworks coming from either side of the sighting, but the object was in a clearing between the two houses launching the fireworks.  The light moved too slowly, too horizontally, and too straight to be a stray firework. After a minute or two of watching it move across the sky, I ran into the house to get my glasses.  The light was moving slow enough that I figured I would have time to get my glasses before the view of the light would be blocked by the trees.  To my surprise, the red light had stopped completely in its tracks. My husband and I continued to stare at the red light, as it seemed to hover in one spot.  It was completely still.  We discussed the possibility of a distant helicopter, but it was silent and completely unwavering.

On 04/02/2010 at approximately 21:30 I was out with my cousin stargazing.  We started the night looking at the Orion nebula.  I have a book of star charts and had my head in it trying to see what else in the area would be interesting to look at.  My cousin pointed to an area in the west southwest sky (Taurus the bull)  I pulled my head from the book to look in the direction she was pointing.  From the left of Taurus +30 deg heading due north toward Polaris were three dull green lights traveling at a rate at that of a satellite.  We were only able to track the lights for about 10 seconds before they were lost behind the trees in my backyard.  I immediately began looking for a logical explanation as to what they were.  I have been actively stargazing for the last five years and in that time I have seen many satellites.  Never have I seen satellites traveling in this pattern(unless NASA has launched some sort of weather satellites I wasn’t aware of).  The pale ! green color was also an abnormal color which I have never seen in an orbiting satellite.  To put it simply this event has rendered me clueless as to what myself (Age 31) and my Cousin (Age 9) saw.  One other side note as to the shape of the lights; they were orb shaped.  they were like what one would see when the space shuttle would pass over head bit at a much lower magnitude in brightness.  As for the distance apart from each other;  If you would hold your hand at arms length and make the victory symbol(or peace sign)and measure the distance apart from your index to your middle finger, that’s the distance they were apart.  From the ground they looked like the following demonstration:    (  .           .             . )   Please do not treat this as a false report.  If anyone who reads can present to me a logical explanation to what we saw, I invite your reply.  I am not reporting this looking for attention in any way.  I, for now am treating this event for what it was: an! Unidentified Flying Object.  Until it is otherwise identified! it will remain a UFO, Not aliens or visitors from far off, but simply a UFO.  Thank you for taking the time to read this report.  Sorry, one more side note.  there were no aircraft in the area, and no beacons or strobes to indicate that they were aircraft. It is so quite around my house at night you can hear a plane even when at its cruising altitude.  I know these were not planes.

As I was thinking ""What is that"" thinking it was some kind of large display set up my mother voiced out, ""What is that?"" and her husband said ""A UFO"" sarcastically, we pulled in our driveway and I ran back to look again and the huge shape in the sky was gone.  My brother got there slightly before me and said that the lights just faded.  They had an orange color.  Then I looked around and I saw 1 more steady orange light that wasn't moving. I looked away and it was gone again. I feel like I'm going crazy.  It wasn't much higher than the rooftops and the lights weren't very bright but it was still, perfectly still in the sky and definitely had a square shape between them. About 30 minutes later there was one orange light moving pretty fast through the sky, much faster than I've ever seen a plane move.  Shortly after that there were two planes going the same route  but slower that were obviously some kind of plane or jet flying through the sky.  I think most people would assume that those planes were the four lights but they weren't.  The lights were smaller, white, and blinking on the last 2 that I saw that I could recognize as planes, everything else I saw tonight I can't explain or describe well because I haven't seen anything like it before. I'm hoping that these were just some experimental US aircrafts because I am really scared now.",2010-07-06T00:00:00,42.63697640692641,-71.32283766233766

I have created a drawing of what I remember the craft looking like which I  included with this report made on Microsoft paint. It was 1977 at Bristol Mountain Ski Resort in Bristol Valley , Canandaigua, New York, the weekend that followed  Thanksgiving  Day which was November 24th, 1977.  Bristol Mountain ski resort was teaming with activity for the holiday weekend, that’s when we really used to get snow. I worked in the snack bar on the bottom floor of the Ski Lodge, along with 4 other people present that day.  We cooked Hamburg’s,  hotdogs, fries and such for customers visiting the ski resort. The only window’s in the snack bar area were a row of windows located higher up on the wall just below the ceiling, facing the Mountain across the street from Bristol Mountain ski resort.  These are the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, in the finger lakes region. It had been a busy day this Saturday November 26th, 1977.  Lunch hour was packed.  Finally the business dropped of for the snack bar and we were all just goofing around and talking, when one of the guys I worked with yelled out,  ""Hey , look at this thing across street above the Mountain!""  So we all looked out the window’s to see what he was making the big deal about. There was a perfect view of this object above the tree line of the Mountain across the street.  At first you had a hard time seeing it because it was a beautiful sun filled winter day with a dazzling blue sky.  It was like a bright orange yellow glowing severe triangular craft, with like a boomerang back to the triangle, but the craft had a severe point to the front of the triangle like to a sharp point and the back although it had a boomerang shape was not a wide type.  It looked like the shape of a paper air plain you made in school. It was just  sitting still over the Mountain top and was pointed right at Bristol Mt. Resort.  Like it was observing all the activity going on there.   We watched it for sometime until we started getting busy again, and after that point I don’t remember if it just left or what?    Over the years I have told this account to different people at parties and such and always can remember it with clarity.  I was completely blown away while surfing the internet, when I discovered that these triangular crafts have been seen by many people. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was eight years old and my parents and I were visiting their friends, somewhere rural outside of Toronto.  Not exactly sure of where but it would have been in the GTA, summer, late in the afternoon. As the only kid there, I was told to go play outside. The backyard was a large grass area, with large trees( pines and such) and wooded areas around the perimeter of the property. Anyway, I saw a movement in the sky and looked up. Gliding through the air was a ring shaped object. Not a disk, more like a substantial wedding band, with tall sides but a hollow narrow body. There was no noise, no smoke, no vapor. It was moving quite slow and low, maybe twice the height of the tree line.  The outer side of the ""band"" was black and had little white dot lights on it, similar to an electronic score board.  The ring itself did not appear to be spinning, but the white dots seemed to be scrolling around  and changing their configuration, but nothing that I could read.  The little dot symbols seemed very simple, just randomly changing and moving around.  There was no discernible front or back. It just quietly glided past with nothing changing other than the dots.  I watched it quite calmly for about 30 seconds and then it went past the treeline and I couldn't see it anymore.I then went in to get everyone to come out to the front yard to see if we could still see it.  The adults weren't that interested in my rambling about a spaceship and when I went back outside, of course it had not reappeared. Being 8 at the time, I don't seem to have a good grasp of the size. I seem to recall it being small, maybe 15 to 15 feet across. I remember thinking that it had to have very small spacemen or that it was being controlled remotely, being that the shape didn't seem like anyone could be inside. But who knows, maybe it was bigger than I remember or maybe they were really really small, lol. Over the years I have wondered if it was some sort of remote controlled aircraft or weird balloon, etc. but it just doesn't seem plausible. It was definitely flying, with no noise, no vapor, no strings and looked like a simple band horizontally gliding above the trees. I thought I would put it out there to see if anyone has ever seen anything similar ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was the captain, flying a four engine turbine powered aircraft (L-188) at flight level 230 (23,000 feet) inbound toward Indianapolis, Indiana, thence cleared to Ft. Wayne for the Detroit Star Ft. Wayne transition into YIP (Yipsilanti, Willow Run Airport, Mich.)  That’s a  'standard terminal arrival route.'   I was on a heading of about 030 degrees.  Both my first officer & flight engineer were doing other duties when I first spotted traffic at my 1100 position, 10 miles & slightly below me.  As captain, I always kept the red instrument panel lighting at a absolute minimum setting so as to have the best visibility outside.   I first spotted a cranberry red light.  It appeared as if it were just another aircraft in the clear night sky, no shape or size, just a red light in level steady flight about 4000 feet below me & 10 miles to my left moving left to right at a steady speed of about 400 knots, about the same speed I was doing.  The size of the light was just like any other aircraft’s rotating beacon or light, but this was a constant steady light, not like a normal pulsating rotating beacon that aircraft are required to have.  I noticed in was headed straight towards a large thunderstorm cloud that was at my 1 o'clock position and 10 miles.  This thunderstorm had constant & consistent in-cloud to in-cloud lighting strikes that really was lighting up the large cloud like a Chinese lantern.  The red light kept a steady 400 knot speed aiming right at the storm cloud.   Then when it got to within 200 yards of the thundercloud itself, the red light changed course from 110 degree direction to a 250 degree direction, instantly, still maintaining the constant 400 knot speed.  It didn't turn, like an aircraft makes a turn, it just changed course, instantly, like a curser on a computer is capable of doing when you jerk your mouse control quickly left to right.  Now it was heading straight towards a long line of constant lighting thunder storms, or squall line, that was at my 9 o'clock position and about 20 miles off my left wing tip.  As I watched the light move at a constant speed from my right to my left directly in front of me, it suddenly climbed at a perfect 45 degree up angle, leveled off for a about 2 miles and then climbed again at a perfect 45 degree up angle without any change in speed either time, to an altitude about 3000 feet above me.  It then turned slightly right to a heading of about 250 degrees straight toward a point just in front of the first of a long line of constant lighting thunderstorms. As soon as the red orb got established on the new heading towards the all lit up lightning squall line to my left, this red light went from its 400 knot speed to, I'm going to guess between 2ooo to 3000 miles per hour for about one long second then it again immediately went back to its slower 400 knot constant speed again.  It covered that 20 mile distance in just over a second, someone should be able to turn that into a speed in miles per hour.  It didn't accelerate up to that speed and it didn't decelerate back to the slower speed again, it just made an instant jump from a slow 400 knots to a really fast 3000 knot speed, for just over a second, covering the 20 mile distance and then immediately back to the same slower speed of about 400 knots.  It was amazing to watch.  After being a airline captain for over ten years I have never ever, before or since seen an object under such obvious control that maneuvered & changed speed instantly, at will, so they could maneuver to and observe the constant & consistent thunderstorm light show display. I watched it make one more turn to its left, a heading of about 190 degrees so as to parallel this long line of constant light shows off to its right side.  It was then behind me to my 8 o'clock position.  I brought the attention of my other two crewmembers just before the red light made its two 45 degree climbs, they saw that but couldn't see to jump in speed an jump back in speed because it was off to the left side of our aircraft.   It was under something’s control, sightseeing at thunderstorm light shows in the night, making 45 degree climbs and capable of unknown speeds that amazed me to the point that I only thought was to turn off my rotating beacon/navigation wing-tip lights to hide my aircraft in the dark from its view.  But I didn't even think to call Indy ARTCC and ask if they had it on their radar.   My two other crewmembers really didn't grasp what I quickly brought to their attention, it all was over in 2 minutes.  I saw something amazing, I don't know what it was, I just hope it was from Earth. I was an ATP, flying four engine aircraft all over North, South America and Europe, for about 30 of my 40 years aviation life, and I never even came close to having an accident.  I was lucky to always fly well maintained aircraft.   That’s my story.",2010-06-10T00:00:00,39.80764884833982,-86.14221402931499

It was late, dark, and we were driving north east on Highway 7, when I noticed a white circular light in the distance.  At first I didn't think any of it. We were in the country, it was white and rather small, so I just thought  a light on the side of a barn, off in the distance. As we continued driving, the light never fell behind our car, which seemed really odd to me.  If it was a light, we would have eventually passed it and it would have went out of sight, but instead, it continued to keep pace with us.  It was then that I asked my mom if she saw the light and she said yes and had been watching it too. The drive was about 20 minutes and the road was fairly windy, and the entire time, the light continued to travel the same path as we did.  It also seemed to bigger, which I assumed meant it was getting closer to our car.   When we got close to our house, we turned left into our neighborhood.  It was then that the light came even closer to our car, then moved ahead of us about a block down the street and hovered. It was very low in the sky, almost to the top of the tree line.   By now, we are both scared.  We drove down towards it, and made another left onto my street. Our house was two houses on the left.  We pulled into our driveway and my mom ran inside the house to get my dad.  It was at that point, the light suddenly went from white to several bright flashing colors, yellow, white, red, blue...  When my dad stepped outside, the light suddenly shot off at great speed, in a straight line, over our house and out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in summer of 1988 is approximate.

About twenty years ago while serving on board the USS carrier JFK USS CV-67, myself and seven to eight other shipmates were having some fun on the carrier's flight deck, we were on the way back to Norfolk VA, and most of the aircrafts already departed the ship back to their home bases, it's a common practice for fighter jets to fly back home.   Anyway, while on the flight deck on a very bright night an oval shiny UFO appeared out of no where, it was green yellow and bright.  It did not look like anything I have ever seen in the skies, when it appeared it looked like it was right on top of us but very high in the night sky, it stood there for about 40 to 50 seconds as if it was watching us.   Myself and the others were just speechless, none of us said a word all we did was look up in amazement without a sound then an amazing sight happened, as it came out of nowhere it left the same way only this time we witnessed how it all happened.   In a fraction of a second there was what appea! red to be a rapture in space, it looked like a door way to a different place in space, and just like that, the bright green yellow object was sucked in that door way and vanished it happened very very fast but all of us could see that, once the object was sucked in, the rapture closed behind the UFO.   I swear this is true and I have no reason to make it up I just thought  I share this event with the rest of the world. I don't know why it took me twenty years to do so but it did, believe or not I don't really care, but I'm sure of my event and this is not bull story, it really happened.

It was 2:16 AM. I was driving west towards downtown Azle on Highway 199 A.K.A Jacksboro Highway. I was looking to the left out of my driver-side window. About 2 Miles away, there was a giant gold glowing object. I could tell it wasn't a oil rig, nor gas rig. The object never moved. It wasn't on the ground or supported by any other object. The object was all one piece. At the top it appeared to be an elaborate antenna of some kind. Below the antenna, was a saucer/square shape. Below the saucer/square portion of the object was about 3 to 5 more antenna-like objects. I estimated the object to be anywhere from 250 feet to 300 foot tall. Let I remind you that it was one whole piece. I didn't stop to get a closer look, nor had a camera of any kind. I drive on that part of the highway at least once everyday, and at least once every night. My car radio's frequency was fuzzy at the time. I looked at my cell phone at that time as well, and had no service. In the same area, their are 2 cell phone service Antenna's about 3 to 5 miles apart from each other.

The air temperature at ground level was between 40 to 49 degrees Fahrenheit. The object was observed for approximately ninety seconds to two minutes thirty seconds. I was about twenty yards east of a fairly-high treeline, but was looking through a gap in the canopy (for at least the final part of the sighting). The object demonstrated the following characteristics:   1) The size of the object appeared similar to that of airliners at high altitude (30,000 ft approx.). 2) The shape of the object seemed to differ from that of airliners however (it seemed lumpish, as a large grain of sand).  This characteristic is what first caught my eye. High-quality IS binoculars were needed to clarify and I didn’t have any. 3) The color of the object was at first darkish, then further along it became highly reflective (due to solar reflection). 4) The altitude of the object was perhaps 25,000 ft to 35,000 ft as during part(s) of the sighting it seemed to be passing through high thinish cirrus-type clouds. 5)  The speed of the object appeared to be similar to airliners at altitude. 6)  The object maintained a straight course. 7)  A striking and much more clearly distinctive (vs. the indistinctive shape) characteristic was the lack of any vapor trail whatsoever. Several airliners in the vicinity [traveling in various directions] were all emitting heavy vapor trails. Finally the object seemed to pass into a thin and narrow cirrus-type cloud and I didn’t see it emerge (It may/must have but I was mildly frustrated by not seeing that).  It was about this time if I remember aright that I noticed two eastbound airliners (one trailing the other by possibly several minutes) approaching the vicinity to the south of the object. I waited a minute or two then continued on. Perhaps the lack of vapor was attributable to a propeller-driven aircraft and/or the altitude being rather lower than estimated(??). To give an inkling of the general location of the object in the sky I sighted it not directly overhead, but angled down 10 to 15 degrees to the south from the zenith, then up 60 to 80 degrees above the western horizon when initially spotted, then 30 degrees or so above the western horizon when visual contact was lost.  Admittedly I’m best-guessing here in retrospect with respect to these aerial measurements. In conclusion the incident was mildly strange.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,41.650030882352944,-91.5039944117647

(The front step faces almost directly west with a clear line of sight due to base ball diamonds adjacent to my parents acreage.) While I smoked, I looked up into the clear, cloudless sky and I was amazed at how I could see so many stars. As I was scanning the South western part of the sky I saw a small object quite low, slightly above the horizon (it looked like a star) begin to move toward the west on a roughly 45 degree angle and it continued to move until it was almost directly west of my location on the stoop (this took just seconds)but high enough in the sky that I had to slightly tilt my head back. At this point the movement stopped and many bright colored lights, red, blue, green, yellow, purple, started to flash, as if the object was rotating. The colored flashes were intense and each color was distinguishable. I took out a small set of binoculars and I was able to get a slightly better view of the colored lights, I still could not exactly determine what it was, but it was definitely spinning at a crazy speed. There is a large radio antenna about a mile west of my parents home, and from my vantage point on the step this object was at least 4-5 times higher than the height of the tower, so this gave me some perspective, It must have been quite far away. I went inside and found my sixteen year old niece and asked her to come take a look, she came outside and ran back in the house after seeing the lights. I then I went inside and asked  my mother to get out of bed to take a look at this strange flashing object. She and I stood and watched it hover at the same location for several minutes. She went back to bed and I stayed outside for 15 to 20 more minutes and watched the amazing light show.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,53.2167,-106.4

Up until about a month ago, I like many people thought that when people say they saw a “UFO” that they were a little… weird…  Even though I saw something strange in the late 90’s, I thought it was explained by the news.  After watching a recent episode of Larry King, and seeing something mentioned about the Phoenix Lights (which I had no prior knowledge of because I did not watch TV in those days, yet it reminded me of what I had seen in the 90’s) I also thought of something that my best friend (who does his best to explain stories in truth and detail) told me a few years ago that he saw.  I was puzzled by the story about he and several other people at a stop light seeing a an oval metallic disc slightly larger than a car, with lights all around it silently hovering over the intersection only about 40ft up.   He said he stepped out of the car, and it tilted a bit and took off at a VERY high speed, still making no sound.  I figured he and his wife had some sort of temporary insanity.  I found the Phoenix lights DVD on ebay, and purchased it.  I asked my friend about that story again, and told me again.  He said he never told many people because people (including myself) just looked at him like he was crazy. After watching the Phoenix lights DVD, I was amazed.  It looked just like what I had seen in the sky over Rockford at around that time.  The local news also said it was probably military flares, and that was the end of it. I assumed they were telling the truth. I started doing some research and started to scan the sky day and night, lately. My mom barrowed my Phoenix Lights DVD, as she is interested in the subject.  My step dad, who is very skeptical made a joke about her watching the sky since watching the video.  I admitted that I do, but made the joke that my chances of seeing something now that I have this interest are probably much slimmer.  It would be a very strange coincidence. The only reason it wouldn’t be less likely to see something would simply be because I am actually watching, now. I left my mom’s house on Friday night, about midnight. At about 12:30am, I was looking up at stars in the sky, as I was walking to my garage to get something.  I looked to the north east probably above the nearby cities of Loves Park, or Machesney Park, IL (about 5-10 miles away) and noticed a light that looked like it was about 400-500ft high.  No structures or towers in that area, (that I know of) are nearly that high.  The light was distant, but coming from a fairly large source, because I could tell that the lights were alternating green and red with an orange/yellow in it as well. My first thought was that it was a helicopter.  I couldn't hear it, but that seemed normal since it was so far away. I watched it for several minutes.  I figured if it was a jet or a helicopter that was flying directly away from my view, it would soon look smaller and vanish from view.  If it were flying toward me, it would do the opposite, and I would soon know for sure.  It did neither.  What it did appear to do is jerk left, then right short distances every minute or so.  I saw a jet fly by a little closer, but higher in the sky, and it looked completely different.  The light started to slowly move upward and further to the east.  I went inside and told my girlfriend to go out with me and check it out.  I got my camcorder.  I wanted to make sure I had at least these 2 witnesses, so if I told anyone, they wouldn’t just say that it was just a case of me wanting to see something since I’m suddenly interested in it (which I am sure people wll probably think anyway)  My camcorder has 3CCDs, so I knew it would pick up the colors, well, which it did, but it was too dark outside and too distant to see exactly what it was.  She watched it, and said she saw it occasionally see it jerk left and right.  To make sure that both of us didn't have a case of our eyes playing tricks on us, we put the camcorder on the light(s), and stared at a star to see if just watching a distant light that intently caused our eyes to make that effect appear, because it was so slight.  That was not the case. Over about a half hour, it looked like it had climbed a few hundred more feet in the sky.  This was also after several jets had passed it.  I decided to get into my car and drive toward it.  By the time I had gotten to where I think it was when I first saw it, It had gone several hundred more feet into the sky, and a bit further north.  By this time, it was so far away, at first glance it just blended in with the stars.  No one would notice it.  The colored lights were the same, but washed out by the distance.  This was confirmed when I got home and could see it much further up in the sky.  I had landmarks I could measure it’s movement with.  A neighbor’s roof, and a tree made good reference points.  It got to the point where I could no longer see it on my camcorder. I do not know how long a helicopter can hover, but by 2:00am, I had to get to bed, and could no longer observe.  I am no expert, but I have not ever seen a Helicopter behave that way, and can't imagine it would for any reason over loves park/Machesney Park. All I know is that we did not know what it was, and still don't after looking at the video.  I didn't know who to call if anyone to see if anyone else saw it. I was not able to watch the news last night to see if anything was reported.  I’m not sure how to find out if anything was. I found this website, and figured I would post the info here first.

I re edited my own report to shorten it up a bit.  I am in my middle ages and I pretty much know what belongs in the sky and what is not the norm.  I am also a ametuer astronomer.I ask you please to delete my report and all data pertaining to me if your not going to use this report.

My eyes were well adjusted to the dark since I was already studying the stars.The sighting lasted 10 seconds.Five with bare eyes and about five with binoculars. It was brownish red/amber in color and shape was oval- teardrop.It had some sort of membrane/aura around it.Amazingly I already had my binoculars in my hands,the timing was incredible!I zoomed in on it up close,it was squared off in the front like bay windows yet rounded as it tapered towards the back.The very back was rectangle in  shape, totally silent, stayed at constant speed, no lights at all.No way was it a balloon, it was a dead air night no wind whatsoever and the sky was clear.Left no smoke/con trail.When observed through binoculars the membrane was transparent,and oval in shape.I could see through the haze but the ""teardrop"" shaped craft was solid,defenantly mechanical in shape. It was traveling too fast on a horizontal heading to be a weird looking balloon.It was not a plane, as close as it was I would have heard the engines, This craft was silent.I would guess the size at 30x20x5'.I honestly can say now that I have seen something in the sky that I can not explain!It was not a satellite,plane,hang glider, balloon,jet,dirigible,shooting star,ISS or helicopter.I have seen many satellites and meteor's,we live in a City with a International Airport so I have seen all kinds of aircraft including military aircraft.It truly was a UFO by its very definition!

The object looked like a large satellite, blinking on and off in an irregular pattern glowing brightly for about a second then dimming to complete darkness for one to several seconds. My first impression was that it was some type of satellite which was rotating and reflecting the sun, but I would imagine that the pattern of flashes would be at a more consistent interval. The object continued flashing on and off for about a minute. By connecting the locations where the object was glowing, it made a shallow ‘S’ shaped path, finally disappearing to the northwest.

There suddenly appeared a long, bright light that appeared to be on a parallel course with the coastline and heading north, then suddenly made a sharp, 900 right-hand turn without slowing down and headed inland.

The bright color trailed behind the object, much like a long tail on a kite. I couldn’t see any more than that because my field of vision was obstructed by the doorframe.

I pointed it out to my wife and she did the same thing I did. She first said it was an airplane, then when I mentioned it wasn't moving, she said it was a helicopter. As I was thinking about getting my camera the object began to move. It came toward us, then turned to our right. It made a sweeping turn then began to decend. It did this without banking. The red lights were not fuzzy on the edges, they were well defined, and they all moved as one solid object. As the object began to move I noticed partial green lights above the left 2 or 3 red lights. Also as the object turned to the right, and later to the left, it didn't bank as a normal aircraft would. The lights seemed to have a perpindicular dark color in the center, and faded to a lighter color on the edge, but the edge was still a cherry red color, the green appeared to be the same type of lights...(my wife said she did not notice the green lights). After reporting this strange observation, I must also include the following information: 1. The Union County Airport is in the same direction as the object appeared to go, and I haven't had the chance to follow this possibility up. (I will do so in the morning...08-19-09). 2. I have not taken photographs of the area where the sighting took place..(Again, I will take daytime and nighttime photos). 3. Each light on the object appeared to be approximately 1/8 inch in diameter, for a total of 1+1/4"" in width. 4. The only reason I am reporting this without having the opportunity to ""investigate"" the possibilities is that when I asked my wife what she saw, she said, ""It was triangular..."" and then she talked about the red lights.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,40.253816666666665,-83.36848541666667

Fittingly, we feel, the source of the hoax prefers to remain anonymous.  PD)) Hello. I was out January 1, 2009, and it was 11:00 PM. I was just walking for a few minutes and was on the sidewalk of a school, when I saw these flashing lights up in the sky. I remember the green lights were the color of a green LED such as that you would find on a computer monitor. I remember I saw one BRIGHT light. I remember a voice calling saying, ""Drop the tunug."" It was a robotic voice. I remember calling out, ""I do not have anything in my hand.""  The voice said again, ""DROP THE TUNUG.""I started running. I remember praying in my head, ""LORD, I am not doing ANYTHING wrong.. PLEASE save me. I will always serve you no matter what, so PLEASE help me.""  I remember this horrible pain going through my legs, and I fell to the ground. I heard a clicking noise. I remember someone walking up to me. They put handcuffs on me. I was told to get up, and not to move, or I would be shot with a taser. I know a LOT about tasers. I remember that I was taken to a building. It was a building, that i had never seen before. When I got in, I heard the building making a low pitched humming noise, and there were several machines with lines, and other thangs going across their screen. I was told to sit down. I sat down in a little chair which had several buttons and cranks on it. I saw a red button that said, ""For emergencies only.""  I remember I was told to sit and be quiet or I would be tased again. I complied. I was hooked up to a pulse oximeter, which monitored my oxygen levels, and a mask was put on my face. I remember them saying my oxygen was VERY low. I was taken to a little room, and was hooked up to an EKG machine which beeped to my heartrate. I was then told to put my face up against this machine. I remember my Mom had told me before NEVER to look into something unless I knew what it was. I refused to do as I was commanded. They tased me again. I told them that I was going to do whatever my Mom said, and that I WOULD NOT do that. I was told that if I did not do what they said I would be put in a green light. They said the green light would not just flash. It would shock me. I did NOt put my face up to the machine. You see I am visually impared, and I have to have A LOT of tests, and i am VERY curious when it comes to tests, but I resisted my curiousity. I was taken into a room, and placed in a little machine. I prayed, and as I was in the machine I sang praises to God who I KNOW would help deliver me from this machine. I saw a green light come on. Someone outside of the light screamed. I remember someone grabbing me, and taking me out of the light, and they told me that if I did NOT do what they said, I would be tased. I was then unhooked from the machines. I was taken outside and told that I was free to go. They put this blue light on me, and everything went black from there. I then remember waking up in the craft again, and was told that I was going to have a device called a tunug used on me. They hooked something up to the wall, and I heard this LOUD noise. It sounded like a machine that is used in the eye Drs. I was then told to look at a red light above me. I DID NOT. I remember having an urge to do something. I grabbed something, and pulled it down. I started pushing buttons on a lever, and everyone in the room screamed at me. I remember seeing these springs coiled up, and they were green. They had a light that was very bright. The light was green. I was told that I was free to go. I was told that I was not going to get the tunug used on me. They took me to the back of the house  or craft or whatever its called, and told me to get out. I walked out and when I continued walking I saw these green lights on the ground. I saw a blinking light that said, ""DO NOT Remove any of these green lights."" \ I walked passed them, and continued walking. I then left. I kept walking, until I turned around and went back home. The next morning I woke up, and went to check on these lights. They were now just bulbs that were NOT on.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,37.36390869565218,-85.37469456521738

The deer stand is a 12’ tripod that has a 360 degree swivel chair and can be covered by a canvas; except the canvas was off and only the metal frame was around me. While sitting, at chest height there is a square bar that goes all around me and is connected to the floor by four vertical bars.  Four metal bars are connected to this chest high bar at each corner and extend up where they are connected at the top by another square bar.  The very top has two bars that form a cross, connected to each other in the middle and topping off the entire frame.  This cross of the bars forms 4 ‘quadrants’ that I separated the sky with as I was looking at stars. I was facing the northwest looking at the upside down big dipper and a group of stars below it.  The group of stars (I’ll call reference stars) occupied about the same space as the big dipper, but is shaped as such: two stars lined up on a horizontal axis between the ground and the big dipper at about the same distance away from the big dipper as the width of the top of the pot on the big dipper.  Two other stars sit on a vertical axis off to the right of this; the top star is about underneath the second star of the handle of the big dipper at about the same distance as the stars on the handle of the big dipper are from each other.  In between the vertical stars there appeared an object about halfway between them and to the right.  The horizontal stars ""pointed"" right to this center object. Again, the vertical and horizontal stars were the reference points I used to verify movement. As I was looking at the big dipper and seeing ‘twinkles’ of stars and some shooting stars all around me, I saw the twinkle of the object that appeared to be a star.  As I stared and focused on this twinkling star I noticed it was slightly moving in random directions, but maintaining its presence within a very small area. If you were to look briefly at the ‘big picture’ it would just appear as a regular star.  As I watched this object to continually verify to myself that this object was indeed moving,  I saw another twinkling of an object just to the left of this one and another tiny ""star-like"" object appeared.  This object darted to my lower left in a straight line as a shooting star would do and slowed to a near stop next to a couple of very faint stars.  It moved randomly as the first star was doing and then disappeared. I strained for a few minutes to see it, but it was definitely gone. As I looked back at the first object I identified I noticed that it was still moving ever so slightly in a random fashion, yet maintaining its presence in a very small area, relative to my eyesight.  At that point I saw another twinkle in about the same place as the previous one and yet another star-like object appeared.  This object flashed as a twinkle and its glow went back to the same brightness as an ""average"" star.  It then traveled in an easterly direction in a not-so-straight line.  As I was looking at this object and looking back and forth at this one and the first one I lost it because it picked up its speed, got very dim and then disappeared.  I lost it when it got about the same distance away as the one that moved in the other direction from the point of origin. Several times I focused in on other stars and verified to myself that they were indeed staying still, and the objects in question were definitely moving. At this point I got my binoculars out; Bushnell 16 x 32 (188ft. at 1000 yards).  These are small binoculars so it was difficult to focus and maintain a steady position. At a couple of points I was able to focus in on the object for a couple of seconds to see what I would describe as a spinning ‘ying and yang’ symbol.  It was spinning counter-clockwise. I lost focus on the object and couldn’t regain focus so I leaned my head back and rested it on the corner bar behind me to get steady without the binoculars. I stared at this object for a long time, thought deeply about it and witnessed continual movement in an area tiny enough to conceal its movements; if I stuck my arm out in front of me and made a one inch square it would have stayed within that one inch square.  It almost got out of alignment a couple of times in reference to the other vertical and horizontal stars, but still maintained its presence in a very small area. This activity continued until it started getting daylight and I lost sight of all stars.  I eventually shifted my focus back on hunting and later told my friend in camp about my encounter.  It was as if these objects came in through our atmosphere in a flash all in the same general area, and then moved in their respective directions.  So I just continued to look at the first object.  It not only helped to have the stars as reference points, but the bars that crossed at the top of my deer stand also provided a stationary reference.  The wind was calm, and the morning was absolutely clear.  I had Lasik surgery in my left eye about 7 years ago that vastly improved my vision.  I witnessed several shooting stars that morning, but there is no doubt in my mind that what I witnessed, by definition, was several unidentified flying objects.  It wasn’t a close encounter by any means, but it convinced me that someone or something is among us either as a hidden residence or as a visitor.  I now believe and I will never look to the sky in the same way ever again.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,31.74,-99.9604

He compared it to the moon focus which could not totally fit in the scope but when focusing on the bright light it became clearly centered in the middle of the scope and was distinctly a link of round lights making up two seperate rings. In the middle of the inner ring, it appears to be straight lights/beams of light toward the center of the circle.  Kinda of like wedges formed in the center of the ring.  At one point, three lights equally became brighter than the rest. We all witnessed the sighting through the telescope and at first I would say it was the bottom of a huge space craft but not sure if the beams were lights all towards the center of the ring like a gateway. Additionally, for a breif moment towards the end of the sighting, small white dots appeared to be darting to and from the main object. Clouds started to obscure the sighting and I saw a blue flash behind the clouds and when then the object was gone. Tonight, returning from dinner, the bright light was seen from the front of our home and when we went to use our telescope, the clouds blocked the vision again.

I saw a green flash with a tail in the southwest direction in the sky.  It moved in a very fast south west and downward direction. It was too big to be a firework but I thought it was perhaps a shooting star because it seemed to have a firey trail.   My girlfriend Jen saw it as well and asked if I saw it.  I said I did and I told her I thought it was a shooting star.   We didn't call anyone at first because we thought it was a shooting star.

There were quite a few ice fishermen out on Lake Owasso but most people were in their ice houses. The sky was cloudy as is typical in winter, except that the horizons were clear just a little over the tree tops. I was facing west and my buddy west/northwest. As we stood around talking, something caught my eye just above us and to the south. I looked up expecting to see a shooting star. Instead it was a green-ish/blue-ish egg shaped light streaking through the clouds. It lasted for about three seconds and then vanished. I initially thought that it was a shooting star because of the speed that the light moved across the sky. I immediately concluded that it was not a shooting star because the dense clouds overhead prohibited our view of any stars. Winter clouds in Minnesota are low to the ground and shooting stars occur high in the atmosphere. The light appeared to be the size of a large airplane (like a military cargo plane) but it was tough to gauge its size because it was hard to judge distance between the clouds and the ground. After initially thinking that the light was a shooting star, my next conclusion was that it was a flare. However, the light was much bigger than a flare, and was traveling horizontally at a constant rate and altitude. Flares also don’t travel as fast as a shooting star. The light also did not look like any flare that I’ve ever seen and was not red or white. The light was moving just inside of the clouds. I could see bits of cloud between myself and the light. This makes me think that it wasn’t a flash light, strobe, or other projection onto the clouds since that type of light would not penetrate the clouds. It would reflect off of the clouds and not appear to be inside of the clouds as this light happened to be. It also did not have any of the normal attributes of northern lights, and appeared in the sky just to the south of our position. There was no noise created by the light, no trail of clouds or exhaust, and it disappeared just before reaching a clearing in the clouds. I suppose that it could have been some sort of bright gas ball, but I’ve never seen anything like that before. This light shot through the clouds and seemed to have defined edges (egg-shaped). The light never changed direction, speed, or altitude that I could tell. It just vanished at a certain point. I can’t say that it was a craft of any sort because all that we saw was a fast moving light. Instantly though, we both knew that we had seen something odd. I don’t have an explanation for what we saw but can describe it quite well. My fishing buddy saw it for the last second or so and couldn’t come up with a good explanation for what we saw either.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,44.95305527415144,-93.11475467362925

It seemed to be thin and cylindrical (perhaps cigar, but did not appear to taper at the ends) and was positioned vertically and slightly tilted at the top so that the whole was at an angle.   It was very diffuse light (cloud cover?) that seemed peach or pale pink.  When studied I noted that areas of the ‘stick’ had pulsing or throbbing light coming from it, again very diffuse so could not be identified as a particular light source.  The shaft was alone in the sky without any other light shaft attached (to the ground or elsewhere). It was in the southeast region of the area and quite high.  A small plane flew overhead while I was looking at the ‘stick’ and it was well below the ‘stick’.  The object did not move and remained in position.  If divided into quarters, the top second quarter was usually hard to see as if blocked by cloud.  The light got brighter and duller.  I stopped at a neighbor’s house and she and her husband came out and also looked at it and commented on the size, shape, and areas of brighter and duller light.  The object was very long and certainly if side by side with the moon would have been at least as tall as the moon.  Because it was such a narrow shaft of light it seemed about as thick as a plane jet stream that you can see during the day although perhaps even slimmer than that. When I checked the sky at about 19:00 hours it was still present, but I could not get a photo with my digital camera.  At 19:40 a different neighbor called from her cell phone to chat while walking her dog.  I asked her to look in the sky and tell me if she saw the light object.  She described a long shaft of light “kind of pink” that’s going “on and off”. When I went outside to try again to take a photo at 20:10, it was no longer present.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

I noticed this because of the colour and the fact that the lights were on top of each other, not beside each other like an airplane.

The lights floated around, changing directions quickly, going left, right, up and down and backwards and forwards.  Then the lights started going up and to the left, slowly slowing down until they came to a stop.   At this time they changed colours again back to the pinkish red colour.

The very first thing we saw looked like a plane, but we realised it was moving much too fast. It looked almost like a V shape with red and green lights with a white glow between each light. The lights on the craft were a vertical rectangle shape.  It whizzed above us in a straight line until we no longer saw it. But after that we saw these tiny lights, they almost looked like stars, but there were some of all different colours, blue, yellow, red, orange. They were silent, non-flashing and moving at top speed. They were very small but they were quite low down.  This continued for 5-7 minutes, we could not see where they were coming from. Although we could see the general direction which they came, they seemed to just appear.  The last light we saw, however, was quite different from the others. It was bright red, almost glowing. But it didn’t move smoothly though the sky like the others, it was almost like a pulsating action that propelled it through the sky rather erratically, although it was moving in the same directions as all the others, it was not moving in a line, rather, hopping from left to right.  I was probably the most sceptical person about this sort of thing before last night. But I do like to keep an open mind to other possibilities. At the time I was convinced we were witnessing something quite unusual.  What convinces me that it was more than reflection of light or meteorites, is the very first thing we saw that looked too much like a spacecraft, but not enough that I am convinced it was deffinately not a plane.

I opened the door to see what it was when I saw my son standing past the end of the east side of the house, staring at the porch. I asked him what he was doing and what was going on. He walked quickly over to me and proceeded to tell me what he saw. He was crying and shaking and very scared. He said he saw a dark figure with really big, dark eyes, with an orange glow all around it. He said it looked like it was floating just a little off of the ground, came from behind my car and went next to the house and turned and looked at him. He said it then floated higher, and was about the height of the Christmas lights hanging on the porch. He said it looked at him. He slightly turned his head and closed his eyes briefly because he was scared. When he looked back it was gone. He said whatever he saw was about as tall as he is (about 4 feet). He said he couldn’t see its legs and its arms appeared to be straight down beside its body. He said its face was very dark and its eyes were really big and a slightly different color than the face. He said it glowed all around it. I estimate he was 40 to 50 feet from the entity, given where he was and where he said he saw it. I was during the daytime, at approximately 4:00 p.m. I saw the flickering orange glow for about 3 seconds and my son saw it for about 10 seconds.

It seems very clear they are orbs, not plans, their movement is nothing like plans and they disappear all at once.  At first I thought they were speeding up the film time and they were plans landing, but why did they all disappear at one time.  The pattern they were flying did not seem like plans at all.

The first object or lights appeared to be a couple miles ahead of me and my view consisted of two unusually large and bright white lights beside each other, index finger at arm length barely covered it. My first thought was that I was seeing lights on top of a tower in the distance because the two lights were blinking one then the other at a slow pace and were brighter than I have ever viewed on an aircraft. As I got closer, within one quarter of mile I realized that there was nothing underneath the lights. The lights were intensely bright still slowly flashing in the same pattern. I eventually drove directly under the lights and was unable to make out the shape of the object in the darkness but did notice smaller flashing lights underneath the two bright lights. The lights under the object were flashing much faster and appeared to be different colors, red, green and white. The lights all appeared to be stationary. The second object or lights were approximately one quarter of a mile farther as I continued northbound on interstate 167.  Just as the first object or lights initially appeared as two very large bright lights side by side so did the second with exception that the two lights were not blinking at any time and were bright green.  The green lights appeared to be stationary over the interstate at the same altitude as the first.  As I continued northbound I eventually drove under it and again noticed smaller quickly flashing colored light beneath this one and was unable again to discern the actual shape of the abject.  As I was about to drive under it my car was approached by two other cars that came from behind me and both sped past as if they had not even seen the very large low flying intensely bright green lights which I found very odd as the lights were so brilliant I found it hard to look away and had slowed my rate of speed to continue watching them. After passing the second object or lights I decided to take the next exit which was the first exit in Tukwila in an attempt to take a front road that I noticed back to view the lights approximately a minute or so later and realized that I could no longer see either of them anymore. There were simply no lights of any kind to be seen at this point.

It was a clear night, the moon was low over the horizon and it was approximately 25 degrees. After about a minute, I looked across my backyard to the sky above a single story duplex that is almost directly across from my back porch. When I looked up I saw a dark rectangular shaped mass, but it had a slight point to the front center.  Along the underside there were two perfectly aligned rows of 5 or 6 star-like lights. They traveled in perfect formation so I know that they were a part of the larger object. There was no noise, and because of the temperature and the hour I do not think it was a glider/parachute, etc. I watched this object for approximately one minute and thirty seconds. At first it glided closer to me in a very tight S pattern, making very sharp 90 degree turns. It was traveling South Southwest at a moderate speed, at one point it stopped completely and hovered above another duplex for a few seconds. I could tell because the lights were still and it looked to have one end lower down than the other, and that’s when I saw the rows of dim lights. After it hovered a few seconds it rose straight up in the sky, I could still see the light formations on the bottom. It slowly started traveling southwest again, and then it disappeared completely. It moved like nothing I have ever seen. The sharp angles of its turns and the speed at which it rose straight up into the sky were completely foreign, not to mention how it disappeared right in front of me.

They stayed lit about 20 seconds. About 10 minutes later, as we discussed what it could be, one light, same color appeared, then split in two  in a split second, horizontally, into equal sized round glowing objects stayed lit for maybe 15 seconds and disappeared at the same time.... at this point we knew it wasn't flares from a ship because the one light split into two horizontally not falling downward towards the ocean....we watched for about another 10 minutes then left the beach. Once we returned to our condo about 3/4 of a mile away we took the dogs out for a walk, and while looking skyward and discussing what we had seen, a pattern of  five white lights, which looked like stars from the brightness & color, began a flashing pattern.  Five lights in no particular arrangement flashing in a sequence... we heard the sound of aircraft but this was no normal plane(s) whatever it was, was flashing  separetly and too close for normal multiple aircraft to be next to each other. The flashing lights appeared to stay in the same spot in the sky. We speculated it could have been some type of military aircraft ( multiple ) flying in some formation. But the rumble we heard was no louder than a normal single plane. This flashing white light pattern lasted about 1 1/2 minutes.. then they disappeared.

Before I tell you what I saw, or what, at least, that I can remember of what I saw on May 27th, 2010, a short while after 10:00 p.m, latest being 10:20 p.m., I want to let you know that until recently I was a total skeptic.  Before all this chit-chat about ancient aliens and ufos started on t.v. and what not, I thought, ""Okay, well, I agree that it's a possibility that there are other life forms out there, but I disagree that they have visited us.""  Then came all the ufo hunters and t.v. series that have sparked an intriguement inside me. So, now let me describe my sighting to you. Okay, I'm walking my boyfriend to the top of my street from where he will skateboard home, we say our goodbyes and depart.  About this time everything is seemingly normal.  As I'm walking, being a nature lover that I am, I'm looking towards the sky.  And I thought, ""Wouldn't it be crazy if I saw a ufo tonight? Walking home and I see one, yea right hahah"" sort of joking about in my head. Well, a few minutes later I notice something that first I thought was a star.  However, it had a white and red flashing light system.  The object would glow a dim red, and then a bright white, and then back to the dim red and then back to the bright white, like a strobe light, then I thought that's strange, so I stopped walking.  And that's when I noticed that this object was moving in abrupt directions, such as zig zagging, but this object was very far away so I could only see it move just a little bit everytime it did so. It was only a little light in the sky flashing a dim red and then a brighter white and moving in every other way I can think of asides a straight line.  Okay, here's where things get even a little more funky, so I've stopped and I'm looking at this light in the sky and I think ""Oh well, there must be some logical explanation for it.""  So I keep walking, not a block away from my apartment, I turn my head to face in front of me and I noticed that far away up in the sky, is ANOTHER one of these flashing lights, still red and white, so I look back at the spot that my eyes had just previously left and sure enough the same one is still there.  I felt a bit frightened at this point and hurried into my home through the back door because I felt that it hid the view from those points of mysterious light, from what might've been aliens.  Now there is one critical detail that I have left out, and that is that while I was walking, the light that I was watching, moved from in front of me ! to behind me.  It was originally ahead of me and off to my right, then it moved to behind me and off to my right, had I turned around and faced it, it would have been on my left.  I cannot explain it any better than that. In one or two sentences, I was walking home the other night and noticed two objects that were distant from each other in the sky yet had the same flight patterns and dual red/whtie light systems that were definitively not airplanes and not helicopters.  There was no sound, it was as simple as this, when I laid my eyes on it I knew it was something I had never seen before, and it frightened me.  I've seen video recordings of such orbs of changing light and the best way I can tell you what it was, is a red and white ufo like all the other ufos glowing a bright white light and some other color.  I'm saying that it is a possible UFO abduction case because soon after I went to bed, they might've beamed me up late at night.  Also my boyfriend had a dream about me being abducted by aliens.  And when I think back to that night, things always get a little blurry, and everything that I said to you I remember with specific detail.  When it comes down to it, I think I might propose that! aliens are trying to make me forget, but I'm holding onto it, almost like when you try to remember what you dreamed last night, and you can remember those bits and pieces of imagery but not the whole scenario.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,34.29657455830389,-119.23991625441697

Did not have a trail, nor did it fragment, explode, or change size On Friday 28MAY2010, a friend and I were visiting a third friend at his house in Green Bay.  The residence is located just southeast of St. Vincent Hospital  (The hospital is visible from the backyard).  This residence is on the east side of Green Bay, approximately 3 miles north of WI-172, and 3-4 miles east of the Fox River (Distances are rough estimates!)    At approximately 10:10 PM, the three of us were sitting on the back deck of the house.  I was sitting on a bench at the edge of the deck and right next to the house, facing north-northwest.  Friend #1 was sitting directly to my left, facing due North.   Friend #2 was sitting on a picnic table in the middle of the deck facing us.  As we were talking, Friend #1 happened to look up in roughly northeastern direction and see something in the sky. He remarked ""Is that an airplane?  That's not an airplane!"".   At this point, I cannot remember if he indicated the direction the object was traveling.  I could not see the object from where I was sitting because the house blocked my view.  I instinctively turned to my left and looked upward over my shoulder, where I was able to view a patch of sky not obscured by the house or the stand of trees at the edge of the property.  I managed to see the object as it moved. I saw what appeared to be an orange ""fire-colored"" object, very roughly circular, but nebulous in appearance, moving across the sky at a rapid clip. It was about as large as the thumbnail on a man's pinky finger, if held at arms length.  There was no trail or halo around this object, nor did it change size as it moved. Once the object was obscured by trees, I dashed for the west end of the yard, where the line of trees ended (about 15-20 feet past the end of the deck).  The object again entered my field of view.  Its characteristics had not changed in the few seconds where I moved my position.  The object continued on a straight-line course from east-northeast to west-southwest.  It did not change speed.  It did not appear to change altitude.  The object did not change color or size either.  Everything remained constant until it appeared to fade just before it left our available field of vision.  One characteristic of the object that struck me is that the center appeared darkened somewhat compared to the outer edges.  When the object disappeared, it did not flash, ""blink"" or explode, it just faded in about a half-second. The sky was clear that night. Despite there being a large volume of commerical air traffic in Green Bay, there was no air traffic sighted other than the emergency medevac helicopter that periodically flew in to land at the nearby hospital. I do not think the flight path of incoming planes intersects with the helicopter's usual flight pattern. This helicopter was not in the area during the sighting. As my friends and I discussed this object, we were of the initial opinion that it was some type of celestial body which entered and then exited the atmosphere.  However the absence of a trail, and the constant shape/size of the object are disconcerting when considering this theory.  Growing up in the country, I have seen my share of ""Shooting stars"", meteorites, orbiting satellites, and what have you.  Most meteors I've seen actually moved FASTER that the object in question.  The absence of trail is not all that unusual, but a meteor travelling at what appeared to be quite an oblique angle, visible for 30+ seconds, would seem to be large enough to expect to see a trail behind it. The entire event lasted about one minute, or one minute 30 seconds, from the time my friend spotted the object to the time it disappeared. Due to my uncertainty about what I saw, I am submitting this report with hopes that:  1) it can be compared to any similar reports submitted from 5/28/2010 or otherwise from Brown County/Green Bay  2) The experts at NUFORC can indicate the likelihood that this was indeed a meteorite or similar (re-entering satellite?) and NOT a UFO  Thank you for your accepting this report",2010-06-03T00:00:00,44.52863971962617,-88.04377663551402

It's very difficult to describe what we saw. The object was black - at first I thought it might be a bird very high up, but I couldn't discern any wings flapping, it just looked like a solid object moving slowly over the ocean, over and past us and continuing inland. There were no flashing lights, and as there were quite a few planes on the horizon, it was quite easy to see that this was not one of them. It was hard to focus on also, it seemed far away but quite low at the same time; for a second I actually thought it sort of looked like a person flying, but I dismissed this for obvious reasons. My girlfriend described it as ""an asymmetrical rectangular blob floating westward, not like a bird that varies direction and flaps its wings, but more like a balloon"". Very creepy, no sound at all, and again this thing flew in from the ocean, maybe 1,000 ft (?) up, and proceeded inland.

My husband and I were walking our 2 dogs, and we were passing through the parking lot at Bridgeport Shopping Center, which is at the NE corner of the intersection of Newhall Ranch Road and McBean Parkway, in Valencia, California.  Valencia is part of the incorporated town of Santa Clarita, if you're searching for it on a map.  Bridgeport Shopping Center has pedestrian walkways and lower buildings - it's new, and is mostly empty in the evenings, we guess there were about 10 other people around the shopping center at that moment but no one was near us. We were at the far East side of the parking lot where there are few street lights. We were walking East toward Grandview Drive when my husband noticed a long line of red lights in the sky that appeared above the treeline, not too high up, and were acting in a very bizarre fashion. If the lights were on some kind of craft/s then it was completely silent. There were about 12 lights - all RED, no white, and they were in a line, as if connected to a leading edge. At first it was just hovering - for maybe one minute, and then started to slowly float Southeast. The string of lights never descended. We didn't see a solid shape behind the lights, it was too dark, we could only see the lights themselves. They all seemed to be about the same size. The size of the lights themselves -- relative to a star in the night sky -- they were the same size as the brightest star in the sky. All together, the span of the lights in a line reached almost completely across our entire field of view. They were above the horizon, well above the treeline, and above the rooftops of everything around. It was very hard to gauge where exactly the thing was, we guestimated it was over Eastern Santa Clarita, East of the 5 Freeway, but West of the 14, North of Lyons Avenue and potentially South of Newhall Ranch Road, where we were standing – although it appeared directly over us. It was a straight line of lights at a 45 degree angle. Like a stick, turned up on an angle. This was the shape ""/"", with the tallest part rising on its right side, with the whole thing heading slowly South by SouthEast. It (the string of lights) never broke formation. It slowly floated South-South East until it became so dim we could no longer see it, without ever changing the distances between the lights themselves. They were not evenly spaced. The whole line silently hovered and then slowly floated off, with entire sections blinking on and off randomly. It was very long/wide! As a gauge, if I hold my thumb out away from me (about 2.5 feet) and my thumb represents one of the lights that we saw - then! the whole line of lights took up my entire field of view. (It took about 5 minutes for it to disappear from view.)  Just when we thought the whole line was lit up, another light would blink on, to the far left or far right - making the total string even wider/longer. The lights did not look like flares to me. I have seen flares and these lights were constantly blinking on and off, wildly -- quickly pulsating. There was never a time when all the lights were on uniformly at the same time, they were always shimmering. Sometimes whole sections would just go out and come back on again 10 seconds later, in random order. The lights, always red, were all blinking/shimmering fast, but not uniformly, and not strobing in any regular pattern and with no regular timing, not the way aircraft safety lights would. Any one light also had an irregular pattern. We thought -- could it be a squadron of helicopters? But the lights didn't behave in a predictable way. These red lights would go on and off in random order and with random timing by first becoming dim, then bright, then dim, then off, and then bright again -- as if they were shimmering. My husband commented that it looked like the special effects on TV when a craft goes into ""cloaking"" mode, or the way lights look reflected in water. He is a skeptic and he was dumbfounded as to what we were seeing. Position relative to each other: the lights kept their exact distance from one another the whole time, even as the line of lights drifted South. The size of the individual lights was like looking at red car brake lights from 2 miles away. That's the only way I can describe it - against the night sky they were as bright and big as the biggest/brightest star in the sky. We can't tell how high the string of lights was, but we couldn't see any other stars through them. We could not see if it was one solid craft, or many lights. They did remain in a stable position relative to one another - at least giving the illusion that they were along the edge of one craft. I've seen sheriff's dept. helicopters fly nightly over town and I would say these lights appeared to be floating around the same height. They were not too distant, definitely over town, not over the mountains. It took several minutes for them to go a few miles. We ran East along the sidewalk to keep a view of it, and eventually the line disappeared as it floated out of view, and became dimmer, eventually disappearing completely from our line of sight. We stared for 5 more minutes and then started to walk home, heading East toward the edge of the parking lot. Then we saw another set of lights, doing exactly the same thing, just over the treeline to the East of Grandview Road. The line had the same weird pattern of red lights shimmering off and on and lasted for 2-3 minutes but was not quite as wide and was oriented horizontally. It didn't drift or descend, it just got more and more dim and finally was down to 2 lights, and then disappeared. We stared a little longer, and then walked home. I immediately called the Sheriff station for Santa Clarita. I reported what we saw and the police officer said they had over 100 calls reporting UFOs already that night. He could not say if people reported the same thing we saw. The sky was filled with other aircraft that night, heading into Burbank airport or LAX. They all looked normal compared to this. Our backgrounds: My husband is in IT and I am a technology and sciences editor for a national publication. We've never seen anything out of the ordinary before and have lived here 3 years, so we also know what's common in the sky here. My husband is a firm skeptic, and I'm uncertain. I'm aware of military testing at VAFB and I have seen missile tests at a distance from the 101, and this didn't look like that. I've also seen small meteors and meteor showers and they don't hover and glide.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,34.46418620689655,-118.48207068965517

The weather was clear, calm and visibility was perfect. I’m always observing ships and am reasonably familiar with most the ships that frequent the Forth. I couldn’t make out any superstructure.  No masts, funnels, sails..anything.  No markings.  I don’t have the best eyesight so I asked my daughter if she could make out any details.  She could not. I went upstairs to get my binoculars and to check out www.marine-traffic.com and to see if I could still see the object from my sitting room window.  I couldn’t. I checked Marine Traffic and there was one ship displayed which was a great deal further out and it looked nothing like what we had seen. I took the binoculars down stairs and went to the beach.  The object had gone. The ship recorded on Marine Traffic was half as far away again as the object, but was easily distinguished as it was red and we could make out superstructures even from that distance, even without binoculars. I would estimate I was no more than 10 minutes maximum upstairs.  Such is the range of view from the beach, a motorboat would have had difficulty in disappearing out of sight in that length of time. I asked some people on the beach if they had noticed anything; they had not.

It was at least 10-20 times brighter than the north star. My friend came out and agreed it was definitely something unusual.

My mother, older brother, older sister and two young nephews were all present.  While playing the game, my older brother said “UFO” and we thought he was trying to be funny (he had previously seen and reported a UFO sighting with additional family members approximately 2 years ago; I had not been present at the time of that sighting).  He said he was serious and we all looked and saw what he had noticed. There was a ring-shaped object in the sky that, at least twice while I was viewing it, rotated on its axis to show its top.  When showing the top of itself, it could be viewed that the center was completely open, allowing an unobstructed view of the sky behind it.  This object appeared about the size of a dime (to make a relative size comparison) and was approximately 45 degrees from the horizon.  It was about 6:30PM, the sun was behind us and the sky was slightly cloudy; the object appeared to be no more than 1000 feet off the ground, well below cloud cover.  The object appeared black but when it would rotate the top would appear to be silver. Accompanying this ring shaped object were 2 dark circular objects.  They were roughly a quarter of the size of the ring-shaped object and one was positioned directly above it, I’d estimate 60 degrees from the horizon; the second was behind and off to the right of the first.  Admittedly, I did not pay much attention to these as I was concentrating on the ring-shaped object. As these three objects moved out of sight range (they never became obscured by objects, they just became too distant to see; this took about 5 minutes from the time we initially spotted them) I happened to look back in the direction the objects had come from and saw a fourth object.  This one was kidney shaped with the curve to the front and wobbled a lot as it moved.  The curved section appeared to be white or a light color, the rest of the object was black.   It went in the same direction as the other objects.  This kidney-shaped object I would also estimate at about 45 degrees from the horizon and moving at approximately the same speed as the other three craft. None of these four objects emitted any noise or contrail or exhaust of any sort.  I could not notice any visible lights on them.  They all moved slower than an airplane or helicopter would.  All were headed in a southeasterly direction; there was a light breeze that was intermittently coming from the northwest.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

All three were traveling in a northeastern direction, in a group.  The largest craft was a black circle, which I have seen before from the location (see my report here dated 6/17/2007).  The other 2 crafts were following the same trajectory and in a group with the circle.  They were smaller, but not circle-shaped.  Because of the distance, I could not make out a shape.  All were traveling fast, and the circle tipped to its side while filing, exposing the empty space in the middle. While we were tracking the group of 3, a 4th UFO flew in the same direction.  It followed approximately 10 minutes behind the original group.  I was able to use binoculars to view this one.  It was shaped like a kidney, although its edges were straight lines, not curved as one would usually think of a kidney.  At the part of the ship where the kidney's ""indent"" would be, there were lights. Skies were cloudy with rain clouds, although it was not raining.  The ships flew both in front of and through the clouds, and were moving away from us duringf the incident.  I did not get as good a view as my original sighting 2 years ago.

It was a large round object that was hollow in the middle - think of a metal washer (for a nut & bolt) and you have a good idea what the object looked like.  It appeared to me to be silver in color but my brothers thought it was black and the sun reflecting off it made it look silver.  It made no noise that I could hear and traveled slowly, well below the few low clouds in the sky. We ran down the street to try to keep the object in sight and were able to go about 2 blocks before it went over a mountain and we lost sight of it.  While we were following it down the street I noticed another darker object directly above the silver ""washer"" object.  It was much higher up and difficult to see any details but it stayed right above the silver washer.

It is critical to note that my curiosity into ""chemtrails"" is somewhat irrelevant here and does NOT represent the conclusions of the NUFORC.  Apart from the observed airplane activity, a genuine UFO sighting occurred and was videotaped, and that is the purpose of this report and video submission.  The NUFORC has made it very clear to me that it views the notion of ""chemtrails"" as a complete hoax.  I fully accept that view, but am determined to report the UFO sighting anyway. In the wake of the airplane activity (whatever its nature), I shot a 26 second clip of the sky, about 14 seconds of which depict what appears to be an orb-like shiny object.  It becomes visible at about 8 seconds into the video and shines or reflects light to varying degrees until the video ends at 26 seconds.

"While filming the crescent moon, I noticed a cigar shaped shadow about 1/4 of the way down creep up and out of sight.",Bellevue,WA,2009-04-26T22:15:00,cigar,1 min,"Occurred : 4/26/2009 22:15  (Entered as : 04/26/09 22:15) Reported: 4/27/2009 8:23:20 AM 08:23 Posted: 5/12/2009 Location: Bellevue, WA Shape: Cigar Duration:1 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69833.html,"While filming the crescent moon, I noticed a cigar shaped shadow about 1/4 of the way down creep up and out of sight. Yesterday as I was filming non-passenger planes that seemed to be swarming about. I noticed the crescent moon, and filmed it for about 20 seconds, commenting on its beauty. Then a plane went by and I followed it with my camcorder. About three minutes later I wanted to get a better look at the moon, so I focused on it a second time, from the exact location. This time the crescent had a shadow about a 1/4 the way down from the right of the top, and it was moving! This shadow covered the entire area of the crescent, as if someone had taken a magic marker and drew a line through that section. For a second I thought maybe I didn't have a clear view, and that there was a nearby tree or something that was causing the shadow, so I pulled the camcorder away and verified that I had a clear view with no impediments. In those few seconds, the shadow had drifted upwards, and was moving quickly. I filmed it advancing until it was out of sight-- it was the exact color as the space around it, so I'm not sure if the shadow was coming from below Earth and causing it, or the object was moving in front of the moon. Either way, it had to have been pretty large to cover that much of the moon. Within seconds of the shadow disappearing, I immediately noticed an unusually large number of aircraft around the moon, moving west to east, as if they were observing something. In ten minutes, I saw seven planes all on the right side of the moon where I had seen the cigar shaped shadow, and filmed two. While the sky had been relatively clear, when I went outside 40 minutes later, there was total cloud cover. I recall that at 21:00 I had filmed a couple planes that were emitting chemtrails, that I could barely make out due to the waning light. These trails were expanding into clouds. I filmed until 22:30, when I ran out of tape. Then at 23:00 I went outside with a new tape, and there was total cloud cover. For the next few hours I proceeded to listen to jets overhead until I fell asleep. I wanted to ad that the phenomena of planes making chem-trails which expand into total cloud cover had become so commonplace I don't bother filming it any longer. These planes are very well camoflauged, but they're noisy. They are two types but they follow the general description of having two engines, but the trail is emitted from the tail of the plane. It looks almost curly cue as it billows out of the end. In my opinion, some of these planes are spraying for moths and other perceived nuisance insects, and the other ones that are more camoflauged are producing convenient cloud cover for the passage of military planes. As I type this I am listening to the constant hum of jet engines, and there is total cloud cover in Bellevue this morning. Last week Monday it was clear and sunny at this time of the day, and apart from a passenger jet ever 7-10 minutes or so, there was not this activity.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,47.604556307692306,-122.16441774358974

When I returned into the kitchen, I heard the motor from the spa in my backyard turn on.  It does this automatically and I am used to this.  The inside of the house was quiet;  I did not have any appliances on.  The time was around 7:15 pm. Immediately after noticing the spa turn on, I heard a louder, unrecognizable noise that seemed to drown out the otherwise noisy spa motor.  I was curious and mildly alarmed by the unfamiliar noise.  Puzzled after a few seconds and the noise still continuing, I stopped what I was doing (replacing the liner on the kitchen trash can) and opened the patio door a few inches and paused.  I confirmed the noise was from outside.  I quickly stepped outside, and when I was about four-five feet from the house, looking in the direction of the noise, I saw an unidentified object flying low in the sky, above the row of house on my side of the street, moving above the homes along Crisp Avenue, then Klein Avenue toward Flagship. I am familiar with how helicopters sound as I used to have a neighbor who owned one and flew it regularly from his home across the street from me.  I was also an EMT and know the sound of helicopters up close as I have loaded patients onto medevac copters.    This object did not sound like a helicopter.  It was too slow to be a plane.  It was hard to determine its shape but it appeared to have at least four lights at opposite points, at/near the craft’s outer perimeter.  The shape of the craft had a ring or circular silhouette.  As it moved in a northerly direction away from me, it stayed very low to the houses and within a few seconds was out of my sight. I ran inside to get my iphone the only camera I have - that was in my workbag in my upstairs office.  Hoping to see it and photograph it, I ran downstairs with my iphone, out the front door and out onto the street.  I did not see it, nor could I detect the sound anymore.  I ran back inside and upstairs again, this time to retrieve my wallet.  I jumped into my car and started driving slowly on the streets of Mare Island with the top of my convertible down.  I pulled over to park, look and listen.   Wanting to share my experience, I telephoned my brother’s home, first speaking with my sister-in-law who is a middle school teacher, then with my brother who is a retired police officer like me.

While driving home on a cloudy, dark evening on February 2, 2010 on a rural county road we saw two bright orange lights approximately 1 1/2 miles away on what we thought were power company vehicles.  The lights blinked in unison and then separately approximately 2 seconds apart.  They looked to be about 15 feet off the ground and about 50 feet apart.  As we approached the dirt road were they had been hovering, we stopped because the lights were suddenly gone.  The road is a dirt road which intersects our main county road and connects to the next parallel county road 5 miles away.  We looked down the road for any sign of vehicles, head lights or anything that would have explained the lights.  The dirt road has a small power substation adjacent to the beginning of the road which would explain our theory of a power company line truck being parked on the road.  The power tends to go off periodically in our area due to normal winter wind and snow storms so seeing! a line truck is not unusual.  We never saw any other vehicles, so we proceeded towards home again driving approximately 25 miles per hour so we could scan the horizon.  This road is on the west side of a very large alpine valley in Northern California and the line of sight available across the valley at any given time is vast.  The only time vision is obscured is when there is a white-out snow storm or too much fog.  Neither were happening at the time, only a light drizzle of sporadic rain.  After traveling one more mile the lights suddenly reappeared in the same fashion, approximately 20 feet off the ground now, still blinking bright orange and 50 feet from each other.  The lights were in an area well known by both my daughter and I since we have lived across from this particular field for 11 years.  There are no roads and no homes on this land, only alfalfa fields which had approximately 2 feet of snow covering the field at the time.  We drove slowly on the road never ta! king our eyes off the lights and as we approached our road the! lights appeared to have slowly moved away from us in a southerly direction, yet they were still blinking in the same fashion and just as bright.  We stopped on the road right before turning onto our dirt road and watched the lights for a few minutes.  They stopped moving away but continued to blink in a random fashion, sometimes in unison, then separately.  The distance apart never changed and was very steady.  The height of each light was exactly the same.  We didn't feel anything unusual and we didn't hear anything unusual.  It was very dark outside so we weren't able to see if there was any sort of aircraft or shape around the lights.  After we drove up our road we looked back down over the valley and the lights were gone.  From our house we have a view of the entire valley as we live roughly 1/4 mile up a hill on the west side of the valley.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,39.8202,-120.3788

I saw what looked like a dim, blue star moving across the sky. Then another appeared on the same path, further behind. The second object caught up with the first. Then the first object went into a tight, elliptical orbit, heading back the opposite direction as the second object followed. When these objects began their elliptical turn, a third object came towards them, quickly, from much further away. When the third object was close to the other two, it slowed down. The three objects were moving slow at this point, then faded out of view.  All three objects looked the same, like dim, blue stars.  I was standing at the edge of the, Columbia River, Washington, off State Route 401, facing east, looking directly across the river towards, Astoria, Oregon, when I saw this. As it was, I was observing the sky. My line of sight was 60 degrees.  The objects came from the north and were heading to my south before they turned. At first, I thought that I found a satellite, whereas it was moving quickly. My eyes followed it from my left-north to right-south. Then I scanned my eyes over to the left again and spotted another one moving much quicker on the same trajectory until it appeared to be behind the first one. I held my hand up, and the length of my thumb was the distance . Then they made the turn, one following the other heading north.

I took direct notice of the stars and realized it was not a planet, star, or satellite.  The object stood stationary as I pulled off to the side of the road to analyze it further.   There were no buildings, lamp posts or any object near the sphere, which was a bright orange/red in coloring.  I had my camera near me, for earlier I had taken some landscape photos while on my drive.  I lifted my camera to the object and the object began to move, I captured a movement picture of the object, I could not quite get a clear picture so I switched my camera to video mode.  The object then began moving drastically as if trying to avoid being captured on film.  The object darts drastically in my video, and the camera starts making noises with every movement of the object, and an interaction between the two is obvious, which is also captured on the video, you can also see rings in the object with an almost nucleus center. I then lowered my camera to grab another photo and while switching over the camera the object separated into multiple spheres now white in color, the spheres were in two lines, the spheres from right to left glowed and pulsed out light with greater intensity one at a time, when the the last sphere pulsed with light the spheres joined from right to left and formed back into one to disappear at a phenomenal speed.

Upon getting closer to the object, I was able to see the object in greater detail. The object was around 600 to 700ft. high and was hovering at the time. It was now 7:52am. The object was about 100 to 150ft in Length and appeared to be about 40ft in Width. The object was rectangular in shape and had 2 black colored areas on both sides of it that were about 5 to 7 ft long. In the middle of the object, I could see a long opening/slit than span between the black sides. Right above the opening/slit, there was a Pulsating Amber Colored Light. I observed the object until approx. 7:55 and it appeared to just be hovering over an open area to the west of us. While rounding a curve, I lost sight of the object as it went behind some trees. Second Sighting  At approx. 7:57am I was able to regain site of the object and it was now moving more in a WNW direction. Then, all of a sudden, it began to bank/turn towards the North and this is when I could see just how massive the object was. At this time, the Amber Colored Light on the rear of it was no longer Pulsating, it was a Solid Amber Light. While the object continued to bank to the right, I was able to see the top of it. The Top of the object was Metallic in color in the rear and front sections  The rear of the top section was rectangular and had a pattern on it that resembled mosaic tiles. The middle of the top section was completely round and Metallic looking with Dark Grey Lines covering the entire circle. The front of the top section was also rectangular in shape and had a mosaic looking pattern on it as well. I noticed a Triangle shape on the very tip of the front of the object and it had what appeared to be a metal pipe that was angled toward the ground. The object remained at least a ½ to ¼ mile from us the entire time. Shocking Ending just before losing sight of Object  The time now is somewhere between 7:59 and 8:00am. The object has completed its turn and all of a sudden, the object splits into 3 Orb shaped objects and appears to be attempting to fly in formation similar to how jets would fly. All 3 objects are black in color and have some how reduced in size. Although now split into 3, the object in the front of the formation still has the triangular shape on the tip of it along with what appeared to be a metal looking pipe pointing toward the ground. I was only able to keep my eye on the object for about 45 seconds due to traffic in the area around the school.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,36.117557352941176,-80.07612941176471

I was  turning in a shopping center to go to Walmart when I noticed some red/orange lights.   At 1st I thought it was a plane until I noticed a similar set of lights underneath at an angle.

After taking several pictures, I spent some time looking  for the phone case.

I went to drive in window got my stuff and started heading back in western direction on US 1 south to 95 s toward my development.  It was now at least 20-25 minutes since I first saw the lights.  When I pulled in my devlopement Hopewell, NJ, the lights appeared closer. (Apparently, the sighting in the shopping center was at greater distance and the object(s) were actually closer to my home.)  When I pulled in my driveway, I again took pictures.  When I looked at them I coulnt see any thing on the shopping center photos due to the distance.

Saw a shiny metallic object when first pulling into the parking lot so assumed it was a plane since it was the same relative size and shape as a plane and was reflective like the metallic body of a plane very visible in the afternoon sun. I parked, checked the craft again and noticed it had not moved at all.  I then assumed it was a blimp. But I do not know of any metallic blimps and this one was extremely reflective.  And it was not the typical blimp shape, it looked more like a large jetliner from the side profile but I did not note a rear vertical fin.  It also confused me since it appeared to be the same distance away from my position that I see the airplanes take as a path to land in Miami International Airport.  I was running late to class so I did not observe it much longer. If it was the distance I believe it to be, relative to my position= ~10 degrees CW from N @ 1 mile.  So it would have been almost directly above International Mall.  I know some stores fly balloons but this would have been very unlikely since planes take a direct path over the mall to land in the airport 3 miles to the east.  And it's altitude was roughly the same if not slightly higher than planes that use that path to land. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were traveling west bound on a two-lane road, roughly 40 miles per hour.  We looked out of the drivers side window and noticed  the object.  It had multiple lights, probably around 5 or 6.  The majority of the lights were white but there was also one or two red ones located somewhere from the middle to the rear of the object.  At first we thought it was a plane, especially since there is a small airport located nearby, but it appeared to be stationary.  It was also extremely low but we were unable to hear any noise as we passed.   I couldn’t say exactly how far off the ground it was, but the height was equivalent to an extremely tall oak tree. Now as we were both passing, we both started to comment on the object at the same time.  We both noticed how low it was and how it appeared to be hovering or moving at an extremely slow speed.  First instinct was that it was just a plane on it’s way to the airport, but the speed, height, and sound just didn’t add up to the normal sightings of planes in that area.  Then the thought was that it was possibly some kind of stationary tower, such as a cell phone.  So once we passed the object, we decided to do a u-turn and go back and get a second look.  We had trouble finding a good place to do this and finally just slammed the breaks on  and turned into the other lane.   By the time we got back to  the spot where it was located, the object was gone. In hind sight, I wish we had just slammed the breaks on the moment we saw it.  There were no cars directly behind us and I don’t recall any other cars passing in the other lane at that same moment. I’m also surprised  at how I felt.  There was no uneasiness or frightened feeling.  Just a feeling of confusion.  The area in which it was spotted is also heavily populated.  In the same direction as the object was traveling, there is an apartment complex and a large high school, which are both located on the other side of the cemetery.

I know it was not an airplane because it was traveling way to fast with no sound.  It was also not a weather balloon because of this factor also.  The conclusive factor I see in this is while as I was watching this light its trajectory curved.  As it crossed the night sky its path curved multiple times.  The curving was not dramatic but very noticeable and smooth. The curving path of this flying light factors out a meteor and a satellite.

At approximately ten o'clock, as I was leaving for work, I noticed two strange object floating above a cloud, out of our atmosphere.  One of the object, glowing red, moved quickly toward my house, above where I was standing. It hovered no more than 300 feet above me, and moved down the road. Later that night, at 3:00 sharp, my roommate came outside as I was coming in.  I told him what had happened, and we both began searching the night sky.  Seconds later, the shape appeared again, moving as it had before (very rapidly).  Within ten minutes, a series of flashes erupted from the east, without cloud cover (no lightning).  Immediately afterward, a dozen circular ""crafts"" emerged, traveling in perfect oblong triangles (groups of three), moving west at a decent speed, as though heading toward some planned destination.  It didn't take long before more and more of these groups emerged.  Soon enough, the sky was littered with these triangular groups. It was like looking at a sky filled with moving stars, but the stars were larger and far brighter, able to pierce through cloud cover.  After each wave finished, there would be more flashes of light, followed by hundreds of ""crafts.""  Coincidentally, the flashing red craft I had seen earlier came bounding down towards us, but stayed at a decent height.  Tiny specks of light (or what looked like smaller crafts) broke off of the entity periodically.  This whole process lasted two hours, or until 5:00 am.  All in all, I would say that we saw approximately 1500 anomalies. I realize how outlandish this sounds, but I am being quite honest, and only wish to help people understand the gravity of the situation. I can only share my subject feelings on the matter, but from the looks of it, each anomaly was being piloted, taking non linear paths, some turning around completely.  At one point, when all of the cloud cover vanished, the crafts froze simultaneously and took on the patterns of constellations, i.e., Orion's Belt, the Big Dipper, etc., as though to camouflage. The flashing red anomaly also emitted a strange pulsating noise, very quietly; however, only further examination of the envirnment will tell if this is somehow connected. I hope this happens again tonight, as I will be patiently awaiting.  I am serious in admitting that something very big was (or is) going on.  I hope that you can believe my story, as ridiculous as it may sound. Best regards. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received assurances from the source of the report that it is a serious-minded report.

On 10/28/068 I was at my sons 8th grade football game at Gordon Wood Stadium in Brownwood Texas.  Facing the East North East around 19:35 we all saw three lights suddenly appear.  I instantly saw them because I was turn toward the North East sitting on the West side of the stadium talking to my mom.   The lights appeared and did not move and stayed stationary for about 10-15 seconds.  I laughed and asked my mom, wife, sister and brother law if they see those lights.  They said yes and my mom asked what is that.  The only thing I could imagine it to be would be a single engine jet in a formation with two more jets going directly away from us for a few seconds and we must be seeing the firey glow of their engines. We all laughed when it went away and then another three lights appear 10-15 seconds later farther to the south a little lower in altitude and they stayed stationary for about 10 to 15 seconds.  At that time I grabbed my phone and opened the camera.  The third set of lights appear 10 seconds after the second set and I could see them in my phone with it being dark and with the stadium lights on in front of me.  You could still see in the sky the three lights in my phone pretty clearly. I noticed they were dimming away and I took a picture at 19:43.  (It's on my phone and I'm not sure how to get it off). The next few seconds there was a single light to the north and lower from the first three lights we saw. Then there was a single lights to the south of the first lights we saw.  Those only appeared for maybe 3-5 seconds.  And had the exact same color and brightness the first three lights had. With in 30 seconds after seeing the last light my mom noticed a plane flying toward the area we saw the lights.  It was coming from the west north west at approximately the same altitude.  It was noticeably how the lights on the plane stayed lit and had one blinking light and that those lights were not the same intensity or color of the three lights earlier and where not near as bright. I attempted to leave a voice mail early today but was interrupted by my boss so I thought I would send you this. Thanks",2008-10-31T00:00:00,31.6393,-98.977

This fireball was trailing a trail of orange sparks.

I have never seen a two-colored meteor, and this thing was whizzing along horizontally, going parallel to the horizon, which is odd behavior for a meteor, in my opinion.

We were watching shooting stars and watching the sky as many of us find as an enjoyment before going to sleep. Right at 9:49, an bright light appeared in the southern sky (looked like landing lights at first), note the airport is closed to all operations after 8pm local time. All of our group was very surprised by this and thought it to be an aircraft in distress. As the object approached the airfield, it was traveling directly north, at an estimated 2,000 ft (aprox only, we cannot verify this), and crossed just to the west of the airfield, paralleling runway 18/36. As it got closer many of the group members took snap shots and video, which many are blurry etc but it was there. As the object came within viewing distance, the only visible part was a large flame. This flame was twice the size of Jupiter in the southern sky. It was moving fairly slow, less that 100kts as it moved over the airfield, and it resembled the flame of a hot air balloon, but was silent. We had the knowledge that hot air balloons do not fly at night and that they are easily heard from the ground, and also the flame never went out, like many times happens in a hot air balloon. This object moved to the north of the airfield, we aprox. Over top of the north 40 area, and it made a left 45 degree turn, and rapidly departed the area, not only gaining altitude, but it increased its lateral distance from us at a tremendous rate. All of the members of the group fly for a profession; (commercial and private pilots) were all in stun having never seen this before. This object lasted 3-4 minutes of duration as it moved over the area.

Their was a slight breeze so it was very comfortable (no bugs) and the temperature was nice (maybe 75 F), A MASSIVE heat lightning storm was constantly lighting up the eastward sky (towards Raleigh NC) from us in Fuquay Varina NC. No rain, no thunder. At 10:30PM (approx) my wife said ""ARE YOU SEEING THAT?"" We stopped in the street as we were walking and looked up and in the direction of the lightning (EAST), but between us the lightning was a single glowing silent bluish green round orb. Slowing accending and getting farther away. I had no watch, cel phone nor camera of any kind. We watched it accend and fade into the distance in about 60 seconds. It had a smooth SPLINE flight path but NOT EXACLTY straight. I moved like it could be a self-illuminated turquoise balloon. BUT it's size was much bigger than the regular basketball-sized party balloon. If you hold out your arm and look at your pinky fingernail. It was about that size in the sky. And we would guess a few thousand feet away at least. So I would estimate it to be at least the size of a van. Maybe 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a hot air balloon (but it was completely round and not pointed at the bottom like a hot air balloon). But a party balloon that size in the sky would only be a few houses away, maybe 200 feet. This thing was UP in the sky and getting higher and ""drifting"" away at a pretty good speed. It HAD to be bigger. It glowed a strange color. Not intense green color like a street light. More of a diffused turquoise color. I say it was more green and my wife says it was more blue. But we both agree it was turquoise. It was completely silent. Straight above us was a clear patch of sky with no clouds and bright white stars. It was not ""bright"" like Venus was that night. It was dimmer but still clearly defined against the sky. Possibly it was brighter at the center than the edges of the object but I can't say for certa! in. I've never seen an object/light that color, especially in the sky before. It got so distant after a minute you could not see it anymore. There was a few neighbors (2 adult men) also looking in the object's direction standing in the street a few houses down (probably looking at the constant lightning which was beautiful) and I was gonna ask them if they saw the object but before I reached them they went inside. I don't know them so I did not ring their doorbell. The next day I asked a few neighbors I do know and they of course laughed and said no they didn't see anything the night before. Then I googled to see if anyone else saw the object and might be chatting about it, and found a wikipedia description of the same or similar turquoise object (the one I saw never grew a white comet-like tail) being spotted in nearby Charlotte a year or so before. So after telling my wife THAT, she said I should report it. I called the local police and they said ANYTHING having to do with the sky is the FAAs domain. So I called them and got an answering machine. I left a message. Then I left a message at my local newspaper. THEN I reported it on MUFON. Then I called 2 local tv stations and they said they had not had any reports about it. It's really bugging me. I really want to know what it was - and stangely AS I WAS WATCHING IT, I was already bummed out that I'll probably NEVER KNOW what I'm looking even is. And although, I did not have a camera I'm a graphic artist so I immediately made a composite (re-creation) photograph or what it looked like (using imagery from the web). I hope you can understand the experience we had and help discern what it might've been. About 45 minutes later my wife saw a ""shooting star"" in the areaof sky as the round object. We stayed outside for about an hour after talking about it and hoping to see it again. But we never did. Now I keep a digital camera with me when I walk our neighborhood.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

Since my first sighting in March 08' I spend a few minutes at the end of the day star gazing on clear nights. This particular Saturday night I was standing on my porch which faces south. I was just about to go inside when I observed some sort of oval craft travelling North to South. The craft had no lights, but was a light color which made it just visible in the star light. It was pretty low, maybe 500 feet or so. It made no audible sound, was moving very fast and in a perfectly straight line with no visible variation in speed. It was about the size of a thumbnail held at arms length. As it was passing over my neighbors house I ran down to the street in hopes of visually re acquiring it, but it was already out of sight. At first I thought it may be a bird flying at night, but I don't know of any birds which fly  500 feet high at that speed, in a straight line at 10:40pm at such a size. Most birds are not oval either. As this thing was passing over, the dogs in the general area began barking which lasted for about 2 minutes. After observing the sky for another 10 minutes or so, I went inside. We are currently dog sitting my Mother In Laws little dog which I found cowering in the corner of the living room. I have never seen her do that. It took several minutes to get her calmed and to stop shaking. One other thing worth mentioning is that this craft, or whatever it was, took the exact trajectory as the first craft I witnessed back in March 08'. My March 08 sightings (there was one and then 3 in a row a few nights later)were the first sightings I have had in my 45 years. I was somewhat of a skeptic until recently. I have noticed that many professional people, including astronauts and pilots are beginning to come forward regarding their UFO experiences.

It also didn't have any distinct shading, by that I mean to say that I could not concretely identify any appendages that would normally be visible, such as the wings. It was also traveling at a higher speed than a plane like that normally seems to move. It was quite far away, and I do not have the best eyesight. I could not hear the roar of any engine, but that is most likely due to the distance. Also, there was no cloudy trail left behind in the craft's wake.

It had just gotten dark with a barley noticeable hint of light off in the sunset horizon. The parking lot was slightly lit with a few street lights but still dark. From one split second to the next, a very bright glowing object caught my eye from behind one of the tree tops, slightly to my right. I immediately grabbed my girlfriend and pointed it out to her. It seemed to take a quick second before it registered to her, then as I remember her words, ""Oh, my gosh."" At this moment I thought I was seeing a flaming meteorite coming toward the mill creek area from the North West sky. I thought it was going to impact upon Mill Creek (a small suburban area adjacent to the South end of Everett). It was heading south east toward the ground. A second object followed directly behind the first in the exact same path. The airborne objects proximity seemed to be approximately 1-2 miles away, seemly closer to a mile. Their estimated size was impressive appearing the equivalency of a small to medium size two story house. If I were to extend my arm and hold my thumb in the sky to its location it would have easily doubled the size of my thumbnail, if not larger.  After 8-12 seconds of first sighting, it became vividly apparent that this was defiantly not a meteorite. There was a brief moment where I wondered if this object was an aflame, out of control aircraft. After 15-20 seconds of continued observation, I identified the object as a controlled, somewhat slow moving object that was not a part of the natural occurring environment. Shortly after continued observation the object did appear to have flames coming from it, however they were not out of control. It appeared to have a spherical globe around it containing and controlling the flames. It’s steady, even and concise movements quickly made it apparent that it was not aflame. Moreover, the spherical globe around it became more visible. These observations were taking place as the object stopped its downward movement toward Mill Creek and began an upward climb out of the city. Its movement was so clean, even and precise that its rapid accent was one of the most intriguing points abo! ut the entire sighting. It disappeared without seeming like it was moving fast. In an instant it was gone as it appeared to move directly out of our atmosphere. The second object followed suit exactly.  TO BE 100% CLEAR AND UNSWERVINGLY CLEAR ABOUT THREE THINGS: 1.	This was not an aircraft even remotely resembling any aircraft within the worldwide public aeronautics industry. 2.	This sensory experience defies many laws of physics and rational thought. I am a scientific mind and have always required tested proof to accept something as fact. These beliefs have all been challenged with this experience. I am forever affected. 3.	I now know for a fact that there are things in our reality that we don’t have a clue about, that we cannot comprehend.

The weather that morning was mostly cloudy with some sun shining through in patches.  It was not raining and the temperature was about 20 degrees Celsius. As I was walking to the parking garage, I look up and noticed a black cylinder shaped object that was crossing the sky in front of me (between a 45 and 50 degree angle upwards in the sky, traveling in a left to right (west to east) direction.  I wouldn’t dare guess at its length but with my arm extended it would be about the width of my thumb. As I was watching it sunlight momentarily reflected off of it’s surface for about 3 or 4 seconds then stopped, at which point I noticed it was rotating in a counter clockwise manner.  It resembled a cylinder in shape that appeared to have flat surfaces down the length of it (like a stop sign).  There were no wings, no propellers, no contrails, no markings or lights, and most importantly no sound of any kind!  At this point I thought it was maybe a satellite but determined that it couldn’t be due to its low altitude.  Its trajectory was smooth (like a satellite in space) with a hint of intermittent acceleration within its forward motion; it definitely appeared to have no problem maintaining its altitude and velocity (which tells me it was not a falling satellite). Sunlight reflected off it again for a moment due to its counter clockwise rotation and by this time it is now to my right at about the two o’clock position.  The reflection then stopped because this object was traveling underneath the cloud ceiling.  A few moments later it ultimately disappeared into the clouds themselves.",2009-08-27T00:00:00,42.98372082362082,-81.25387288267288

I saw it flash bright one more time and I went to the bedroom and told my wife there was a a strange light in the backyard and I was going out there to see what it was. She got up and went to the window and I heard her say, ""I just saw it too, what is it?"" I told her I didn't know but I was getting my flashlight and going out there to see. I walked out through the back yard and pointed my light all around. There was nothing , no sound either. Then as I ! was shining the light out in front of me my wife said, hey did you see it. I said no, she said to your left, and I pointed my light off to the left. Nothing. Then she said can't you see that? I did it again, same spot. Nope I didn't see any flash.

By this time my daughter had awaken hearing her mom talking in the dark bathroom out the window to me got her curious. She saw it also. I then walked back out toward the flash and it looked like it was now right next to the ground as I could see the outline of the weeds in the light. It flashed twice right next to the ground.

We were in the backyard for a few minutes when I saw a bright light that seemed stationary in the Northeast sky.  I pointed the light out to my wife and than noticed it was slightly moving from north to south.  We live 40 miles outside Washington DC, near Dulles airport, so we do see a lot of airplane traffic.  I started to think we must be looking at a slow moving airplane.  As the light got closer I noticed there wasn't any blinking lights and this light was not acting like a conventional aircraft.  The light would slowly move than stop and stay stationary for several minutes than would start moving again.  While we watched the light I told my wife to stay and watch so I can go inside to grab the camera.  I ran into the house, grabbed the camera and opened the back sliding glass door. Just as I started filming the light was just making it over my house, I told my wife to meet me in the front yard. As I ran to the front yard and met my wife I again started filming the light, at this point it was slowly flying above Orion, which was just rising in the east. This is when the unbelievable happened. Just as the light was above Orions belt my wife said ""Look it's turning around"" I couldn't believe my eyes. The light was making a complete U-Turn. But even more spectacular, as the light made the U-Turn, another light continued moving south and stayed on the original path. What I'm trying to say is-the light we were originally watching turned into two separate lights. One made a complete 180 degree turn headed back north and was blue in color, the other light continued south. It seemed to me that these two lights were somehow together or connected and than separated. The light that U-Turned off the original light soon stopped and remained stationary for approximately five minutes as the other light continued south. Soon after the original light was out of sight the U-Turned light started moving ag! ain towa rds the north until it was out of sight. During this sighting my neighbor was also walking his dog, he saw my wife and I and was also able to see the two lights after they separated. This was our sighting. I really hope someone else saw what we did.  Thanks",2009-01-10T00:00:00,38.8175,-77.6308

Initially this was a white light that emitted periodic white starburst-like rays that stayed fairly close to the center point of light. It would periodically move in a jerky manner and then stay completely stationery for a while. When the object came closer it appeared to be a stubby cigar-shaped tube and continued to emit light rays periodically from a central light point. At one time, for about 20, minutes a central point of light would appear (like a stamen on a flower) and the object would rotate around as though it were a satellite dish scanning the area below it. I went and got a neighbor to see it so I could be sure I wasn’t losing my mind or something. He didn’t know what to make of it but didn’t really seem to care and went back inside. I sat in my truck bed, realizing it was not a man-made object, and opened my arms wide and tried to mentally will it to come to me (if this makes any sense). To my amazement, it moved almost directly overhead and mov! ed closer, at which point I could no longer see the object but only the radiating light. It came closer to me and became like a cat or fox’s face with the light rays being like whiskers or something. It would come closer, actually very close, and immediately recede if I moved arms or blinked, as though it were tentative or shy. It seemed to prefer it when I crossed my arms over my chest rather than spread them wide. After ~15 or 20 minutes of this the cat’s face transformed slowly into almost the classical “alien’s face”. Then it seemed as though I was looking down the wrong end of a telescope; everything became dark around the outside and a narrowing circle of light was at the end with a being at the center who became increasingly wrinkled as the circle closed. I felt almost paralyzed but really started to freak out so I waved my arms and the whole thing retreated immediately. It then came closer and retreated but with the “alien face,” not the cat’s face. I watched this f! or probably 30 minutes and then figured that while this was a ! unique a nd weird thing going on there was no point in watching it any more and went inside to go to bed. I did look out the door a few times and the thing stayed around for maybe 10 minutes and then was gone. I know this makes me sound like a whack job or something, but I’m generally a very skeptical person and have multiple science degrees. So there it is.

I was outside in my backyard on my deck for about 10 minutes. During that time I noticed how beautiful the sky looked and began to gaze up at it while I finished my cigarette. I noticed planes in the sky and I am fairly familiar with the different lights used on commercial and private aircraft, and what I saw in the air was strangely disturbing. While star gazing I remember looking away from the stars, and when I looked back the first thing that caught my eye was a fast and bright strobe-like light moving in the general direction towards Carlisle, PA.  Once I saw this strange light I was intrigued and the first thing I thought was that it was just a plane with a spectacular lighting pattern and colors of dark yellow, red, and white – no greens and blues normally associated with standard civilian aircraft. What made me change my mind and become a little nervous was the movement it began to make as it traveled across the sky. At first it seemed to maintain a steady flight pattern, but soon the object (at this point I had a feeling it wasn’t any plane that I was familiar with) began to make a very random, quick yet smooth motions that omitted absolutely no sound. It almost looked as if it were making cursive motions that one could associate with the writing style. However, even with the awkward motions the object continued to move in the general direction of NE-SW, until I looked away again. When I looked back to same area it once was, the object had moved surprisingly to a position higher in sky (not altitude but degree – altitude seemed to be constant) and was now heading more for a NW route. That’s when denial struck, and as I was the only outside (my friend was playing guitar in the basement) I didn’t really want to be out there by myself it was a little eerie, and the object i! n the sk y wasn’t necessarily the  most comfortable thing to floating around above me at the time so I went inside.

It starts off as a very intense bright star around 7pm and thoughout the evening moves very very slowly. It starts off in the east and fades over the pacific before it blinks out. I began to realize this isn't a star when I was walking my dog one evening, it was a cloudless summer night in August, it was beautiful to look at the stars and take my dog for a walk. As i began to walk, I looked up at the bright ""star"" and it just turned off. I thought that was kind of weird. So when i got home, I sat in my backyard with my mother and told her, as to her dismay she didn't believe me so i wanted to prove it. We watched the star and in 17 minutes time, the star began to move. When it moved, it was wobbly. And right before it moves it shoots off a red light into the air. This happens every night, we are pretty sure this is a traini! ng mission or something of the sort for this UFO that eventually keeps moving very slowly and blinks out over the pacific ocean every night.

The fire balls then shifted or jumped down to the left and disappeared after about 2 seconds. A minute or two after that, two red dots (that looked slightly different than the fire balls, more rounded and distinct) about 4x the size of a normal star appeared to the left of the first sighting. Then one by one, the dots would move in sequence to the left or north, horizontally, as if jumping one another, but blinking out as it would move. This happened for about 5 to 8 seconds with the dots jumping each other about 5 times and then they just disappeared. A lady in her mid 50’s then came up to the beach access after saying she saw the red dots. The three of us then watched for about 10 minutes or so as randomized flashes of light could be seen off in the distance and scattered throughout the sky, but in the same vicinity as the other sightings. The flashing looked like the same kind of flash a camera would produce, but it was faintly obscured by clouds. There could have been close to 500 flashes, some bigger or brighter than others. Seven people, ranging in age from 13 to 35 began to walk onto the beach. Just as they got there the two red dots flashed again, off to the right and slightly above the moving/jumping dots. This time they were sort of diagonally sloping to the left and then jumped parallel downward and disappeared. The flashing lights slowly became less numerous and then seemed to stop all together.

Viewed from Miller and Baseline road. Two seperate craft. On December 9th 2009 at approximately 21:00 hours, I was driving southbound on Miller road approaching Southern avenue.  I noticed two bright lights to the south that appeared to be about one mile away near the old mill.  As I approached my turn at Maricopa I was still watching the lights as they were out of the ordinary.  They appeared to slowly be moving to the west as I was traveling west down Maricopa road. This is when I became alarmed. As I made the turn onto sunset point south bound, I kept fixated on the two lights hovering in the sky.  They appeared to stop moving. I raced to baseline road as quickly as possible.   When I got there I parked on the south side of baseline looking south.  The object was approximately 300 yards away hovering about 100ft in the air.  I could barely make out a dark silhouette between the lights.  They appeared to slowly begin moving south when the light on the right side of the object flickered out slowly.  The other light remained, but appeared to be dimming.  It took approximately 30 seconds to one minute before the left side or remaining light dimmed then flickered out as well. I regained my composure and began to try to rationalize the sighting.  Maybe it was something I just hadn’t noticed before.  Anyway my Wendy’s was getting cold, so I began to leave.   I looked back up, and the lights were back, but twice as far away as and farther east than before.  I realized I had my digital camera with me, I took video for 1min 45 seconds at this point.  The lights hovered and slowly started to move south. Throughout this entire time the object never lost altitude, and wasn’t moving fast enough to achieve this by conventional means like everyday aircraft. No noise either, just silence. Video was stopped due to poor camera quality. I continued to watch for approximately a minute longer absolutely fixated. I looked away to prep the camera for more video. When I looked up there was another set of two lights. Closer together and not parallel to each other like the first lights. I took video again for 1min 45 seconds. The first set were still there, but began to flicker out just like the first time. First the right one went out quite quickly. Then the left remained illuminated, but appeared to be dimming. The newer set of lights maintained its tight formation with the first object as the remaining light from it disappeared. They then began to slowly move south until I could no longer see them.

I woke up at 4:00 a.m. to behold a bright yellow light, about three times bigger than a bright star, even with the ridge top east of El Rito.  The ridge is about 500 feet above the valley floor where the town is situated.  I was looking east at this object. Within 5 minutes, it had risen about an “inch” above the ridgeline.  In two or three more minutes, it had risen about 2 “inches.”  (If I hold up my fingers horizontally and squint with one eye, it seems to have risen to two fingers above the ridgeline. Then, as I sat there watching it, it started to descend rapidly, throwing out a shower of sparks behind it.  A shooting star was descending at the same time, to the northeast, but this object was not near it, and it was bigger than the shooting star.  Suddenly it turned in a J shape, and began ascending again, then stopped and stayed in the same place. I continued to watch it for 45 minutes, until 4:45 a.m., when I became so sleepy that I couldn’t keep watching anymore.  In that time, it had risen 6 finger-widths from the ridgeline, faster than the sun rises, so I think it was rising faster than the rotation of the earth. Part of the time, I watched it through binoculars.  When I did, I seemed to be able to discern a crescent shape, and through the binoculars, it appeared to be sending out rays in all four directions like a cross. Perhaps I was looking at Venus, which my almanac says is bright in the morning sky right now.  But if that was Venus, then why was it brighter than a shooting star, and bigger, and why was it rising so rapidly, and why did it descend, sending out a shower of sparks behind it, and then turn in a J shape and ascend?  I think this is very unusual. I spoke today to a local astronomer, who hadn’t noticed it.  I’ve agreed to get up at 4:00 a.m. tomorrow and observe again, and he has agreed to observe also, and I will call him at work on Monday morning, June 1, and we will compare notes.",2009-06-09T00:00:00,36.3434,-106.1886

Occurred: May 29, 2010 around 9:20pm   I was driving to work from my home getting ready to turn onto I-205 north and to the East above the treeline I saw 3 lights in the sky. They were in a perfect formation of approximately a 25-30% angle triangle with the center point above the other 2 outer low points. The points of light were way to far apart to be any plane or aircraft I have EVER seen!  I didn't see any distinct blinking lights like those from an airplane or any other common aircraft.  The individual lights would somewhat pulsate in intensity but not a true blink. One light would get brighter though the light didn't radiate outward to appear any larger, just brighter, as another would dim in unison. They seemed to ""take turns"" dimming/brightening.  I don't recall seeing any odd colors just white/yellowy lights. As I turned onto the freeway ramp I lost sight of it for a moment then regained sight of it to my right as I was heading north.  At this point it seemed as if the formation had slightly shifted but gone up a bit higher in altitude, though still too low to the ground for this to be a military type plane formation maneuver.  Now the northernmost light was slightly lower than the southern pointing light and it appeared closer to the center light, like how the perspective would warp if you had a solid triangular object and pivoted it slightly clockwise. At this point a fourth light appeared just barely above the tree line and even further back in the south direction than the back corner of the triangle and much lower.  This light seemed brighter and larger than the other three and seemed almost to be a tail???   Upon a quick glance at this point it would almost appear as if the little dipper had lost part of it's tail, it's bottom star, gotten very close to the earth and hovered there above Oregon City. Unfortunately I was not in a position to stop and shoot footage as I was running late for work.  I called home quick to see if my husband could see it but he could not even though we are on a slight hill.  The object was just hovering too low for it to be seen from many locations.  I say object, yet strange thing is I didn't see any solid object holding these lights in this formation.  It was BY FAR the oddest thing I have EVER seen! I have looked all over the internet, called news channels and even the local dispatch and NO ONE else seems to have reported this.  This is why I'm posting this here. I am not crazy or anything but some verification that ANYONE else saw this would ease my mind!  Thank you for reading.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,45.3573,-122.60679999999999

May 29th, 2010. At approximately 10:30pm I was leaving my office in downtown Oregon City.  I was walking to the place I normally park under the bridge when I remembered it was Saturday and I had parked right in front of the office where the meters don’t run on weekends.  As I was heading back, facing east, I noticed four (4) lights over the cliff where the big Oregon City elevator is - Which coincidentally is shaped like a UFO. They looked fairly high up, about as high as a plane would be coming in for landing at PDX from that distance - Ten thousand feet, (10,000) maybe? They ascended slowly upwards, appearing over the cliff. Although they were shaped like a triangle, it was apparent they were separate objects in a triangle formation. As they rose the formation began to break up and they criss-crossed each other.  They gradually faded the higher they climbed, eventually disappearing altogether. As one formation began to fade another rose up over the cliff a! nd as similar pattern was repeated. They moved slow and consistent, like balloons being released on a calm day. There was no mistaking them for balloons, however, it was very dark and they were lit up by their own light sources, not the sun or moon.  There appeared to be 12 total but I could be wrong.  I was frantically trying to call my workmate who was still up in the office to get him to come down and see. He made it down in time to see about 4 of the remaining lights before they faded. The lights were red-orange in color and they did not blink, flare up or change shape.  They were simply very bright as the rose over the cliff and faded the higher they climbed. We waited about 10 minutes to see if anymore appeared, but that was it.  End of show.  On a personal note, I am 34 and have never seen a UFO before, of any kind, except on film.   The behavior of these lights reminded me very much of some films I have seen of UFO clusters in the day time. Silver orbs floating arou! nd like balloons, eventually ascending and fading out.

On Saturday night, May 29th at approximately 10:30pm I took the dog outside before going to bed. I always take time to scan the skies while outside after dark. Sometimes I take my night vision scope out because there are so many more stars and other objects that are seen with the night vision monocular than with the naked eye. Last night I took the scope outside with me again. I was able to see, what I believe were, two separate satellites traversing the night sky. These are usually always seen at least once a night through the scope. However, after looking at the sky for a good 10 minutes I was able to see an object that I could not identify. This object was traveling from west to east very high up. Because it was only visible through the night vision I could not discern if this object was within the earth’s atmosphere or if it was out in space. This object moved much slower than the satellites I see every night, much slower. It also brightened and dimmed in a rhythmic pattern. While the object moved through the sky it would slowly brighten, stay bright for about a second and then slowly dim again to nearly invisible, staying dim for approximately 4-5 seconds. This pattern repeated itself during the length of time I watched the object. It didn’t flash quickly or erratically, nor did it move briskly or erratically. This object stayed on the same course repeating it’s brightening and dimming as it went. When the object was at its dimmest, it blended in with the smaller, less visible stars in the sky. The size and shape of it was very much like the rest of the stars. I was not at all able to see this object without the use of the scope, even when it brightened to its maximum luminosity. Eventually, this object flew out of sight. Given the slow movement, size and the fact the object was not visible without the scope, I believe this object to have been in space. If it was, it had to have been extremely large!  There were other aircraft in the sky during this sighting. I could hear and see an airliner coming from TIA in Tampa heading north and see smaller aircraft to the west heading south. These planes were much lower and faster than the craft I was watching. I am a paranormal investigator and have some experience in investigating and reporting unexplained events. I have seen satellites, the ISS, shooting stars and all kinds of aircraft as I have served in the USAF and currently reside in an airplane community; this object did not fit the description of any of these things.

WHEN: May 31, 2010, at approximately 12:50 a.m. WHERE: Driving South on I-75, about 2 miles before reaching the Williamsburg, KY, exit SIGHTING:  An unidentified object flew across the night sky just above the road in front of us;  it appeared and illuminated suddenly and seemingly from nowhere, moved extremely fast in a straight line  (although it seemed to move slightly forward across the sky), and just as suddenly, completely disappeared seconds later SUMMARY: While driving home to western NC from Berea, KY, a friend and I observed what neither of us can logically explain as anything other than a UFO.  [OBSERVER 1/INCIDENT REPORTER BACKGROUND INFO.] Being both an avid astronomy enthusiast and the daughter of a retired USAF fighter pilot, I believe that I am a very good judge of determining the “identity” or cause of an illuminated and/or moving object in the sky.  Not only do I have a strong knowledge of what things in the night sky such as meteors/”shooting stars,” satellite/ iridium flares, planes, helicopters, etc., look like, but I also have a healthy dose of analytical skepticism from my father which I always apply when something out of the ordinary presents itself. When the topic of a UFO is brought up, I always think of the story of the “Tucson Lights” ((NUFORC Note:  ((sic))  Phoenix Lights))  that is shown on UFO shows on TV often and hoe my father finds it slightly comical how much that incident is still hyped despite the lights so clearly (at least to him) being from A-10 flares (he was an A-10 pilot for 20 years, with over 4,000 hours in the cockpit).  However, my father has always been deeply fascinated by UFO stories/sightings, and he is a firm believer that much more happened at Roswell in 1947 than what the government ever told the public.  My father has instilled in me a profound love and curiosity for all things flight and/or outer space related, as well as a strong sense of the importance of thoroughly reviewing/examining something before drawing any conclusions. ADDITIONAL NOTES ON SIGHTING]   The object did not enter from one end of our line of sight and exit at the other, but rather, it suddenly appeared in the middle region of the night sky visible in front of us, and seconds later, disappeared directly in plain sight.  It did not have the movement, luminosity, or any of the distinguishing characteristics of a meteor.  Although it appeared to be an illuminated aircraft of sorts (not just a streak of light), it moved far too fast to be a plane as well as in a somewhat hard to explain irregular path unlike that of any airplane.  Additionally, its light was not constant like that of a plane in the night sky. It simply appeared in the middle of plain sight, moved across the sky in a way and at a speed that I have never before witnessed demonstrated by anything else, and then abruptly vanished while still in a clear area in the middle region of the night sky visible to us. Having observed a comet, several meteor showers, a satellite flare, and of course, more planes and helicopters than I could ever hope to count, move through the night sky, what I saw in the sky this past night was almost bewildering, due to it being absolutely unidentifiable in any right.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,36.7222,-84.166

It was gray, and wouldn't be possible to see in such light, but it was visible. I have been a non-believer in such crafts until recently, and having witnessed one first-hand is more freaky.

The object was first noticed toward the right hand portion of the sky, and at the time, didn't seem much higher than around a few hundred feet up (judging by the speed it was traveling, and the movements it made).  The object was round in shape, and moved across the sky towards the left, all while it's color changed from a vibrant blue, to green, purple, red, orange, and so on.  It wasn't making any sort of sound, and didn't seem to be moving like it had a distinct front/rear and left/right. The object then changed direction with seemingly no effort, and did something similar to a figure 8 (still only moving at a medium pace). Just after the erratic movement, the object then proceeded to change it's shape from being round, to a more cigar shape with what looked like a bend in the center (it almost looked like a DNA strand in shape).   At this point, the object's two ""halves"" both started to change their own colors, all while the object started to move south and in a straight line.  The shape slowly morphed back into being round (as well as it's color back to a white), as the object increased speed and continued straight. It appeared that my first guess of it was being a few hundred up was wrong, because after a minute or two of this, the object then started to flash 3 times consecutively, every few seconds, as if it were exiting the atmosphere.  The object eventually disappeared after another minute or so, and no further lights/objects were seen again. I myself am an avid lover of UFOs and their mystery, but had yet to see anything abnormal in my life until this happened.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,38.7625,-121.1649

Just before the Sighting ended, I noticed another Ball just East of the 1st one. After maybe 20 Seconds, they both just Vanished. You could see them kind of Fade Out of sight.

The ""stars"" were about seven full moons apart from each other. As I got closer to the city I could see that the lights were seemingly stationary because their orientation altered naturally with my approach and the turns in the freeway. I apparently was getting closer to them. As I got into town, near the area of Sutter General Hospital the three lights were to my side.

The aircraft continued along it's path and as it passed overhead, the color of the glowing light changed to yellow and stayed that color as it continued along its course and eventually out of sight. This area is near a military base and several other aircraft (actual planes) can be seen in the distance with their blinking lights. This aircraft was unlike the others as it appeared to be a gliding light, not once blinking as the others in the distant sky did.

The light looked only slightly bigger than Venus, and actually just looked like a travelling bigger star.  There was no pulsating, just a constant moving white light.  In about 90 seconds of observing, I heard the running of something with the sound of tennis shoes; which suddenly stopped or disappeared as soon as I looked in its direction followed by an evanescent light relation. I noticed in addition, that when I looked at this travelling light in the sky from the side of my eye, there appeared to be a long beam stretching seemingly all the way back.  However, this sight was quickly lost, and could not be seen straight on.  I tested this 5-6 times, and everytime I got the same result.  About 1-2 minutes later, I saw the light qucikly dim.  Then a few seconds later the light disappeared completely with no help of clouds.  This was the only msytical aspect of the experience, everything seemed rational albeit unexplained.

I watched for a minute and saw four of these lights slowly revolve around the circular silo before they flew off over my neighbors field into the distance quite quickly. I was not able to see these lights in detail, as the fog made them appear blurred, even though I was less than 100 meters away from them.

At first, I thought it could be the moon, but I very quickly realized that it was some sort of aircraft hanging in the sky.  One thing was clear: the light was too large to be a plane. I couldn’t keep my eyes off the light, as it was so bright it could be seen through patches of trees.  The light was round and had a yellowish tint to it.  I continued to track the light until I lost sight of it, almost as if it had left my horizon.  The experience lasted about a minute or so. Briefly after, I tried to call my father.  When I connected to his phone, I heard muffled background noise.  I listened as long as I could bear before I was too freaked out to continue.  I called my father again, and when I connected, he claimed that I had not gone through to his phone.

It was near 9:30pm on Monday, April 27th of '09. I was alone and traveling along US 25 heading toward I-26 and had crossed the state line not long before this sighting. I noticed the craft ahead of me; it caught my attention because of the unusual lights, how low it was and how close it was to the road. As I got closer to it, I became sure that this wasn't any type of standard aircraft I'd ever seen before. It was round/ball-shaped with two red lights on either side, center, and a row of at least 3 rectangular light panels on the bottom half which were strobing slowly in vertical sequence, from the top one down. It was about the size of the cab section of an 18-wheel truck. I estimate it was approximately 50 feet in the air, on the right side and just slightly over the road. It did not move at all, and as far as I could tell, it remained stationary the entire time I had visual contact with it. I had the radio playing and did not have the presence of mind to turn it off or down, so I am unaware if the craft made any type of noise. I did briefly consider stopping to try and take a picture, but the only thing I had with me was an older cell phone which previous experience taught me did not take decent pictures at night at all. I slowed my vehicle quite a bit as I approached in order to get a better look at it, being both fascinated but understandably a little shaken, too. In my rearview mirror, I previously had noted that another car was coming up behind me. I was driving quite slowly, so with that in mind, I sped up slightly to prevent annoying the other driver and finally drove past the craft, which still never moved from its position. Once past it, I looked in my mirror again and was dismayed to see that the car I'd seen behind me was no longer there--I'm not sure if the other driver had seen what I was seeing and pulled off or had exited the road somewhere--but I became immediately aware that I was now totally alone on the road, with no cars whatsoever in sight in either direction. This finished unnerving me and while I no longer saw the craft, I suddenly felt the need to at least be within sight of other cars/people, so I accelerated to appx 70-75 mph and stayed at that speed until I finally caught up to more cars about five minutes later. This was my first encounter of this nature. I came to this website to see if there were any other sightings in that area on that night and chose to report what I'd seen since I found nothing else. I sincerely hope it will be of use.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,,

No sound/wind I was taking the puppy outside for his evening walk before-bedtime at 10:35 PM and I was looking into the starry night sky while he sniffed around.  The clouds had not as yet moved in for the evening ahead of the storm front and the sky was clear and very still.  In the area of the sky above my head and slightly West by South-West I saw what I first thought was a falling star, but it was moving slower than a falling star and not in an arc,and had no tail like a comet, but rather moved  at a 50 degree angle across the sky--more like a satellite or swift moving plane, but with one bright light source.  It then flashed brightly once, continued move on its 50 degree angle, flashed brightly a second time and continued to move on the same angle.  Then it burst into the brightest white light that I have ever seen and bathed me and the surrounding landscape in a bright white apot-light (I cannot convey to you how bright this was!  Like a Halogen spot or an MR16 or a Mercury vapor spotlight)  I was looking upwards and I felt like my face and arms were stark against my shadow on the ground-brighter in contrast than anything I have ever experienced, and the surrounding landscape was lime-greener with the illumination than can be immagined.  Time seemed suspended for a moment and then the light was extinguished and the afterimage of the light faded like a halogen spot fades after it is turned off and the glow of it remains for a moment.  Then all was dark again. The puppy was coward down and the horses on the hillside began to stampede around the pasture in confusion.  I stood there waiting and trying to listen and evaluate the experience:  I had heard absolutely no sound---no airplane or helecopter, no missle whine, no explosion, no sound of any implosion with the ground.  The night had remained calm and still throughout the event.  I have only a vague sense of the scope of the illuminated area since I was staring up at it.  I can only say that the surrounding hills of the hollow were black and my ! immediat e area was illuminated:  perhaps 1 to 3 acres.  I am curious to find out if anyone else saw this event and has an explanation.  Was it a meteor, but I have never heard of them flashing several times and then bathing-light so this seems unlikely to me?!

She thought it was strange to see a plane that low and in that area, so she thought it might be a helicopter...but then she realized there was no helicopter sound.

As the craft slanted upward to go above the trees behind our house she noticed the bottom of the craft. She explained that the craft was about the distance of 2 1/2-3 car lengths from her window and noticed a light humming sound. She noticed in detail that the bottom of the craft was roundish oval shaped like the top but longer. It had red and purple light with a pink coloring mixed in it. She says that it is very difficult to explain and that she had never seen anything like it before. She described the bottom to look something like a brain with texture and the colors mixing together. The whole bottomed had a yellowish pink/peachy/ amber glow. She said the bottom seemed to smooth directly in the rest of the metal above the craft. The metalish material looked like grayish black pewter.

I went around to the front of our house to get a better angle above the tree tops and saw, to the west, two more triangles.  These were dancing in the air. Flitting about. Then they sped off. I went back to the back yard and the two triangles were still there but each higher in the sky and farther away.  So, not stationary, but I was unable to see them move because it was so gradual.  One hour later the two in the back were still visible but much farther away and higher in the sky. We live near an air force base and have witnessed Harrier jets come to complete stops in mid air.  I would love to have that be the answer.  I just question why they would be lit up like Christmas trees and stay floating high in the sky for hours.   Also the triangles were always facing me so if they were on the wings and the nose of a plane it would have to have spent all its time on its side to give that view.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,48.0435,-122.44469999999998

I was sitting on a bench visiting with my mother when I noticed what I thought were 5 geese flying in a v formation from east to west.   After looking at them for a couple of seconds I was shocked realizing that they were not geese since the sun was reflecting upon them showing that they were actually metallic sphere like objects.  The sky was clear and the temp.was about 65 degrees.   With excitement I yelled UFO's and the 3 boys (22, 17, &16 years old) came running to see.  I pointed them out and then I ran into the house to get the binoculars.  When I got back outside I tried to focus on the objects but I was to shaky so I handed them to my son’s friend.  We were all screaming and laughing that we couldn't believe what we were seeing.   As they started to go behind the tree line we ran to the corale area in front of the house to continue watching them.  One of the spheres shot off back towards the east disapearing as the other four continued steady and equal distance apart on to the north/west- towards Austin’s Bergstrom Airport.   They slowly just disappeared.  Right before they vanished a white prop plane (about the size of a cigarette butt) was traveling near and behind them to their south.  The plane must have seen them.  We heard the plane but no noise from the objects.  The plane seemed to have been traveling faster than the spheres.  The spheres were low and slow flying well beneath the cloud cover.

Time: Exactly 8:40 pm EST Date: Saturday, February 6, 2010 Meteorological Conditions: “Socked in” cloud cover, temperature in the mid-20’s. Rather bright out due to snow cover and cloud-refracted ground light. Objects Sighted: Three small, white orb lights, in triangular formation, also moving independently. Appeared as very bright stars, but BELOW the clouds. Duration of Sighting: Approximately 15 seconds. 	Driving to my friend’s house, exiting my neighborhood on a road that runs due west, 90 degrees to US Rt 219, I noticed three bright star-like lights in triangular formation “parked” still in the sky in a southwesterly direction, about 50 degrees from the horizon line.  The lights were seen to my left, out the driver’s side window. Approximate altitude of lights was 2000’ to 2500’.  I was instantly alarmed by this, considering the relatively low clouds, and they stood out plainly. I quickly noticed they were moving together, but suddenly they broke formation and began moving in tight, very quick elliptical maneuvers independently. This went on for about 8 seconds, before the “lead” orb began heading SE. The other two lights stopped their maneuvers, and rejoined in formation behind the “lead” orb. I could plainly see sky in between the objects, indicating they were indeed individuals and not one large triangle. All three were identical in size and brightness. Their velocity seemed the same, as no light moved faster than any of the others. I vocally exclaimed at this, as instinct and logic told me I was witnessing a UFO event. My brain scrambled to find another  explanation. The maneuvers were like that of a aerial dogfight, but all movements were rather fluid, albeit extremely fast and precise. These were much too small and fast to be even military aircraft. Also, the G forces being endured in such a craft must have been immense. Being someone who’s somewhat interested in the UFO phenomenon since a childhood sighting, I didn’t take my eyes off of them. There is no military air base near here, though the lights were in the airspace above our small local airport.  I happen to be an aviation enthusiast as well, and my eyes are often skyward, and I could tell these were no aircraft. They appeared as small, round lights, white in color, and rather bright like mini Christmas lights. I es! timate the size of the objects would be no more than 10’ in diameter. Top speed was in the 200+ MPH range easily. As mentioned, they stood out because of the refracted light carried by the clouds, giving an illuminated sort of gray background to my sighting. I continued to watch at a stop sign as the lights maneuvered speedily back into their original triangle formation and proceeded southeast across Rt. 219 at great speed and gaining altitude until they faded out and disappeared through the clouds. There was a moderate amount of traffic, so perhaps I wasn’t the only witness. Anyone traveling south on Rt. 219 may have noticed.  I’d like to note that I’m a college graduate, and I consider myself educated, articulate, and very mentally aware of my environment. I cannot explain what I witnessed. Attached is a basic Photoshop rendering of the objects as they appeared prior to executing the elliptical maneuvers. This is also the same formation they returned to after.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,38.9143,-79.8407

Therefore  I am always trying to debunk what my mind wants me to think. I live4-5 miles from the Redondo Beach coastline.  There is an airport ½ mile from my home, There have been a few times that a plane coming from over the ocean toward the airport seems to glow but I quickly figure out that it must be the sun reflecting off of the water and giving the appearance of a plane glowing.  The two times this has happened after a few minutes the plane looses reflection from the water and shows itself. Today however I was stumped. I wondered, not sure why, outside of the overhang of my carport and looked directly up beyond the airport airspace. I saw what I quickly thought was a plane that had caught  the sun that was behind me. My first thought was that this plane must be some aluminum shell picking up every possible reflection  it could to give the appearance that this plane was flickering with fire. The reflection was flickering like Morse code or something in that type of pattern.  The light moved at normal plane speed from west over the coast line to east about 5 miles past my location, slightly higher than 75% of the planes that come through this area.  Once it traveled far from me I expected the reflection to dim but it maintained it’s glow well.  I was somewhat perplexed but I still felt it was a plane. At the 5 mile point past my location it turn upward and traveled to a greater altitude, before turning back at what appeared to be around the same speed as many of the! WW11 planes and sesna’s  that decentin to the airport landing strip.  The glowing golden object came back past the airport heading west and then stopped it’s westwardly movement. It help position for the most part in one area for the next five minutes.  There was some minor attitude changes but it maintained a very still and silent hold of it’s position.  The moment it stopped movement I was not thinking plane anymore. I was able to go in my house twice to get my phone camera and my digital camera, both times when I came outside it had not moved and continued it Glowing flashes.I made one final dash inside my home begging my girlfriend to come outside, when I came out the last time the object was gone. Could it have been some type of metallic object like an aluminum balloon that appeared to be farther than it was, therefore it looked like it was traveling at plane speed and it just happened to catch the sun reflection and wind patterns that created its movement? I thought about that at certain point when I did not think it was a plane anymore but when I came out of my home for the third time after a 10-15 second absence the object was gone.  Before I went inside it was not moving at all and in 15 seconds it disappeared. I am not saying it was a UFO, but it was not something I could deduce, and going outside for noreason in the first place is a bit weird.

The object was moving towards me, heading north parallel to the west side of the freeway.  As it approached I could see that it looked like a sphere flying in the air, clearly not an airplane shape.  The object kept coming, as it got closer and the glare went away I was able to get a good view of it from the passenger’s front window. It was a metallic disc, with conical shape at the bottom and top, rhombus shaped profile.  It had no windows, lights or moving parts.  I was a metallic color, resembling what an unpainted aluminum aircraft body would look like and it had no markings on it.  It was moving in a straight line with no signs of leaving any trail behind it.  To the best of my a! bility I’d estimate the object was about the size of  a helicopter maybe bigger, flying some 350 meters off the ground at a speed similar to a plane.  The object flew with the edge of the disc pointing to the ground at a steep angle, the face of the disc pointing forward.  The closest it came to me was about 400-500 meters.

But they were moving, moving east.  They were keeping the same distance apart, as if they were attached. But I thought they were too far apart to be connected.  I believe they were at least my fist-width apart at arms-length.  I watched for a few more seconds, to verify they were in fact moving.  Then looked through my binoculars at the objects.  But the magnification didnt seem to do anything more as far as figuring out what they were. I thought the binoculars would reveal airplane lights blinking, or colors, or something.  But - nothing more than my eyes did, though I suspect they were a bit larger through the binoculars.  They just looked like white stars to me.  As I watched them disappear in the east, over treetops, they seemed to be going faster, and were now twinkling, like stars. ! I figured this was some atmospheric thing playing tricks on my eyes.  The closer one disappeared first, then the lead one turned to a blur before disappearing above the trees.

I was the one who first spotted it when I saw two airplanes in the unobstructed sky and noticed that there was a third object (the glowing ball) which was not behaving like the other two airplanes. We surveyed the area and noted that there were nearby radio towers and traffic lights that were visible slightly above the tree line, but none of these were at the same height as the object. We observed the object hovering for a brief period (about 5 minutes) and it was pulsating with light. Soon the object disappeared. We began to scan the sky again and a few seconds later we noticed the object again over the campus, a great distance away from where it was before. We didn’t know how it was possible for it to travel that fast. It hovered there for a while and disappeared. To me it seemed like it disappeared but I have terrible eyesight and wasn’t wearing any visual aids. My two other friends however could still see it as a small red dot traveling at an immense speed to the other side of the hill where we saw it initially. We then saw it change a series of colors (purple, white, and yellow) and it looked like it was wobbling back and forth in the sky. We continued to watch the object and it disappeared and reappeared several times, randomly getting brighter until it was the brightest object in the sky and it disappeared again to move to a new location. After about 30 minutes of observing this object, we were not able to locate it again.

Since I live near the Boulder Municipal Airport when I saw two orbiting red spherical objects (they were orbiting each other) over in the west of where I live (which is slightly to the west of the airport) I called the police non-emergency line. As the phone was ringing I saw a slight flash of green come from the east. A solitary green sphere was floating right over where the airport is emitting occasional bursts of light. As I watched the three orb/spheres I told the police what was going on. Then I saw something I knew I should not tell them. The green orb detached two smaller green orbs that chased the two red orbs off to the north. When I went inside to email this off, the large green orb was still there. All the time there were aircraft passing by at normal flight altitudes but what I found disconcerting was the fact that I could not hear the trains I normally hear this time of night going by on the tracks just under half a mile away. So you know, I am a firm believer in UFOs and have twice before seen them but never this many in a single sitting, it has always been silver doughnut shaped UFOs before now and in pairs. Anyway I am a student and a retail sales person who is between jobs and schools. If you are wondering why I list a California address that is my permanent address and the address I live at now I am here for only a few more weeks.

Following a Triangular UFO,Frankfort Square,IL,2009-04-01T20:00:00,triangle,Aprox. 1:30,"Occurred : 4/1/2009 20:00  (Entered as : 04/01/09 20:00) Reported: 4/9/2009 10:29:08 AM 10:29 Posted: 4/14/2009 Location: Frankfort Square, IL Shape: Triangle Duration:Aprox. 1:30",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/069/S69591.html,"Following a Triangular UFO I was debating whether or not to report this because of the date of the sighting.  Howevre I feel like it is important to report what occurred. I was on my way back to my girlfriends house after her, myself and our two friends went to a local store in Orland Park. She rode with our two friends and I drove by myself. I should mention a little about our background.  I’m a student at a local college as is my girlfriend.  My friend is the General Manager of a restaurant and his fiancée is a student also. I arrived at her house in Frankfort Square before they did so I waited in my car for them to arrive.  As I was waiting, I received a call from my friend who was driving the car my girlfriend and his fiancée were in.  He told me to drive to  St Francis Road and turn east towards Harlem Ave.  He said that there was a huge triangular object in the sky and I should be able to see it.  I immediately did just as he  said and the was a large triangular object in the sky. There were three lights on the object on each point and they appeared to be changing colors from red and blue constantly.  The lights were far enough in the distance that the shape was not clearly visible but when the lights moved, they stayed the same brightness and appeared to be equidistant from each other.  The object appeared at times to be pointing downward and then it would appear to turn and be pointing up or to the side. I told my friend that I saw it and we decided to see how close we could get to it.  We decided to drive south on Harlem to Rt. 30 and head east.  Two other cars appeared to have noticed it as they pulled over and were taking pictures on their phones.  I got out my small video camera and attempted to record the object but it would not appear on my camera.  I kept the camera rolling however to at least capture the audio of our conversation.  My friend called both 911 and NBC5 news to report what we were seeing. My car got  separated from theirs and they got close enough to the object where my girlfriend and my friends fiancée were both almost in tears because they were scared.  They followed Rt. 3o to Indiana and when they got to the city of Dyer, IN,  they reported that they had gotten really close to the object and then it disappeared.  By this time I was about 5 miles behind them and I could see the object clearly as a solid triangular object.  However when I got close to it, the object also appeared to just flicker out. I caught up with them in a parking lot in Scherriville, IN where my girlfriend got in the car with me and showed me some pictures she had taken on her phone. Only a single light was visible on all of her photos. As we talked in the parking lot about what had just occurred, my friends fiancée said that she “got a weird feeling that if we keep going east we will see it again.” I looked at her and my friend and said that we should probably head back home because I got a bad feeling about her last statement. However, my friend decide that maybe they should keep going east towards Merriville, IN. Well they decided to keep going east on Rt. 30 and my girlfriend and I decided to head north on Indianapolis Boulevard. We stopped at a bookstore so I could try to relax after what just happened.  About 3 minutes after we had stopped at the bookstore, my friends fiancée called my girlfriend crying saying that the object did in face ‘reappear’ and it looked “a lot more menacing.” I told my girlfriend that I wanted to talk to my friend so she handed me the phone and I had his fiancée put me on the phone with him. He sounded kind of scared and he told me that he yelled at the object and the lights appeared to “flare up”.  I kept talking to him as I went outside with my girlfriend and we saw the object to the south east.  It appeared that there were one or two aircraft flying in the area of the object. I cannot say if they were commercial or military. I do know they were apparently circling and were flying pretty fast. My girlfriend and I got in my car and we drove south down Indianapolis Boulevard  back to RT. 30 and headed east. I called another one of my friends from Valparaiso, IN to tell him what was going on and to keep a lookout because it appeared to be heading his way as my girlfriend talked to my other friends fiancée. They decided to turn around about half way to Merriville, IN. We followed the object to I65 in Merriville where the object vanished.  We went home after that and my girlfriend was talking to my friends fiancée on the way home and all she kept saying was that she kept “wanting to look up”. We did notice that the aircraft that were circling the area were still there as we drove home on I80. The whole event lasted about an hour and a half.  It was first noticed at about 8 :00 PM.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,,

As we were watching it it would turn directions while the triangle maintained its shape. At 6:55 pm I called Frankfort, IL 911 they said that there was multiple calls regarding the sightings. So I did the only thing I could, as I had no camera besides my camera phone which was not a very good at taking clear picture. So I started driving towards the UFO to get a better shot from a closer distance. after 30 miles we were into Indiana and the UFO was just a little too far out of Camera Range. While we were driving towards Indiana There was a lot of people sitting on the side of the road taking pictures. I never stopped to get any numbers and I would love to be able to contact those people. As we were driving into Indiana. The lights dimmed down as we saw 6 lights coming out of the south the strobe colors on the new lights were RED WHITE AND BLUE and they were fast movers. I think they were the air force because they circled the area for over an hour. I called all of my friends and family that were in the area and they went outside to look but they were too far away at the time. I also called channel 2, 5, & 7 news and they said that they would look into it through the police blotters. I left my number and so far I haven't gotten a call back. But I'm hoping that someone comes forward with pictures or videos that we can submit to the UFO hunters or the news. I never got a good picture of the Craft but we saw the objects for over 2.5 hours. The lights on the craft would switch from red to a bright orange about an half inch wide in the sky which is pretty big. there is no way this could be an airplane or a weather balloon or flares, because the lights would go out for a while then go back to a higher intensity and change color but it always kept the same formation. I lived outside of a air force base and have seen a lot of different aircraft flying and I have never seen anything like it. It reminded me of the '05 Tinley Park, IL sightings (which i saw too after my friend called me to look outside) If anyone has any pictures or videos please submit them. I am sorry I don't have any pictures but I will review the video some more and see if there is anything good on it. Thank you",2009-04-14T00:00:00,41.4738,-87.8377

I was out enjoying the sun when I noticed a light or silvery object (a point) drifting very slowly to the W.  It passed overhead about 1415 and finally disappeared behind the trees.  It did not perform any of the sudden maneuvers often reported of UAPs, such as darting off at extreme speed; it just slowly traversed the sky.  Size, height, speed unknown. It left no trail, did not flash, etc. A star or planet, or even a spacecraft such as the ISS?  Not likely.  It was too bright to be the former; and S/C are usually launched to the E. to take advantage of the Earth's rotation, so fly W-E.  They also usually go much faster, in angular velocity.  Not a jet; it went too slowly. Weather balloon?  Possibly.  Wind here has been light NE all day (as usual); but winds are usually W. at higher altitudes.  It did not seem to slow down or get fainter as it would if it had been climbing.  It could also have been a UAV (pilotless drone airplane), very high or flying very slowly.

Traveled NE. I am reporting a UFO sighting that my fiance and I saw while driving to a restaurant on Chicago's NW side (not too far from O'Hare airport). I saw a few light colored spheres in the sky above an airplane and my fiance confirmed it was there. I pulled over on Oak Park Avenue and took her camera to grab some photos. She counted 12 of these spheres, which seemed to be very high up. I was so busy trying to get her point and shoot Lumix camera to focus that I really didn't pay attention to any other detail about these things. I don't know if they all moved in unison or if they were all moving individually. They were traveling North East. My fiance says they may be balloons, so I checked the weather. The wind was blowing southwest at the time. Also, these wouldn't be planes because they were not only too high up but, I really don't think that many planes would be at the same altitude traveling North East (to Canada?). I called 311 (information) to make a report, and they transferred me to the Police. I was sort of embarrased so I asked them to just let the military know what I saw. The spheres eventually dissapeared into the distance and could no longer make out where they were. I have 1 photo of the luckily zoomed in capture of only a few of the spheres which I circled on photoshop with a pen. The camera had an auto focus which, unfortunately, couldn't find the things in the sky to focus on. So, out of the 10 or so pictures I took most were all blurry. I do have 1 picture or two that you can make out these things. I'd be willing to share the photos with someone who'd be able to help identify the objects.

The object was clearly visible from the ground, travelling too slow to be a plane or anything that I have seen before, very similar in appearance to a number of UFOs that have been seen over the UK in the last 12 months. It made no sound, and did not change direction as I could tell. Several witnesses all stood looking at the sky at the same time as me, and I had not been drinking or taking any drugs!!!!

I just saw a very strange movement on the sky.  When I saw it, I first thought it might be a plane, but some strange green and red lights were flashing on it.  But I don’t know how my brain got frozen, it was a strange thing which was moving slowly at first and then suddenly disappeared in a nano second I think.  It was moving towards west, towards Saudi Arabia, because it is located on west of Bahrain, from the sight I was viewing. When it disappeared from the scene I suddenly realize oh God I witnessed a UFO. I am not saying that exactly it is a UFO, but it might be. Unfortunately I was not having any camera at that time so I couldn’t capture any picture. The place I witnessed this strange object was deadly silent area where no one reside. It is between two hill towns.  Called East Riffa and West Riffa in Kingdom of Bahrain.   I was standing on top of a hill in West Riffa and I noticed this object on sky.  I don’t know if anyone else witnessed it.  But it was not too late at night, so I guess there might be someone else as well who might witness it.  It is a busy town, of Kingdom and around 6:30 pm  (This is not exact time when i saw the object, it might be few minutes different, but when everything ends i noticed it was 6:30 pm) during evening it becomes busier on roads.  I know, there were none around where I was standing, but it was too high in the sky, so it might be seen from far too, as Bahrain is a small country. I will also try to draw a picture of the object, which is still in my mind. I will never forget that moment. One more bad luck of mine was I was carrying Sony Erickson Z800, the camera of this phone is not that good, that I can capture the object photo clearly, and as I said I was out of my mind for few seconds when I saw the object. So I didn’t even realize that I am having something to capture this object. I am shocked and a bit scared to see such a strange thing flying over our heads and no one can notice it. I know this is hard to believe without any evidence, but I feel my brain was frozen at that time and then start functioning after it disappears. I just need to ask a question here, is it possible that UFO can freeze human brain? If YES, then I think that happened to me. It might not be a brain frozen, because if that was the case then how can I remember the movement and picture. But I was not moving I was stand still like a poll. I am not sure what happened to me but only I can see at that point was a really weird object flying over my head and moving towards west. I will draw a picture and will send to NUFORC as soon as possible.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

We were looking at an unusually bright star, concluding that it was probably a planet. We were discussing what planet it might be when I looked above it and saw a flashing light. I thought it must have been an airplane, but when I looked a bit higher, I saw two more. What was very strange is that none of the blinking lights were moving. They were very far away, so I couldn’t tell for sure if they were just moving very slowly. Then, the highest one started to rise upwards, and we realize that it was coming towards us. We watched, and the weirdest part is that it was completely silent. There is a small-craft airport in town, and we are used to hearing planes. This object made no noise at all. It kept moving towards us until it was finally above us and then past us. We looked up and noticed that it was shaped like a triangle with a light blinking on each end, one light red. I thought they might be government planes since Palin was in Bowling Green today. But they were so close together that it just seemed off. The one traveling above us kept going, silently. We looked back to the other two- one was gone, the other (the lowest one, the first I saw) was still in the same spot. We kept watching the moving one and then the third reappeared (or a fourth appeared, I can’t be sure) coming from a completely new direction. They were less than an inch away (from where I stood, it looked this way), slowed down a bit, and then kept traveling on. We watched for 4-5 minutes. I went inside to turn on the news and fire up my computer, but of course nothing was mentioned. I have never looked up anything online about UFOs before, and this was the first site I came across.

My second thought was, “it’s a meteor”, due to its incredible speed.

As I was driving up, I saw an orange light in the sky, surrounded by two aircraft, possibly helicopters, but I was not sure.

At this point I thought there may have been some sort of accident, as the two aircraft were still circling the sky, but the orange light was gone.

It streaked across the sky, leaving a trail, and disappeared. This event happened in less than a second.

This morning while walking my dogs in the rural area of Singers Glen Va. I was looking up periodically as I usually do trying to see any shooting stars when I noticed what  I at first thought was a satellite moving across the sky. I am a Chemical Engineer and was getting ready to leave for my regular morning workout before work. It is quite common to spot satellites from my house and I enjoy tracking them across the sky and so am quite familiar with how fast they travel and what they look like (basically look like a moving small star). The ones I usually spot are typically moving in a West/East direction. As I focused in on the moving object in the southern sky I realized that there were actually 3 objects. Two were adjacent to each other and the third was following behind about 5 to 8 times the distance of the two that were adjacent to each other. They looked very much like a satellite would (like small moving stars) and took about 30-40 seconds to move across the entire visible sky. They were traveling in a North to North West direction. Here is how they were aligned in the sky: + + + ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD)),2009-08-27T00:00:00,,

I stood up, watching it, and said “What the **** is that?”  My mother looked up where I was pointing, and as she did so, the object flashed again.  The flash was extremely bright, and it charged up first, flashed bright enough that it almost hurt the eyes, and then dimmed back to the reddish color again.

They were seeing strange lights in the sky.  We looked outside and the lights were also visible from our house. My account: Sky was mostly dark.  The sky was overcast.  My guess is that the cloud ceiling was 5000-10000.  I saw 6 red lights moving very slowly across the sky.  They were due west when I first viewed them at about 35 degrees above the horizon.  The lights were in a formation resembling two opposing triangle.  The two triangles were separated by roughly 5 or 6 times the length of the side of one of the triangles.  They were not in a tight formation, but stretched over what appeared to be a large distance.  My feeling was that the six lights were not part of one object, but they were independent of each other.  This seemed to be true based on what was observed later. The lights had a ""blurry"" look to my eyes, not crisp.  I do not wear glasses.  There was no unusual noise to be heard.  The lights moved from the western sky to the southern sky slowly.  At a quick glance they might have appeared stationary, but they were indeed moving.  After watching for ~90 seconds, the lights were in the southern sky and the three lights of the triangle to my right independently broke from the formation and seemed to move away from my vantage point.  The lights got smaller and smaller until they were not visible.  It appeared they ascended into the cloud cover and were no longer visible.  Within another 15 seconds or so, the other three lights in sequence did the same thing and vanished. I am 39 yrs old and have never seen anything like this.  It was completely unlike anything I could imagine.  Honestly, as it was happening, I was convinced I was seeing something from an extra terestrial world. I called the police about 45 minutes later to report this and they said many other people were calling with the same report.  He went on to say they heard from a neighboring police department that the lights were caused by weather balloons with road flares tied to them.  After hearing this, I doubted my first assessment.  However, the police report was not definitive. The day after this happened, Jan 6, this appeared on our local news station website:  ###### source: http://www.news12.com/NJ/topstories/article?id=223402#  (01/06/09) MORRISTOWN - It was something out of a sci-fi movie Monday night in Morris County when residents spotted mysterious lights in the sky. Residents in Florham Park, Hanover and Morristown saw the hovering red lights in the sky. Some are even wondering if the lights were a UFO, leaving some to think we’re not alone in the universe. Some who saw the lights called police. The authorities contacted a local airport to scan the sky with radar, but found nothing. According to police, the lights were possibly helium balloons attached to road hazard flares. ####  To me, the balloon and flare story is plausible based on what I saw.  When the flares went out, this could have been perceived as the lights moving away from me and then vanishing into the cloud cover.  However, I would like to know who set these balloons afloat and why they had flares tied to them.  Until then, the jury is out for me. One last note: from my parents vantage point, they saw 5 lights and not 6 like me.  We both claim the lights were clear as day to see so I can't explain the discrepancy in our accounts.

It was around 10:00pm UK time in the evening when I went upstairs to my bedroom to look out the window to see what the weather was doing. It was a very clear night, the moon was shining very brightly and so were the stars. However, as I was looking into the sky something caught my attention; my eyes were immediately drawn to a bright object behind the trees. At first, I wasn’t really sure what I was looking at, to me it looked like a bright star, however, it was the brightest object in the sky with the exception of the moon. That theory was quickly ruled out when it began pulling off incredibly fast movements behind the trees. It suddenly started moving from behind the tree in what I could best describe as fast short burst movements. It would suddenly move quickly and then just as suddenly stop dead in the sky. To give you an idea of the location, where I live we have a lot of trees surrounding our house, with two large trees at the front of our driveway. The object moved from behind one of the trees we have and settled in position between the two large trees. What amazed me was its variety of movements, it was moving up and down left and right and even diagonally and at times all within one movement and very quickly. The object appeared as a strobing bright whitish light that wasn’t really round, the way the light was in appearance suggested to me it was more of an oval shape object. But it appeared to be strobing very quickly, almost to a flicker kind of rate. I was absolutely mesmerized by this object; it was pretty amazing to observe what it was doing. This object didn’t appear to be very close; to me it was a typical size of a star, but maybe just slightly bigger. Another thing I would like to add to this sighting was the fact that while I was observing this object I was getting a kind of an emotional response to it. Wasn’t sure if this would be of any help or if indeed it has any relevance but I thought I would mention it anyway. It was strange to me. The actual sighting lasted for around 25 mins or more, I couldn’t keep myself awake any longer and had to go to bed. I can’t really say how long that object was in the sky, but it seemed to be lingering for quite a while. However, this morning I had another surprise on my way to dropping my wife off to work. Our local radio station announced a UFO flap that’s been taking place in the Reading area I live in and even stretching as far as Oxford as well. I thought I would mention this, as it might help you verify more on the report I am giving you today. I really do not know what is was, but I do know what it wasn’t; you can rule out blimps, flares, aeroplanes, and helicopters etc. What I saw was nothing related to conventional explanations and I am absolutely convinced it was very much out of the ordinary. I wished I had got it on camera, but unfortunately none of my equipment was charged up, so frustratingly I couldn’t use anything to capture the object. This isn’t the first time I have witnessed a UFO, I have had previous experiences with them in the past also, but this has been the best one so far. I am a regular listener of the Jeff Rense radio program here in the UK and always listen to your reports of UFO activity. God bless everything you are doing in getting the truth out about what’s really taking place around the world. I hope this report helps you in your investigations.

This was different than anything I have ever seen. After leaving my room, I immediately went to knock on my sisters door. She came out of her room in a panicked state and said, ""Did you hear that?"" We both ran downstairs into our moms bedroom and called 911. My sister then explained to me that the sound she heard was like a compressed boom, almost like a shockwave.

At first I thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but then I realized that the object was not moving. It was not a star and there is no way a helicopter could reach those kinds of elevations.

My story begins with some intrigue, last night our power seemingly went out, my wife and I awoke due to our fan going off, I quickly got up to shutdown my desktop before the APC ran down, but noticed that it was not beeping, then noticed we still had power, thinking it was strange that our bedroom breaker would go out on its own I went back to bed. It began getting colder in the house so I forced myself to get out of bed to check the breakers, thinking that our central heat possibly caused a breaker to trip.  Before getting outside I noticed that half the house was without power, not just my room and the heater, when I got outside there were NO breakers thrown, baffled, I went back.   Before getting back inside I looked up at the clear night sky, only to find a flying star, ""shooting star,""  I ask myself? Not possible, it moved extremely smooth and consistent, almost unreal, nearly straight above me moving east to west,  solid white light (like a star), it slowly faded so faint I thought it disappeared, but it was still visible. I continued tracking, then it became strong again (about 10 seconds of strong light and 10 seconds of faint light), it shifted direction and disappeared again, but this time I could not see it any longer (it did not go off into the horizon, it simply disappeared), so I turned around looked up to see the rest of the sky, AND LOW AND BEHOLD, ANOTHER!!!   That’s right, almost brighter than the first, now I am watching another one flying north to south.  I couldn’t take it anymore, it was about 5:30am, I quickly went inside and got my wife, it took about ten minutes to get her outside, daylight was approaching, and when we looked up scanning the sky we couldn’t see anything, she looked down on the horizon facing North, and she sees one!!!  I did not get to see it, she said it streaked across the sky shifted direction (up) and disappeared, I was satisfied enough not to be disappointed. A little background on my wife and me.  We live in the Texarkana area (outside of the city), I am a highly credentialed systems engineer, serve on a financial board, and often photograph the night sky with my wife’s DSLR (thus I know what the sky is suppose to look like, as well as what airplanes and meteor storms). My wife is a home maker, takes care of me and our 4 kids, she is also a photographer of her own business, and she runs a local MOPS group.

Traveling southeast I saw a string of orange lights.  They were very tiny to the eye. Almost the size of a very distant star.  At first it looked like formation of Canadian geese because it was traveling in a V formation.  But then very quickly and erratically changed their orientation.  They were then like a loose rope, or like a whip, still all in a line but following each other like a snake.  They traveled a great distance in only about 10 seconds.  1st almost over head and then out of sight.   It all happened very quickly but would estimate there were about 25 to 30 of them.

It was dark at that time, and as I was passing through the opening of two end units, I heard a power hand saw being used by a resident on his rear deck of the townhouses backing up to the drainage ditch which I was approaching from the opposite side.  The sound stopped and I saw him walk back inside his house as I reached the spot where I let my dog loose to run and fetch the ball (I know its dark, but I throw it to a spot across the ditch, just like I have done hundreds of times before). After I threw the ball, I have about 40 seconds before she returns with it, I looked up in the sky just to see the stars on this clear and crisp evening.  Panning the sky to the north, I saw what at first looked like a tighter that usual grouping of faint stars, a shallow V of an angle approx. 135 degrees to the backside of the V.  The V shape wasn’t a group of stars, because it was moving from the north to the south.  There were 5-6 dimmer than a star lights on each arm of the V and a gap of no lights to the front of the V.  The dark frontal gap was approx one-seventh the size of the V.  I spotted it approx 30 degrees from vertical where I was standing and tracked it moving south for only 5-6 seconds before it went dim.  It went dim before it was obscured by the height of the roofs of the townhouses across the ditch. Total view angle was approx 90-100 degrees. The height was hard to determine as I had seen nothing like it before to compare the size, although planes come from various directions regularly coming of going to Dulles or Reagan airport.  The speed seemed very fast even if it was low, but in the relative quiet moment of the evening as it was, I heard not a whisper of sound before, during or after the craft passed overhead.  It may have been higher than I thought but the speed would have been even faster to move across that span of sky.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,38.64662271428572,-77.31406

At approximately 10:00pm CT I walked outside to get something out of my truck when I saw something out of my peripheral vision. I looked up to see an object overhead 3/4 of the way up from the horizon. The object was moving very slow almost hovering coming from a southerly direction.  The object continued to move from the south to the north very slow.  The object appeared to be disk shaped with several yellowish white lights and a red non-blinking light toward the middle of the object. The object continued to move from south to the north were it made a turn and moved toward the center of town. This object made no sound and appeared to be the size of a house. The object appeared to be 150'-500' from the ground.  I ran into the house and yelled for my wife to come outside and look at this thing flying in the sky.   Upon going outside my wife saw the object and told me to run and grab the camera.  I got my camera and tried to get some photos of the object but wasn't able to get a good shot.   I called the local police department to ask if anyone else reported seeing anything strange flying around the night sky.  The dispatcher told me that nothing was reported but would advise any officers in the area to keep a look out.  I then went back outside and continued to look in the sky to see if I would possibly see it again.  My neighbor who is a police officer then drove up and I walked over to tell him what I saw when all of a sudden it appeared again. The object came from the same direction as before almost like it was circling back around.  My neighbor told me the only thing he could think it might be was a military drone.  I asked him why a drone over Spring Hill?   He said he didn't know but looked a little to big to be a drone and was flying too slow.  The object moved off to the west and appeared to turn up on it's side so that you could see the top.

At approximately 2:50am, while looking Southwest from a business just South of Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, California, a bright blue light in the sky caught my attention while I had been outside walking in a parking lot. The light was at the horizon and seemed far away, like it might be near Interstate 5 or the coastline. However, the light was brighter than it should have been if it was a regular aircraft flying from that far away. It was also quiet, so I assumed it was too far away for me to hear.  The blue light was flying to the left.  That's what really made me stop to look at it. I thought something was strange about what I was looking at. I work by an airport so I'm used to seeing lights in the sky all the time, but something seemed strange about this one. If an aircraft is flying from the right to my left in front of me, shouldn't I be seeing a red navigation light? The light slowed and changed colors.  It went from blue to red and flew back to my right.  It appeared to be circling something off in the distance, like a police helicopter. My initial thought was that it WAS a police helicopter, but I was still confused by the lights and the direction of travel. I have this saying to remember which side of an aircraft the lights are on: ""Go right ahead."" I think of green meaning 'go' and 'right' reminds me that green should be on the right side of the plane. As I stood there and watched, I expected to see a white search light come on. It never did. It circled a few times, even seemed to hover. It would moved off quickly again, dipped, and sometimes dipped so low that I couldn't see it anymore because it dropped below the horizon. It seemed to always be on the move and wouldn't sit still for long. I was looking over the top of a nearby warehouse, but at such an angle that I was almost level with the roof of the building so I could see the shape of A/C units silhouetted against at the night sky. I kept walking when I lost site! of it and tried to walk to a better vantage point nearby wher! e the bu ildings were not in the way and so that I might have been able to see more sky, but the light never reappeared. I stood watching it for at least a solid minute, maybe two, long enough to see it move back and forth a few times, and for me to think about what I was seeing. Stranger still, even if the navigation lights were somehow switched, I am certain the light was BLUE and not green when flying to the left. I walked by a traffic light soon there after and compared that color to a blue business sign off the side of the road. The light was definitely blue and not green. Thinking back on it, at the moment that it turned, I do believe that I saw a white center light and possibly two very small and dim red/green navigation lights very close together, which seemed right for the distance I thought I was seeing the aircraft at, however once its side faced me, it turned a very bright red flying to the the right, and a very bright blue flying to the left. There were no other aircraft! coming or going from Palomar Airport at the time. Things were pretty quiet with hardly any cars on the road. There were no sirens I could hear, no police cars or ambulances were flying down the road heading towards it. The weather was partially cloudy with a low ceiling. The aircraft was definitely below the clouds. If I had to guess what it was, I would still go with something like a police helicopter, but I've never seen them use a light set up light this. It behaved like a helicopter with its movements, circled, dipped, hovered, and moved off very fast, but everything just felt odd. I thought the lights were brighter and different. Back home, I even have a medical helipad nearby in which medical helicopters often land at in the middle of the night. Even close by, the medical helicopter lights were pale by comparison and they would often turn on a search light when landing. I checked my watch when I finally lost sight of the UFO and the time was 2:52am. I didn't suffer a! ny missing time, didn't feel any different, other than a bit c! onfused by what I saw now. I'm ex-military and a trained observer. I wish the lights were closer so I could provide more detail. I believe what I was witnessing was maybe 2 to 3 miles away. My best guess would be somewhere along I-5 or the coast between Palomar Airport Road and Poinsettia Lane, closer to Poinsettia.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,33.12780664961637,-117.30352710997443

I saw two V shapes composed of roughly 10 individual UFOs each (like geese flying south).  Each V would hold its form at the tip of the two arrows; but the back of each V (2 or 3 UFOs) would move randomly for a brief moment, and then return to the V.   I followed the Vs down my apartment complex street for as long at they were in sight. The UFOs moved slightly faster then I could walk.     A man was walking down the street at the same time I was, (going to the bus stop).  He noticed the UFOs and tried to make conversation, but there was a language barrier.  He spoke Spanish and I could not understand him.  I then returned to my apartment and wrote down the time, date and drew what I hade just seen.

That's when I took notice of it really. I watched it come toward the north, stop and then go west and then came to complete stop for about five minutes.

It was traveling southbound with me and without immediately considering the details I just assumed it was a particularly visible conventional aircraft, but it's odd shape kept my attention.  With only my own perspective to judge from I couldn't accurately determine the objects distance from me and therefore couldn't figure its speed or altitude but after watching it for a couple minutes I realized that it was either much too large and traveling much too fast to be anything conventional or it was flying much too low over the city.  Within a few minutes I was taking the 35 East exit and at this point the shape was south east of the city. Around this point it split into two lights, one was directly above the other.

I say roughly because one ball appeared to be out of the line and further ahead.  I initially thought it was a military craft formation of some sort moving from the southeast, however as they got closer, it became apparent that this was not something mechanical.  There was absoulely no noise at all, and no trails of smoke or vapor were behind them.  They were located not too far above the horizon (meaning I did not have to look too far up to see them).  They appeared to be moving rapidly to the west and the pattern they were moving in changed as they moved.  There did not appear to be grouped in any shape now as they were moving.  Right before they disappeared, they clustered up together in two ci! rcles and then started winking out one by one.

I was sat watching TV at about 1.15 am when My Husband came home from a late shift.  I got up to have a ciggy outside the back door and as I usually do when I go outside at night  I glanced up up to the sky. Just at that moment two bright white lights shot over our house, one just behind the other.  They were going at super fast speed, and I judged them to be quite low (About the same height as the local air ambulance helicopter flies over)  I can only compare the speed of them to war zone footage I have seen on TV of tracer bullets fired at night. they were that fast. It looked like one was tailing the other, and both seemed to be darting slightly from side to side as they travelled forwards. They got to a point just over the school behind our house and without slowing just shot up vertically and then vanished in the cloud. They were completely silent. No noise at all. Al this took maybe a matter of seconds. I was just stood there looking up with my mouth open. It really was a ""WHAT THE FU.....!"" moment. The hair on the back of my neck literally did stand on end!  I have never seen anything like it in real life. They looked just like those little things that fly around in the film ""Close Encounters"". In fact, that is what I thought as I was stood looking up at them. (I know that sounds like a bit of a cliché but that is the best way to give you an idea of what they looked like.)   I have no bloody clue as to what it was.  I had no time to get my a camera and film them, and even if I did I think I would have been to preoccupied to think about grabbing it. (I would just like to add, even though I am quite interested in reported UFO sightings, I don't particularly go looking for them, and wasn't even sure if I believed in odd things flying around in our skies.  I have never witnessed anything like this before, and even though I am quite rational and like to find possible explanations for stuff like this, after seeing something for myself I have no idea at all what it was.)",2010-05-12T00:00:00,,

Facing northwest, looking toward Rancho Bernardo. We came home at approximately 2045. I noticed that my wife and daughter were standing outside at the top of the stairs (2nd story apartment) looking in the aforementioned direction. I came back outside prior to the appearance of the objects. The objects were viewed in the same approximate vicinity. My wife was initially looking at a large white bird (I believe that it was an owl, we do see those around here on rare occasions.) I was able to go outside in time to see the bird fly away from a tree just above the mountain horizon. Within 15 seconds of the birds departure, my wife and I witnessed what she described as a fireball moving at a very high speed across the horizon from east to west at perhaps a 20 degree angle, disappearing from view as it went behind the mountains. I witnessed a second object, described later in this report. Here's my description of what I saw: The first initially looked like a meteor. I've seen plenty of them. After a brief retrospective moment, it seemed odd because this had a distinctive shape and appeared to be much closer than a meteor. We both agreed that the first object did have a ""fireball"" quality to it, although it was not like anything we have ever seen before. She did not see the second object. I describe the second object as a rounded disk with a dull, white glow. It did look different than the other object, although the intensity of the light emitted from both objects was similar. The big difference is that I could see a clear disk-shaped outline to the second object. After a brief and partially witnessed vertical climb (partially obstructed by a tree), it went in to a downward dive at a tremendous speed. I'm not qualified by any means to estimate the size or distance of the object, but if I was forced to render an opinion, I'd say that this would be an object 100 feet in diameter at a distance of 10 miles from our viewpoint. That would certainly mean a low-flying object. I'm a skeptic, I always love a good debunk. I was thinking about meteors and bird flocks, reflections on the birds and such. The kicker: At 9:00PM, we heard the rumble of jet engines and witnessed two aircraft fly over the area where the objects were witnessed. They were cruising from west to east. This is an uncommon flight path. With the exception of distant commercial flights, we do not ever see military aircraft in that direction. These were jet fighters, I am confident that these were jet fighters, as I have lived near a military airbase for my entire life. I was very surprised to see this. We do have MCAS Miramar about ten miles in the opposite direction, they use a very specific flight path for training and have never to my knowledge done training that requires loud engine noise over civilian territory at night. They do have fighter jets ready to go at any moment, this is a well known fact, although I can't source it for you folks. Sorry!  The fighter jets were probably about 15-20 miles away from us and were flying at a low altitude, 8,000-10,000 feet. Please bear in mind that I am not an expert, this is just an estimate based upon my very limited base of knowledge. This was the first time that either of us had witnessed an event like this. We always hoped that it would happen some day, and this was quite unexpected. Possible debunks: The white bird/owl. We both agree that the first object was not possibly the aforementioned bird, as this was in a slightly different vicinity and looked nothing like a bird. Regarding the second object, I've never seen any flying creature move like that. We saw what we saw and did our best to transcribe it. We're hoping that somebody else witnessed this and can perhaps explain what we actually did see.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,32.97723982300885,-117.02342477876107

To whom this may concern. I am not sure what to say about my experience today.  I guess my first question is, has anyone reported something odd in the sky over the NW Indiana today (4/30/09).   I ask this because myself and another person witnessed a strange object moving very slowly beneath the heavy cloud cover.   The object was dark color and very large.  I first thought the object was a low flying jet.  Then I realized it was moving way to slow.    As we watched this thing we kept asking each other what we thought it was.  We vocally passed ideas to each other that it was a helicopter, Balloon, Blimp but the shape was all wrong for any of these aircraft. We couldn’t figure out what it was. The movement was SLOW, very slow.  Had it been a big jetliner it would have fallen out of the sky, it was moving that slow.   The shape was sort of round but more elongated or cigar shaped and the color was dark greyish black.  There was no sound and we saw no lights of any kind. It was well below the very heavy cloud cover and it was extremely easy to see as it passed behind the tall leafless trees in the distance.  As for the distance from it to where we were was about 400-800 yards.  I know this sounds like it was pretty far away but the size of this thing was quite large.  Someone else had to see it.    I kept comparing it to the Semi Trucks traveling below it and how much bigger it was and wonder what the hell it was. The object was moving in an easterly to south easterly direction.    After about 3 to 4 mins of watching it, it stopped and looked as if it was turning (North) and we thought is was going to come toward us.  But it immediately zipped way at a much faster speed due south and out of our sight. I have no idea of what this object was and it has left me wondering about we saw.      One thing we both kept saying to each other was that the outer shape was obscured or had a fuzzy appearance.   What I mean by this, is for some reason we couldn’t make out a clear outline of the object.    It was like when you look at the road on a hot day and you see the heat waves coming of the road creating a watery appearance.    You could see it but it was very hard to focus on.

I live in a condo on Butler Beach very near Saint Augustine Beach and the ancient city of Saint Augustine.  Very often I take a 4 mile walk on the beach in the evenings. Last night, Friday April 3, 2009, I left my house at approximately 9:00 PM (I did not wear a watch) and I walked south down the beach from Dondanville Road to Mary Street (2 miles) where I turned around and was approximately one half mile north of the Matanzas Street beach ramp (I estimate it was between 9:35 and 9:45 PM).  I was noticing the bright moon nearly directly overhead casting a short shadow as I walked and I turned around and looked up to admire it.  A bright banana yellow object caught my eye…it was far off in the distance (low on the horizon)but increased by double in size in just about 15 seconds…it still was very far off and at first looked like it might be an airplane (except for the unusual color).  After 15 seconds it looked more like a Coast Guard Helicopter with a search light on and it was much closer (I am estimating 3-4 miles away). I took my headphones off to listen but heard nothing.  The yellow light continued parallel to the beach and I looked very carefully to see the green and white flashing lights of an airplane to appear – which they did not.  When I first saw the light it was low on the horizon and seemed to have a contrail.  I thought maybe it was a space shuttle launch or a missile.  But then it kept getting closer and larger and was not climbing higher.  It did not seem to leave any further contrails after I saw it—it was like it might have been after a vertical climb. I am sorry but I am completely unable to surmise its size.  I had nothing to compare it to out over the water…but at its largest it would have been about 10% of a full moon (low on the horizon rising) at its closest to me -- I am estimating that to be a quarter mile to as far as a half a mile away.  I know that is no help.  I held my arm out and my thumb completely covered it and would have even if it had been four times larger.  The light continued towards me and parallel to the beach but and one point it turned directly to me and glowed very brightly, again in that banana yellow.  It grew larger and seemed to be moving very fast – about the size of a softball, held at my arms length – now dwarfing my thumb.  The light became so bright that it illuminated the water like a ray of sunshine…but again in that bright yellow—very similar to a ray of sunshine – not diffused at all.  At that point I felt that it must be a helicopter but none the less I felt a little scared. The light shifted slowly away from heading towards the beach (and me) to directly out to the ocean.  As it turned it looked half yellow and half orange with a fire-like flickering.  Finally it turned all orange and sped off impossibly fast due east and then grew very orange and doubled in size and then completely disappeared after a thunder-like orange flash…and the atmosphere looking all wavy like a heat distortion around where the light was.  I continued to watch for five minutes.  I looked all around the beach and saw no one else nearby.  I have no idea what it was I saw but I am very interested in knowing if anyone else saw it.",2009-04-14T00:00:00,,

I could judge the speed of the light to be going at or faster than 50000 miles an hour because when you see a satellite in the sky it is usually a small light traveling at a nice steady speed and it will travel around the earth’s atmosphere.    The reason this light was so different was, it was about 10 times the size of a satellite light, and this light was a steady light it did not blink, it did not change color, it was just a big white light. Now the other reason it was so different that any light  I have seen in my life was it was very far away and it was traveling away from or solar system.  I saw the light for about 2 minutes the light did not get any smaller or bigger as I was looking at it, which was weird to cause after 2 minutes the light just vanished.   Like it was traveling though a port hole or something, and when I saw the light it was just ripping through space at very high speeds it came in one side of the port hole then when it vanished it disappeared though the other side of the port hole.  And when I say port hole you could refer it to ripping a hole in space time continuum, or it could be a worm hole, in one side out the other.

In the middle of the object was a smaller dark circle, almost like a small hole. I watched the object move from the northeast towards the north very slowly, in a slight up and down pattern. The object slowly rotated as it was traveling across the sky, changing from a perfect circle to a thin line, as if I were looking at the object from it's side. The object also slowly changed color from bright yellow to orange, to a darker shade of orange, and then back to bright yellow. It continued to rotate from a full circular shape to a line then back again. The object completely disappeared and reappared twice as I watched it travel slowly across the horizon line above the water. I paddled up to two other surfers in the water, pointed out the object to them and asked if they had been watching it. One said he had been watching it and didn't know ""what the hell that thing is"". The other surfer said it could possibly be a kiteboarder, but there is no way a kite could make a perfectly circular shape like what we were seeing, or be that far out to sea. All three of us ruled out certain slow moving objects like a blimp, or even the moon. The moon could not have traveled that far along the coast in 15 minutes, nor change color, nor disappear as it did. I called the St. Augustine Beach Police Department when I got home.

I was looking southeast when i observed two orange lights streak across the sky directly over my position,from the southeast heading northwest starting at about ten o'clock high to about 3 o'clock where buildings blocked further veiw of it's path. The object appeared to have a orange light at it's front that shone out a short distance as it progressed and another orange light at it's back or tail.The object appeared to be long in shape and thin.The object seemed to be about a 1/4 mile in the air above me and seemed to be about 200-400 ft long.The objects body ,or area in between the leading and tail light was blacked out against the night sky,but i could percieve somthing solid connecting the two lights ,due to the way they moved togehter as one and stayed the same distance when shooting by above me. I was very startled and reported it to a supervisor who happend by minutes later.The supervisor had been indoors and had not seen anything although he related that a  sighting had been reported the week before in monterey bay area and was upportive ,if not a little suspicious of why i chose to get so excited/agitated. The supervisor left me at my assignment outdoors and i continued to watch the sky,except now i was very excited and afraid. At about 3:50 a.m ,or 20-25 minutes after seeing the first object,i observed a second object 2 miles away, due south and about a 1/2 mile high in the sky or 20-30 degrees above the horizon.The second object appeared as white very bright light that was not blinking or pulsing.The object appeared in a dark section of sky that i was already looking at and appeared to just turn on in place and right away moved morth west in the same same direction as the earlier sighting.The white steady bright light was a few miles away from me and moved much faster than an airplane or satalite but slower and more steady than a shooting star.The second object also moved out of my veiw as i watched it untill buildings blocked my veiw.I was very startled to see a second unbelievable object and neglected to check my cell phone this time to record the time mentaly. At 4:06 a.m in the same section of sky but a bit farther south and farther away from my vantage point than the second sighting,i obsrved a third object. The third object was a exact match to the second object,a bright steady white light that appeared in the middle of a dark section of the sky.The thirs sighting was the same as the second sighting in it's path and behavior. I am very good at seeing satalites and airplanes and shooting stars and have spnet years ppointing out these things to friends,as well as having spent the past four months on my present graveyard shift ,where i get to be outside and observe shooting stars,satalites,and airplanes all night long. I never expected really see somthing so unusual in real life.The first object reminded me of the ciger shaped objects from airline pilot sightings re-enactments on t.v. The above statement is true and not any type of conventional aircraft or missle test,as i have witnessed many military tests and most aircraft flying today. The objects made no noise,had no trails left bvehind ,and were below the level of all but cropdusting aircraft.

Then the craft merged into one and began making some very interesting shapes in the sky (as you will see on the photos).  I immediately informed her to pull over as soon as she could and begin snapping pictures. Unfortunately by the time I got that message across (our first 2 attempts at connecting via cell phone were no good as we would lose signal), but by the time I got the message across sunset had already set in however, my wife used a Palm Treo 650 cell phone with its camera settings on maximum resolution to take the pictures (in which I have about 25 total).  The Palm returned some very interesting photos to say the least.  Upon receiving the pics I immediately reported the sighting to MUFON and filed a report:  Case Number:  22723.  At the end of the event they all seemed to merge into 1 or 2, dipped down from their hover and shot skyward at a very high rate of speed (in which one of them pulsed red as he/she ascended)   Later that evening I noticed that 2 or 3 other people in Southern California reported UFO activity.   One report identically mirrored what my wife and son saw (which indicated 4 craft merging into 2).   We are DEFINITELY not alone in this universe. Thank you.

(resubmitted with clarification and corrections)  On Thursday evening in the sky over Dripping Springs, Texas my daughter and I, and three of my daughter’s friends witnessed a white, oval shaped, pulsating light fly over at 20:49 CST at a very high rate of speed. It was too slow to be a meteor and too fast to be a jet or satellite. It came from the southwestern horizon and less than a minute later disappeared into the eastern horizon. It was slowly pulsating bright and dim white light and there were no clouds in the sky. It appeared larger than a star, but smaller than Venus. At maximum elevation, about half way through the sighting, I would estimate that it was at about 50 degrees.  At the beginning and end of the sighting it may have been about 45 degrees in elevation. The sighting lasted about 45 seconds. It made no sound, and left no visible trail. The Hays County Sheriff, KVUE TV, and the Austin American Statesman said that they had no other reports of the incident.

While out on my deck I saw 2 lights directly on top of each other hovering in the western sky.  The two lights moved simultaneously so I'm assuming they were on 1 object.  The lights were white then subtly changed to a blue hue and back to white.  The lights hovered, then moved right very fast and stopped then moved left and up very fast and stopped.  Each time the object stopped it hovered for a few minutes before moving again. At that point, I saw a red light flying very fast toward the object.  I thought the red light was an airplane but it moved significantly faster than your average passenger jet in the sky.  The red light flew directly at the object until the red light was hidden behind the object and I never saw it again. The object kept moving fast and hovering and then in an instant it flew directly downward below the tree line and I couldn't see it.

Approximately 22:40 in the evening of 8 April 2010 I was driving west at about 65 miles per hour on highway 12  from Elma, Washington, to Aberdeen, Washington.   I was accompanied by two friends  (A women in the back seat and a man in the front seat. We were just beginning to emerge from a hail storm when a very bright, white light came into view in the upper right of my windshield moving westerly at a very high rate of speed.  I knew immediately that it wasn’t any kind of conventional aircraft.  As I looked at the light I asked my friend, ""What the hell is that?!""  Looking at it, my friend replied, ""I don’t know.""   I am a private pilot and have logged more than a thousand hours in small single engine aircraft. The first thing I noticed was the lack of navigation lights on it. The light was less than 1500 feet above ground because it was flying lower than the clouds that produced the hail storm.  I estimated these clouds to be around fifteen hundred feet and the light to be about a thousand feet above ground level.  It was also less than half a mile to our right.  So it was very close when I first saw it.  I figure it was moving at several hundred miles per hour.  Probably around mach 1. Yet there was no noise.  The ball of light seemed to be the same size as a small single engine aircraft.  But it was so bright it is really hard to say with accuracy. It made a slightly ascending  ten degree right turn then turned back to the left about fifteen degrees and leveled off at about fifteen hundred feet above ground level.  In less than a minute, it was already quite a distance away, perhaps as much as ten or fifteen miles.  It seemed to slow down as it approached Aberdeen.  Since we were traveling in the same direction, it remained in sight for maybe as long as ten minutes as we moved toward Aberdeen.  It in fact seemed to be hovering over Aberdeen at one point.  But it is hard to tell from that distance whether it was over Aberdeen and whether it was still moving slowly or hovering. As we emerged from the hail storm the sky became partly cloudy and the stars came out.  Even being several miles away it was much brighter than the stars.  As we approached about five miles out of Aberdeen the light finally disappeared from view.

I was looking at the stars facing southwest, when something caught my eye. I quickly looked over and in 1-2 seconds I saw 4 lights moving at an incredible speed past the roof of my house. I quickly ran around to the side of the house to see what it was. For the next 2-4 seconds I clearly saw 3 lights forming a triangle speeding across the sky directly south. There was also a light right in the middle of all 3. There was a large distance between the lights, because at the speed they were moving, they stayed in perfect unison probably 5-6 miles apart from each other. I'm not sure whether or not these were rim lights to some large craft, but it seems unlikely since the distance between them stayed in a perfect triangle. If this is the case, the craft must have been absolutely huge. The speed of this object was approximately (and I'm guessing here) 10-15x faster than the airplanes I observed in the sky over the SF Bay Area during the minutes after the sighting. I can't stress enough that this thing was moving INCREDIBLY FAST!  The night sky during the event was very hazy, with the lights from San Francisco making it hard to see the stars. I lost sight of the object in the haze traveling southward. The lights also appeared to be speeding up. For the past year, I lived outside the city, and saw many shooting stars during the night and early morning. I am absolutely certain that these lights were not shooting stars.

I was with a friend. The sky had bouts of moving clouds.  Sometimes the clouds were more dense, and sometimes the sky would be pretty opened up.  I soon noticed a very bright star, there weren't any others noticable in the sky.  It was abnormally bright, and it was moving north in the sky.  It felt much too distant to be a plane, and there was no sound.  I asked my friend what he thought of it. He said he wasn't sure, he thought it was probably a satellite and fell asleep.   I've never seen a satellite before, but this 'star' looking object then stopped and stayed in one place, making small seeming motions back and for or up and down.  This object would fade in and out sometimes, other times it would get covered by clouds and it made it difficult for me to understand what it really was. After observing this one object, and noticing others over a matter of a half hour to 45 minut! es, one single, low flying plane, flew through the sky right in the vicinity that I was watching the object. I felt as though someone else saw this and was investigating the situation.  This was the only airplane I saw in the sky from my location that night.  Not long after that, I saw the most facinating thing I have ever seen.   A reddish, hazy, round sphere, less than a quarter of the moon in size came from nowhere from the lower left side of the star moving to the right, and flew at a very fast speed in front of the clouds across below the star looking object, and immediately moved south, in front of the clouds, but still feeling pretty far away.  The experience lasted about ten seconds and then it disappeared.  My friend soon woke up, and we left. I can't really remember much after the red sphere, I know the sky cleared of clouds, and some stars were visible.

As I was driving, I noticed a strangely bright light over to my right. Because I was driving and could not stay focused on it I casually mentioned it to my husband (knowing if it was just a plane he would quickly settle the subject as he is very pragmatic) He continued to watch it quietly so I kept trying to grab glimpses to see it as well. We began a discussion of what it might be: a big star??? =No, too big and close, a satellite? =No it was not moving across the sky and again seemed too close and too big...a planet?= nodefinately too big ...a plane? =No it had no other colored lights and was not growing larger or smaller during the duration of the drive like a plane flying toward you might. We were very calm and curious but both fully attentive. I pulled into the drive way and went to look where we had seen it before and it was not there but as I turned back to lock the doors of the car I realized it was now front and center above the tree line before me.Now,I was fully awake. We stood watching it for a bit. There was absolutely no sound. It appeared to be a reflectively bright metal, very roundish with a slight bluish tint. We both remained calm but my husband suggested we go inside and get a camera and binoculars. We turned to do so and saw a bluish light coming from our computer room=which would not be strange except that my husband turns things off obsessively (he is forever accidently locking me in and out of places or turning things like the TV off when I am in the bathroom) So I assure you the computer was turned off when we left for work that morning and no one was in the house all day =to our knowledge. Now we were both unsettled. We went inside quietly and brought out the camera and the binoculars. The object had moved only slightly in what I would liken to the movement that one experiences in an ocean tide...as if it were treading water and had to actively move a bit to stay in place. The camera with a telephoto lens could not pick up any details more than the naked eye but the binoculars gave me enough to reiterate that it appeared to be a craft of metal in the shape of a cylinder on end or a roundish object. I could not see any ""spinning"" or movement of the craft itself. Given the camera lens was not strong enough and the binoculars were =the distance to teh object might be estimated I would think. My husband suggested that we go inside. Both of us were on edge and when we went into the computer room. The computer was on and my husband asked if I smelled something. He thought it smelled like body odor but I felt it was more an electrical smell with biological undertones to it. The room next over also had a slightly strange scent. We then took a heavy metal flash light and walked the entire house from attic to basement and found nothing else disturbed and Thank God found nothing “unusual” in the house. We did not check on the light again as we both thought it best just to lock all of the doors and quietly go to bed and leave well enough alone.  Although I am as curious as most about UFOs and have pondered things I have seen in the sky before this was the first encounter that I have had that warrants any comment. We are pretty average people. We are both employed in corporations and work hard. We have 4 children who were all out of town at the time.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,42.3888,-71.4225

She called my attention to it and several other people rushed to observe the estimated 30-40 foot in diameter object as it wobbled but deliberately moved to our left (NNE) between Concourse K and L toward the main body of Terminal 3.  It took about 60 seconds to enter and exit our field of view. Its destinctive peripherial protrusions, like notches on a gear, were its primary identifying feature to me.  It was dull gray (my wife noticed orange/rust) with an undulating movement.  It traveled low under the cloud ceiling. We laughed and moved closer to the windows and I told my wife to try for a phone camera shot but she couldn't manage it in time.  Another lady asked ""what in the world is such a big flying hubcap doing out there"".  Others looked and turned their heads in disbelief.

An aircraft appeared to be disabled during the 7:00-8:00 pm period.  Tornado warnings and high winds followed and passengers took shelter in the tunnels of O'hare.

By the way I do not believe in UFO's and I am an elementary school teacher who has never saw anything out of the ordinary in the night sky.  While we got jupiter in focus we noticed a couple of its moons and could faintly see a couple rings.  We sit in the lawn chairs and began to talk at how clear the sky was and all the stars we could see.  As we talked my step dad asked me to look at a group of stars and pointed for me to look at the bright one in the center.  It was not Jupiter.  As we looked at it it flashed like a camera had just took our picture.  It never moved and only took 3 seconds to dim again.  This happened 3 more times during the night to other faint stars we looked at.  I don't know what it was, if it was other objects crashing into eac! h other.  I just know it was wierd to see.

I looked up to see how heavy the clouds were and noticed the lights, which were each about the size of a moon but with fuzzy edges because they were above the clouds. My first thought was Northern Lights or some weird form of lightning. Then I looked for a beam of light which would indicate they were searchlights from the ground but saw nothing.

He lives in a mobile home in the middle of a pasture.  There is a logging road that leads down to a large pond.  There are trees on each side of the road.  My brother and his best friend went outside to smoke leaving me and my sister-in-law inside with the children.  They were outside for about five minutes when the called us out to come look at a bright star.   I went outside and down the logging road I saw what looked like a large star that was very low.  It sat just over the tree line in the horizon.  I remembered thinking that it was tear drop shaped.  Looked like a tear drop diamond.   We were talking about what it could possibly be.  We had never seen a star so large and one of us said that even the North Star wouldn't be so low.  Maybe it was a planet?   We are all strong christians and have never believed in any alien myths or stories so we were talking about any logical explanations.   After looking at it for a minute i began to notice red streaks coming out of the bottom.  I kept thinking that my eyes were playing tricks on me from focusing too much so I turned away and looked back only to see red and blue colors coming from this bright light.  My brother then asked if it was moving or if his eyes were playing tricks on him.   I looked back at it and the light was moving right to left very quickly.  It never moved far enough to disappear behind the trees.  At this point we were all a little scared.  This was obviously no star nor planet.  My brother got out his video camera and began filming.  The movements became more noticeable.  Diagnol, side to side and up and down.   My brother and his friend decided to try to get closer.  They began walking down the lane and were not ten feet closer when the light started to BACK AWAY.  The light was moving backwards.   Me and my sister-in-law were screaming that it was leaving and of course the guys froze in fear and we literally watched this ball of light back away until it was out of sight.   As a skeptic If we had watched that light for a while and it never left I would have been convinced it was just a planet or something and that our eyes were playing tricks on us with the lights and movements.  But when I saw that thing back away from us I knew that it was nothing of this earth.  I don't know what we saw last night but I do know it was either an angel of god or a being from somewhere else.   After it left of course we are all looking in the sky in terror and amazement at what we saw and I began to notice planes EVERYWHERE.  It was dark of course and it was a very clear night.  But I counted eight planes.   When I commented on this to everyone else they brushed it off as it being a clear night and there's always that many planes, I just never noticed it.  But I did count 9 planes and they were headed in the same direction as the light.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,32.5856,-88.87690000000002

In the early hours of January 8th, 2009, a sudden noise was witnessed by many residents of Conisholme, Lincolnshire. Later that morning, it became apparent that one of the twenty 200ft tall wind turbines located in fields bordering the village was heavily damaged.  An entire 66 ft long blade had been thrown off the turbine, while another blade was severely crippled. Later that day some residents of the small English village reported sightings of 'unusual lights in the sky' which were witnessed the previous day and in the early hours of the 8th. These are the following reports:  One gentleman reported 'It was a massive ball of light with tentacles going right down to the ground'  One lady reported that she had seen orange spheres skimming across the sky. A local council cheif reported that he had seen a round object with a slight red trim hovering near the turbines that night. Another witness claims to have seen a bright yellow light over the village which remained stationary for 5 minutes before quickly disappearing and was able to take a photo.

I watched and took pictures of it for 30 minutes as it passed over my head and out of view into the distance.   My Dad was with me this time and brought his binoculars.  Looking through the binoculars I could see some type of light around something moving.  It appeared to change colors from blue to white.   In the photos you can only see a small point of light.  I tried to zoom in on the photos to see if I could see more details, no luck.    One of the pictures surprised me, it shows at least 7 lights or orb’s.  This picture was taken when the light was above my head and I was under a tree.  I remembered that moment because when I looked at the light with my eyes it appeared to change color and shape or something.   It was so high up and you really couldn’t see a lot of details, but something was different.   Then to see the picture and see 7 lights or orb’s, that’s really scary.

At  6:09 P.M. CST I went out my kitchen door to take the trash out.  The door faces east. The moon is just about full this evening.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a strange ""cloud"" to my right. It was strange enough that I turned to look at it. It was moving from the south to the north very fast.  It was about 70 degrees off the horizon and dark grey.  The shape is what first caught my attention.  Imagine an iPhone lying flat but there was a large ""dome shape"" under it and in the middle of the rectangle.  The ""dome"" seemed to have several lobes on it so it was not perfectly smooth.   In fact the whole object was about the size of an iPhone held at arm’s length. There was only one object. It did not make any sound.  In fact I would say the silence was ""deafening"" in the same way it is quiet after a large snowfall. The moon is quite bright tonight and the edges of the object seemed to glow from the moonlight rather than an internal source.  The object obstructed the view of stars as it flew by. I walked down the side path to the front of my house to keep the object in view.  It continued straight north.  The speed and altitude did not alter. I continued to watch it until it disappeared from view. The sky is clear tonight except for a few wispy, white clouds that are shaped more like long pencils.  I watched the object fly under the clouds and noted that the object was not only moving in the opposite direction of the clouds, but it was going much faster than the clouds.  It moved fast enough that I knew I did not have time to get my camera.  Plus the object was dark enough the I was not sure it would photograph. My dog was outside with me and he started barking when the object was in front of me. I watched the object for approximately one minute before I could no longer see it.  There were no aircraft nearby at the time. I was home alone.  I am a mom and a business owner.  Unfortunately, I did not see any of my neighbors outside who I could ask to witness the object.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

To whom it may concern, Yes I am writing this in concern of the matter of a U.F.O. that was sighted by myself and my current girlfriend  on 1/8/09 (last night) at approxamately 6:30pm-6:45pm wile traveling north on hwy.  6 just a fourth of a mile before hwy. 302 in Lexington County, SC.  I was in the passanger seat when I noticed to my right above the treeline a good half mile off the road we were on a brightly luminated object that was the color red when I first noticed it and to me it looked like it had risin up out of the wooded area and came to a rest or hover just above treeline and that is when I told my girlfriend to ""pull over"" and ""look at that"" at that time the object had started to move vertical very slowly but when it started to move upward the object did something strange it changes size, and color. From a bright red to a green,orange,purple then blue. From where we were the object seemed to be a sphere and kept a spherical shape even as it changed size and color but when I first seen the object as I stated it was a bright red and  I guess then it was about the size of a dime on the horrizon but when changed to green it got smaller to about half the size of a dime then it went to a amber-orange color it expanded to about the size of a half dollar on the horrizon then it turned to a brilliant violet-purple and it went to the smallest size witch was about the size of a BB then the last color was again a very beautiful brilliant blue and then was just a little bigger than the BB sized purple and that was what it looked like as it went up through the clouds the color was so bright that as it went through the clouds it also lit up the surrounding clouds. But as it was moving upward and changing colors and size it made a few really fast zig-zag moves then went straight up through the clouds. All of this sighting happend in a matter of 45 seconds to a minuite after pulling the car of the road. But what I think is really strange and you will too is that in 1992-93 me my father and my sister whitnessed an object exactly like the one I saw last night. And it was very near the same place just back in 92-93 my family and I saw it from a different location witch was on Fish Hatchery Rd. in Gaston,SC  but a good mile from my then home the object hovered and changed size and color but what is interesting is that then it was over a area that is the Lexington County Lanfill and when we saw the object last night it was over the same landfill my girlfriend and I were just on the hwy 6 side of it but back in 92-93 my family and I were exact oppisite on Fish Hatchery Rd. side. Now there have been for years talk in the community that there may be Millitary Weapon Sylos on the Landfill complex witch I guess is about ten miles squared in a heavily wooded area. I really do not know if there may be missiles or nukes or any other thing there that anyone or anything may find interesting on this landfill property but I know what I saw and this is the second time I have saw it above this area and whatever it was it must have been interested in something there. Both times I got this feeling that whatever this thing was intelligance was there. I was 13 at the time of the first sighting with my father and sister and I am 29 now and I just hope I am  lucky enough to whitness something that intelligent and beautifull again before I die. Also I would like to add these two times I whitnessed a UFO were the only time in my life I had ever seen something unexplainable in the skies of SC or anywhere else in the USA.

See long description. My wife and I (son was sleeping in car seat) were driving on I-275 South(east) towards Milford, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. As I was driving south I looked up in the sky and a couple of miles ahead of me I saw a glowing orange sphere. I knew it was not a meteorite because I was driving for a good minute before I drove underneath it (and it was still hovering). I kept yelling to my wife in the back with the baby to look up and see it. She could not see it from her angle. I did not want to be the only person who saw this because the veracity of a sole witness is always a challenge. As we drove underneath the object I made the decision to turn on my hazards and hop on the shoulder. I have never pulled over for something like this before, as I have always been able to identify an object, until now. As I was slowing down I kept trying to look up and I almost hit the guardrail as I was pulling over. My wife yelled me to watch out. This did not make her happy since it was her car. As I stopped the car I opened the sunroof and said look! There it was just hovering above us. An orange glowing sphere. The time was 9:39pmEST. It was difficult to determine its altitude and relative size. She thinks it was “too high for a helicopter”, but I think it was only about 5000'-10,000’. It was the size of a (small) dime. Of course you need to know the altitude to determine its actual size. It did not have any other colored lights on it. Just an orange glowing ""sphere"". I should caution in calling it a sphere as we were unable to determine if it was disc/egg shaped due to the glowing light. Sphere matches the best visual description. The light did change in intensity but it was a very small fluctuation and could have been our eyes playing tricks on us. My wife and I were going through a detailed Q&A trying to discern what it was. It was not moving, on any plane (X,Y, or Z). There were no conventional Nav lights or beacons, there was no noise except for the highway, and my wife complaining to get us out of t! here bec ause I woke my son up and they did not share the same enthusiasm and excitement. I did not want to leave because I wanted to wait and see it move. I wanted to see its propulsion. Was it conventional or something unexplainable by our current understanding of technology? This would have filled in a great piece of the puzzle and possibly answered the question. Very frustrated, I decided to heed the wife’s advice and get off the shoulder because we were not in a safe place on the road with traffic whizzing by us.  After safely merging back on I-275, I immediately called my mother's house to tell them to run out front and look to the north a few miles and up (they are on the highest development around and would have a perfect view). My stepfather answered my call and ran to the front to take a look. He saw nothing. We reached exit 59 within a minute (Milford Parkway) and looked to our right (north). You could see a great amount of the horizon and we saw nothing. We arrived home about 5 minutes later, then I made calls to friends and family and now I’m typing this report.  The credibility of the witnesses (my wife and I) are impeccable, as well as the intelligence and scientific backgrounds to make an unbiased observation. We are also well known and respected in the community. In addition I am an amateur astronomer and private pilot (not current) with exceptional knowledge of ALL active military aircraft in service (except of course current black projects).

Strange unconventional movement  within the formation. Formation of 5 or 6  very dim lights (at first they tricked me into believing I was looking at the Pleiades),was first eye contacted about 45° elevation comming almost perfectly from the East; maybe 75 to 80°azimuth.  Passed directly over zenith (90°)overhead heading straigh West.  Total span about twice the diameter of a full moon; about 1-1.5°.  Triangular formation.  No Noise.  No visible bird wing flapping (usually synced from my experience).  Extremely linear movement without any signs of change of direction.  Very interesting and what to me gave this out as a UFO sighting is the fact that the most southern speck of luminosity in the triangular formation(almost seemed light emitted phosphorescently and not reflected from underplaced city lighting displaced itself from the pack in a most graceful, smooth and harmonic manner.  This displacement was maybe equal to the width of the pack.  Once the diplaced light assumed its origina position the contrary one (the northern speck of light)repeated the exact same movement.  It was lost in sight about 15 to 20° after passing the zenith due to physical wall and roof limits in my house.  No noise before or after its passing....no doppler effect, no low frequency noise. This sighting came to me at the moment I was talking through my mobile phone.  We were agreeing on the agenda of the astonomy observing night to take place next wednesday. I had my patio lights off to familiarize myself with the night sky and constellation so as to prepare the observation objects for the night. I am an amateur astronomer with public functions and responsibilities in the area of astronomy.  I know my celestial objects.  I am also a recording engineer...I Know about sounds.  These were definitely not birds to me.  I have a perfect 20:20 vision.  I saw no movement withing the pack. All ""stars"" were the same color though they seemed a bit greenish reminding me of phosphorescent specks in wristwatches.  I figured that if a bird leaves a ""V"" formation while traveling at the same speed it would have ended behind the pack when it regained its position.  Its was also very suspicious to see the same thing happen on the opposite 180° place of the ""V"" formation.  I can assure:  It was not a meteor breaking up.  It was not an airplane.

I became aware of a translucent object, a long, vertical rectangle with well-defined corners that floated north from the location of the flash. We are on Daylight Savings Time in Indiana and still have plenty of sunlight at that hour.

I slowed the car and got into the right turn lane and inched along.   The object, like a gigantic plastic film in the sky, kept moving north and was gradually assimilated or hidden by a darker cloud. I don't think this was a reflection of something on my windshield, because of the way the object moved, then remained stationary for a moment, even though my auto continued to move.  I had to turn into a parking lot at tha! t point and did not see the object after that.

I was just about to comment on how clear the night was when I noticed some lights to the north heading directly towards us.  Keeping my eyes on what I was witnessing I pointed to the lights and said to my wife, ""Look up, look up, look up.""   What I saw were two banks of four lights.  Each of the lights was parallel to one another and they appeared to have a similar formation to a flock of geese, or the delta formation flown by military aircraft.  The individual lights weren’t round, but linear in appearance.  They weren’t bright white, but rather dim and tanish color. Each bank of lights was swept back to the next, as if they were mounted to the underside of the wings of a fighter jet.  Four lights on the starboard wing, four on portside.  The lights didn’t blink.  They didn’t get brighter or dimmer, just a constant, steady light. As the lights got closer, the formation became more disheveled.  When they were almost directly overhead, they stopped moving in a southerly direction, hovered for a few seconds, then headed northward, where they just came from, reforming the original formation.  Only this time, four of the lights were gone and the remaining four continued north.  As they flew away it appeared that they were either turning off one by one, or they merged into one single light before vanishing.  It looked more like they merged into a single light which then disappeared. Whatever the lights were, they appeared to be low enough for the campfire light to illuminate them (or at least appear so).  While my mind was trying to rationalize what I was seeing, I thought they might be a flock of birds with their undersides getting lit up by the fire.  My wife quickly told me, “Those aren’t birds.  Birds don’t glow in the dark”.  And she was right, those were not birds.  The whole spectacle lasted for what seemed like fifteen to twenty seconds and we didn’t hear a thing.  The object(s) were completely silent. After witnessing this, I went into the house to describe what we had just seen to my kids.  My wife stayed outside watching the night sky for any more signs of anything unusual.  A couple minutes later my wife came inside and said that she had just seen a shooting star off to the east.  She said that she had never seen a tail on a shooting star as long as the one she just witnessed.  I don’t know if this has anything to do with the encounter that we had just seen, but I figured I’d throw it into this story anyhow.  We seen no more “meteorites” for the rest of the evening and hadn’t seen any prior to this one. My wife, son and myself went back outside to watch the sky some more.  We noticed an unusually high number of aircraft flying in the sky.  I knew that they were planes because they had flashing beacons and the usual look of planes flying at night.  We saw three or four aircraft to the north, a couple more to the west, a couple to the south and east.  They all appeared to be flying in their own directions, no formation of any sort and they didn’t go away.  You could look in any direction and see planes. About ten minutes after the sighting my neighbor got home from work.  I was describing to him what my wife and I had just seen when he looked off to the west and said, “What the hell?”  I looked over and I said, “That’s it! That’s what we just saw!”  A bank of four lights was flying low, heading in a southerly direction again, coming from the north.  This time the lights appeared to be much farther away from us.  They weren’t directly over us this time.  The lights were moving pretty fast and then they turned and traveled in a westerly direction before converging into one light and disappearing again. We all kept scanning the sky discussing what we had seen, trying to come up with some logical explanation.  My neighbor went inside to call some of his friends and he told his dad what we had seen.  His dad came outside and we talked about the lights.  While discussing the evening’s events I looked up and saw a single light flying extremely fast through the sky.  There were no flashing lights and the object (which I think was a military jet) was flying in a southeastern direction.  I’m assuming the light was the afterburner from the aircraft.  It disappeared behind my house and I lost site of it.  The same aircraft, or maybe another one, then appeared from the same general direction, moving slower and in a northerly direction as if the aircraft we just saw slowed down and turned left. What we had seen did not appear to be ""normal"" our geographical area.  We’ve spent many nights outside with and without campfires and never seen anything like this.  The sightings of the unidentifiable groups of lights and the large number of aircraft in the vicinity made this evening very unique to say the least. We didn't get any video or photographs of the object(s).  They never reappeared once we had the camera in-hand.

It just looked out of place and was different. I ran inside to get my zoom camera and decide to take a picture to see if I can identify it better. What came out made us all gasp in amazement. It was round and had a red aura surrounding it. It started to move and I quickly focused the camera for one last shot before it disappeared. I am still shaking. The image that came out was creepy.

It was more like two converging rows of lights in a V formation, moving swiftly over the entire sky in mere seconds.  A few second later, a subtle low hum, much like a jet at high altitude,  the way you would ear it on a quiet farm. After thoughts: I saw it right above me, between two low clouds.

The sound could not have been another high altitude jet, cause we can hear many every -quiet- day. I remember my surprise to ear such a low and distorted sound.

I am going north bound on the 55 just about getting to where the 91 splits to the 91 east and west.  As I am talking to my friend I could not keep my eyes off the ball of light that seemed to be hovering right smack in plain view. The first thing I said that must be a helicopter…  Then I started rethinking that idea because it just stood in one place for a period of time.  I told my friend I think I am looking at a U.F.O he said record it and I said that is what I was going to do..  I pulled over three lanes on the free way and hopped out of my car.  I looked at it for a min to make sure that it was not a plane or a helicopter. But then it could not explain why it just hovered over me and my car.  It seemed really close now and I took out my phone and was not sure that it would be able to see it but I pushed record.  As I was trying to capture it on my phone cam, I noticed that the color was like a baby blue and bright ball of light.  The way it traveled   I could only compare it to the patterns a lightning bug would use slow back and forth in a zig zag pattern.  As I kept looking at it not on my cam anymore  It almost seemed to get closer and get brighter as if it noticed I pulled over and was recording it.  It looked like it was coming down… I freaked out and jumped into my car still looking through a possible window that would let me see it.  At this point the panic set in because all I could think about was I was going to be taken…  I have seen many a movies to know how it works.  Then from one min to the next now it was not behind me anymore it was back in from slowly moving to the right where it disappeared over the free was sound barrier.  I then started to look for it some more and it was nowhere in sight in a matter of five seconds I could not find it.  Then I drove a little bit up the road still looking in every which way and nothing.  I was able to get to a perfect clear spot that would allow me to see and say ooo that was a helicopter. But no such luck.  That blue ball a light was gone.  I had plain view over everything but no light in the sky.  Here is where it gets better.  I have it on my cell phone.  I thought I did not record it I was wrong I see my little blue light..  I have proof I am not crazy.  I now wonder was there anyone else who saw the same thing???",2010-06-03T00:00:00,,

Knew it wasnt a star but had no blinking lights that i could see. Then It got a little lower but what i really noticed is it started to become more parallel to me at my 9 o'clock so I knew I was right beside it. Past the hills on Woodford I started to notice it become even lower and go even past my 9. So I pulled over on this dirt road (lee witt rd), and I couldn't see it all. I had lost it in the trees before i turned of 321, then through the trees I noticed a outside light prob from a house and another brighter light, possibly the light itself, much lower now. So I did a 3 point turn and turned back to 321. Then I drove about 30 feet, killed the lights and got out, looking directly NE behind the truck. I saw it again!! Much lower prob 100 feet above the tree line in the distance. So I got! the flashlight,  and went into the field about 6-7 feet and could see it perfectly. Due NE, have no idea if it was 1-2-4 miles away b/c all it was white light. I swear for a sec i thought it had a searchlight on but it was like 1/2 sec only.

June 2, 2010 at apx, 9:10pm. I live near Rural Road and University, in proximity to ASU’s Tempe campus.  As two friends of mine were leaving, one got in his car and drove off, the other called for me to quickly come over and look up.  As we can only see the ""aircraft"" from one angle, below us, the object was a circle shape, so likely some kind of saucer/disk.  It’s altitude was near what typical, large commercial passenger planes reach as they are approaching landing, near Mill Avenue bridge.  The aircraft proceeded to head mostly south, in a slightly west direction.  When I witnessed the aircraft, it appeared to be 1-2 miles from me, over head.  It silently floated in the sky, as it traveled down over the rest of Tempe (until it was out of my sight). As my friend and I were watching it slowly drift away, another neighbor came outside to go to their car as well.  We called to her immediately, notifying her if she wanted to see a UFO to come quick.  She came over and watched with us, as she called her roommate to come outside.  By the time the roommate (4th witness) came outside to meet us, all he could see was the red light in the far distance (unable to tell the difference between this and another local Sky-Harbor related aircraft). To describe the object:  It had no color, maybe black, and had a red light at the tail of it that occasionally turned quickly on and off (slight flash). The front lights were a series of lights, between 6-8 white, circular lights that were all on, but one. This is hard to describe, but one light would turn off, in the row of lights, and turn back on as the next one turned off.  It repeated this pattern, across the entire row, and back again.  Resembles the kind of lighting effects that are used on games we see at the fair, or Peter Piper Pizza, for example. As I have lived in direct sight of Sky Harbor’s flight path for landing/taking off over the last 4 years, I have watched aircraft during the day and at night time.  I know what helicopters look like, and how aircraft are supposed to have one red and one green light (to indicate which direction they are flying to other aircraft) and this did not have these lights.  Like I said, the only red light was at the tail. The object moved slowly, similar to that of a police helicopter, using their search light to find a criminal.  The bright white lights making a pattern, as the object flew, was very usual, let alone unsettling.  The object made little sound, very slight puttering sound, but almost nothing at all. I am a 21 year old female, just graduated from ASU.  The other observers are one male, 22 year old, current ASU student.  The other witness, another resident at this apartment complex off 8th street and Dorsey, is about 19-20 years old.  Her roommate is male, between 21-24 years old.",2010-06-03T00:00:00,33.414035671514114,-111.92091958939265

It was later determined to be moving, however, after a closer study. ~A few points to supplement this assertion are:  1) object was eclipsed momentarily by tree limbs at several points and but would always return to open sky, as perceived from our position in front of my house. 2) it flickered as it moved back and forth along the horizon and in circular or arc-shaped, sweeping motions to and fro. 3) the object's light would dim after it reached the peak of its arc-maneuver and hence begin to move in the opposite direction, and would brighten considerably when facing us. the path of the light's beam could be seen when facing from side to side. 4) once in awhile, the light would juke every which way and at odd combinations of sharp angles, in short bursts of incredible speed. ~It at first seemed to be hovering over one point but we found the object to be maneuvering away from our position, as it eventually disappeared over the horizon. We were both compelled by strange, anxious feelings for the duration of the sighting. ~ We repeatedly had to back up to keep the object in our view and actually had to move to my second-story balcony for the last ten minutes of the event, as if hypnotized to stare at this weird light until it could no longer be viewed. This was at approximately 21:19. ~ I attempted to signal the object with a MAG-light-- in numeric combinations of numbers counting down from three-- but to no avail.  At one point, I attempted to use the 75-watt bulbs in the balcony lights as well. But still, the object retreated. ~I judged the object to be three miles away at first and it was gone forty minutes later, still moving  in the direction of the Delaware Water Gap. This thing was very bright and very noticeable; I would find it hard to believe that nobody else saw it besides the two of us. ~ All distance estimates were provided by the author of this report, who has worked in fields of occupation involving great heights and distances.",2010-05-12T00:00:00,,

We suspect that he is a superlative witness, and reporter of fact.  PD)) The flight pattern of the five reddish orange lights were west or northwest at about a 20 to 30 degree angle. I would like to start this ""reported sighting"" letter with the statement, I, or we, my 12 year old son and I, aren't looking for any special status or ""pats-on-the-back"" for what we viewed.  Nor do we want to be thought of as, ""out of our minds"" for saying anything at all.  We simply saw what we saw, and just want to report it. To add a little validity to our report our backgrounds are:  My son - 12 going on 13 real soon, an ""A-"" student,  7th grade, athletic, only child at home. Myself - Retired Air Force, aviation was my career for 22+ years, aircraft mechanic 6 years, aircrew member, flight engineer, cargo and air refueling aircraft the last 16 years.  I worked in the airline/aviation industry for seven years after retirement from the Air Force.  I did finish college a few years after I retired.  Aviation Management with a minor in Aviation Safety; took a few courses in accident investigation which taught a person how to question and evaluate an ""eye witness"" to an event. The sighting took place on the night of May 10th, 2010 at approximately 21:40, (9:40 pm) PST.  We were outside enjoying a wood fire in a small mobile home park in Trinidad, CA.  A clear night, the rains had just gone through earlier in the day.  There is a small airport just south of our location about 11 miles away. My son and I were engaged in a conversation when I noticed a brighter than normal light coming up over the tree line just to the north of us.  I wouldn't have paid much attention to it had it not been so bright.  Initially, I thought it was a late night commuter flight arriving out of the north, but then I noticed it wasn't the normal color patterns of an aircraft, the green and red lights from the wing tips and the flashing anti-collision lights the FAA requires. The light pattern we saw was a reddish orange color, maybe a little yellow mixed in.  And they weren't flashing.  The colors were ""glowing"" or slowly pulsating.  I questioned then whether it was an aircraft or one that I knew of anyhow.  Granted, I've been out of the aviation field going on seven years now.  I then noticed its movement. It was moving a little quicker than the normal ""prop"" or small jet type aircraft that come into our local airport.  And, it didn't appear to be one of the Coast Guards' rescue helicopters out on a night flight.  All aircraft have a distinctive sound to them; there wasn't any sound at all coming from the sky.  Just the occasional car or truck going down Hwy 101 and the rustling of the redwood trees from a slight wind.  But then I figured it was too far away to hear.  However, that would mean it was a large craft with the size they were and not being able to hear them.  A couple of weeks ago, someone said that was Venus in the night sky that was so bright.  I just noticed it was a very bright star or planet on a clear night.  Compared to that, this light was at least twice the size. We watched it for about 30 seconds or so, maybe a minute.  It was traveling from our right to left which would be north to west or northwest direction.  It was then we both noticed two more similar lights appearing from the same location over the tree line.  Then a fourth one appeared following the two in front.  All seemed to be going in the same direction.  A tall redwood tree obstructed our view as we watched and I had my son move to his left to try and pick them up as they appeared from behind the tree.  They never reappeared.  He said,"" Papa, they disappeared!""  About that time and I would say again it was around 30 seconds or so, a fifth light appeared, trailing all the others and moving in the same direction.  We then moved our position to be able to watch the craft without obstructions from tall trees.  We kept an eye on it and to our amazement, it all of a sudden got smaller and disappeared.  Wow! is all we could say. The direction of the flight pattern for the five reddish orange lights were west or northwest at about a 20 to 30 degree angle in the sky as referenced from the top of the tree line to the point where the last one disappeared.  It all took place within a three to four minute time period I would guess, but I wasn't keeping track of the time while watching.  I did happen to remember to ask my son what time it was when the last ""light"" disappeared. I could only hope that others saw this and are reporting it.  As a military flight crew member I could only describe a few of the ""odd"" things I saw throughout my flying career as, well, ""odd.""  Now, at least in my mind, I have some creditable proof to maybe I wasn't seeing things.....",2010-05-12T00:00:00,41.1334,-124.0398

Me and most of my friends have had UFO experiences either on or near Sohn Road in Vassar.  In fact, I use to live on Sohn Road until March of 2000.  I have seen some crazy stuff while living on that road!!  Mostly circle shaped lights at night/early morning.  Some orange, some white, and some that even changed colors. I have had two experiences in the past month to month and a half while driving down Sohn Road in assar, Michigan. Both experiences were with an orange colored circle. The more recent experience happened on Friday, July 31 of 2009 at about 1:00 am in the morning as I was returning home from a friends house. I was heading down Sohn Road (from Vassar heading towards Frankenmuth) when I approached the ""S"" curve.  Anyone who has ever driven down Sohn Road knows what curve I am talking about. The road curves to the left, dips down and then back up, and then curves to the right.  As I came from the ""dip"" and started to turn to the right again, I noticed an orange ball just above the tree line beyond the farm field to the left of the road.  I stopped my car in the middle of the road so I could get a better look.  It was not moving, or blinking, nor was it making any noise. I thought that it might have been a satellite or something similar to a satellite, so I started to take off down the road again. That is when things got really strange for me. The orange ball started to move too. As I am driving down the road, I noticed that the orange ball is moving with my car. I stopped my car in the road again, and the orange ball stopped too. I said to myself that I needed to get the f**k out of there, so I started to drive down the road quite fast. As I am speeding (literally) down Sohn Road, I can see (through the trees) this orange ball staying right with my car. My heart was pounding!! As I came to the next curve (there was/is a chiropractor's office on the left side of the road) and to an open area, there was no sign of the orange ball at all. I even stopped my car and looked all around. The orange ball disappeared!!",2009-08-05T00:00:00,43.3655,-83.5658

It was a cloudless night and the stars were out. We had our lights all turned off to enjoy the night sky. We had come out around 11:35 pm and had been in the pool about five to ten minutes when I noticed lights in the sky coming over the house behind us.  At first I thought it was a plane, because our house is in a flight path. They were in a distinct triangular shape that in some ways mimicked that of a fighter jet's elongated triangle--  but the lights made a triangular shape that was bigger than a plane, you could see sky through and around them. They were small orange points of light, and looked extraordinarily similar to the smallest stars we could see in the sky except of course that they were moving, and fast, flying in what appeared almost like a perfect flock of geese formation, except with two rows instead of one. I instantly pointed them out to my husband and we watched them as they passed almost directly overhead and past our house from Northwest to Southeast. There was no sound whatsoever either before, during or after they passed, other than that of the usual street traffic nearby, etc. Once we realized they were separate lights and not a single plane, I was honestly afraid they might  be missiles of some kind, because they were so small and high and going so fast,  their color was so uniform, and there was no sound.  Honestly, I have no idea whether missiles make noise or not, but it's all my mind could come up with at the time.   Also as they passed one of the tiny dots of light moved out of the V formation and away and then back into it.   They continued on in their straight path until they disappeared over the roof of our house. The whole thing only lasted 20-25 seconds or so traveling from the horizon of one rooftop to the horizon of the opposite rooftop. There seems to me to be absolutely no question that what we saw was not a natural event, but a group of-- I have no idea what. I am completely at a loss. But those orange lights were most definitely in a formation, and wherever they were going, they were going fast. I have never reported anything like this before in my life until today.

At first I thought it was a flare or a very big shooting star.  However, during the time I watched, it moved across the lake at even speed, slower than what normal planes look like, which I have viewed many times. There was some clouds, light whispy, but the circlular red light could be viewed even when clouds were in the way.  About 20 seconds of watching brought the light about 70 degrees above me where it stopped.  Up to this point, I was expecting to hear a sound, plane or helicopter and to see running lights when it got closer, but neither happened. It stopped for about 10 seconds maybe more when I heard some people on the street and tried to alert them to what I was seeing.  However, and this sounds made up I know, the light then moved slowly to my left and got behind thicker clouds.  The reddish light could still be seen from time to time over the next 10 seconds or so as I tried to guide them in to what i saw but by then, even if they did see it, it would not have made much sense to them as you could not really define it or see the movement. Its hard to say if it was getting higher, but through the clouds when I did see it, the size appeared to have diminished. The only logical thing I can think of is that it was some sort of flare on a parachutte. However, if it was that then it was above clouds, so at least 1000 feet in the air, it moved in a straight line for 20 to 30 seconds I watched it, stopped dead in its tracks for 10 seconds at least and then moved to my left.

My husband and I were standing out on the carport watching the sky. I was facing him (facing North) and he was facing South. He called my attention to something that flashed in the sky. I turned around and didn't see anything at first but kept watching because my husband told me to just wait that it was flashing at intervals (roughly one minute). I kept watching where he told me to look (we used two stars in the sky to locate it) and I caught the flash. It wasn't something ""twinkling"", it wasn't going off quickly enough to be considered a blink, it was just like a pinpoint flash. It didn't illuminate the sky around it. I know it sounds idiotic (and I'm not saying this is what is was) but the best way I could describe it is if someone was setting off a flash bulb really, really high in the sky. I kept standing there and watching in the exact same location and in about a minute it flashed again in the exact same spot. Sure enough within another minute it flashed again, in the exact same spot. It didn't move a single inch because as I said, we were using two stars to guide off of with the location. The last and final flash was to the left of the stars and then we didn't see it again. It flashed very brilliantly each time we saw it, the last flash that was off to the east of the spot it was initially holding position in was just as intense as the others. It was just a very bright white flash. The light didn't reach the ground or anything it just looked like a star flashing really intensely at one minute intervals from really far up in the sky. The final flash we saw, as I stated before, was not in the position it initially was and after that we didn't see it anymore although we were both keeping our eyes on the area we saw the flashes in. The final flash was far enough from the first ones that it couldn't have been a ""star"" moving. If it would have stayed lit up, the distance it was with the last flash, you could have definitely detected noticeable movemenet. But since it didn't stay lit, an! d we did n't see it move, we just saw that it HAD moved pretty far from its first location. There were no clouds, it was clear and we had a half moon that wasn't visible because it was low on the horizon. We didn't see or hear any planes or helicopters and the flash seemed to be coming from so high up a plane or helicopter wouldn't be at that altitude anyway. It looked like a star (as bright as Venus) would light up for a split second then go back out only to light up again about a minute later. I know my report was redundant as far as the descriptions, but I want to make sure what we saw is understood as a single light and not an affective ""flash"" although that is what we would call it. I also want to make it clear that it moved far enough from its original location that there is no way it could have possibly been a planet or star. The location of both areas were in the same field of vision range.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,31.7515,-84.1355

I wonder whether or not other people saw it. At about 1 minute before midnight, I looked out the window of my bedroom in the 1st floor apartment I live in with my family, up at the sky in the direction of the apartment buildings about, I'd say, a few hundred meters away. I wasn't looking for anything in particular, just wanting to enjoy the night sky. I glimpsed what I first thought to be a half-moon. It was about a semi-circle in shape, though with further inspection it seemed like one of the corners of the semi-circle was elongated. The color was kind of a really light orange, and I remember thinking, ""Hm... The moon looks rather golden...""  The position of the object was just over the top of two of the buildings, positioned kind of in-between then but above. The apartment buildings were about 20 stories tall. Then, I thought I could see the object quivering, like when an image projected onto a wall by an over-head projector quivers when the projector is lightly touched; it was like it was hovering, or something. And the outlines of the object were also kind of blurry. Also, when I shifted perspective, the object also changed position in my sight like any object in normal distance, completely unlike a body at moon-distance. I was confused, but then it seemed like my subconscious had already come to the conclusion that it was not the moon, because then I realized that it was much too large to be the moon, and the color was off, anyway. At the time, I just tried to put it out of my mind, and returned to my own business. Then, at 0:14 of the 3rd of May, just 15 minutes after, I looked outside again, unable to resist my curiosity. To my absolute astonishment, the object had shifted, like the moon was setting, or something. Now, it was positioned at about the top floor of second-top floor of the apartment building; I don't remember clearly which. That was when I came to the conclusion that it was definitely not the moon or any ordinary celestial body. Furthermore, it the edges of the object looked very blurry or scattered, like I was looking at it through tears, but the buildings did NOT look like that; only the object. I had mixed feelings at that point, kind of scared, kind of curious, and kind of uncertain, as well as wondering if there was anyone else seeing the same thing. I was working on my computer, and it briefly occurred to me to use my web-cam to shoot some footage; I have no idea why I didn't. I looked away again, again trying to put it out of mind. Then, a while later, I looked out the window again, trying to catch a glimpse of it. It was gone. It couldn't have been more than a few minutes since I had last looked. Now that its blurry light was gone, I could see that in between those two apartment buildings, there wasn't much of a gap at all that I could see from my vantage point; definitely not wide enough for me to see the entire Object. (I think the reason I didn't notice that when the object was still there was simply because my attention was riveted on the object.) But then that begged the question, ""How could the Object have remained visible to me when  it appeared to have lowered to the level of the top two floors?"" Unless it was in fact in FRONT of the buildings. That could only mean it was an UFO, right?  Hopefully, someone else also saw it and have photo/video evidence.",2009-05-12T00:00:00,,

Around 7:30 PM last night (Friday, 12 February 2010), my father was walking down our driveway to get the paper. It was extremely dark out, and the sky was very clear. As he was partway down the driveway, he noticed a group of lights to the north at an elevation of perhaps 45 to 60 degrees (Vermont’s mountainous horizon makes this difficult to judge). They were blinking like the running lights on aircraft, but as if there were three or four aircraft passing right next to each other while heading in different directions. This apparent cluster was what caught his attention, but a moment later he observed the appearance of another light. This light, slightly to the south of the cluster, appeared much larger than the others did, my father estimating its apparent diameter to be at least four times that of the largest stars and planets from his perspective, with intensity to match. He described it as being a light orange-yellow color that made him think of a motorcycle headlamp. He wondered if it was from an aircraft’s landing lights, but after a few seconds, it went out in the way that an incandescent lightbulb does when switched off. At this point, he saw that the group of smaller lights was no longer present, but one remaining light had moved south and was heading away from the point where the large light had been. The light moved south, still blinking every second or so. After a few seconds of it moving on this path, another large light appeared at the position of the smaller one. The smaller light kept moving, but the larger light remained completely stationary, not drifting or arcing in the way a flare or even a helicopter with a spotlight might. This happened twice more over the next few seconds, so that there were three large lights marking the smaller one’s previous path. The small light made a “u-turn” back towards the north, blinking all the while. My father described as being as if a car going at a reasonable speed had made a 180-degree turn, but an aircraft going an equivalent speed for his viewpoint would have needed a much larger turning radius. After the smaller light had traveled some distance from the others, all three large lights went out simultaneously, in the same lightbulb-like way the first one had. Through all of this, my father had not heard the slightest sound, except for a large jet that approached from the south after the light finished its turn. The entire incident took less than a minute. At this point, he ran inside to get my mother and myself, but by the time we got outside the light had disappeared, and the jet passed over our house to the north. My father has excellent vision and hearing, a good knowledge of the conditions that can cause many aerial phenomena, and a great love of stargazing, but he has been at a loss to explain what he saw. If the bright lights had not appeared, he would have not given what he observed a second thought, but their intensity and utter lack of movement were like nothing he has ever seen. He has drawn a diagram of the lights’ path and thoroughly explained it to me, but I, too, cannot explain it. The only thought that occurred to me was that he might have seen some sort of ball lightning, but he witnessed an instance of ball lightning in his youth and said that it was not at all like what he saw. He also inquired at the nearest airport, but their only explanation was that Black Hawk helicopters have recently been in use nearby. We found this suggestion unlikely, as the helicopters that frequently pass near our house are particularly loud and my father heard no sounds save the engines of! the jet that appeared just before he ran to find us. In short, we are absolutely stumped as to what he might have observed.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,43.7803,-72.4092

As I looked up, basically straight up but facing west, I noticed a line of dim objects, about 30-40 (I will use rough numbers in my description because of how quick event happened) and my first thought was that it was birds reflecting the city lights, but then the objects split into 3 separate groups, one with about 10 objects, the middle one around 20 and the third (farthest group from me) was maybe about 15, again just rough numbers, I didn’t have time to count!   The group was traveling in a southern direction, from where I was in Sunnyvale, I’d say they were directly over Mountain View, about 2 miles west of me.  That path would take them over Cupertino, Saratoga, then the northern edge Santa Cruz Mountain range (around here we call them the Cupertino and Saratoga hills).  The group was moving at a good rate of speed, it was hard for me to focus on them because they were so spread out, and I was trying to see if I could discern any shape, which vaguely they were each a slight V-shape, but I’m not 100% on that.   The whole sighting lasted maybe 10-15 seconds, and at the end of it they all seemed to group together and fade out, which is why I think they were only reflecting city light and they dimmed out going over the mountains.

My husband came out of the bathroom asking what the weird noise was.  He thought that it was something on the computer or I had the tv on.  He looked towards the tv and the computer and seen there was no noise coming form either.  He looked at me standing by the large windows and said what was that noise?  The noise and the lights were gone, but he had heard the noise and it brought him out of the bathroom to question it.  He heard the noise over brushing his teeth and running water.   I told him about the lights and he believed me.   We have no noise out here.  We live on 25 acres with a few hundred acres of farmland, woods and crp land behind us.  Our house sits up on a hill with an unobstructed view of the sky.  Our sunroom has very large windows that go up to a peak.  I tell you this so that you can see that I had a very clear view of what I saw.   As far as the weather, it was snowing and the humidity was high.  Sound doesn’t travel well in that kind of weather.  On days when it’s calm and dry or cold, you can hear semis 4 miles south of hear humming down a highway.  This was not that.  The light beams had two separated strands on the left side going straight up and down from the ground to the sky.   The light beams on the right were also two separated light beams going straight up and down to the sky.  I looked up to see where they were coming from, but because of the snow, the beams went into what ever they call the low snow ceiling.   I then talked to my husband about what just happened.  We both went outside to listen for any more noise.  There was nothing.  Then he took his 10 million candlepower flashlight out and pointed it out in the backyard.  With a flashlight we did the same thing.  Both times, the light would spread out and you could see all the snow coming down.  With the double twin light beams that I witnessed, they were solid stands.  No breaking up of the beams, just straight lines down.    I then called my 19 year old daughter that was in the town 5 miles away and asked her if she heard/seen anything.  They were watching movies in her friends basement.  Nothing.    I decided that it did need to be reported, so after about 15 minutes, I decided to call the Rice County Mn non emergency sheriffs’ telephone number.  The dispatcher did take the call seriously.  She was nice about it and said that I did need to repeat the story to a deputy.   She transferred the phone to him.  I told him about what happed.  He was also great about what I told him.  I told him that I work as a librarian at a local high school, I don’t drink and I don’t smoke.  I am a middle age women that has 2 kids, a farm and would not make up what happened last night.   He had me describe in detail for their report, about what happened .  He said that there are too many reports world wide of this stuff happening for some of it not to be real, and the universe is too large for us to believe we are the only one here.      I felt the need to report this to them, and I also feel the need to report this on your sight also.   I did go outside this morning to see if there was any visible sign on the ground to where the beams were touching, but I could not see any.  It did snow about 2 to 3 inches overnight.   I hope this info helps. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness, who submitted this report, appeared on the Jeff Rense Radio Program at 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 14, 2009.

As we drove closer and came into a darker area we noticed five and six bright lights formed into a triangle shape in the sky (we were surrounded by trees and, therefore, the visibility was slightly impaired; nevertheless, we could clearly see the triangle formation) . They were slightly swerving into each other but essentially maintained the triangle shape. I asked my girlfriend to stop the car and I got out to get a clearer look at this unusual phenomenon. As I stood there, all of the bright points of light disappeared, except one. They zoomed out at an unimaginable speed leaving no trace whatsoever. The bright point of light which remained did so for another 20-30 seconds, and then slightly dimmed and suddenly it was gone. The color of these lights was a blend of red and orange and they were very bright relative to the surrounding stars. These bright lights might have been hovering at 500 feet or more; it was hard to tell the exact altitude and distance, but they were near enough for us to see what was taking place.

The cloud travel at about forty five degrees from the west horizon, from south to north.

I also have to confessed that this sight gave me chills and made me a little nervous since I have seen other “strange” objects before but nothing like this big or weird.

This evening while in our spa we again heard the sound of the F16s. This time when we looked up we saw something very strange. At approximately 9:10 PM on Monday the 16th of March 2009 we heard an approaching aircraft. We looked up and to the east since this is the normal direction these jets take. As soon as we looked up we saw a white light moving extremely fast from the east to the west. This light was about as bright as a semi-bright star moving nearly as fast as a meteorite. There was no tail or sound coming from it at all and the light stayed constant. We could hear the jet coming w/afterburners on but by the time he was overhead the ""light"" was nearly out of sight to the west. These jets normally head north towards the guard base after reaching the valley but this one headed straight across the valley as fast as he could (without breaking the sound barrier) As fast as the F16 was moving, it was nothing compared to the ""light"" he was apparently attempting to follow. Over the next several minutes 5 more jets (jet 2 also had afterburners on) headed in the exact same direction as the object and first jet. I believe if this was a meteorite or space debris the object would have been burning leaving a trail behind and would not have been traveling in perfectly straight line from east to west with no noticeable elevation change.

I passed the spot from where we observed the flare, stopped, and looked up. I saw a straight line of about 5-7 dimly lit objects moving through the sky, first appearing at about altitude 30 degrees and azimuth 6 degrees. It appeared to me that the objects did not emit light on their own but were reflecting light from the sun below the horizon. They moved about twice the speed of the satellite we had seen earlier. There seemed to be a bit of haze surrounding the group. They were almost pinpoint sized objects, dim yellow color (which makes me think it was reflected sunlight) and as they approached about azimuth 0 degrees, they changed formation from a straight line to a cluster. The rearmost objects caught up with the foremost objects to make this cluster. As the group continued across the sky, they disappeared at about azimuth 310, which appeared to me that the objects moved into the shadow of the Earth and could no longer be seen.

I went outside just before midnight, to smoke a cigarette and looked up at the stars and saw a formation of 5 golden lights speeding across the sky West/northwest.  I stared in disbelief, then I saw two more reddish golden disks flying (one slightly behind the other) much lower and extremely fast.  I started backpedaling and tapped on the window to the room where my fiance was and before she came out I saw five more heading northwest.  By the time she came outside they were gone, but I just said, look at the stars...then bam, 3 more just flew West right then.  We witnessed a few more flying west and then I called my parents (looking at my phone I believe it was 12:07 when I called my mom and I talked to her for 11 minutes about what I was seeing)  My phone wasn't working first, but just as it finally started ringing and she answers, (she lives in Kalamazoo Michigan) two more flew over heading due west completely silent and extremely fast.  I witnessed 3 more formations as I talked to her, but I started seeing so many, I lost count of how many were in which formation.  Every formation was heading west or northwest, except one lone formation of 3 that traveled southeast.  The whole time I was seeing them, I only saw one airplane with blinking lights and one helicopter which was extremely huge and loud (it was flying very low, so I could see it was like a Huey and had only red lights)...my fiance had went into the house to file a report and I stayed outside and kept seeing these things.  At about 12:30am she came out and we called a number to report what we had seen, and two flew over very low and fast heading northwest.  I talked to someone on the phone for 4 minutes, and the helicopter flew over during the call. then we tried to call the airport, but only got automated answers.  I also was shocked when I witnessed a small flash and shower of sparks in the sky to the north.  It looked as though something may have exploded.  These things were a goldish somewhat red color and traveled in formations of 2, 3, or 5.  I lost count, but I saw at least 2 dozen.  They were silent, extremely swift, and mostly stayed in very tight rigid formations, that were shaped like triangles, or an upside down check mark.  Two or 3 of the formations were loose on one side, with the things weaving back and forth, while the other side of the formation stayed in a tight line.  The lights DID NOT blink ever.  The ones that were flying lower looked as though they had a ring of light golden light around them.  They moved easily 10X faster than the airplane I saw to the north (which had blinking lights that were greenish)  There wasn't a cloud in the sky, and I saw no moon.  If I had to guess, I'd saw they were heading towards Muskegeon and Lake Michigan.  I have NEVER seen anything like what I saw tonight.  I have seen meteor showers, shooting stars, satellites, airplanes, helicopters, planets, and the MOON of course.  I can't say what to use for a background, but the formations with 5 all had objects the size of stars and were flying much higher I believe.  The lower flying formations which only had 2 or 3 objects were much larger than stars.  Probably 4x the size of a star.  These larger objects were moving incredibly fast.  Even the smaller objects moved easily 10 times faster than the airplane to the north. We do not have any camera to take pictures.  And these things were so fast and some of them were so high, I highly doubt anyone could capture them on film.  It would just be a blurry mess I think.  I hope someone has at least tried to capture them though.  It was unlike anything I've ever witnessed in my life.  When I witnessed the shower of sparks, I did not see any objects around it and it was to the north.  It was around 12:30 when I saw it and my fiance just missed seeing it too as she was dialing a number for me and our house blocked her view.  This is all I have to say.  I would suggest following up in Muskegeon and around Lake Michigan and the Gerald Ford airport here in Grand Rapids....  I hope someone else saw this besides us.

Tilted looking Object moving from west to east.  I was on my way to an appointment, and had just turned onto northbound Wadsworth Blvd from Center Ave, in the Belmar area of Lakewood. A second or two after making the turn, I noticed this white ""line"" (could have been cylinder, cigar, disc or almost any shape) moving fairly quickly from left to right (west to east) well ahead of me - I estimate at least a few miles, maybe several miles (could have been over Wheat Ridge or Arvada...). As it got further east, the white color dimmed to a gray color, probably from going underneath the shade of a cloud (just a good guess). It was difficult to keep a really good eye on it as I was in rather heavy traffic, which was slowing down as I approached Alameda Ave., so I had to also keep a good eye on the traffic. I lost sight of it as it went out of view (an office building on the NE corner of Wadsworth & Alameda blocked my view). Once the traffic had moved forward enough, past Alameda Ave, I looked for it again, but could not see it, and had to continue to be careful driving. It might have still been there, but harder to see perhaps because it closely matched the color of background clouds? It also would have been getting farther away (farther to the east). I did not have a camera with me, and even if I had had one, I wouldn't have had time to turn it on, aim it and snap pictures while driving in heavy traffic - would have been very unsafe, also. However, I went back to that stretch of Wadsworth Blvd and took 4 pictures, approximating what my views were as I was driving this morning. I then used software to draw in what it looked like to me. I will upload the pictures in the sequence of the viewing; you will be able to see it as a white, angled line, west of Wadsworth and roughly above a bank building on the left side of the street, past Alameda Ave. The 3rd and 4th pictures show how it dimmed to gray as it moved farther east. I was on the phone with a friend this afternoon and told him about it. He a! sked me if it could have been an airplane banking in a turn. No, it could not have been that; if it had been that, it would have not appeared to move relative to my position, as it would more or less be flying away or toward me, not moving to my right (east), and it maintained this ""tilt"" throughout is movement eastward. If it was an airplane, then this would mean that the nose of the plane was inclined about 45 degrees, the nose pointing up and the tail pointing down. When a plane is landing at an airport, the nose is slightly raised so that the rear landing gear touch down, then the nose lowers and the forward gear touch down. This was a much greater angle. If it was a plane, then something must have been very wrong and the passengers would have been very uncomfortable, to say the least. So, no, I don't believe it was an airplane.
