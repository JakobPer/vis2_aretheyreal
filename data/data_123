Upon arriving at the scene I began talking to the witnesses and they pointed out the object to me.  I began taking photos of the object with my camera equipped with a 300mm lens (the object was so high up it looks like a white semi-translucent dot) when we noticed another similar object appear.  The two objects appeared to merge before moving apart from each other and eventually the second object either disappeared, or we lost track of it.   A few minutes later we saw another, lower object. I began taking photos of that object as well.  I quickly looked at the images I had taken and my first thought was it was a plastic bag flying through the air.  The object was again a white, semi-translucent object that seemed to be changing its shape.  But as myself and multiple other witnesses watched, we saw this object traverse a distance of around 10 miles in the span of a minute’s time.  While watching I had called another friend of mine who happened to be working in the area that the object took off in.  He was literally right under the object when we were talking.  He found it with binoculars and watch as the object climbed up to about 10,000 feet in the air before vanished before our eyes.  Around this time, the original object vanished, too.

Saw something kinda weird last night.  I really enjoy sitting on my back porch on warm clear nights and just watch the sky.  To me it's much better than TV.  I watch for satellites (21 last night, a record) and meteors (only two but...) I see lots of airplanes as well.  Of course you can tell them by their flashing beacons, sometimes you can make out the green/red lights as well.  Normally, and I mean almost always, you see one and you can watch it cross the sky until it either goes behind a tree or a house or just slowly gets dimmer and dimmer until it totally fades from view on the horizon. It was getting late, near midnight and my eyes were getting tired but I believe that I saw what I saw.  Looking to the southeast, probably forty to fifty degrees off the horizon, near the star, Altair, I noticed a sort of oddly lit plane with at least four white-ish lights flickering on and off what I would call randomly, about once per second.  It was odd looking but nothing that I thought was totally out of the ordinary.  The lights were not real bright but this meant to me that the object was at a very high altitude.  It was moving very slightly south of due west at a speed consistent with a high altitude aircraft.  Again, not real note-worthy. But then I noticed a second identical object following the first.  (If you held a ruler out at arms length then the second was about two or three inches behind the first.)  Even this was not that surprising to me as I've logged a lot of hours out there skywatching and seen lots of aircraft.  I assumed that if I watched long enough that I would realize that they only seemed to be in a straight line and that in time one would be headed in a slightly different direction. What I didn't expect was for the first object to disappear.  It just kind of faded away in a second or two.  I kept waiting for it to reappear after I refocused (again, my eyes were tired) but no.  It was gone.  This got my attention.  I could still see the second object for a few seconds...and then IT disappeared as well. The entire event, from the time I noticed the first then the second object, to the time they were both gone lasted maybe 20 seconds.

I work at a major airport in the state of Florida as an airfield electrician.  I am used to, at this point, the general visual characteristics of aircraft lighting as it approaches and departs the airfield, especially since my job depends on being able to get out of the way for landing and taxiing aircraft. 	On 6/8/2018 at approximately 22:20 local, I stopped in one of our lighting vaults to use the facilities and wished to have a cigarette before going onto the field for the night's work.  This lighting vault is located on a less populated side of the field in a section of airport property that has not yet been developed.  As I stood there and observed various aircraft flying many miles from the field, my eyes were drawn to one light that was behaving EXTREMELY out of character for the lights of an aircraft.  It was rapidly changing colour between red, green, white, yellow and blue.  My first thought was that it looked similar to police lights at night with its rapidly changing colours.  Its approximate position was perhaps 3-5nm to my Northeast and it appeared to be slowly moving in my general direction, displaying inappropriate characteristics of motion for an aircraft.  I do not believe the changes in colour to be due to atmospheric effects because other aircraft were appearing normally as just a white point of light with the occasional strobe, even in the same general region of the sky.  After appearing to slowly move towards me, the object appeared to remain stationary in the air for some seconds before retreating in the distance and then appearing to dim and fade out rather than disappear below the horizon.  I made an attempt to photograph the object, however I only had a cell phone camera and was unable to see the point of light in any photographs taken. 	I work the night shift and have for the past year become well used to the appearance of large and small aircraft navigational lighting in positions from 20nm to 20 feet, furthermore I have become well used to the normal movement of aircraft on approach and departure and am well aware of the visual effects produced by their movement in relation to stars and other aircraft.  At the time of my encounter, I did not have an airband capable radio on my person, but as I returned to my truck about the time the object began to ""fade away"", for lack of a better term, I did not hear any chatter in relation to it on the local control frequency; though I admit I did not check with the various approach/departure frequencies. 	I am not sure what I saw, but I am sure that it displayed characteristics extremely dissimilar to aircraft lighting. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) I'll look for it...though I own an LG 450 flip phone, by design. I am resisting the smartphone push until I cannot avoid it anymore. This was seen visually and I am usually aware about these things. The only mental explanation I can come up with is a rotocraft with amber and blue stroboscopic lights. I could be very wrong, but this is my explanation. ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) I checked out the same place at the same time and saw no object.

I was looking generally to the north, with large trees to the extreme left and right of my field of view, and a two-story neighbor's house in the center.  I had observed several high flying passenger aircraft (typical light/strobe pattern), satellites and a meteor or two. Suddenly, from behind the left hand bunch of trees, travelling from left to right, at a viewed angle to just clear the top edge of the neighbor's roof, appeared a VERY bright white (PULSING, not flashing) light.  The pulse pattern was: (gradual increase, hold a second or so, gradual decrease)(3 second pause)(repeat)  The time from minimum to maximum brightness was about 2-3 seconds.  Pulsing was not quite regular, but not random either.  The color of the light was absolutely one the purist whites I have experienced. I would estimate the distance to be middle distance, as it wasn't at airliner flight level, appearing much lower in altitude and close. I thought maybe it MIGHT be a helicopter, but there was ZERO noise. We have an Army National Guard base nearby, and UH60s overfly regularly, as well as the local Lifeflight.  They make a racket all the time, and I am quite familiar with helicopter noise.  During this event, however, there was NO SOUND/DEAD QUIET.  In addition, there were ZERO other strobes, anti-collision or flashing lights observable.  The light was about the size of a nickel held at arm's length, gliding along at a slightly sedate pace.  The path was a straight line path from left to right, until is disappeared behind the right hand set of trees.  It FAILED to appear where I estimated it should based on course and speed.  I quickly moved in my yard to see if I could re-locate it, but no luck. Now, during the last few seconds before it disappeared behind the trees, I was able to observe the object with my binoculars.  What appeared in my view was a neon blue...Aura? Haze?, and within this haze was a tumbling, jet-black multi-faceted rectangular-ish shape.   Confused by the blue light, I pulled my binocs away, and that is when the object disappeared behind the trees. I can honestly say this is one of the most unusual & unnerving things I have ever seen.",2018-06-15T00:00:00,42.7355,-73.7204

"Five  colored orbs seen over Newbury Park, CA.",Newbury Park,CA,2018-06-30T22:05:00,light,45 minutes,"Occurred : 6/30/2018 22:05  (Entered as : 06/30/18 22:05) Reported: 7/4/2018 11:26:21 PM 23:26 Posted: 7/5/2018 Location: Newbury Park, CA Shape: Light Duration:45 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/142/S142076.html,"Five  colored orbs seen over Newbury Park, CA. This incident occurred in Newbury Park, CA on Saturday June 30th 2018. I went outside to move my vehicle from the street to my driveway.  On my way back into the house, a blue light in the eastern skies caught my attention.  Initially, it looked like an electric blue disk heading west at roughly the same speed as a Cessna aircraft. Judging the object’s velocity, altitude, and size accurately is difficult as there is nothing to compare it to in the 10:05 pm skies.  Because this object reminded me of another sighting that I had 6 years earlier, I ran inside, grabbed the 12mm x 50mm binoculars to get a quick glimpse as I wanted to rule out airplanes, satellites, drones, etc. What I saw amazed me.  The object looked like a translucent electric blue orb, no defined outline. My GUESTIMATE is that the object was 30-50 feet in diameter and very roughly 1000-1500 feet above me. I then ran into the house, grabbed my night vision monocular and proceeded to track the object. I was tracking its trajectory in relation to the (stationery) stars.  To my surprise, the object turned to the south. I concluded that satellites don’t turn, at least not sharply.  Then, I remembered that I had a cell phone in my pocket, so I pulled it out a recorded a lousy/shaky video before losing sight of it as it went over the roof of my house. Shaken up and puzzled over what I had just witnessed, I sat in my backyard for a few minutes to gather my thoughts when I look up and I see a red orb in the east heading west, same size, shape, speed, and elevation as the first one.  Then, I sat in the backyard, where I have a much better view of the western skies and tracked the red orb with my night vision monocular for about 15 minutes.  It headed west.  It then turned north and back to the east. Having no clue what the objects are, I started to panic. So, I went inside for a drink of water and to calm my nerves. After a  few minutes, I went outside to check the skies to check for additional orbs.  Directly above me, I saw a red orb following a green orb.  The red orb was approximately 6-8 “orb lengths” in back of the green orb. I took my eyes off of them for about 5 seconds to grab the binoculars and when I looked up the red orb was in front of the green orb by quite a bit.  The red orb had stopped, while the green orb proceeded forward toward the red one.  When the green orb reached a position that is parallel to the red orb’s position, the green orb stopped and the red one proceeded to move forward.  Again, I followed the red orb, but this time with my binoculars, but for only about a minute.  I then abandoned the red orb to investigate the green orb, however, it was nowhere to be seen. After the orbs had disappeared, I scanned the skies with my bare eyes for 10-15 minutes when I witnessed something incredible.  To the north-north east (NNE) of my location, approximately 1 to 1.5 miles from my location, a blue orb (30-50 feet estimated diameter) ascended from the ground (exact location is unknown as it was dark), in plain view.  I immediately called my wife. She came out running and witnessed the orb ascending.  We both looked at the orb thru the binoculars as it ascended to the same location where the other orbs had previously been.  It seemed to undulate as it rose.  It ascended faster than a helicopter, about 2 times faster. This entire incident lasted approximately 40-50 minutes.  After this incident, I conducted extensive investigation looking for answers.  I searched the internet for local events that involved the release of balloons, local newspapers, local news organizations, looked at the local high school website for weather experiments or other events (high school is closed for the summer), sales events, searched the MUFON and National UFO Reporting Center for new, but similar reports, NOAA website, visited Youtube to see if anybody has posted anything about this specific incident, but no luck.  As of yet, I have no answers as to the identity of these objects. Being a scientist, I explored many possible explanations for what my wife and I witnesses. Two possibilities: (1) colored weather balloons with a source of light inside and (2) drones.  After careful consideration, I dismissed these explanations as weather balloons don’t stop on a dime, especially when a nearby balloon is in motion.  Weather balloons don’t maneuver intelligently.  Secondly, drones return to their launch locations.  These objects never returned back to where they came from.  Large drones tend to be loud.  No sound was heard while the orbs maneuvered above us and no sound was heard when the last orb ascended not far from our location. My search for answers did reveal a Youtube video that shows similar orbs that appeared above Newbury Park, CA, some 5 years ago.

I am a 68 year-old, male.  I have a professional degree and have owned a small business for more than 20 years.  I have never seen anything like this before. I stepped outside on the front step/porch to grab a smoke before heading to bed.  It was approximately 11:20 PM (23:20).  The date was July 1, 2018. A reddish-orange, round object caught my eye in the southwestern sky.  It appeared to be hovering over the State of Minnesota Fair Grounds, about two miles away from my house.  With the Fourth of July just days away, I assumed someone was shooting fireworks at the Fair Ground, and the object I saw was the first shot of a fireworks display.  It appeared to be at an elevation I’ve observed before where a ball of fire is shot into the sky and after reaching a certain height, it explodes into a floral arrangement or a starburst. I waited for it to explode and burst into stars and other bright objects.  To my surprise, however, it did not explode.  Instead, moved higher in elevation and took a path to the northeast. At this point I’m asking myself one question, “What is this?”  Its elevation continued to rise as it moved across the sky in a northeasterly direction.  I assumed it must be a distressed jetliner, helicopter, or airplane, and that it was going to crash somewhere off to the northeast. All I could make out was a large round ball of fire….large enough to be a jet, a helicopter, or a plane, but I could not discern any shape; no wings, no tail wing, no helicopter rotor.  So I had to change my assumption and could no longer say that it looked like an object that was ablaze. I live in an area that is beneath a moderately used flight path for jetliners departing the Twin Cities Metropolitan Airport, which is several miles south and west from my house.  The departing flights are gaining elevation as they pass over my neighborhood but are close enough that they can clearly be identified by their fusiform shape and wings.  They are close enough that on occasion cabin lights can be made out. Occasionally a helicopter will fly overhead.  I’ve always suspected that these are medical-related helicopters travelling between two hospitals; one south and east from my house, and the other to the northwest. I mention this about jetliners and helicopters to let you know I am familiar with aircraft that have flown over my house and are within view from my yard.  I know what they look like, how fast they travel when they are within view, and how they sound. The object I saw was travelling about at the speed of a helicopter, but there was no sound….no engine roar, no propeller sound, and no rotor sound.  I followed it as it deliberately moved across the sky to the northeast, never altering direction.  I followed it until it disappeared beyond the horizon.

As it got closer, I noticed it was pink in color and looked just like what you would see in a plasma globe, just without the glass exterior.  It was sparkly and sometimes would disappear out of view for a millisecond or two.

It didn’t make a sound at all as it passed right over my head. At that point, I looked over the bay and another object, exactly the same as the first, following in its path but about a mile or two behind.  It was at the exact same height and moved at the same speed and trajectory as the first.  I felt like it was close enough that I could have hit it with a rock as it flew right over my head.

I was laying down when I noticed a light in the sky from my bedroom's window.  I got up and looked more closely to see it, initially assuming this was  an airplane with lights on the wings flying at night.  This also made sense to me because it was cloudy tonight.  The weird thing about it was that the light coming from whatever was flying was what seemed like bouncing around in the cloudy skies, but  all the whilst staying in one spot.  The light was bright white.  I then called a friend over to check it out without saying what I was looking at, and then it started to  become very erratic.  The light would bounce and also change direction.  My friend also noticed the flashes had a pattern, it was one flash a slight pause and then 3 quick flashes.  The direction change wasn't extraordinary, just bizarre in the sense that it was not a normal flying pattern for a plane.  My window was also open and there was no sound emitting.  A couple times, in the six minutes of its ! duration,we looked away, once to turn the lights off inside my apartment to get a better look, then again to look for my binoculars, and then again to find a place to report this.  As we were looking for my binoculars, within the span of around less than 20 seconds, we looked at the previous spots it was no longer there or had vanished.   What this flying thing was I have no idea.  To me and my other witness the only thing that was evident, and very clear was this bright bouncing and changing light flashing in a pattern.  We are both young adults.  I am from the Midwest, and he is from the PNW.  I have never seen anything like it.  We considered the possibility of drones and while I don't know what that would look like at night with a flashing light it did hover mainly as it changed directions, however it looked really high and to me in relativity with that height the light must have been massive, or extremely bright.",2018-06-28T00:00:00,47.03031595092024,-122.89693098159509

It too disappears into the clouds, but get this: what I thought was the original light, appeared right where the plane vanished, and it started moving the direct opposite direction the plane was moving.  It kept moving at a decent speed.  Not fast, but not super slow either. After that disappears behind the side of the building, we see the original light again.

I kept going back in time (about 4 hours) to 12:47 AM to see if I could find where the lights entered the frame. The lights appeared above the treeline and rapidly moved up and over to assume a position where it remained for over 4 hours hovering slightly. It looks to me as a pair of 2 lights connected by something, probably the aircraft, and moved in unison. Feel free to access the Google drive folder below for most of the videos recorded and a “line of sight” map of the camera:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Xh_F7DNv-a8kILooFX_BsEIe2fE6akU ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, I see the lights in the sky again and it seems like it is some sort of infrared guidance system for the planes to land. Obviously, it can only be seen with a IR security camera and the video from 12:47 looks like they were doing some sort of calibration and then bringing it in line for the planes to land.

While we were in darkness I went outside to check out the extent of the black out when I noticed up in the sky is this bright red light heading towards Forest Beach... It was way too low to be any sort of plane and it definitely was not a helicopter it did not have flashing lights it did not have any of the attributes visually or auditory (I mention auditory because it was a very clear, still night, no breeze, no traffic, the restaurants were closed (Monday nights) so no people talking outside it was a very quiet evening) It was not a helicopter or blimp or anything else like that.... (that I am aware of)  So I went back inside and I woke my wife, much to her dismay by the way, and I told her about the power outage and the thing I saw in the sky and I suggested  let’s go back down to the beach. So we gathered up ourselves and drove down to Forest beach and  literally as soon as we got there we look up in the sky and there’s at least 15 to 22 beautiful flashing lights, Darting around, zipping left to right, up and down flashing on and off, putting on the most amazing show, right before our eyes, there, in the sky!!!!!!!!!!!!! It looked like a Christmas tree made out of low hanging stars, it was a beautiful clear night,  there literally was not a cloud or marine layer insight and the show went on for at least 7 to 10 minutes, we were hypnotized by it....it was  amazing!  (I apologize for keep repeating myself but it was, F****** AMAZING.. )Then as all this was going on the red saucer, The one that I saw before during the black out, reappeared, only now it was much clearer, it was fairly large, red, definitely had structure/girth.  It hovered from right to left, literally right in front of us, occasionally it would blink, and in doing so would double, even triple in size!!! When it came in contact with one of the other flashing lights it melded with it, getting even bigger!!!  Eventually it slowly moved away and disappeared out over the ocean.  The light show was over, a cool breeze started to blow and we went back to our car literally pausing every three or 4 feet reassuring ourselves what we just experienced and saw. It was mine blowing. We went home nothing else happened, ( cute twilight zone music, that I’m aware of......that was a joke…)  Anyway, that’s my story I’m sticking to it you could ask my wife, I asked her to write down or do a voice recording of what she saw, so she has it so she can refer back to...and feel free to ask her man, it’s the truth, I swear to God.  Anyway, I took up enough of your time, I apologize if this came off a little like I was rambling, it was just stream of consciousness of the event we witnessed.

In the Car were myself, wife and her 30 year old kid.  Weather was sunny quite hot!  Being that it was are first time going to Ridgreast.  Using other people's directions, we we became real lost!!  So we decided to stop at a small store, and ask for directions.  That would be when our troubles began!!! I left the girls in the car.  Went in to do just that.  There was a very strenge looking young lady, behind the counter.  She was about four foot nothing.  Black hr in a bund thick with a bit of wave.  A bit of a long gated face with bulging big brown eyes.  Green smock and blue jeans.  She spoke with a very thick accent.  That to this day, I can not place.  I told her where we were going, as if were on right track. She looked at me for a long second.  Before informing me she was not from around there. Because of that fact could not help me.  Even though we were the only two people.  She quickly turned walk away.  Leaving me feeling a bit put out. But I thought ok then to myself and walked out.  Of course as often happens, I sent back.  As the girls wanted chips and sodas.  Walking back into the store there was a man a very tall man.  Well over 6ft about 6-4 maybe five.  Black hr balding, gold rim glasses.  Slinky big ears dark green smock short sleeve plead shirt.  Asked him the  same thing.  He also spoke with an accent. He told me the fallowing ""go out of the parking lot.  Go right you well find the freeway about half mile in front of you.  It is important for you to know.  At that point, we are going north to south.Back my tale,there was not a cloud in the sky Until we pulled out onto the road.  No sooner that we did so.  The sky turned first gray with thick clouds.  One cloud on our left back was shaped like two tops put togther.  About a qurter mile back.  About 400 feet above us. It then begins rainning in such a manner that the wipper became useless.  I mean it was like driving under a water fall.  Nexst Thing that happend is as fallows.  I looked up after rolling a smoke. Just in time to see the rain stop!  As I screamed hold the Fck on! As we saw the road just flat out end.  The car took to the air, maybe 5 to 6 feet. We landed in desert,hard!!!  After making sure we were all ok. I got out of the car, so as to check for damege.  Thankfully there was none.  But what we did notice was we were going east to west.  The car wes soaked the ground was desert dry, and thirty min. had passed.",2018-06-21T00:00:00,,

The sky was clear.  We were sitting facing due south. As we were watching the skies we saw a single light to the south that was moving rapidly towards us, to the north. We see both military and civilian aircraft all the time.  We see them at great altitude (probably airlines coming from the east (maybe Chicago, New York, etc.) headed to the west (maybe Seattle).  We also see low craft such as airliners that are leaving Spokane airport headed west, or airliners coming from the west headed to Spokane airport.  Occasionally we see military aircraft coming and going from Fairchild AFB to the east of us. Except for exceptionally high altitude craft, we usually eventually hear some amount of engine noise. It is not unusual for us to occasionally see a satellite or the International Space Station cruise across the sky. I give all this background because I want to express that we know the usual aircraft that frequent our skies.  What we saw tonight was not anything like what we have seen in the past. This single light, no larger than a bright star, was traveling very fast.  My guess is that we watched it coming from the south to directly above us in maybe 10 seconds.  We were not able to watch it as it continued north.  Our assumption is that from the far south to the far north it would have traversed that distance in maybe 20 seconds.  The trajectory was straight with no hint of deviance from its path. This light was solid and did not have any light strobes associated with it.  There was no way to discern a shape or altitude, other than we could not hear even the faintest engine noise, giving us the impression that it was at a very high altitude.

It was falling as it began to illuminate, so my immediate thought was that it was just a shooting star.  However, before I could finish that thought the light came to a very abrupt stop and became a steady in its intensity.  This of course caught my attention. I was on a call at the time and began to tell the other person what I was seeing. As I crossed over the Harmony & I-25 overpass, heading into Fort Collins, I once again observed the light drop another 5-10 degrees closer to the horizon; going from what appeared to be a semi-fixed position, rapidly dropping, and then coming to another abrupt stop.  It was still fairly high on the horizon. Soon after stopping it  began to increase in intensity and then rapidly dim.  It went through 3 or 4 cycles of this behavior.  On the last cycle it went completely out and looked like it had disappeared.  After about 1 minute it came back in exactly the same spot but only at about half of its previous intensity. About 30 seconds after it had appeared again I observed it shoot out what looked like a missle towards the ground, at a 45 degree angle.  The “missle” came out of the north side of the object.  The light coming from the projectile disappeared when it got about halfway to the ground. 21:56 - At this point I was near the Harmony & Ziegler intersection still heading west on Harmony.  At this point I observed the light once again drop at a rapid raid and abruptly stop about 5 degrees above the mountains. It appeared to be just north of horsetooth rock. 22:00 - Earlier I had told the person that I was on the phone with that I would pick them up if the light was still visible by the time I got to their house.  I wanted someone else to see what I was seeing. I arrived at 22:00 and we drove to a nearby park on Boardwalk to observe the light. 22:03 - We arrived at the park and we could see the light low on the horizon.  It initially didn’t seem like it was moving but we noticed that if we used the tops of the trees as a point of reference then we could tell that it was in fact moving but very slowly.  We made it a point to observe the few faint stars we could see and compare their movement to the light.  It was clear that the light was moving much faster than any other stats we observed. 22:10 - Other than slowly move further north the light wasn’t doing much.  It had drifted far enough north that it was behind a tall tree and we could no longer see it.  At this point we left the park and I drove them back home.  They did agree with me that the light was behaving very oddly but obviously hadn’t exhibited any of the crazy behavior like I saw a few minutes prior. 22:13 - After I dropped them off I called my mother who lives out east of I-25 near Harmony rd. I asked her if she could see a bright amber light low on the horizon, about where horsetooth rock would be.  She said she did see a light and  that it appeared to be  flickering.  I told her about my experience and she sort of laughed it off.  I told her to keep watching because I wouldn’t be surprised if it did something else.  I said good and hung up the phone. 22:15 - My mother called me back very excited because she said she saw the light move from the stationary spot she had first observed it at.  She said it was getting very bright then then quickly dimming to the point where she couldn’t see it.  This went on for about 10 minutes until it dimmed completely out.  For about a minute she assumed it was gone but then gasped and said she saw it appear further to the north.  Not unlike my experience she said it started to illuminate while it was still moving and then abruptly stopped.  It then went back into its routine of getting very bright and then dimming almost out. It did this for about 5 more minutes until it dimmed out and never re-appeared. ~22:35 - End of event.",2018-07-19T00:00:00,40.55069822812846,-105.07729501661129

These lights have been appearing nightly for at least two years, beginning at about dark, in the sky either over western Auburn, or slightly farther west. They are not conventional aircraft.  They do not have any red/green running lights, they are much brighter usually, and often they flash brighter, systematically.  They are composed of what appears to be either one, or as many as 3-4, bright white lights.  They hang in the sky for several hours usually, sometimes moving short distances to the left and right (as viewed from east of them, on Lea Hill Road in Auburn), sometimes moving farther to the north. There are normally three or four of these objects which appear at once.  The normal air traffic in the area can be seen passing in front of them, and it seems to ignore their presence.  Sometimes the objects appear to flash red or blue.  They are almost always present for at least 2-3 hours, and sometimes have been present as late as 3 AM. I am a professional UFO author, a witness of at least a half-dozen sightings of alien spacecraft during my life, and an abductee as well.  I am not likely to misidentify conventional craft as a UFO.  I am familiar with most types of military craft, including stealth craft and exotic craft. I do not know what these craft are, but they cannot be conventional aircraft in my opinion due to their configuration of lights, motion in the sky, presence in the same location for so many nights, and the fact that they are clearly brighter than conventional aircraft’s white lights.  They should easily be spotted by radar from Auburn airport, Boeing Field and Seatac. As to the possibility that they could be drones, I tend to doubt that idea.  There is no reason that I can think of for drones to take up the same position in the sky, night after night, for literally years on end, when there is nothing of particular interest happening in or around Auburn that anyone would have reason to go to so much trouble and expense to observe.  They clearly are unconcerned about being seen, and usually just hang in the sky, moving short distances roughly north or south and then returning to where they were initially. Could they be some type of alien craft?  I cannot answer that question, I only know they appear to be distinctly different in appearance to conventional or military aircraft I am familiar with.  Someone surely will be able to identify them, from Seatac or Boeing ATC centers.  Whether they will do so honestly is another question.

I always look at the planets; I love them.  While admiring how bright Mars was, I noticed there were three bright lights in the sky moving.  They were pretty close together and the middle one was slightly higher than the other two.  The thing that weirded me out the mos! t was that it made no sound. It was flying away from us going towards south bound 77.  It made me feel very uneasy.  I stood there watching it for a few minutes and then went back inside.

June 22, 2018, my wife and I had an after-dinner stroll along the promenade in Long Island City, New York.  We took a seat somewhere between Long Island City and Hunter’s Point Ferry landings to rest and enjoy the view of Manhattan on the other side of the East River.  At 8:30, or so, we spotted an object with a pair of red lights hovering above the skyline.  The lights were a little too bright for me not to think it was odd.  I joked that it was a UFO, without really putting too much stock in it.  Still, there was something so strange about its brightness and its steadiness, like a snapshot in the sky, that I could not take my eyes off of it. The object made a vertical jump, held for a second, and then shot across the sky 3 to 5 miles toward the southern part of Manhattan in about 2 seconds, and that was when my jaw hit the ground.  From where we sat, neither of us could determine the exact height of the object but it appeared higher than the Chrysler Building - a lot higher.  My wife argues that it was probably a trick of the eye and that whatever we saw was in reality closer to us.  She believes it flew lower and above the river’s edge.  I disagree.  I trust my sense of perspective.  I can compare structural sizes and their spacial relationships as good as anyone.  I can tell the difference between far and near, high and low, and I am convinced that what I saw was way up in the sky and away from the river’s edge!  My wife said it was a helicopter. But after a real helicopter flew by, she clearly saw the difference.  The helicopter’s lights were not as bright as the UFO’s.  The helicopter was noisy.  The UFO was silent.  The helicopter wavered as it hovered.  The UFO was as still as a statue.  She said then it was probably a drone. I countered with the following: a drone has height restrictions. Again, the height and distance of what we saw could be argued, but you’ll never change my opinion. The UFO was at least a few thousand feet over the skyline and further west of the East River. After YouTubing videos of drone in flight at night, I can say that the behavior of a drone compared to that of the UFO is much different too. Like helicopters, drones are subject to air buffeting. They’re not perfectly steady. Their movements are not clean, sharp, symmetrically perfect like what I saw in the UFO. Describing the UFO’s movement was like someone using a right-angle straight edge on a laser pointer. It moved in two perfect straight lines, cutting over abruptly in a 90 degree angle. Also, like anything else in movement, drones display acceleration. The thing my wife and I saw did not show this. One moment it was there, the next it’s shooting across the sky. No acceleratio! n! It was amazing. One more thing: I don’t think the NYPD would allow anyone to fly a drone in an area crowded with helicopter traffic. Just saying.  I wish I had recorded it, but I didn't really expect anything odd to happen. When it did, it happened too fast.",2018-06-28T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

But I was also keeping an eye on the weather, as there were thunderstorms in the forecast and the clouds had begun to look threatening. At about 9:30 pm or so, I was watching one dark cloud rolling in, nearly overhead.  As I watched, for a brief moment I saw what appeared to be the leading edge of a disk-shaped object protrude at about a 45 degree angle from the base of the cloud.  I saw it for less than a second, but it appeared as though it were a solid object with rectangular or square raised areas or panels.  Then it was suddenly shrouded in the outline of a dark cloud. Imagine a disk parallel with the ground dipping forward to poke through the clouds, resembling a flattened smile. The dark cloud followed the general outline of the that I had just seen.  I though perhaps that I may have simply seen a cloud and my mind played tricks on me.  But I kept watching it.  Over the course of the next 45 minutes or so, the curved dark cloud remained stationary, even as the stormcloud and other clouds in the sky moved steadily westward.  It also stayed the same shape and size, even as the other clouds grew changed shape.  Still, I was more or less convinced I was watching some sort of weather phenomenon. Around 10:15 pm, I watched the thin dark cloud slowly wheel in a clockwise direction, taking about 30 seconds to turn about 90 degrees from its original orientation (imagine a disk now perpendicular to the ground, with the bottom edge protruding through the clouds).  Then, it slowly slid to the southeast and retreated into the lighter stormclouds, even as those other clouds were still drifting westward on the wind. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Possible disk, but wouldn't rule out meteorological phenomenom (addendum) Addendum to my report sent a short while ago:  I forgot to give a description of the apparent size of the object (or whatever it was).  The phenomenon occurred at about 40 - 50 degrees above the horizon.  Given the low cloud cover, it would have been relatively nearby.  The length of the visible portion of the dark object (or cloud) was about equal to the width of the palm of my hand held at arm's length.  Its width would have been about as wide as my index finger held at arm's length. As I first sighted it, my initial impression was that it somewhat resembled the leading edge of the saucer section of the USS Enterprise from the 1960s original Star Trek series - a disk with a blunt leading edge.  That is one reason that I thought I might have imagined it.  It was dark, metallic gray in color. Given the curvature of the object or cloud that I watched for about 45 minutes, if it was part of a disk, the visible portion would have been about 1/8 to 1/12 of the circumference.  The rest, if it really was disk shaped, would have been above the base of the clouds. ((END ADDENDUM))",2018-06-28T00:00:00,52.1078373650108,-106.66923239740821

At 5:05 a.m., I noticed a solid light heading from the north-northeast to the south-southwest (roughly a heading from 020 to 200 degrees, based on compass reading).  The light was about the intensity of a satellite, but not following the normal north-south path of previously observed satellites.  We heard jet engines at altitude (higher than airliners approaching Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.  Upon more careful observation, we saw several lights in formation, then determined four in the formation.  They were not in “fingertip” formation, rather in a triangle, with a trailing aircraft.  The lights were steady white (like formation lights), not blinking “position” lights.  We thought,” cool.”  Then another formation appeared, then another.  After more than four formations, we were even more interested.  Occasionally, there would be a brighter light, without other lights near.  Also, occasionally, there would be a different formation pattern, with three leading in a line-abreast pattern, with one trailer, centered.   We continued to watch, with formations of four passing continuously for a total of 25 to 30 minutes.  There had to be at least 50 aircraft, and perhaps 100 +, so we wondered where that many military planes could come from and be heading to.  Was it an exercise.  A source said that the NORTHCOM exercises were delayed this year. ???   We contacted the local FAA airport tower, then Austin TRACON, then Houston ARTCC.

Within roughly a minute, a chevron (or triangular/boomerang) shaped object appeared over the woods, partially obscured by the tree line.  I counted five green lights on the bottom of the object, which glided up slowly from the point of materialization at an angle that allowed me to view its full shape. Viewing this object, I felt a sense of joy and reunion.  However, when the question came into my head, not as words, but as a feeling, inviting me to meet the occupants of the object, it came with an intense energy that was familiar in a sense, but like nothing I've experienced on Earth in my conscious memory. I was reluctant to feel fear, but I almost immediately knew that I wasn't ready to have a physical encounter.  I declined, telling the occupants they could go if they wished and thanked them for trusting me.  Almost instantly, the object dematerialized.

((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Mr. Ron Wright, former MUFON Field Investigator for MUFON/Oregon, for submitting this nice report, with illustration.  He can be reached at <rw@lonewolfslodge.biz>  PD)) This investigator has over 30 years of looking into crop circles, cattle mutilations, ufo sightings and other cases including a search and rescue of a missing woman in Eastern Oregon.  But this is my first hand report of a 'Close Encounter of the Third Kind'. This incident comes by a phone call to my spouse on the late evening of 6 June 2018 at about 9:30pm, she received a call from her son.  He is a former US Army veteran, former police officer and currently a security guard at a local casino.  Watching my spouse's face as she was talking to her son, was a look of concern.  She handed me the phone and said, ""You need to hear this!""  As I listened to her son, he was sincere about what they saw and encountered.  The main witness was his girlfriend's daughter who is age 12.  Given permission, I spoke with the girl for over 30 minutes asking specific questions.  Here is a short summery of that chat;  ""What time and where did you have this sighting?  About 7:30ish today, 5 miles south east of Siletz off a gravel road near Ojalla Road in the woods. ""How far was this creature from you?  ""About 100 feet or so, standing 2 legs, pale grey height 4-5 feet quarter size eyes  (dark brown) ribs showing, super skinny, no clothes head round oval, looked like no ears or nose, roundish bump where nose should be!""  ""How long did you see it?""  ""10 seconds first time and about 12 seconds the second time...""  ""What else did you see or hear?""  ""Birds were real quiet, then when it took off, the birds got noisy again. Prior to the sighting you could hear a 'buzzing noise'.  Then sounds got echoing, that lasted about 20 seconds, then sounds in area got normal again.  It, the creature moved unnatural, fast and quiet, no sound at all!  ""Did you see the whole creature?  ""Yeah, real skinny, ribs showing, thin like almost transparent, no clothes, quick movements...""  She went on to tell me the family checked that area for evidence and found only tuffs of black and white fur on the stump.  Time I spoke with this yound girl was 9:30pm the evening of 6 June 2018. The following is a full written report from this 12 year girl of her entity encounter;   ""The night of June 6th, 2018 me and my family decided to go for a drive up in the hills 5 miles out of Siletz, Oregon.  We were out to find wood to make ourselves a bow.  My mom's boyfriend ""J"" saw some sticks that were perfect for the bows so we cut them off the tree that they were attached to. Then we went down the road and ""J"" saw some downed alder that could be used for firewood.  I started hearing a faint buzzing noise but put it off as a bug in the car.  Then out of the corner of my eye I saw the most bizzare thing ever. It was about 100 to 120 feet away from my moms car.  What I saw was a human looking creature that was about 4 to 5 feet tall with pale grey skin.  Its skin was so thin it was almost transparent and it was so skinny.  I saw it a total of three times and this was the first. I saw it for about 10 seconds. When I made eye contact with it everything went silent.  The birds stopped chirping, everything was silent.  Then it ran away. I told my mom and ""J"" and we thought ok we'll keep an eye out.  Then I saw it again I knew that something was up there.  And as I said previously it ran away, but it looked like it came from behind the stump it was standing by. Then I said, ""Hey, I saw it again I think we should go up there and look around.""  We went up there and looked around and then while I was standing were I saw it the first time and I saw it again! It moved so quick when it noticed that I saw it.  And for moving so quick it was incredibly quite.  I yelled for ""J"" ""I saw it again!""  So we went over to where I saw the 3rd time and when we were talking it got really quite and  voices echoed a lot more than the other places in the woods. Near the site of the first sighting we found fur that resembled rabbit fur.  It was black with brown tints to it and it stunk really bad!  After trying to search for tracks we figured that it was to dry for it to leave tracks so we decided to head home.""   Investigation summery... I spoke  with the primary witness, this 12 year old girl.  Very sharp, and sincere about what she saw that evening.  I do not think this was a fabricated fantasy, as I could sense the fright and excitement in this young girls voice, which lead me to beleive it did happen. Besides the young 12 year old girl, there were 3 others that experinced the echo and the buzzing sounds.  The boyfriend, her mother and her younger sister.  Other than the echo and buzzing sounds, to my knowledge none of these individuals suffered any other physical effects.  As for the two listed, I have heard about this in the similar case in Salida, Colorado, ufo encounter in which the family had the buzzing sound during their ufo encounter.  As for knowing the boyfriend for over 15 years, besides being a combat veteran in Iraq, he is a sound individual and is sincere in what he beleives happen and there is no question in his mind that this girl saw this entity in the woods.  All four truly beleive this incident occured and I am sure it will be a memorable moment for this 12 year old girl!",2018-06-21T00:00:00,44.7768,-123.9201

There were some large fireworks off to the NE that we could see, at which point we spotted a light flying in our general direction.  At first we thought it was an ember from the fireworks, as it was the same color as a flame, but embers usually burn out relatively quickly.  We concluded it must not be when it kept on going and didn't lose its luminosity. It didn't make a sound as it flew over our neighborhood in a straight line towards the SW at a speed of approximately 15-20 mph and an altitude of approximately 3/4-1 mile.  We watched it as it flew off into the distance until we could not see it anymore.   A few minutes passed, and another object, exactly the same as the first in every way (same altitude and speed) came from the same location and followed the same trajectory.  This time, my wife was able to find my spyglass and I got a closer look at it.

To see the full effect of the video, I accelerated the original video to 9 seconds. After repeatedly watching the video every day, I have accidentally noticed the three dots among the clouds.  The white dots appeared from nowhere and it can be noticed that the dots are standing at the same place from the beginning of the video recording, to be precise all 10 minutes long (at least).  The white dots were standing exactly at one fixed place, and also seemed to generate a trail/turbulence/disturbance when blowed/passed by the clouds.  They seem to be invisible when the clouds are not passing over them.  The clouds where a kind of very thin and quite transparent layers at the distance of at least 6 km from recording point. When magnified, the dots appear to have an oval shape, as can be clearly seen from the video I am sending (and also from the same video attached to youtube).  What kind of aircraft can be standing fixed at one point at least 10 mins long?  Balloon?  Not, probably it would be moving with the clouds. Satellite?  Not, why leaving turbulent trail in the passing clouds.  So many questions. I have  never seen something similar before. I DO NOT CLAIM THAT THE WHITE DOTS ARE THE FLYING SAUCERS WITH THE ALIENS INSIDE, BUT I'M OPEN FOR EVERYTHING.  THE WHITE DOTS CAN BE EVEN DUST ON CAMERA GLASS, DISPLAY OR CAMERA MALFUNCTION, BUT I'M NOT SURE.

Sometimes it would go much dimmer.i took many videos and zoomed way in with a camera app on my phone to took several photoa.  They are not the best quality but the object seems to have a circle in the middle of an x in the visible ones.  My phone kept shutting off as if I had no battery even though it was well charged.   Eventually I left and was wondering what it could have been.  My friend whos house it was didn't think it was a ufo of any kind and blew the idea off.   July 3rd late at night we saw the same light in the same exact spot and I felt embarrassed thinking I must have been wrong about the ufo idea.  It must be a satellite or something else.  I'm not sure but two times in the same spot made me doubt myself.  Then there was last ni! ght July the 4th. I saw the same light again.  It seemed brighter and this time there was also a 2nd one a ways across the sky.   I was no certain something is going on and when I went inside to get my phone to take a picture I came back out and it was completely gone.

The area I live in has always had some strange things going on there.  Lots of old pioneer days history made there etc.  Lots of very old 1700's cemetery's too.   Anyway, I first want to guarantee you that my story is as true and accurate as I can possibly make it.  These sightings are absolutely real, and just begun lately.  I have seen several UFO's during my long life, and I know beyond any doubt they are real.  Yes, I have seen the proof too.  I work for the U.S. Government.   Around April of this year, I began to hear a roaring-howling sound that seems to go over my home and then all of a sudden stop.  I thought it could be the city airport and such, so I let it slide.  I have never heard a sound like it either.   Then I woke up a night or so later around 2:00 AM, fully awake, and was just looking around inside the house.  Then I saw ""Them!""  Four Alien entities of some sort standing i! n my kitchen.  I could clearly see their reflections from the kitchen in my living room television window.   At first I saw a claw like hand, very long, and very black.  Two of the entities were very tall and skinny with very long hands, and solid black.  Their heads were round and very large with golden-colored slanted eyes.  They looked right at me and we had a stare-off.  I was too amazed to do very much.  Their arms were long and skinny.  I was absolutely amazed at what I was seeing.  I've seen UFO's before, and now possibly their occupants!  The other two entities were solid white, shorter, and they were walking down my hallway to the bedrooms so I could only see them from behind.  They seemed to be wearing uniforms of some sort.  Solid white and humanoid!   I continued to look at the tall black Aliens and it was clear they were trying to contact me-let me know they were there.  After about 10 minutes they walked away through the walls!  They have returned two more times, so far since that first night, and I don't fear them for some reason or another.  After 10-15 minutes they are gone.  They just stare at me with those big yellow eyes.  I could see no mouths or ears on these creatures because they were solid charcoal black.  Also, I keep the kitchen light on at night so I know they are coming there.  As a Christian man, this proves that there are things we just don't understand.  I was a probable ""Abductee"" during my early childhood years in 1968, but that's another true story.  Where these Alien creatures came from, and why to my house I cannot understand.  Maybe they know I am a believer!  I wish to remain totally anonymous for my own protection since I still work for the U.S. Government.

Visiting family member there!. Estimated location of UFO:  Mahattan beach and Redondo Beach in the state of California! Estimated altitude of ufo over hover location 500 or more feet AGL. My statement regarding the UFO:  I saw the silvery reflecting object hovering and motionless,  I looked at it and carefully did some motions  I moved left and right looking for any anomilies reflection off of other objects no result determined maybe UFO.  The view i had I can see LAX traffic departures and determined object was too far south of LAX traffic departures and to low as well.  I determined a UFO at this point, attempted to picture of UFO with cell phone object was unable to be seen in screen and no picture was attempted, at this point attempted a 2nd time object was losing brightness and moved away reflection brightness gone. My statement of my background: I have general aviation flying experience though no longer active, I have flown in high wing Cessna mostly 152 and 172 models and low wing Piper PA-25's mainly. I have worked at LAX as a ramp service agent and refueler.  I attend airshows and I am avid aviation afficienado.  I fly drones general hobby consumer products and R/C Model aircraft.  I'll state this “if it's got wings I am pretty much familiar with it.”   Final statement:  Airplanes require forward movement to maintain flight or go higher in height this did not happen and ruled out helicopter because of windy conditions, and reflections not consistent with rotor blades spinning i.e. rapidly continuing pulsating flashes of light and police helicopters would be only authorized to fly low over a city and still have a forward motion for hindering ground gun fire common practice!.",2018-06-07T00:00:00,33.83267537437604,-118.33263344425957

My roommate shouted for me to come out on the deck and take a look at several lights that were rising up into the sky. I live on a hilltop, and the alley slopes downward, toward a creek with woods, a park, an inn, and a campground. Venus was clearly visible low in the northwestern sky. These objects were brighter. When I first saw them from the deck, they were shining a deep gold, turning red or orange as they rose higher.  They were moving into a formation that appeared to match the constellation Orion. I ran back inside, grabbed my camera, ran back out, and started jogging down the alley to the north, taking pictures as I went.  I came to a vacant lot and saw that there were 10 in total.  They had broken formation.  One began to turn pale, then white, and shot off at high speed to the west. The nine remaining objects began to drift apart.  None of them moved very fast, but I did observe upward and downward hovering, lateral movements, pauses, and a few sharp turns.  As they were drifting apart, they too began fade, first turning pale yellow, then white, before completely disappearing.  Just before they disappeared, a residual haze or aura remained for a few seconds, before dissipating. I walked around town (very small, population 200) and saw plenty of people sitting outside around campfires or tinkering in their garages, but nobody had been looking up.  I walked through the campground, but from that vantage point, a heavy canopy of elms and cottonwoods would've obscured the view.  Nobody was launching Chinese lanterns. I took a few photos that may be useful. I was able to capture the color changing process, which reminded me of the following quote from John Keel's Operation Trojan Horse:  ""In a majority of all landing reports, the objects were said to have turned orange or red before descending.  When they settle to the ground, they 'solidify' and the light dims or goes out all together.  On takeoff, they begin to glow red again.  Sometimes they reportedly turn a brilliant red and vanish.  Other times, they shift through all the colors of the spectrum, turn white, and fly off into the night sky until they look like just another star.""  I've seen them in this area before.

The wisps could be described as similar to roots, branches, or veins surrounding the moving black holes.  A distinct eye looking feature.  Very prominent black pupil with a yellow iris.  This ""eye"" like feature moved around the sphere.  One was able to see it through the sphere and when it came around to the side that was better in view. The sphere was observed by two people for about an hour with binoculars.  Then the sphere shrunk in size and appeared no different than a star in the sky.  The sphere moved quickly in the sky.

As it blinked in this back,and forth pattern, it moved south (from right to left) across the horizon, dropping in elevation slightly. Once it reached the southern edge it got closer to the treeline and the object began to shimmer slightly.  It reminded me of the way that it looks when you look off into the distance on a really hot day and see the heat radiating from the ground distorting things and creating a ""mirage"". When this shimmering happened, you could see the outline of what appeared to be a disc like aircraft.  It makes me think that it was using a cloaking device that failed to work properly as it got too close to the trees. We are in a rural area that is dead quiet at night, and this object produced absolutely no sound.  In addition, the lights were not spaced close together like that of a plane, but were much farther apart.  If you were to hold your hand out at arm's length up to the sky, the distance between the two outer points of light was about the distance between your thumb and pointer finger (4-5""). My husband tried to take a picture of it, but his camera phone would not cooperate and only produced a washed out photo that appeared to be taken in bright sunlight when it was actually almost dark out.",2018-06-28T00:00:00,45.512,-122.2135

After making sure all was secure, I was standing at the rail marveling at the cool breeze that felt heavenly after days of sticky humidity.  It was then that I looked up and noticed there were still very large bright pat! ches of open dark sky with the imposing clouds all around those clear sections.  My deck faces straight out towards southwest with no trees, or structures anywhere  to block my view in all directions.  I was standing at my deck rail looking out sorta southeast towards the end of the deck - observing the clouds and large open areas and looking for any stars. I was also wondering if the lightening was getting bad enough that maybe I should go in.  That was when I saw way up where planes would normally be spotted, a narrow rectangle shape with 3 bright lights single file down the length though there might have been a 4th and the lights appeared to be circular but being so far away couldn’t be sure. I thought it looked a little strange; however, our area’s major airport is located over in the eastern part of Henrico county. At first glance, I figured it was a plane though it didn’t look like other planes or helicopters I had seen at night. They usually have a flashing light(s) ! and you can see the wing lights but nothing like this was seen! - just the single file lights. I did see in lightening flashes a faint maybe triangle outline but really not sure. One flash I would see it, the next not, and again nothing like a plane or helicopter.  The sky was pretty bright - maybe the moon had been out but was now under the clouds.  Honestly, I didn’t think about  looking for the moon and it’s location  until I was back inside and the shape was gone.  Anyway I kept looking and it didn’t seem to be moving at all but then a few sorta short slow jerky movements upwards/forward but nothing like a plane makes so I started thing of a helicopter again maybe in a holding observation pattern. And the movement was so quick without any discernible distance - not sure if it really moved or shook - there was just some sort of change.  I thought about a weather ballon but that didn’t seem to be the case either. I even thought of maybe a plane in a holding pattern but they circle in a wide pattern and you can tell they are moving. This lit s! hape wasn’t moving forwards, backwards or circling.  I was keeping watch on the cloud movement along with the object’s position relative to me and the garage next door.  I kept watching for a few minutes - it was in a very open part of the sky, and I took my eye off the sky for just a second to smack at a mosquito, when I looked back up it had disappeared - no lights or shape anywhere.  There hadn’t been any sounds other than the storm.  However,  earlier I had heard plane sounds as is normal here day and night. The airport is about 30-40 minutes up the highway.  And quite often I watch them at night (while sitting on the deck) flying to and from the airport or circling - I had never seen anything quite like this before in terms of being there and then just as quick gone.  It was like they flipped a switch and the lights were turned off.   The sky was too clear and open for it to pass behind a cloud.  If it had done that, it would have come back into view and it didn’t but ! there weren’t any clouds where it was located.  I have seen we! ird ligh ts in the sky before but have always been able to figure that they were probably a plane or helicopter.  But this was different and I have never made a report, and in fact,  I don’t follow UFO stuff at all. However,  like many folks, you wonder if we are here -what keeps other “beings” from being out and about.  There is probably a likely explanation, but found this site looking to see if anyone else saw it.  Don’t want to be contacted, or any personal information to be used nor to be added to any other mailing lists etc.  Just wanted to report it in case someone else saw something similar at the same time and area.",2018-06-07T00:00:00,,

At 12:25AM I was using my small spotting scope to look at objects such as Saturn and Jupiter in the night sky.  I first saw the object east of Saturn at the time.  Object could just be seen as three blinking/strobing lights that were red, green, and white.   At first glance I thought it was a airplane with strobing lights.  I soon became aware this was not the case. As an amateur astronomer I had clear reference points to track the object and knowledge of satellite activity and meteors.  The speed in which the object was traveling was comparable to the speed of the International Space Station.  Faster than any plane I have ever seen.  It also did not travel in a straight line as most aircraft would, instead it traveled closely to the ecliptic line in the sky that night first passing Saturn and then passing Jupiter at relatively proportional distance as it did Saturn.  Object was first spotted in the SE and “set” in the west.  Its lights were rapid blinking at ten times the rate as most aircraft strobe lights do.  One would think it would be a satellite however this was not the case.   When I first spotted the object and made the deduction that it was not an aircraft I trained my spotting scope (one powerful enough to see the lines of Jupiter) on the object.  At minimal magnification it was clear the object was triangular (sketch of object will be included in the report).  I followed the object for about thirty seconds zooming in magnification to get a clear representation of what the craft’s outline looked like.  As I stated it was clearly triangular with lights on the edges of the triangle.  If this were to be a satellite with my scopes magnification (one I have tested on the International Space Station before) if the object was at the altitude of the space station would be easily twenty times the size of it.  I lost the object from my scope around the time it was passing Jupiter and used the naked eye for the rest of the viewing.  I cannot explain what this object was, but am 90% sure it was not a satellite or aircraft.",2018-06-07T00:00:00,33.54170373692077,-101.90381898355756

As I went down the road to see where they were going they disappeared over the airport without landing at the airport.  The craft actually were flying directly over president Trumps Golf Course here in Palm Beach and I have seen these same types of crafts with different shapes flying over the same area before.  About 4 years ago I saw seven crafts flying ! in a circular pattern over the same golf course moving slower at about 70 or 80 mph.

This incident occurred the morning of November 29, 2018, at approximately 12:10 a.m. and its duration lasted until approximately 12:23 a.m.. I walked to the back door to lock up and noticed an extremely bright object low to the horizon in the Eastern sky.  I could determine this due to my position on my back deck which is 10 feet from the ground facing due East.  I’m 6 feet 3 inches in height so my view was approximately sixteen feet from the ground. I looked around the sky to compare stars and the Moon.  There was a cluster of stars to the upper right of the object but much dimmer and higher in altitude.  I looked to the left and saw another grouping of stars of the same dimness and approximate altitude as the others.  The Moon was to my immediate left.  Larger and brighter than the object I was viewing but it was much closer in appearance and lower to the horizon than the bright object.  To give a perspective as to the bright object I was viewing’s distance from the Moon, I can only estimate as follows:  The Moon (appearing 7 to 10 times larger than the object in question due to it’s perspective from where I was standing) would be (in distance) approximately 10 moons side by side.  The object I was viewing appeared larger than a star, was much sharper in appearance and displayed characteristics unlike a star. I went into the living room and retrieved my cell phone.  I returned to the deck and took several pictures.  I didn’t know whether I was operating the camera correctly and feared I wouldn’t get any images of worth.  Because of this fear I went into the living room to review the pictures to see if any of them came out.  While in the process of doing so my wife walked through the room towards the kitchen.  I said to her that I captured a photo of something odd in the sky and if she’d mind going to the deck to see if it was still there.  She did so, paused and said for me to come outside with her. She pointed out the object I’d seen and said, “Is that what you saw?”  I said yes but the object was now higher and to the upper right in the eastern sky.  She said, “ Do you see that smaller bright light moving around it?”  I looked where she pointed and I did see it.  The original object (in it’s new higher position) had a quick moving smaller light moving erratically to it’s right.  The smaller light wasn’t as bright as the larger object but I could see it moving in various quick directions around the object.  It would rapidly move toward the larger object then away from it.  After approximately 30 seconds or more the smaller light was no longer visible but the larger object was.   Note:  I’d left the phone in the living room where I was reviewing the photos when my wife called me to the door.  I failed  to take the phone with me when she called me outside.  As a result, I was unable to get pictures of what we were now both seeing. Once I zoomed in on the object, I captured in the pictures it no longer appeared to be a very bright light.  In the enlarged photo the object appears egg shaped then circular, slightly larger at the bottom than the top having a dark blue marking near the top and toward the bottom.  It then began moving rapidly in a westerly direction then back to an easterly direction.  The lighter blue body is surrounded in a almost closed circle that’s darker blue and to our eyes had a hue or haze surrounding the outer skin.

This was 2 am it was on a path towards Edwards air force base. my window faces west our house faces north. We have a hill about 4 hundred feet away, houses on a round about street, The craft was so big 90 feet or so wide 150 feet or so long, no sound, even the black hawk was silent sounding.

I loved exploring the mountains on weekends, and myself and a couple of AF buddies had rented a motel room somewhere above Boulder.  I remember lying in bed when the room began to go black, and then the stars suddenly appearing, followed by a bright flash of light.  At first I was panic stricken, and I don't remember if the others had seen the light, but I found out that my hair had suddenly grown over an inch in length. When I got back to the barracks the next day, my roommate totally freaked out at the length of my hair.  I was at a loss to explain other than tell him what had happened.  He wasn't sure what to think of my story, but did realize their was glaring physical evidence.   He soon moved into base housing with his wife, and only one of the buddies who were with me remained a friend.  I don't remember if he also went through the same rigorous interogation as I did.  I only remember that he went to Holloman AFB, while I went to McConnell AFB in Kansas.  Many very strange occurred after that which finally ended my military career. I still have trouble remembering many things, as it has always been very ""foggy"" since that time, but I still wonder how my hair could have grown from a half inch to nearly two inches overnight.",2019-01-04T00:00:00,40.024403601895735,-105.26873952606635

I was 12 years old.  We were hunting raccoons outside Reasnor, IA.  My best friend’s sister and brother in law had a farm and the brother in law did a lot of hunting and trapping.  The kids came along and carried stuff but did not actually do the hunting.  Early in the night (app. 10 pm) we saw a disc shaped light in the sky.  It was yellowish and was above the clouds most of the time.  It appeared to be huge!  We knew it wasn’t a spot or search light, as there was no beam going through the clouds.  The forest became very quiet and my friend and I noted the feeling of static electricity in the air.  The dogs ran back to the truck and jumped in the back.  They wouldn’t come back out.  They were whimpering and were clearly afraid.  Even Jack, the black and tan hound came back.  This really bothered everyone because Jack never quit.  We would always have to go get him long after the rest of the dogs were tired and done.  The hunting party disbanded quickly and we raced back to the farm.  It seemed as if it followed us but I can’t be certain of that.  Once we got to the farm we called for my friend’s sister to come out and see it.   We were all in disbelief, trying to find reasonable explanations for it.  We could see planes and helicopters approaching it, and then quickly turning away.  We tried calling the sheriff but the lines were busy.  We saw nothing in the paper but kids at school were talking about it.",2019-01-04T00:00:00,,

It happened in May, June, or July 1974.  I was driving through Montana on traveling from Seattle, WA, to Lead, SD.  I would have to guess I was east of Billings.  My wife and two (2) young sons were in the truck with me.  It was somewhere between midnight and 0200 hours.  I was the only individual awake.  I can remember I was not tired at all.  I was in the middle of no-where.  (I did most of my long distance traveling at night back then because I can see better.) All of a sudden almost the entire immediate landscape was lit up by an unusually bright artificial cone shaped white/yellow light.  I can remember being quite scared as I had never witnessed such an occasion.   I tried to accelerate my truck to get out of the area but it would not go anywhere.  The engine was not running, the key was still in the run position, and the headlight were still on.  I attempted to restart the vehicle to no avail.  By now I was almost in a panic mode because I was not in control of the situation.  I lost track of all time and the ability to do anything physical except to try to restart my truck. When the light disappeared my truck motor was running, it was in drive, and the vehicle started moving.  Now I was finally able to wake my wife.  She can remember the fear I had in my face.  A relative short distance down the road was a café, where I had to stopped for a cup of coffee to calm back down.  There were others in the café whom seemed unfazed by what I had witnessed. I told one of my doctors about this event several years later whom dismissed it as my imagination.  This is only the second time I have went public with this.  As I will be over 70 early next year I would like to see if it is possible to get some resolution to this incident before I pass on.  This is the first time I have attempted to research this.  I don't remember my beliefs prior to this incident, but it has made me a confirmed believer in UFOs and ETs.  I find within the last six (6) months or more I have a renewed interest in this subject as well as the real possibility we on earth have been influenced through our ancestry by extraterrestrial beings.

I don’t recall the exact day.  The location of the craft when sighted was just south west of the city of Sebastopol, California.     38° 22’ 54” N.  122° 49’ 05”W. It began as I awoke about 1:50 AM to what I thought was a audible hum.  I searched the small house I was living in for the source of the sound.  After exhausting all possibilities I realized that the hum I was hearing was actually a vibration or hum I was perceiving in my body.   About 1:55, I went outside to see if I might find  something that might explain the “body hum” I was experiencing.  As I looked up toward the northwest, I was stunned at what I first thought was a huge dirigible or blimp but the size was immense. My next thought was, a blimp, if navigating would be running engines producing prop sounds, but I heard nothing, and it is far to large to be a blimp.  The night was crystal clear, cool and no moon light present.  I could not see the craft itself only its lights and the void it created in the clear bright starfield.  The shape appeared to be like that of a rectangle three times longer than its width with rounded corners.  There were four bluish-green lights near the corners.  Four amber lights forming a square in the center with a red light in the center of the square.  All lights were soft, not bright or piercing.  I thought it odd an alien craft would be lighted like that, without stealth. My best assessment of size is difficult.  I thought it to be far larger than an aircraft carrier and determining elevation was difficult on a dark night.  I would estimate  the bottom surface was 1,000 feet above ground.  I saw it travel about 1/8 mile, last seen almost overhead.  I watched amazed as I realized this is an alien craft.  It moved slowly in a south west direction. Just before 2:00am, I returned to my girlfriend ((female name deleted)) sleeping and urged her to come out and look at the craft.  To my lament she was reluctant to wake and go out.  Disappointed, I returned outside to see it had progressed and heading more south.  It was moving on a gentle arc or curved path.  I watched again for about a minute then went back to encourage ((female name deleted)) to come out.  I really wanted someone else to see what I was seeing.  Then I returned outside to see the object was gone to my great disappointment as it was there only 30 seconds before. It was nowhere in sight.  When I returned inside, it was 2:20.  I thought that odd as it should have only been 2:05 at the latest.  No other impression of time incongruity occurred other than the surprise at how quickly such a large object moved away. The next morning I was thinking why didn’t I check with the sheriff's office for other reports? I never did.  Can’t say why other than I understand “we are not alone”.  We are part of a universal community.  My studies are broad.  I report here now because I listen to your reports on the radio  C to C a.m. and this sighting ought to be recorded.  Also, I’ve always wondered who else has had the “hum inside” experience from proximity to a U.F.O.  That is what I believe happened.  If not for the hum experience I would not have gone outside to see the craft.  Seems likely it’s intentional.  Are they calling to us?  They did to me.  Why?  I’ve not heard of a body hum like what happened to me elsewhere.  Have you had other similar reports?  Is there another similar report from Sebastopol in 1982?  I might add, I have always been more sensitive to “energies” than the “average joe”. One of my studies is the Urantia Book and the following teachings, an off planet (Earth) source of knowledge and wisdom.  There it is said the celestial administrators of our planet have told our alien visitors to make themselves visible but do not engage.  But they do, don’t they.  That might explain the visible lights.  If your not familiar with the Urantia book and following teachings, they may help you in your work.  All made available on internet or published book.  If you have questions please ask.  URANTIA is the name of our planet to the rest of the universe.   Thank you for the work you do so truth may be known.

I should have reported it then but did not know to whom or where to report it.  It all started because of our dog.  He was a collie cross,regular farm dog.  As it was summer he was sleeping outside the farm house.  It was getting dark and I was watching TV.   Suddenly the dog started to scream.  I'd never heard the sound of anything so terrified. It was not a bark but a scream.  I ran to the door, not knowing what to expect.  Surprised, I saw nothing, the yard was quit and there was nothing in sight.  However as I looked to the sky to the East I did see a red light low in the sky.  It was only there for seconds then gone.  I returned to the house but felt uneasy so I decided to take a drive to the East where I had seen the red light.  If nothing else for curiosity. I headed East out of our yard towards where I saw the light.  Less than a mile from our house in a clearing past a lot of trees there it was.  I knew instantly I was looking at a UFO.  It was huge, rectangular, much longer than it was wide and it had dark red bright lights around the bottom.  The lights were either really close together or one strip. The top reminded me of a VW Bug.  It was hovering not far off the ground.  I don't recall feeling frightened just awed at what I was seeing. Suddenly just as it had been there it all went dark as if they knew I was watching them.  I decided to drive farther East .  I drove a short distance then stopped and got out of my truck. Suddenly I could see the lights again, it was stationary for at least a minute if not more . Then off the lights went again but within seconds I could see the lights again about a mile farther East. Suddenly it took off at a 90% angle.  it moved so fast there was a red streak of light from earth into the heavens. A UfO had come right over my house, oh how I wish I could have seen what my dog had seen.  That sophisticated ship was built somewhere with high intelligence and high technology.  I was just a simple farmer living a simple life but will never forget my experience that night and am glad I finally decided to share it.

Some time ago, while I was headed South on I-5, outside Bakersfield CA, a flying saucer made several passes over the roof of my car.  I did look out my window and could see an array of circular lights on the disk as it was approximately at each pass about 100 feet from the roof of my car.  I did not stop and maintained a speed of 60 mph as I was extremely afraid, but at the same time curious.  This happened in a time frame of about 15 minutes.  The saucer would sway out from my cars roof to 45 degrees to the side of the car at 200 feet then swing back over my roof.  It then would go to the other side of my car at about 45 degrees to an altitude of 200 feet again.  The diameter of the saucer was approximately 50 feet. I was outside of the city limits of Bakersfield, driving along the I-5 an oddly I was the only car on the freeway headed South.  I did not notice any traffic headed North bound either?  Was this an attempt by aliens to abduct me?  Yet they elected not to EMP my car, because I would have crashed.  Do you think they were waiting for me to stop the car?  The year was 2002.

All my friends and I were having a party at one of our friends house being that they were all classmates and finally achieved a diploma.  As the partying continues through the night-my cousin, my best friend, and I, decided to go outside in the front yard to have ourselves a cigarette smoke.  We all 3, make our way outside and close the front door behind us and are now standing in the doorway/entrance area outside which is approximately 5ft.x5ft without an overhang so our vision directly above us and in the sky is clear and unobstructed.  Being that it was very late in the midnight hours; the sky was pitch black and very quiet in the residential area that we were in.  Maybe 3-4 minutes go by as our other friends were still inside and we are smoking outside- My friend (who is standing 12o'clock to me) turns to my cousin and I and says ""Hey, guys, ! you see that?""  My cousin and i were having a conversation about something at the time without my friend so, we ask him ""where are you looking?""  He then steps between my cousin and I and points directly in a 12o'clock position from us in the sky what seemed to be only 10-15,000 feet high in the sky and says ""look, it's right there just like those grey cigar cloud shaped ones"", ""I've been looking at it for like 2 minutes now and I know that it was something there because it's been slowly moving and shifting positions, but it ain't making no noise"" he says. That's when after him pointing out where exactly for us to look in the sky- We were able to see exactly what he was talking about, and it was shaped exactly like a grey cigar cloud shaped object hovering with absolutely zero sound and zero lights!  My cousin, My friend and I watched this object as it defyingly floated in the sky like a very slow wobbling feather making very short, but calculated, and angled turns.  As we stare up in the sky in complete shock and well IN BELIEF-about 12 seconds pass by and we see the object now completely alter its position and begin to speed up and start to fly away.  While we are watching it beginning to fly off parallel but just at a very fast speed- We then hear extremely loud roaring sounds but do not know what it is since it is very late at night and quiet.  As we are asking ourselves what is that sound and where's it coming from, that's when we notice 2 military fighter jets chasing after the object in the sky at a very high rate of speed.  At that point it solidified everything that we thought we seen and what we were thinking it could have been.  Never have my cousin, friend or myself witnessed a military fighter jet chase after an object like that unless seen on youtube videos or hollywood movies,  But to be able to see and experience myself with witnesses was truly Out Of This World!  My cousin at that time was a new high school graduate,  My friend was my age of 21 and was employed at The Home Depot! Full time, and I myself had been employed full time with an electronic store after just graduating with an A/A. This is just my first story of encountering and witnessing something in the sky.  My second story is when I have actually been followed in the same city by 2 of these crafts. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Although my actual strange and unexplainable experience took place almost three years ago, I hope it's not too late to report it and that the information may be useful or helpful to you or others. At the time I was living in my small motorhome/RV which I had set up in the backyard of a friends 5 acre countryside property.  I had it parked right behind the small house my friend and his disabled wife lived in so I was able to plug in to the house for electricity, water, etc.  We lived about 30 km from the nearst small town and the closest nieghbors were maybe 300-400 meters, so it was quiet and on a clear night there wasn't any artificial light pollution for star gazing.  As well most of the trees at the front of the property, where the house and motorhome were situated, had been cut down and lawn planted so we had a good view from horizon to horizon. On the night of the event, I was outside of my RV so I could get better cell phone reception as I was having my weekly phone conversation with my daughter which lived an hour and a half away.  By this time it was approx 22:00 and completely dark with a gorgeous clear view of the night sky, I noticed two stars in the eastern part of the sky that seemed to be moving 2-3 inches, from my point of view, to the west and then back to thier original position.  This happened a few times in a 2 or 3 minute span, so I told my dauhhter that I would call her back in a couple of minutes so I could concentrate on them and see if they were actualy moving or just my imagination.  Within 5 minutes of watching them they had started moving around at distances that confirmed my suspicions, and it wasnt just 2 star but now there was 4 then 5 then 6 and so on, I couldnt believe what I was seeing!!  There were stars from all areas and all over the night sky moving across the sky, zig zagging, some just moving in a staight line, some darting everywhere, and all at different rates of speed.  I seriously thought I was having some kind of medical issue with my head or eyes or something, as I had never in my life witnessed anything abnormal in life such as ufo's, ghosts's, etc.  I ran into my friend's house and told him what I was seeing and to come out and look, as well I picked up his disabled wife in my arms and carried her outside, I wanted as many people as I could get to see this so that maybe people would believe me. Well to make a long story short all three of us watched this show go on for approx. 2 hours and ended up counting over 30 stars at one time moving great distances across the sky, as for the 2 initial stars I first noticed they ended up coming very close to us, it's hard to say for sure but they were'nt more than 300-400 meters off the ground and 10-15 km away from us as the crow flies, they just slowly were cruising along at the same altitude and stopped what i believed was over a nearby indian reservation for 10 mins or so then slowly cruised on and then lost sight of them behind tall trees.  I know how this sounds and I did make several calls as this was taking place but everyone I spoke with claimed it was cloudy in thier area and thought I was making some kind of joke. That's my ordeal and to this day I still don't know what to make of it because I didnt see any type of crafts, all they were was lights that looked exactly like stars and except for the two that came close all the rest looked as if they were in space just as if they were normal stars but moved like the were being operated by someone or something.   Thanks for listening and if anyone else has ever seen anything similiar please let me know?  Cheers ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was mid summer and we were on our summer holidays from school.  We decided to stay awake all night eating sweets, junk food and soda.  I remember it was about 4.30 am in the morning, it was not quite night and not quite day, somewhere in between. at this time we decided to go out on our bikes for a wonder around the area.  There were no cars or people to be heard or seen.   We were out on the main road next to the farm just riding around having a laugh when one of my friends pointed up to the sky above the farm fields and shouted ""omg look "".   We all looked up and I saw two flying saucers/metallic grey/silver disc shaped crafts completely still in the sky. two houses high above the fields.  They made absolutely no sound. I remember staring up the discs and feeling an emotion of complete dread and fear.  I do not know if I even knew what a ufo was back then until a few years later when seeing them in movies and connecting the dots.  We were so scared we rode back to the barn as fast as we could and when we got back to the barn the lights tripped out and we had a power cut.  We were too scared to sleep in the barn so we slept outside on the driveway until the morning .   I am no longer connected to the group of people I was with during this sighting but as some one who is a regular listener to coast to coast for the past year I know for sure I had witnessed a craft from another civilisation in space.

Why?? Although this happened a few years back, I am curious to know if anyone has seen the same thing I did. Driving down a regular, pretty nice, suburban street at night in Arlington, me and my bestfriend we’re headed towards the end of a street where you could either go left or right when you got the the stop sign.  You can not go straight.  (We needed to go left). As we were coming down the same street we always did, a 8 ft tall “thing” walked across the street, at the stop sign of the neighborhood which we were driving towards.  It was similar shaped to a human, but way taller and way skinnier, overall tall and lanky to the point where there was no mistaking the fact that it was not human.  It’s head was slimmer than a human too, clearly not as big as a human head would be to a body of this size.  The arms went further down then a humans would.  It walked across the street like it was somewhat in a hurry. My heart dropped instantly and I couldn’t really even say anything.  I could not believe what I know I had for sure seen just casually, somewhat in a rush, cross the street. My bestfriend spoke about 2seconds after it happened, (she was driving the car) and said, “did you just see that”  I said “YES” she replied, “well tell me what you saw so I know you’re not lying.” “It was y’all and skinny”.  She started laughing and continued driving down the street as I yelled at her to stop because I thought it would jump on the car or something like a horror movie. Instead, it must have his because it was nowhere in sight.  But if I were it in a human world, I would probably hide too. There is one video on YouTube of an alien on a roof top in Mexico in 2015. That is the only pic/video I have found of EXACTLY the thing that I saw.  I know that video is real, because I saw that thing with my own eyes.  I think he is stuck on Earth, maybe that’s why it took him 3 yrs to end up on a roof top in Mexico because he is having to walk around at night to try to stay out of sight somewhat.

Suddenly I noticed a very bright, cool LED-esque light.  At first, I dismissed it as just being a landing light on an airplane, though I quickly ruled this out.  The object was silently hovering, unlike a plane or helicopter, and the sun was clearly visible in the east, while this object was right above the car, maybe a couple hundred or a thousand feet above the ground.  There are no towers or buildings near the sight, and the object was continuously illuminated, indicating that this was a lightbulb, not something burning or reflecting the sun.   Just as I was thinking of what it could be, a square-shaped gap opened in the clouds, showing that the object was much weirder than I had at first thought.  The original light was still there, surrounded by what looked like a moving cage of thin bl! ack bars, with no means of generating lift or propulsion.  As soon as I saw this object, it disappeared completely and the clouds completely closed up. P.S.--I self taught myself to recognize almost all civilian or military aircraft, including some I have never seen before, using a manual, and I still have no idea what I saw that day.  As the incident unfolded, I told my dad, an amateur astronomer, what was happening and he was also dumbfounded.  (He couldn’t look because he was driving.)  In addition, although this may be coincidental, during my lunch break at noon I heard a very low and fast flying helicopter fly from west to east over my school in Denville.  I quickly ran to the window to see it, but couldn’t as it flew right over the building. This is a completely factual report, and I am still curious about what I saw, but I wish to post anonymously.

After a day of fishing at Alum Creek reservoir in Westerville, Ohio, a friend of mine, myself and my two teenage sons were preparing to leave the lake for the day.  We had just gotten the boat out of the water and were still at the boat ramp when my oldest son noticed a glowing orange ball of light approximately 3 miles to the west.  My youngest son quickly grabbed a pair of high end binoculars from under the seat of my vehicle and we all four watched as the glowing light got closer.  The ball of light was about the size of a beach ball and was coming towards us at about the speed of a low flying commercial aircraft.  Suddenly, we saw the ball of light split into 2 balls of light, now making it 4 balls of light.  Then those balls of light each split into more balls of light and the process continued until there were 11 balls of light coming towards us in a straight line.  They were still all about the same size as a beach ball and still flying at a steady pace.  At one point the 9th ball in line flew off course to the south.  There was a full moon that night and it looked as if the 9th ball of light was directly under the moon.  Due to the fact that it was now illuminated by the glow of the full moon, we could see that it was a saucer shaped object that looked to be gun metal gray in color and thru the binoculars we could see a compartmentalized structure on the bottom of the craft.  It almost seemed as if the object wanted us to see what it was and so it flew out of formation and illuminated itself under the moon to show that it was a spacecraft. Just as quickly as it had flown out of formation, the 9th ball of light regained it's spot in line with the other balls of light and all flew off to the east, following the route of the powerlines.  There was a thick formation of trees just beyond the lake and once they flew that way, we could no longer see them.  We all stood there mesmerized and then we began talking about what we had seen.  We had all seen the same thing and had all taken turns with th! e binocu lars.  There were still a few boaters around the boat ramp and they too were looking up at the lights, but I am not sure what they thought they saw.  We all told our families when we got home and as the days went by many people that we told convinced us that it was something other than what we thought we saw.   After listening to Coast to Coast am the past several years, I am now once again convinced that it was alien spacecrafts that we saw and I wanted to share my experience.",2019-01-04T00:00:00,40.13236180904523,-82.90826582914573

We were new to the Yuma, AZ area.  We had left Southern California on July 04th, 2016, and had gone East to find a better and more affordable place to live.  Without knowing where we were going, we decided to check out Yuma, Arizona, and soon it was decided that it was decent enough for us to live in and it was a small town that had pretty much everything that the bigger cities had as well.  We leased a home for one year.  The home had an outdoor pool and an outdoor hot tub where we would regularly get in it during the late afternoons and evenings to enjoy the water cooling off the hot Yuma heat during the summer time, and during the winter use the hot tub in order to enjoy some warm waters under the starry Yuma sky. The hot tub contained a strong and luminous LED multi-color light inside, and so did the pool, but the pool’s light was inoperable and needed repair, so only the hot tub light would be turned on at night. On one occasion, my step kids came into the home and were wild and excited that something from the sky had flashed a blue beam of light at them.  Being that one was a seven-year old at the time, and the other was a nineteen-year old, I discarded their story as something that they had made up in order for the older one to scare the younger one, and practically forgot and put the entire incident to rest. As a matter of fact, we went on with pretty much a normal routine after the incident was reported by the kids, and we continued to use the pool and hot tub regularly.  On several occasions I started paying more attention to the night skies.  Almost daily (it’s just a matter of time here in this region) we would observe these small white moving orbs float by from star to star.  They would sometimes pause momentarily, and they would camouflage themselves with other celestial bodies.  Sometimes these objects would stop to pause in the sky, temporarily making one lose sight of it, but most of the time they just floated on by the night sky.  For a few weeks, or months, I tried to see if there was a directional pattern of flight of these objects, but the answer was, No.  These were independent objects that were far beyond our air space.  I know, because next to us is the Marine Corps Yuma Air Station, and on several occasions I tried to visually compare how high the Marine planes ! would climb up in the sky to where more or less I had seen these objects, and these objects had to have been way much higher in distance from the ground than the MCAS jets flew.  Some floated on fast, while others a bit slower, and they held a constant speed too, even after they started moving from a temporary pause. It was either October of 2016 or November of 2016 when my step son and my step daughter decided to go later on in the evening and use the hot tub.  We started talking about the incident that they had witnessed in the sky the time that they saw the beam of blue light shine upon them.  At one point, I asked them if they could show my the direction of where this blue beam of light appeared from, and they both pointed towards the northern skies of Yuma. Being a former U.S. Army Communications Soldier myself, from 2000 – 2009, I am familiar with the basics of how a few methods of communications work.  Something in my mind told me to try and use the very bright and luminous LED lamp to see if I can somehow communicate with whatever was out there in the sky.  I thought that the chances of something responding back was slim to none.  But I was wrong. Since the LED lamp in the hot tub could be set to a specific color by a series of flicks of the switch, I had set the color to a light blue color.  Once the color had been set, I went into the hot tub and I sat facing North, fortunately the LED lamp was facing north as well as it was built-in to the hot tub’s southern part.  I began covering the LED lamp with my hands.  At first, I started doing a series of either two counts or three covered, and then uncovering it for the same amount of time.  I probably did this for a good five to fifteen minutes.  In the time that I was doing this, I also varied that times that I would cover the light and the times that I would uncover the lights.  At one point I saw it!  The blue light came from the Northern Sky and just focused on us three in the hot tub!  It was sort of like a one second burst of light upon us, but it happened!  All three of us saw the blue light, and afterwards we all went into the house and shared with my girlfriend ! and other step-daughter what we had just witnessed and encountered. I never did that experiment again afterwards, and I only shared it with a few people but was met with skepticism and ridicule.  Interestingly though, since that occurrence I’ve got a few skin blotches on my right hand that appeared soon afterwards and have been having some memory issues.  It doesn’t help that I am a disabled combat veteran today, served in Afghanistan as a Combat Engineer in 2006 – 2007), and have PTSD.  If it were not for my step kids seeing the light that night too, I would of have had thought that I was going crazy or be told probably by the VA that my medications might of have had caused me hallucinations. By the way, I am not the only one experiencing these strange physical and mental symptoms, so is my now twenty-one-year-old step daughter too, but not so much my young step-son. I hope that this report can help another person to see and bear witness that these orbs and blue lights are real.",2019-01-04T00:00:00,32.7038626459144,-114.59088443579766

I am only just now reporting because I was unaware I could report this.  I was referred by someone on Reddit from the r/UFOs page. I can’t remember the EXACT date and EXACT time: roughly June 29-June 30 of 2018; time may have been anywhere in between 10P-12A I believe. Me and my girlfriend were in New Mexico driving from Colorado to Oklahoma, taking HWY 64 going E/SE.  I was exhausted already, and so was my girlfriend.  During the trip, we would smoke a little bit of herb to keep our mind occupied.  But I am confident that was I saw was not due to me being tired or possibly high.  I’ve never had such an experience before.  I believe 100% what I saw.  I was sitting passenger seat, hadn’t seen a car or been near a town for miles and miles. What I seen was a single, bright red light from the top right corner of the windshield, seeming only about 10-15 feet from what would be the top of our car (a sedan). It struck me as odd, so I watched it through the side passenger mirror.  It looked as if it very slowly rose into the sky but stayed in the same position at the same time. There was no way it was the reflection of the taillights of the car on a road sign. It was a bright and sharp orb of red light. It seemed to suspend in the air, maybe about 20 seconds. I was able to look through the back windshield to make sure and it was there, almost directly behind us but in the sky. It slowly faded out until there was nothing but the darkness behind us. It looked if it may have been traveling N/NW.  I’m not sure what it was, and hope to find out if there is a scientific explanation for this. My girlfriend says she didn’t see it, but her eyes were on the road because she can’t see the best at night. This is not a made up story or a hoax. This actually happened to me. I tell my friends and family this story, and it’s even more believable that it could be a phenomenon based on location.

Immediately upon stepping onto the back porch, we both looked up to see what we thought was a spotlight, even though where we live made that impossible.  I quickly stated that it must be the moon, while my wife directed my attention to the moon behind me, clearing up that mix up.   As we began to try and get a better look at the lights, a clear shape took form, there were 3 GIANT white orbs in a perfect triangular shape.  When I say GIANT, I truly mean that this craft (if one solid unit) must have been the size of a football field.  I work in an industry that allows me to make fairly accurate scale analysis in a moments notice and my brain simply could not process the shear scale of the craft(s).  I jumped up onto the bench on our back patio to peer over the roof top to see where it was moving and it appeared to be complet! ely silent and heading East towards Geist Reservoir.  Just as my wife joined me standing on the porch bench, it became very clear that this was not of earthly origin....the triangle shaped craft quickly split into three orbs that shot in all different directions, breaking the laws of physics that we live by.  And just like that, it was gone. I have lived with this unsettling event now for 2-1/2 months and still do not know how to process what I saw.  I steadfastly believe that this planet has been visited by ETs at some point in the history of mankind, but to see something with your own eyes, and know that there are millions others like me....it’s earth shattering.   I decided to share this information in the event it may help connect the dots to a bigger story, or at least preserve this event somewhere that it will not fall on deaf ears.

Preface:  I am a former private pilot, so I am very familiar with aircraft, civilian and military. I was walking my dog through a field next to a local church on Christmas Eve evening while the church was letting out.  I estimate the cloud base that evening was approx. 1000-1500ft AGL with scattered clouds. I saw an object approaching me from the NW (Narrows Bridge area here).  Object was spherical in shape and emitted a brilliant, extremely coherent orange glow.  I could see no other projections, wings, navigation lights, etc.  Being so bright it was hard to estimate its size, but my best guess is between 1-4 meters in diameter.  The object made zero noise. As it approached my direction it just skimmed the bottom of the cloud layers, moving through cloud material and lighting it up with the same orange color it was emitting.  It sped up and slowed down erratically and quickly, moving very much as a living creature would as apposed to human aircraft or drone would.  There was very little wind that night, so I doubt it was any type of lighter than air object.  I estimate it varied in speed from 40-100mph for the entirety of my sighting.  It never changed altitude. (~1000-1500ft)  As the object got closer it did a gradual turn to the south and moved parallel to my location.  It flickered as it moved.  When it was moving slower the flicker rate was slower, as it sped up it flickered faster, and at a certain point it flickered so fast as to smooth out and appear as a steady light. Oddly, my dog actually looked up at it and barked at it. He really never barks or even notices aircraft for that matter. It was quite strange. I always carry a military grade 1000 lumen flashlight with me when I walk the dog at night, so as it went by I shined my light at its direction at full power, then switched it to strobe mode to see if I could 'get its attention' – it didn't seem to take notice of me or react in any way.  It continued south for another 30 seconds then turned to the south-west and faded away in the distance. I found it somewhat odd no one in the nearby parking lot seemed to notice the object flying over.  As far as I could tell no one was looking up at it but me. I should note, this is the second time in my life I have seen a glowing orange orb type object.  The exact same type of object flew right over me in 2012.

It just moved very quickly in space.  I guessed it was a near earth asteroid, big and fast.  If I extended my arm/hand the size would be about a golf ball to tennis ball in size, huge, dangerous and flying through space, very impressive.  I have been an Art Bell listener since 1994 and always enjoyed your shows with him.  RIP Mr Bell and keep up the good work, Peter.   PS I searched the internet and other sources and there were no other reports from that vicinity.  I imagine NASA was watching is closely and were grateful it never collided with Earth or else this email would be moot.  Thank you.

This UFO was shaped as a skull and at first, emitted a blue light.  This object started off small and floated around the top area of my house.  The object had then stopped suddenly and changed to a red color and started getting larger and larger as if it was getting closer.  It got about 5-10 times its original size before it stopped getting larger.  In the middle of this skull shaped red UFO, it looked like eyes and I felt being watched.  This stood like this for an unknown time.  This object then shot off into the distance beyond my house in the sky never to be seen again.  When we went inside, the clock said 1am.

It was a clear night with many stars visible.  We were looking in the direction of Orion’s Belt to the Southwest, when we saw a line formation directly overhead, consisting of 6 lights, traveling from East to West, at a high rate of speed.  From directly overhead to out of sight to the west took about 4 to 5 seconds.  It appeared to be a long thin illuminated light shaft with 6 distinct circular lights evenly spaced along the shaft.  It disappeared into the western sky. This was followed several minutes later by a similar sighting basically following the first one’s path. Then several minutes later there were two more that traversed Southeast to Northwest and then another few minutes passed, when we saw two more traveling North to South. Next, a V formation of lights, 3 or 4 lights on each side of the V, was seen traveling East to West, basically following the path of the first light shaft. ,This was followed by a similar, or the same, V light formation traveling from SE to NW.  Then there was a larger V formation traveling E to W. ,Then a few minutes passed before one larger circular or spherical illuminated object was observed rapidly traveling East to West along the same path as the V formations. ,Several minutes later, another two V-shaped objects, one following the other, were observed traveling NE to SW. ,And then after a few minutes, one more V was observed traveling W to E low in the Southern sky. Shortly after the last sighting, we saw a commercial jet aircraft, traveling N to S, at an estimated altitude of 20,000 feet based on the relative size of its navigation lights.  Based on this, the unidentified formations were above this at around 30,000 feet. Sightings ended at 10:48. I am a former Navy submarine officer and retired engineer.

I was approximately 3 ½ mi. south of Washington Court House. I saw a grid of very bright green lights flanked by bright yellow lights.  Green lights were rectangular in formation and yellow irregular.  In front of formation was a small red blinking light which seemed to be what looked like the light of a small air plane.  It appeared to be dragging the other lights along.  Then the colored lights blinked off only to come back a few seconds later.  I watched this out my driver side window as I continued to drive. It was flying slowly and low enough I could do this and try to make sense of what I was seeing.  I then saw that the green and yellow lights were shooting out at very high speed from the red blinking light out front which still appeared to be flying at the speed of a regular airplane.  The colored lights continued intermittently shooting out at rapid speed forming the rectangular formation as before and disappearing as quickly. I knew of a place a mile ahead where I could pull off safely to observe this phenomena, which I did.  The object continued to fly in an easterly direction and was practically out of sight and very low to the horizon.  Yet I saw bright yellow gold lights shoot out 2 more times.  The speed at which these lights shot out looked like fire works with no tracers, no sparking, just bright globes which quickly blinked out.  And then it turned back! With heart pounding, I jumped back into my car and back on the highway.  I was relieved there was other traffic on the road because I could not shake the feeling of being followed.  I was trying to focus on driving and not watching out my driver’s window.  Yet I did look out after travelling about another 4 miles towards home. “Oh S**t!” …. Out of my driver’s side window, this time it’s a line of 4 white lights.  They looked like head lights with no space between.  They were not bright and seemed to be flying at a 25 degree angle.  I had another 18 miles to go before getting home and I was tense. I called my brother via cell phone to let him know what I was experiencing, just in case.  My phone record says 8:50 central time so I am guessing first sighting occurred 8:25 CT. I arrive home and still had that feeling so I did not go in the house, but watched the sky instead.  Not 5 minutes passed and what looked like a small aircraft came flying in the direction I was standing.  I saw no shape, only 2 pairs of white lights. No sound, low flying and disappeared.  I have never observed any air craft in that particular position in this location at that altitude in 17 years of living here.  I went inside for 5 minutes only to go out and watch more.  I saw another red blinking light flying low on the south horizon and another on the north horizon 5 minutes after that.  It was a very clear night so it seems strange that the more ordinary lights would disappear.  The lights were too low for cloud cover.  I really strained to hear a droning noise that should have been audible, yet could not hear anything. I am aware that the county I live in is part of the Wright Patt air zone for training.  Any explanation would be appreciated.",2019-04-08T00:00:00,,

We often slept outside, and we always had our sleeping bags ready to go. In our neighborhood in Garden City we all had big back yards, lots of trees, and it was really like sleeping in the woods.  It was a dry clear night, and we laid out in our sleeping bags.  We talked a lot and were both staring up at the stars, when we both noticed something unusual at a star right straight above us. The star or light would have other lights going up to it, and then leave it.  Its been a long time, but I believe we saw at least 4 stars or lights joining up with it, then departing.  I cant recall if the activity ceased, or if we just fell asleep.  I think I might have compared it to a gas station, or a drive in restaurant.  We both saw it at the same time and always wondered what it could have been. Now hearing all the declassified info about the spy satellites  (Hexagon) and others I wonder if this is what we both saw that night.

Now my dad & I where very close we used to like to smoke herb before we got into the woods to just relax n enjoy things.  We where smoking & just turned into our friends old dirt road at about 530 PM when I'd noticed the side n front windows of my dads old truck appeared to be tinted a really dark color.  So I asked him, pops when did you tinted your windows on here ? He might of thought me crazy but he looked at his side window n scuffed the he started staring out n up the front window n said I didnt tint it .  So we both kinda was like God damn how good is this weed we're smoking!  Anyway we started looking out the front window that was at this time a very very dark purple were looking up at the sky and it's just all lit up these pinkish purple hue colors.  Neither of us had a clue at the time wtf was going on .  We where still driving down this old narrow dirt road but rt ! at the tree top level all we could see was this odd colored light.  My dad speeds up trying to get out from under whatever it is but that was a no go.  So I tell him stop to pull over so he does , we step out of the truck to get a better look n that's when things got weird .. we looked up at the top of the trees now these trees are no more than 30 or 40 feet tall that's how close this thing was . We where in shock bc this thing had no identifiable shape to it & it was about as large as a football field that  emitted this pink/purple light all the way around it that seemed to be constantly fluid ( that's what it reminded me of was a fluid movement) but like I said it was huge but made no sound whatsoever anything that big n close moving should make a sound or upset the atmosphere around it but no.  While we where standing under it everything seemed kinda distorted or something idk.  But things ( us ) where not moving in a normal frame of ref.  I'm guessing we where rt there u! nder this thing for about 30 min watching it but I'm not sure ! .  Like I said nothing was normal at the time .  So my dad kinda freaks and jumps back into the truck n we take off to our friends place but this thing was rt over the top of us the entire time .  We parked at our buddy's and this thing then proceeded to slowly very slowly creep across this farm field in the adjacent lot . I told you this thing was huge n never made a sound as it moved .  Now my dad &I are still standing out side watching this thing our friend is standing in his front door looking out at us n this thing moving across the field . It was slow when it made it across the field it just sit or hovered there for a few min same as it did to us , then out of the bottom left quadrant of this thing it shots out something toward the ground that looked like a missile to me but it never made a impact or sound when it hit so idk .  But then this thing started to move again slowly (now when this thing took off it was gone (poof ) no sound no nothing . My dad & I where just in a stupor! our friend in his front door was asking us wtf is that thing ? We didnt know what to say what could we say wo sounding crazy af?  Anyway my pops refused to even talk about for long time after that even to me & I was with him .  I'm only reporting this now bc I'm getting old & wanna get this off my chest my dad & our friend have since passed away and it's just me now .  Idk maybe someone out there can  relate or have had the same experience maybe it can help them I hope so .  Anyway ty for your time .

I was a teenager in high school.  It was in the afternoon.  Do not recall the day of the week or time of year. I was in my bedroom located about three houses off Sunset Boulevard in Brentwood, California near the 405 Freeway offramp (the offramp made famous decades later by the OJ Simpson White Bronco chase). My bedroom had two windows, one parallel to Sunset Boulevard. I was on the phone with a friend and happened to pull the curtain to look out the window that faced Sunset. I sighted a glowing red orange fireball with a tail traveling from the North to the East.  As I recall, it appeared to be a few hundred feet up in the sky. It was traveling very slowly, parallel to the earth. I remember remarking, “You’re not going to believe what I’m seeing!""  I watched as it traveled out of range and ran to the next window, thinking surely it wouldn’t be there. But damned if it wasn’t.  And still traveling parallel to the earth and moving slowly. I continued to watch and at one point the fireball, still maintaining the parallel course, sped up until it was out of sight. I clearly saw a fireball but if others also saw this same UFO they may have interpreted it as something else, i.e. a disk or cigar…who knows?  I didn’t do drugs, and I know what I saw!  And I’ve thought about this over the decades and always felt I couldn’t be the only person to have witnessed this. We are in the midst of watching Project Blue Book and like so many other UFO movies and tv shows, it recounts a similar fireball sighting which peaked my interest again. The program also recounts oddly moving lights in the night sky.  A couple of years ago my husband and I experienced this from our home on the Olympic Peninsula.  (Actually, this was one of two similar sightings here.)  There were between 5 and 10 points of light crazily moving in several directions.  They had a greenish cast.  The general direction was towards Victoria B.C.  It lasted for several minutes.  It was so creepy, I left my husband outside to continue watching…but I kept an eye on him from inside the house!

When I looked out my window I saw several lights moving slowly down and around the hill in my pasture.  I immediately went outside to get a better look and indeed there were 5-6 separate lights that I assumed to be from UTV’s and/or ATV’s.   Knowing they had to be trailered in as there is no road access, I went back inside to get a coat, boots (there was a light coating of snow) and of course coffee before heading down the hill to see who it was. I was in no hurry knowing they couldn’t get out of there quickly due to the Badlands terrain. Returning to the shop I took out the truck and I was now visible to them with shop lights on and headlights.  At this point I saw a much larger vehicle I assumed to be a big semi-truck, turn on its lights and it also had several amber “curtesy” lights above the headlights.  My intention was to go down and get a photo of the license plate.  About 30 minutes had passed and they were still out there. They made no sound, were non-threatening and my dogs did not bark nor were the horses upset. I then videotaped the lights on my phone which were still moving slowly around my pasture as if they were looking for something.  At the time, I believed they were “shining” for deer or poaching.  Not being able to drive directly down the hill due to the snow cover I went around to the back gate, which took about 2 minutes, to get a picture of the trailer they had to be hauled in on.  It was still dark but there was some moon reflection off the snow.  I found nothing at the back gate.  No truck or trailer, no tracks, nothing, so I went to the neighbors on the opposite side of the hill to see if they were parked up there.  Again, nothing. I went back home and the lights were gone.  About 45 minutes had passed and it was starting to get light. I drove all around my property, about 10 miles or more, looking for tracks how they got in. Nothing.  No tracks anywhere, at any point, no evidence whatsoever that anyone had been in my landlocked pasture. The only evidence I have are the photos captured from the video I made. The photos are of machines like nothing I have ever seen; nor any person I have shown them too.  I notified law enforcement and posted it on Facebook.",2019-01-04T00:00:00,46.9246,-103.2622

It was hovering and slowly traveling along with me and then veered east.  I don't know if the UFO was aware that I was watching it.   When the UFO turned east, it slightly turned its profile.  When it turned its profile, I saw the red outline face eastward, so the whole UFO turned eastward.  Only the red sides were three dimensional and the red sides were the light mechanism of the UFO.  The middle was flat and solid black.  The UFO was on the right side of road and I don't remember seeing it lift off but I looked at it for about 1 minute.

I noticed this smudge directly above my steering wheel, almost near the top of my windshield.  I thought that was odd so I stared at it for the duration of my time stopped at the light.   I called my wife, who was in the car behind me, and asked if she saw it too.  She verified that she did see it and said that she would call me back because she was on the other line. The light finally turned green, and as I continued driving southbound, this red smudge had a blue light slowly manifest itself directly behind the smudge, close enough that it looked as if the light and the smudge were touching.  After this blue light fully manifested, the smudge started moving west in the sky with the blue light getting brighter and brighter behind it and eventually forming two white lights with one both above and below the centered blue light.  This happened over a period of 10-15 seconds.   When the smudge stopped, it ended almost directly centered on the windshield in front of the passenger seat.  As this smudge stopped, the smudge started to change color and shape.  The smudge started turning from the smudge into a white, straight line perfectly vertical in the sky – the lights were still behind it, just not as bright as when it was moving.  After a few seconds, I watched this now straight line turn into an oval shape that was similar in shape to what you see planets orbit lines look like in books and online.   When this oval shape was fully formed, I watched it disperse into HUNDREDS of different colored lights.  The weird thing was that these lights, mostly red, green, white, and blue, followed that same oval path that they dispersed from.  Over the next couple minutes, I watched these lights start to spiral, similar to how tornadoes are shaped – thick at the top, but starts to taper towards the bottom – all spinning and eventually falling below the tree line.   As I continued watching, the thick top mass of lights did, in fact, start to get closer and closer to the top of the tree line.  I watched this event until it completely disappeared behind the tree line on the west side of US-27 just near W. Polk Ave. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2019-04-25T00:00:00,28.0573,-81.5687

We chalked it up to the air show or the event at the field at the time but I was watching a tv show today that had very similar objects.  They were like fireballs but not exactly.  They had a trail that followed them when they moved but then they would move and stop and become round again.  At first they seemed to be something falling like a meteor but stopped and hovered or moved side to side.  One split into several different balls.  I have 2 videos which I will send.  I posted the videos on Facebook and an ex military friend of mine said it was the air rangers from the show practice jumping so we never thought anything else about it until I just saw the TV show with the same balls we saw, so I decided to report it just so someone else could take a look because I’m not so sure.

If you zoom in on it you will see its shape and sizzling white lights ... in the longer video it was further away but you can watch it zip up suddenly and then a blue flare of sizzling lights and it darts quickly away.  I looked at these videos up closely today and saw how detailed they are if zoomed in... good luck if this helps with the puzzle of discovering what it is.  I am interested in NASA and follow Space news so I look often at the sky and have a great interest in science.  As an artist I draw space craft and other detailed machinery.  This took me completely by surprise and I simply thought it may be a satellite ... then I began to consider it more seriously upon seeing how far it leaped up and realized it must have darted that far at extreme speed.

I have been looking for similar reports for years and finally found one that was kind of similar but not entirely.  I was in my home on Plum Island and was watching TV.  It was 12:45, as the tonight show just ended and I was going to bed.  I shut the lights off, went into the kitchen to get a drink of water and suddenly froze.  There was a bright light, like a flashlight shining in my living room.  I froze as I thought it was a robber casing out my house.  I stayed in the kitchen not making a sound, suddenly my house was full of light, it was like daytime.  (not middle of the day bright but early morning when the sun first comes up or like around 7:00pm in the summer before it gets dark.)  I was confused, did I fall asleep standing in the kitchen and woke up to morning?  I looked at the clock on the microwave and it was 1:00am. To better describe the scene, the back of my house was floor to ceiling sliders on the back and sides going out to a large deck that overlooks one house behind mine.(Marks) and the marsh beyond that.  I lived on a small dirt road with 4 houses.  1 in front of mine, one behind mine and one across the street from the one behind me. I'm confused as to why the clock on the microwave and my cell phone say 1:00am but its light out. I go out on the deck to investigate.  On the right  corner of the house behind mine (Marks) on the roof is a huge glowing object.  At first I though that Mark put a spotlight up and it was what was shingles's in my house, then I thought his house was on fire but that wasn't the case.  It was a huge glowing object I can only describe as a fireball. Just sitting on the corner of the roof and side of the house.  Not moving, just glowing. I wasn't afraid, just curious and maybe a little nervous. I decided to go back in the house, grab a cup of coffee and my cigs and go sit on the deck to watch it. I watched it but nothing happened.  The best way to describe the object is that it almost looked like a piece of the sun was on the corner of the roof.  It was the color of the sun when it sets over the water. red in the middle and then orange around the outside turning to a yellow. kind of round like a circle. Then it dawned on me that is was daylight out.  The object wasn't emitting any light rays but the whole sky was light. I walked around the the deck stairs that face out to the front of the house to look down the street and It hit me like a ton of bricks that it was dark out like it is supposed to be at now 1:30 in the morning. It was only daytime over my house and Marks house.  Across the street and everywhere else in was night. Then I got kind of freaked out. I looked up but there was no aircraft or space ship lighting up our houses, it was seriously daylight. As I sat watching the only explanation I could come up with was that it was some sort of UFO that crashed and they needed the light to see to fix it. I wasn't scared sitting on the deck watching it, because I am pretty sure if there were people in it, they didn't notice me. I didn't want to wake up my boyfriend as I knew he would run over to get close up and I was afraid he would be seen and I know he would never just sit and watch.  I thought about going to Marks and ringing his doorbell but it was now like 2:00am and again, I didn't want the ufo to see me. So I just stayed on my deck drinking my coffee and smoking my cigs watching it.  I watched for hours and it didn't move, nothing. by now it was starting to get light everywhere as it was around 5:30 in the morning.  I was so tired and I had to work in the morning so I figured I would just go to bed and when people woke up they would see it. I went to bed and woke up to pee around 7:00 am.  I looked outside and it was now morning light and the UFO was gone. Oh and the object did not make any sound, in fact there was no sound at all.  No birds, crickets or frogs, just dead silence. I thought to take a video or pictures, but was afraid It might see me, so I didn't.  I will email you photos of my old house so you can get an idea of where I was watching and the surrounding area.

Here I was, driving down one hill and heading back up another, when I noticed a pair of lights that were stationary up in the sky, north of the freeway.  Just floating maybe a hundred feet up or two hundred. I thought it was weird, because I thought it was incoming aircraft like right next to each other in the sky.  Maybe 50 feet or a hundred feet apart.  Way too far apart to be a helicopter.

It possibly could have landed into Lake Michigan just north or Atwater beach.

I didn't report this right away because I sent the footage to a local news team and they said it looked like space debris or debris from an airplane.

The light eventually dimmed and disappeared, with no visible clouds in the sky; it just seemed to fade out as it continued the same direction and speed.

What we saw and for how long:  We both saw five goldish looking lights, about 40 degrees above the horizon lined up horizontally but tilted slightly,  The left most light was significantly brighter (about as bright as a car headlight from a quarter mile away) than the others.  The distance was hard to judge but I would guess between 2 and 3 miles.  They appeared to be drifting slowly to the west (left) and all of a sudden they just disappeared, as if a light switch was turned off. We saw these lights for about 10 seconds before they disappeared. What we didn’t see: We didn’t see the lights appear, other than when we noticed them, so we can’t vouch for how long they were visible. We did not see a craft or crafts that may have been emitting the light.  There were no blinking lights associated with them, as seen on normal aircraft; in fact as we continued to drive north, about a mile and a half past the original sighting, we did not see any aircraft in the area at all.  The lights did not behave like fireworks, military aircraft flairs, drones or shooting stars, all of which we have seen many times. About us: I am an Engineering Technician/Metrologist and my wife is a teacher.  We are both sky watchers and have witnessed many unusual things in both the daylight and night skies.  We both try to think of logical explanations for anything that we experience but we can’t explain what we saw.",2019-04-25T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

I was driving on hwy 77 going north, just coming up to the side of the Mall of America. I had a friend with me sitting in the front passenger seat. All of a sudden I shouted ""WOAH!"" at which point he stated, ""I saw that too!""  Which really shocked and excited me that he did, because I am usually alone when I see strange things in the sky, or people I am with just don't ever see what I do, most likely because they aren't paying attention, and as for me, my eyes are always in the sky!  Even this time my friend wasn't really paying attention and kept looking at his phone but this object was so bright and low to the ground that it caught his eye.  I'd say it was at around the hight of the Mall of America.  Which would be illegally low for a plane to be flying. The object made no noise at all and I'm not sure how to explain the shape of it with one word but it looked semi-long, cylinder shaped with round edges in the front and back. Idk if you call that cigar shaped or what.  It was VERY bright and glowing a neon green and blue-ish like meshing together.  Looked like something that glows in the dark but brighter than any glow in the dark toy thing I've ever seen. It was traveling north, the same direction I was and it came about very fast, seemingly out of no where.  It was like its cloaking mode malfunctioned or noticed we saw them at which point it did not get far at all ahead of my car before it just vanished right in front of us, just dissapeared so I don't mean it vanished out of view. It just plain old vanished right before our eyes!  About a month after that event, I saw the same exact looking object do the very same thing, and also not too far away from the first time, but I was driving alone. So a few weeks go by and just last night I was at work (which is with-in just a few miles of the other events) and I hear my co worker talking to someone explaining what she had seen fly right above her while she was standing outside our work having a smoke and that the thing had vanished right before her eyes, right before looking like it was going to fly right into these apartments, and she described it looking exactly as what my friend and I saw. So needless to say I hopped in that conversation real quick haha. These 3 events all happened in the same area within 5 miles of eachother.  It is right near the Minneapolis-St Paul airport but we know what planes look like and this thing was most definetely no plane I have ever seen. I'm sure I will see it again sometime. I also take lots of videos of the sky because i tend to see things quite often and I have a couple still images from different videos of something no one can tell what it is.

As I was making my rounds, I saw a bright object fall smoothly to the ground.  It was too smooth to be a flare, or fireworks.  Amazed, I walked over to a trucker and asked if he saw what I have just seen.  He said no, we joked for a minute about UFO’s, and he went on his way. I was still confused, so I returned to the spot where I witnessed the light.  As I was staring in the area, two objects appeared in the sky.  They were off set from each other.  They were maneuvering unlike anything I have ever witnessed on this earth.  At first I thought that they were flying bugs in the distance that were attracted to the street light.  But they were flying smoothly around the area where the light fell.  I was still convinced that my eyes were playing tricks with me, because the objects began to mimic my movement.  They would glide back and forth in sequence.  Then they would maneuver around each other.  When I took steps forward, they ascended, then stopped, when I backed up, they would descend, then stop.  I was convinced it was not my eyes because as I continued to stare, they started gliding again.  This went on for about a good 5 minutes.  Then, I guess they got tired of messing around and disappeared. The objects reminded me of a dragon fly.  They were not saucer shaped, and I did not see any lights coming from them.  I would say drones, but I never saw two drones fly next to each other with that much control, and speed. This report may be nothing, but I will never forget what I saw.

My son and I had just gone for a bike ride around Greenlake in North Seattle because it was a very nice, clear afternoon. When we returned home a little before 6:00 PM, we were laying in the grass in the front yard looking up at the blue sky and noticed an faint object very high in the sky that was moving north to south at a slow speed.  It had the appearance of a white point of light, like a satellite, but it was during the daytime.  It appeared to be too high to be a commercial aircraft and it was moving too slow.  I thought it might be a satellite also because it appeared to almost drift at times, but then I noted it would make sudden bursting movements. After a few minutes, my son noticed another object and it appeared the two objects were approaching each other.  At that time, I called my wife and daughter outside and they could see the two objects as well.  Eventually, the two objects came so close together they seemed to briefly merge.  The two objects then separated and that’s when we saw the third object, but not before I saw a streak of light that resembled a faint meteor, streak near the objects. The three objects then held a tight triangular formation for a few minutes until their luminosity faded to the point where we couldn’t see them anymore.  Afterwards, we all discussed what we saw and we all agreed we saw the same thing.  This sighting was during broad daylight but one would have had to be looking straight up at the sky to see it, and even then you would have had to be focusing fairly intently to see and track the objects.

I (driver) noticed a faint light about a mile down.  We were probably driving about 65mph due to us hailing a pretty heavy trailer.  Although faint, it was pretty easy to notice considering the lack of manmade light source around that area. The object was right, RIGHT above the tree line. As we gained,  I saw the ROUNDED triangular shape. 3 lights on each corner also were now in sight.  This is when I realized it was something worth pointing out.  I pointed at it and said, “Um, what is that?”.  My colleague also expressed the same question. About 100 yards and closing - I realize the initial glow I saw was centralized, white, with a faint hint of blue and I could now see a whispy like fog coming off of it.  Of course with the amount of drones flying around these days, it was my second thought, following random-unnecessarily high-interstate-light pole. 50 yds away (slowed down to 50 MPH - I noticed it was slowly hovering about 10MPH, so we didn’t see it was actually moving until we were close.  we could now see that it was far too large to be a light pole or drone, yet too small to be a plane or jet, to our knowledge. We continued asking the same question to each other.  We agreed about the sizing, glowing, hovering, and movement speed. I proclaimed, “I can’t identify that!”, nervously laughing.  I knew that this was important and wanted to pull over, but my passenger urged me to continue driving due to the coned off construction lane we were in.  We would have been stopped on the interstate with vehicles a mile behind us inbound. My background with this is that I’ve heard 2 stories of sightings, which came from pretty truthful sources. It always intrigued me and I was looking forward to it.  This excited/ perplexed me.  I was disappointed to not stop and take a fixated look at it.

I was probably around  4 to 6 years old in the mid 1960s.  I lived at the time with my grandparents.  My late grandfather was the Superintendent/Manager of CalTex Oil Refinery Depot in Lapu-Lapu City, Mactan Island, Cebu, Philippines.  Since renamed to new company name that took over years later.  The refinery complex had a family housing compound located at the end of the complex by the ocean facing the Mactan Channel also known as Opon Channel.  It was a one story house with a separate servant’s quarters.  Oil Cargo ships from around the world would dock at the refinery pier to deliver crude oil, which would be stored in the enormous tanks located on the other side of the complex opposite the house just behind the servant’s quarters. I do not remember what day it was, but could have been a Sunday, when I think the refinery did not operate full capacity.  I think it was after noontime and no later than 5pm.  I was usually left alone to amuse myself since it was assumed that I was safe because the complex was secured and guarded.  I don’t remember seeing the Security Personnel around that much though. I discovered one day that I could sneak in to where the huge oil holding tanks were. Climb to the top of one of the tanks unseen and hang out there.  I had a great view of the complex, ocean and also planes landing at the airport a few miles away that at the time of the Vietnam War was also a staging base for the US Air Force/Military. When my  UFO sighting happened, it was in Segments, Time Space in between.  It wasn’t one continuous thing.  This is what I remember: A.  	The UFO wasn’t huge, Dull chrome in color.  Maybe the size of a military tank?  It was in 3 or 4 circular sections/compartments. Large at the bottom then the smallest circular part at the top. It was stationary and hovered over the water, Silent,  No sound.  It had Green and Red flashing lights at the bottom section.  Maybe a pale gold light also. B.  	I see a Police, Coastguard or Military type Speedboat with 2 or 3 uniformed personnel in the boat.  I remember one possibly Caucasian man on the boat looking at me.  But it was completely silent also.  I don’t remember hearing anything as if I was deaf. C.	  I was back on top of the oil tank.  No UFO, No Speedboat, people, security, NOTHING.  Back to the sunny, cloudless late afternoon day. At the time even television was in its infancy in the Philippines.  I don’t even remember watching tv at that time or even if we had a tv.  Wasn’t into comic books.  Never heard of UFOs or Spacemen. Now, when I saw the UFO and the speedboat I could not have still been on top of the tank!  I had to be by the water, much closer.  The complex had major fencing around it.  I do not remember seeing all this thru a fence. Another odd thing separate from my UFO experience was very late at night when everyone was asleep I used to wake up because I could hear people outside of the house by my grandparent’s bedroom.  I slept in the same room as them sometimes.  They would be whispering and talking but not in the local Cebuano dialect but in English.  If it was the Security guards they would be speaking in Cebuano and not in American accented English???  That happened a few times but don’t remember if it was before or after my alleged UFO encounter.  Waking Dream, possibly?

If it was exo-atmosphere, it would have needed to be significantly faster, as it crossed the sky at a 45 degree angle, going away from us, going from very visible to distant, to out of sight in 4-5 seconds.

We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter See below original summary, but I thought about something today that is interesting Last night, the reason we saw this object in the first place, is because we were focused on an area of the sky, that had a flickering light, I had just told my wife, that is a satellite, not a star, because of the evident flicker, those are the solar panels….  We were using an app on my android phone called “Skyview” – this app shows all object in the sky including satellites, spent rockets etc…   The flickering light was stationary and Bright.  The Phone app did not recognize it, I tried to load update to the app, to see if it would then identify. Then, we saw the fast moving object, directly from same general location.  I stopped thinking about the flickering object, and am not certain if it remained…  I believe it did.  So I do not think the fast object was the original Flickering object… but small chance it was the same.  I am just not certain now, as I did not connect the 2 objects last night… only today did I think about the location and the possibility that they were in some way connected. Also, you said last night that there was a similar report from Arkansas, and also something reported West of Spokane.  I used Google Earth, and made a Pin Drop out West of Tampa over the Gulf.  Another West of Spokane, and noted that the line traverses directly over Arkansas.  (See attached) Let me know if you have any questions Also – What were the times the Arkansas and Spokane reported?  I believe mine was very close to 2300 EST ((END ADDENDUM))",2019-04-18T00:00:00,28.006814358108112,-82.47646101351351

I live with my mother, and she was preparing a birthday cake Friday night for my niece, who had a birthday party on Saturday.  We bagged up some kitchen garbage and I hauled it out to the dumpster behind our apartment late that night (approx. 11:45pm -- we're night owls). I happened to look up as an object flew in to my view from the west.  It crossed the sky in about four seconds, moving at incredible speed, faster than any airplane or jet I'd ever seen. It was close enough that I could vaguely make out the shape of something, but it was too dark and moving too quickly to make out definitive detail.  The only real piece of identification I could see was a single red light on the bottom of the object--it did not pulse, it did not blink, it was just a solid red light. It was too close to be a satellite, as it definitely had some kind of silhouette (but, again, too dark to tell what).  And it definitely was not a jet, drone or airplane, given this object did not make any sound.  It could have been some kind of glider, but it seemed to be moving way too fast for that to be a possibility. It traveled from the west (in the direction of Lake Tahoe), to the east (veering north-ish). About ten minutes later (11:58pm-ish), after I made my way back up to the apartment and told my Mom what I had seen, I had begun making a late night meal of a tuna sandwich.  As I began assembling the sandwich, the apartment was buzzed by a very low flying jet flying moving very quickly.  I did not see the jet, and I do not know which direction it was traveling, I just heard it roar over the top of the apartment.  It sounded like a rumbling gust of wind at first, but I heard it trail off in to the distance.  It probably rattled the windows it was flying so low and so fast. My 72 year old mother was in the bathroom at that time, on top of being hard of hearing, and did not hear this jet over the sound of the ventilation fan in the bathroom. A few minutes after that (12:02am-ish), another jet (or possibly the same jet) could be heard in the distance, though it did not approach the apartment anywhere near as closely.  My mother was present and did hear this. About an hour or two later, we had to run to the store to buy shredded coconut for the cake (as my Mom had forgotten to buy some earlier that day).  It was designated that I had to run in to the local Wal-mart to buy the coconut, as my Mom's hair was in curlers and she was too embarrassed to enter the store herself.  As I left the apartment parking lot, over the hills to the west again, I could have sworn I saw a dot of light shoot in to the sky at very high speed, like a meteor going straight up, but I am not sure if that was my eyes just laying tricks on me due to the excitement of seeing the other object earlier in the night.  It was very faint against the night sky. After going to sleep later that night (4-5am), I slept in to around noon the next day, and was awoken by a very similar jet flying over the apartment again, low enough that I physically felt my bed vibrate as it passed. I've maybe had five alcoholic drinks total in my 35 years on this earth, and three of those were at weddings I attended in 2015.  I haven't tasted alcohol at all in nearly two years.  I have never, ever done recreational drugs. This is the first time I've ever seen anything like this.  When I saw the objects in the sky, I was of sound mind and body, fully aware of my surroundings, and wide awake.",2019-04-18T00:00:00,39.16921421319797,-119.75176954314722

First, my wife woke me up because while out on a drive she noticed a bright light in the sky, similar to a star, but slightly brighter...this thing was moving back and forth, up and down, a figure 8, just erratic.  Not super fast usually, fairly subtle mostly to the point thay when I first looked I didn't notice. So, I blow it off and start talking and looked away and she insists I look again.  When I looked back it truly WAS moving erratically!  I could not think of any possible thing that would move like that.  As I stare in awe I begin to adjust my eyes and notice at least 6 other lights but these ones were slighter dimmer than the stars.  They were darting back and forth it seemed!  I pulled my phone out hoping I could use the zoom to see better what was going on.  My phone camera wouldn't pick up the stars or the dimmer lights I mentioned but clear as day you can see the larger light in the sky on the camera.  I have video.  Through the phone camera zoomed at 8x(max) it looked like it was spinning, like looking through glass, and pulsed every once in awhile which in the video seemed to make it disappear for a couple seconds every 15 seconds or so. It stayed in the sky for hours drifting slightly to a different spot of the sky over time and continually moving in unexplainable ways. If I had only seen this, as weird as it was, I would not report it.  However, while this was happening and we're staring at the sky at about a 45° angle, we witnessed something completely unexplainable and in my mind worth reporting. The sky seemed to have gotten darker out of nowhere...we both felt ""weird"" and hard to explain but it felt like a void, and a temporary breathlessness.  I had the urge to look up because it looked like something was going to fall on us. It appeared of nowhere and I almost wanted to move out of the way.  Then it just floated there for a second like a blimp flying.  It looked like 5 engines or cylinders all attached and white or silver in the shape of a V.  It didn't make a sound and was either car sized or jet sized. It was hard to tell how far up it was because it was so fast and scary.  It honestly was more like an absence of sound and then it took off at unprecedented speed after gliding or hovering for 5 seconds or so. Our best guess as crazy as I know it sounds...is that a portal opened up and a ship came through.  I had chills.  I would have never heard it if I hadn't seen it and wouldn't have been looking without seeing the star looking ufo's so I feel like it must be connected but idk.  I just don't want to feel like i'm crazy so I need to report it.  My wife saw all the same stuff and felt the same way at the moment that this ufo appeared.

"Black oval object in sky flashing blue lights that ""winked-out"" followed by a circling jet and then three helicopters.",Oklahoma City,OK,2019-04-19T17:35:00,oval,30 seconds,"Occurred : 4/19/2019 17:35  (Entered as : 04/19/2019 17:35) Reported: 4/20/2019 7:36:42 PM 19:36 Posted: 4/25/2019 Location: Oklahoma City, OK Shape: Oval Duration:30 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/145/S145759.html,"Black oval object in sky flashing blue lights that ""winked-out"" followed by a circling jet and then three helicopters. My son and I were playing tennis at Memorial Park (1150 NW 36th St, Oklahoma City, OK 73118) on April 19th, 2019.  It is an azure blue, cloudless sky with light north winds and was approximately 67 degrees Fahrenheit.  My son was on the south side of the court facing north and I was on the north side facing south, and the sun is directly to the west of us at about 60 degrees.  I’ve included a Google Earth Map image of our line-of-sight (UAP-1.png). Off to my left side (southeast) in the background right above the tree line at about 40 degrees (the tree line is roughly 250-300 feet from us), I see a bright blue flash and look in that direction (UAP-2.png).  My first thought is that someone let go of a blue Mylar helium balloon, and that I’m seeing the sun’s light reflecting off the surface.  I point at it and tell my son exactly that.  It moves from east to west (left to right from my viewpoint) and passed behind the trees so he doesn’t see it at first.  He backs up to the net as I move up to it and point in the direction.  I tell him it’s about to pop up from behind the tree and it does.  Only this time it has moved closer (at about 45 degrees) and is a black oval with two intermittent synced blue flashing lights on either side.  It stops moving in the sky (UAP-3.png).  Movement from point to point was approximately 12 seconds. So now we think we are looking at a drone, but it is really way up in the sky, and doesn’t have aircraft navigation lights of red and green, just the dark, but bright blue similar in color to Dell computer system lights.  The blue is darker than the blue sky but also brighter than the sky when they flash.  It stops directly above the trees (but not actually above the tree because it is obviously way in the background behind it). Then it flashes brighter than any of the other times and it winks out and disappears (UAP-4.png).  My son says, “Where did it go?” Puzzled by how a drone could just disappear, I pull out my phone and note the time.  It’s 5:37 PM CST.  We continue searching the sky for about another twenty seconds.  Granted, from the time I saw the first flash and it disappeared was only about thirty seconds.  So almost a full minute from the first sighting, at 5:38 PM CST, a jet races from the east to west on about the same plane as the object and makes a bank toward us going north and flies a loop right around where the object disappeared so that it ended up flying back to the east in the same direction it had come from.  The plane was high enough that I could not make out what it was or how many engines it had.  It was too fast for a prop plane.  The plane itself actually gave us perspective the size of the oval.  At first when we thought it was a drone, I was thinking that it was two or three feet across.  However, after seeing the jet in the same place in the sky, the oval had to be the size of a car because it was s! lightly smaller than the jet.  The jet leaves the same way it came (UAP-5.png). We realize that with all the people at the park playing tennis and basketball around us, we are the only ones to witness this in the sky.  We keep watching the sky to the southeast.  At 5:43 PM CST, directly behind us coming from the northwest, a low flying red with white trim helicopter (300 or 400 hundred feet above us) races overhead in the same direction as where the oval disappeared (UAP-6.png).  It moved so fast that it cleared us and was gone in about three seconds.  Fast enough that we could not make out what was written on it.  The only two helicopters that I’m familiar with in this area that are that color are a news channel helicopter and the med-flight helicopters used by hospitals. At 5:51 PM CST, a second helicopter, one farther west of us, also flies to the southeast in the direction where the oval disappeared.  This one is the KFOR Channel 4 News helicopter.  I can read it clearly on the side and it takes about ten seconds for it to come into view and cross the sky out of view heading southeast. At 5:55 PM CST, a third helicopter, this one’s way farther east of us and heads to the southeast in the same direction as the others.  This one is black with red trim, but is too far away to make out who it belongs to. As each incident occurred, I noted the time, descriptions, and directions.  I did not get any photographs as everything happened so quickly, but I logged it all in my phone to refer back to later.  It could be completely coincidence and that none of this is connected.  I could not find out any info regarding why these choppers were heading where they were going.  There was no stormy weather for storm chasing. I have included drawings where I have recreated to the best of my knowledge keeping the proportions as close as I remember them to be. The resolution is high enough that you can zoom in on the areas and see the details and colorings of the object. As a side note, Tinker Air Force Base is in Midwest City and in the vicinity southeast of Memorial Park in Oklahoma City about 15 miles away.  My guess is that what we saw was even farther south than the military base.  Will Rogers Airport is in Oklahoma City and is southwest of Memorial Park by ten or so miles.  Having said that, we are used to seeing all kinds of planes coming and going all the time, and even the occasional drone.  I don’t know what this was.  I’m not calling this a UFO, through it certainly is an UAP to me.",2019-04-25T00:00:00,35.47186177914111,-97.52630349693251

The object was extremely far away, but we were able to see every color.  At one point a plane flew under the object and we were able to see how large it was in comparison.  It was at least two or three times the size of the aircraft.  The object ended up hovering for over an hour that we saw.  At one point the object dipped down and we noticed a smaller object below it that was similar.  When the larger object reached the smaller one, all of the sudden the smaller object disappeared.  We then noticed a large plane that flew under the large object flying North. The large object then suddenly disappeared.

On the other side of the river was an old abandoned cornfield that had not been used in years.  The old cornfield is surrounded by large oak and maple trees that probably top out at 60-100’ tall. As I was driving down the hill, I noticed several huge very bright lights hovering over the treetops across the river above the cornfield. At the time I was 18 and about to graduate high school, so I was pretty naive and did not really understand as to why the lights were there.   My first thought was maybe a stadium was being built because the lights resembled the large lights that sit on top of towers above football fields.   There must have been well over a half dozen of these large bright lights. I went inside ((male name deleted)) apartment and an I asked ((male name deleted)) what was being built over in the cornfield, he said nothing and kind of laughed it off saying there is nothing back there expect dirt and mud. Within a few minutes of arriving, we left ((male name deleted)) apartment and drove back up the hill.  The lights were no longer over the treetops: however, we did see high up in the sky a separation of clouds, and an enormous red halo, which looked like something passed through.   Just below this separation and the halo were several aircraft that seemed to be circling the area or investigating what was once there.   The cloud separation and red halo disappeared as we drove up the hill. One weird thing about this sighing was that there was no reason for any lights to be in the cornfield and there was no real way to get anything back into the cornfield easily and there were airplanes flying around but the airplanes were considerably smaller than the red lights I saw.    This sighting led me to believe in UFO’s for most of my adult life, but today I do not believe in them: however,  I can not explain what I saw that night, and it baffles me to some 28 years later.

It was very sunny at the time with puffy cumulus clouds.  I was in a rural area in the Big Bend or bending part of the west coast going up into the Panhandle area on US 19.  I was excited, as I had intuition that I would land the job, and just slightly nervous.  I looked to the left where there was a brightly lit field where the sun had just broken through a cloud.  Very shortly thereafter, I looked to the left again and saw a very unusual sight. In the same cloud group where the sun had broken through, with rays gleaming down, was another large beam of the same white/gold light.  I puzzled over this as there is only one sun. The beams were equally strong as the sun's.  Although I was not concerned about what I was seeing-just very interested, I was worried about some government person or people seeing me notice this, as I was going into a government job.  Not a job classified as important, but one where I would be working around important people.  So, I casually pulled off the road, not braking hard, but as if I had to consult a map or something.  There was very little traffic.  Possibly no other cars for several minutes. I peeked out of my window and looked towards the phenomena, but what I saw instead was a huge charcoal or steel colored craft overhead that looked like it was made of cast iron.  It seemed to have a central area where the beam might have come from.  The surface was rough but I didn't see too much detail.  It was right overhead, and I may have stepped out of the car.  The light changed very quickly as the sun set, and I could not see it any longer. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2019-01-11T00:00:00,,

Well tonight is a crystal clear night, hardly any aircraft out right now and I see that same light hovering behind the trees, so I watch it with my binoculars and it slowly starts moving out from the trees and its orange, blinking quickly.  Suddenly once I had full view it started blinking a weird pattern of green and red, and moved to the east of me behind a building.  5 minutes later with no view of it I see a very bright light approaching me super slowly at tree top level, it flew right above me as slow as an aircraft can go I assume, and it was a triangle.  It had a red and green flashing light, and then a light at each corner and it almost looked Transparent, if all lights were off you wouldn't be able to see it.

I went outside to bring my dog in before leaving for work.  It was cold, mid to high 20’s. It was still dark. The sky was crystal clear. I do not wear / need corrective lenses.  I live in a quiet, dark, rural area.  A light in the sky (about 36 degrees up) caught my attention as I was facing straight north.  It was moving too fast, too low, and was too bright to be something (like a plane) that I could look away from.  My first view picked it up at approx. Maple Valley HWY 169 & Cedar Grove Road intersection (1.04 miles north of me).  It traveled from Cedar Grove/169 to the north side of Tiger Mountain in 8 to 10 seconds.  This is about a 5 mile distance in a straight line. 5 miles travel in let’s say 9 seconds = 2000 MPH.  This is why it caught my eye, and I couldn’t look away.  It had no craft shape that I could decipher.  It was simply a bright, round white light about the size of a quarter.  It had no trail.  No colored lights.  It did not make a sound.  It never wavered in altitude, and it appeared to travel in a straight line with the horizon until I lost  visual with it.  This may sound strange, but it traveled with a purpose. The best visual of the object I could give you was if you could grab a star from the sky and pull it down to about 6000 feet.  That’s exactly what it looked like. I’ve emailed a drawing showing how I came to my guess on the objects altitude.   I used the “Skyview” App to locate the objects approx. degree in height.  I looked at an area map and set a ruler on what I believed to be the line of travel.  If it had continued on its path over the North part of Tiger Mountain it would have passed very close over Fall City, WA.  It then would have looked to cross directly over the city of Carnation, WA.  I posted my experience on social media to see if anyone else in the area saw this object.  I have had no success so far.  I’m sharing this because it ! was not a plane, or a drone.  It was not a satellite.  It wasn’t! a meteo r, or a shooting star.  I’ve seen all of those things a million times.  I was just lucky yesterday morning.",2019-03-14T00:00:00,47.4061,-121.9953

The sky was clear & bright blue with some high-level haze and thin high-altitude clouds.  The temperature was about 35 Deg F. At roughly 1624 hrs, I noticed a bright orb-like light or object appear to my right at 75* elevation, moving from right to left.  Speed was moderate.  As the orb moved, it slowed considerably, almost to a stop, seemed to emit or discharge some type of liquid or mist that dissipated in the atmosphere, continued for another couple of seconds before it abruptly faded from view.  The liquid or mist was not a flare or fireball.  Before fading, I quickly lifted and pointed my camera without using the viewfinder and took some photos in the general direction of the object.  The orb did not leave a contrail like an airplane or make any sound/engine noise.  I continued observing the sky and taking pictures of airplanes. Then, around 1700 Hrs, as I was facing due west, I noticed the same (or similar looking) glowing orb again suddenly appear in my line of vision, 30* elevation, moving straight down before fading away.  There was no contrail or noise. I again quickly raised my camera and took some shots as it was moving downward, thinking I might catch something. Later, while reviewing my pictures, I discovered that I had managed to capture a total of four photos showing what seem to be the objects, two from the first sighting, and two from the second. I am an Army vet, and I am quite familiar aircraft recognition.  I have also been observing aircraft with my photography for about a year now.  I am quite familiar with how airliners, drones, helicopters, birds, stars, planets, meteors and errant mylar balloons look, in life and in my photos.  I can say, with all the sincerity that I have, that the objects I observed were none of these.  I do not know what they were, but they were highly unusual.

Disappeared in 2 min. I woke up around 3 a.m. and looked out to see if it was still snowing.  I saw a bright light in the western sky.  I first thought it was a bright star or planet.  Then I realized it was moving very slowly.  The light was clear, and not pulsating.  That’s when I realized the object was triangular in shape, heading from the north to the south.  By the time I realized what I was seeing it vanished.  After daylight I looked towards the area where I had seen the object.  It had been heading towards and behind a large electrical power pole.  When it disappeared, I first thought it had moved behind one of the nearby hills.  In daylight, I realized there were no hills it could have gone behind.  Just bare trees, through which you could have still seen the light.  I told my husband about this later in the morning.  He didn’t think it odd, because he’s said for years that he sometimes saw strange objects in the sky when he worked 3rd shift at a gas station in his teens and twenties. Just so you know, this isn’t the first time I’ve seen a UFO.  When I was in high school back in 1966-1967, I was practicing with the marching band on the football field after school in broad daylight.  All of a sudden, a cigar-shaped object floated across the sky at nearly tree top level.  The band member next to me saw this, too.  Both of us stopped and stared at it while the rest of the band made a left turn and continued marching west.  This object was in the eastern sky heading west.  Again, it just vanished after about a minute.  Neither one of us spoke to each other about this, but we both had shocked looks.  A few months later, someone from Project Blue Book was on KMOX radio, and asked for people to call a secure line if they wanted to report something unusual that they had seen.  My mom called, and a representative came to our house and took my statement. I’ve lived by airports my whole life, so I’m well aware how planes and helicopters appear in the night sky.

I consider it a blessing to be a witness of something so detailed and incredibly amazing. the aliens, interdimensional beings, FBI drones or CIA spying on me all are a definite possibility but I checked the constellations via a new app on my phone and I have a live feed of international space station.  The ships continued to move every time I would focus on them so I switched to AutoFocus attached a fish eye lens and military grade binocular app to my camera. Both my Nikon 5500 and my galaxy S9.  I got a glimpse of 20 different ships.  Triangular craft with 3 spotlights (blue) a fireball ship hovering low in the forest. I have seen to black helicopters during day and two dogs went missing. I found ! a field where they are hovering above taped off by swim team finish line rope and yellow tape.  A random crate was discovered by me and my cousin (huge shipping container) with secret society occult written all over the unit.  Triangle logos dated in 1800 something.  It said lumber 2015. Msde no sense.  We found wiccan esque area of occult materials and the following night I drove past a hooded gathering of cloaked people at 4am by a bonfire in the rain. Feb 25th I saw more vivid lights and got a telescope zoom lens which allowed me to capture the saucer and prove the light was some sort of spaceship or drone spinning.  They hover NW and are also close to mirzam under canis major left and down from Orion's belt.  The animals all start barking and I had made direct contact with the aliens or interdimensional beings or angelic creatures (whatever they are) via UHF device and I also have a device that can pick up low frequencies. I bought a thermal sensor lens for camera to detect heat signatures. March 1st - last night I discovered the entities and spacecraft are only visible to those with their third eye open. My mom can see it after I film it but she is programmed to think the existence of aliens is some x-files shit. Whatever these UFO orbs are they all the way visible from exit 154 by sheetz cookout and the field is near mebane oaks road. I have contacted the town and no military exercises were happening. Also I was vocal about sightings at first and white Vans (literally like the show stranger things are looking at me and watching my moves) too bad I'm an expert at evading shadow government paid thugs.

You can’t see it from any roads or homesteads.  Unless you are local, you wouldn’t even know it’s back there.  It had gotten dark and the dog was still swimming and playing so I just threw in a catfish line, and we just stood side by side quietly just looking out over the pond.   It was a beautiful night when we heard the strangest noise.  It kinda makes my hair stand on end just typing this.  Something came from behind us moving really fast, and it was gone as quick as it came.  It kind of sounded like a oversized bottle rocket, or a big arrow that was spinning making like a quick “ssshush” sound.  I half thought something was going to blow up in front of me, and looked for some sort of smoke trail but there was nothing.  The water didn’t even ripple.  I turned to her and almost in sink we both said, “what ((words deleted)) was that?”  I’ve lived around here my whole life, spent time out in the sticks a lot and never heard anything like that.   I half expected someone to be playing a trick on us but there was no one within miles, I pulled out my spot like in the truck and couldn’t see a thing.  We both were kinda freaked out at that point so we grabbed the dog and took off.  I didn’t tell many people this, and the ones I did reacted about like I would.  They just laughed and said we were hearing things.  Also, we weren’t drinking, no drugs, nothing to alter our minds.

Dear Sir/Madam, thanks to give me the opportunity to share this experience.  I do not mind to put my name or contact, btw.   I was sleeping in my bed at night, I opened my eyes and saw some shining stars on top of my feet which were covered inside the bed.  I went closer to see what it was, and just one of them was flying towards me, at a  very slow peace (sic.  pace).  It was a very small UFO - disk-shaped- with holes on the sides, making amazing colours (inside the disk there was one wheel going the opposite way the disk was going).  It was going slow and showed off all the colours which were mostly pinky, a vivid full colour pink.  I was not scared and I was happy to tell this to friends and family.  Obviously, my friends had different views about it.  I can surely tell you that this disk, - U.F.O disk-  wanted to BE SEEN.  It looked to me like an old UFO because it was going too slow.  But there was no one inside it, there was no alien inside the saucer, the saucer was going by itself.  The saucer was big like a BEAN, I never imagined that an UFO can be so tiny!  I have enjoyed this experience.  I never thought about UFO in all my life and I utterly enjoyed it cause it was a good sensation and I was happy to have seen it.  I would like to receive an email, if possible, but in any case, no one knows for sure what it was.  Unless someone has experienced what I have experienced.  Just to remind:  the saucer was tiny like a bean.  Have no made photos cause I did not think something like that was passing through my room when sleeping.

Strangely, overtones of interference were heard even though the default Voice Memos app shouldn’t have been transmitting or receiving the sound data being recorded.  It was clear that the interference was correlated to the microphone input, and moving the device around the speaker produced feedback sounds in the amplifier.  This seemed impossible and was evidence that the phone was in-fact transmitting data that it “should not have” been transmitting as the musician assumed the data recorded, stored, or played-back his Voice Memo application was protected. With the phone in the direct center of the speaker, he heard a ringing in his ears and was a bit confused – and had reason to believe this possibly caused an accidental distortion of spacetime itself.  Note this point:  He listened to an analog recording of the same moment, then walked outside to listen to it on his cell phone.  He noted the numerical number of the recording, and was surprised to hear that there were obvious time-domain distortions with the recording, and the pitch of the notes was shifted significantly and warbling in places.  He didn’t imagine that the crystal-clock in the phone would be affected by the speaker, and was beginning to think that he had captured evidence of true time distortion. As he was outside listening, he noticed that the dogs were barking more frantically, and that the weather was changing rapidly – almost instantaneously.  As the wind got more violent, bugs began flying upward and leaves and small particles also began levitating or moving toward a general direction.  It really seemed to him that an immense force of gravity was pulling everything towards a point in the sky, and there was a loud electromechanical buzz which sounded like two separate electric motors.  Suddenly, a spinning saucer craft about 13-17 ft in diameter with a slowly revolving outer sheet-metal body appeared out of the very spot his eye was drawn to, and it swooped down to land a street or two over.  He felt the electromagnetic sounds through his feet as the device landed, and fled from the scene, leaving his phone. After returning some days later, he noticed that the recording he heard the time-distortion effects had been replaced with a recording that started at “note this point.”  And had “continued” recording for over 7 hours, complete with the sounds of the craft captured and the sounds of him running through and locking his house even though he was not recording anything at the time.  Except that the “playback” of the time distortion had been flipped out of phase and edited from this altered, replacement recording.  He heard strange sounds on the radio as well.

Possible anti gravity propulsion system.,Reno,NV,1994-07-15T03:00:00,unknown,30 minutes,"Occurred : 7/15/1994 03:00  (Entered as : 7/15/1994 3:00) Reported: 3/24/2019 9:01:17 AM 09:01 Posted: 3/29/2019 Location: Reno, NV Shape: Unknown Duration:30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/145/S145338.html,"Possible anti gravity propulsion system. First Reporting date: 9/24/1998 Reported to: Art Bell on Coast to Coast Show by fax. I would like to take this opportunity to report a possible Unidentified Flying Object [UFO]and share some insight into the greenish and while lights that are being seen in the sky. Five years ago, in 1993, I had a very close encounter or you could refer to it as a standoff with an Unidentified Flying Object [UFO] in the Reno, Nevada, area.  Excuse my pun, but I may be able to shed some light on the subject of UFO’s.  I cannot tell you exactly what it was, but I can tell you that it was not a fixed wing or helicopter that was currently known to the general public and there for unidentified. My military background includes an active duty tour in the U.S Air Force as an Aircraft Maintenance Specialist on F-111’s and other tactical fighter aircraft and over 20 years as a Security Forces Specialist and Supervisor.  I have extensive experience in Search and Rescue Air Support with both fixed wing and military helicopters. In this particular incident, I was working as a Sheriff’s Deputy on swing shift and had worked overtime until around 0300 hrs. in the morning.  I changed into my street clothing and put my Glock 9mm in my pancake style holster on my pants belt and put another magazine into my rear pocket.  I got into my Chevy 4x4 pickup truck and headed Northbound on highway 395 and to my residence in the Cold Springs Valley area near the Nevada/California boarder. At about 0330 hours, I crested a hill on Hwy. 395 at started to drop down in elevation towards the Cold Springs Valley.  I observed a bright white circular light moving back and forth across the base of Pevine Mountain near the Southbound lanes of Highway 395, which is several miles from the old Crystal Peak Mine access road. The area is about 5400 feet in elevation and the white light looked to be about 150 feet, above ground level or AGL.  At first, I thought that it might have been a Nevada Army National Guard OH-58 helicopter with a search light mounted on it, although I did not remember one on any of the aircraft I had flew on during search and rescue.  I did not see any formation lights, not strobes or anti-collision lights. At the bottom of the hill, I took the exit and pulled up to the stop sign. I sat there for a couple of minutes.  I shut my engine and lights off to listen to the sound of the main roto blades and did not hear anything.  The intensity of the bright light did not change as the object moved in a circular pattern and a nose mounted searchlight or a side mounted searchlight would have varied in intensity as the nose of the helicopter turned. I watched the bright light for about 3-4 minutes, before restarting my truck and turning on to Cold Springs Drive to drive around the dry lake bed.  While driving around the lake bed, I thought that another vehicle was catching up to me, as I would see some light and then it was gone.  After driving around the lake bed, I turned onto Brant Street and drove about 2 and half miles to my residence. As I pulled into my driveway and got out of my truck, I noticed that the very bright light was traveling along Brant Street at about 150 feet above the roadway towards my position. I moved out into the middle of the culdesac where it was dark and just stood there to try to get a glimpse of what type aircraft it was.  The nearest street light was about half a block away, so I felt a little safe in the dark.  My first thought was, ""Great, the object followed me home."" The object was moving about 15-20 miles per hour and maintaining about 150-200 feet AGL.  I attempted to observe the outline of the object, but the brightness of the white light prevented it, and the intensity was much brighter that a searchlight that can be mounted on helicopters.  The light seemed to form a round disk type area about 100 ft. in diameter and was the only outline to judge the size of the object.  The object stopped moving towards me and remained stationary in the air with no main rotor blade or tail rotor noise. I was able to observe that there was a greenish hue to the white light emitting from the bottom of the object and said in a loud voice, “Oh, so that light is actually a low attitude propulsion system”.  I was surprised when the object moved sideways about 15 feet, as if answering the question. I got the feeling that I was being observed by a FLIR system- Forward Looking Infrared Radar.  I decided to wait this situation out, as I did not want to identify my house with a sleeping family. I was having a standoff with an UFO and I was thinking to myself, I bet they never abducted a cop with a Glock before and reached down and padded my Glock on my hip. I was hoping that the object would cross over me or move past me slowly, so I could get a look at the underside of the object.  The object maintained a silent hover for about 15 minutes as I stood still.  After about another five minutes, I decided to press the issue and threw up my hands and said very loudly, ”Well, what are you going do, do something”. The white light underneath the object became a greenish/ white color, with what looked like greenish water droplets as big as silver dollars spitting out the bottom for about 10 to 15 feet.  Then the greenish, white light shot straight up into the sky and was gone in about three seconds. I hung around for about another five minutes expecting the object to return since we were so close, but the object did not return and I searched the sky and did not see anything except the stars. I had feeling at the time that the object that followed me home may have been a either a Black Project from the Southern Desert area, or just a UFO. I did not mention the incident to anyone at the time as it would not have been politically incorrect to do so and could have been detrimental to my law enforcement carrier.",2019-03-29T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

So only I can see above the roof and sky but they can’t.  As we playing card I decided to look up the sky.  Suddenly a space ship flew fast and quietly down the sky and came to sit on top of the tree next to the roof.  First I thought it was strange and amazing at the same time. Amazing part was I the only one saw it and I didn’t want to scare my friend them and kept to myself.  So as I saw it coming down clearly it was amazing how fast it was and how it can change it space ship to camouflage that fit the shadow of the tree.  So if a person don’t pay attention you will never know it’s sitting up there.  I was thinking to myself that it might be watching me.  So I make it seem like i didn’t see it but my eye was on it the whole time.   Looking at the same spot it landed in the dark.  I cannot! see it after it landed but I waited and keeping my eyes rolling up on it.  When it’s ready to flew off it lights went around it space ship and it lift itself two three feet above the tree before it flew into the sky and disappeared within 5 sec.

Left daughter's house in Burghfield, heading for Tilehurst home.  Early morning between 6.30am to 7.30am.  As we approached church lane, I glanced out at the trees on my side of the van we were in.  There are bad bends in the road at this point, and ... my wife screamed out, ""WATCH OUT"" hit brakes just managed to stop before going into ditch on my left,"" whats wrong with you?"" she said by this time I was looking straight ahead afraid to look again without her confirmation, ""have a look out my side window ,  What does it look like "" I said "" a spaceship"" was her answer drove the van up the road a bit to get a better look, stopped the van and I got out of it to get a better view.  WOW PWEW from being scared to death one minute to amazement in heart if thats the feeling, felt privaliged, felt as if i was gifted to see such an event, this craft was hovering over a field no more than 50 yards away about 200 feet in the air it was 100--200 yards across 30 yards deep, looked Saturn-like in shape.  Had a set of windows running through the middle all different colours, looked as if they were flashing but maybe it was the rushing thunderous clouds inside the craft that gave this impression.  The clouds were all small but were different shades, and they looked as if they were thundery, rushing through the ship.  It was at this point I decided to tell myself to remember every detail as I was seeing something that was going to get investigated and my information could be of grea! t signifficance.  We watch it for about eight minutes or so.  The ship moved off in an arc shape to our left going up as it moved, its path took it straight over the Atomic research base 500 yards away, then it went parrallel to the M4 motorway towards London, here is where we lost sight of the ship, it disappeard out of our sight (to far off to see) I drove up the road 500 yards and parked the van to see it thier was any thing that I could add to this ufo sighting, YES the weather it was a bright morning dont think I saw the sun up yet but it was bright morning the best sky I've ever seen all light blue not a cloud in the sky anywhere.  Nothing not even a planes energy trail.  But thier was two other objects in the sky, the moon looking like this (in shape although tilted more, under this moon I saw a star shining as bright as any flickering quite large for a star i thought maybe its the space station, the star or space station was just below it about a quarter of an inch between your fingers looking up at it, remembering all the events of that day was going to be easy, or so I thought, we told our family first about the sighting and some were sceptic and others laughed, three days later there was a news article asking if anyone had seen any ufos lately, I was exspecting the press to be full of this sighting but thier was none, it was then I felt as if we were being tested for our integrity or our abilty to be trusted wierd feeling, did nothing about it for 4 years or so, something triggered off my wondering why? Started reading up about ufo sighting and people near where I live who I could ask some questions, and I told him all I told you, then he asked me what day it was? forgot the date ? couldn t remember the date ? for over two years couldn't nail down the date? nightmare?  then the other week I ask my wife to see when our passports run out? keeps them in a draw with other things birth certificates, insurancecs, etc, she came down the stairs with a piece of paper torn off dated 11th september 2004 and she had written on it SPACEDAY, brilliant as so i thought, easy now to find evidence?  EVIDENCE OF THE SPACESHIP?  So easy, no chance, (1) M4 motorway cams must have recorded it, the traffic police, and the BBC, have access to these road cams, no reply?  (2) weather photos of that morning sky again BBC and weather stations have this evidence no reply? (3) Google earth must have evidence of the spaceship that day where is it? no reply?  (4) M.O.D Base has twenty or more cameras that could have recorded its flight? Researchers the police, google earth, weather cam sites, mod, all got this evidence? can t belive theres no evidence other than our sighting? also how amazing it is that nobody has come forward with evidence of seeing these webb cams, vidio evidence, yet hundreds of people would have seen them, the cover up of this sighting is more unbeliveable to me than the actuaul sighting, UFO researches cant find the vid evidence of this sighting? why?  hundreds of people must have seen this evidence yet nobody has come forward? I'm not trying to sell magazines or vidieos, or badges or books,  and I dont tell lies, what we saw was there plain to see, UFO RESEARCHERS, LOL, no such thing, more chance of seeing a spaceship powered by cloud energy than finding a REAL UFO researcher, HOPE YOUR THE REAL UFO RESEARCHER THIS SIGHTING REQUIRES",2019-01-11T00:00:00,,

What I saw was not my normal.  This occurred in the early morning hours of 8/13/2018 at about 3:40 a.m.  I had awoken about 3:00 a.m. and decided to go out on my deck in the backyard to see if I could observe the Perseid meteor showers, even though I was in the brighter city limits. Constantly looking straight up to the sky, I had been outside about 40 minutes when I had the pleasure of seeing two meteors.  I was about to call it good and go inside when I glimpsed a very intense bright white light coming over the roof line to my south.  My first thought was jokingly ""Oh, this ought to be a great meteor,"" and then my mind instantly realized, of course, it better not be a meteor!   In the seconds I had this thought and was still looking up at the white brightness increasing and moving over the roof line, I saw an equilateral triangle shape of 6 round-shaped white lights arranged in 3 rows (one in leading front, two in next row and three in last row) - no pulsating or different colors.  It appeared to be a set of 6 lights moving in perfect formation and unity; I could not see an outline of a structure or frame that contained the lights but I had the sense the ‘edges’ were rounded and not sharp. I could not see the top of the craft, I only saw it from underneath so I don't know if there was a dome or viewing window(s).  I guesstimated the size around 9-10 feet. It moved slowly over the space above me at a level and steady pace, making no noise, and moving from the south to the north near the tree line - which I later estimated to be about 100 feet high. It did not light up the ground area which remained dark.  The entire event took about 10-12 seconds before I could no longer track it due to it disappearing through the trees in the yard.  My thought was ""what the heck was that?""  I stayed outside for about 5 more minutes before going inside as I started feeling a little uneasy.

I have no reason not to believe my friend because he thinks I’m crazy that I have had many ghost experiences and he has often teased me about it in the past. 	It started as he was restless one night and could not go back to sleep.  So at about 1:am in the morning, he went outside his cabin nestled in the mountains just on the southern outskirts of Glacier National Park in Montana to smoke a cigerette.  As he gazed up into the sky he watched what he first thought was a planet in the sky which would brighten and dim off on and on.  But it was’nt until he was finishing his cigerette when he glanced up on a mountain across the river that he noticed a white light.  At first he thought ‘why is there a hiker with a headlamp hiking at 1:am in the morning’.  Then he noticed off in the distance about 2 miles away where he saw another orange light.  It was then that he looked around and noticed about a total of 10 lights scattered throughout the forest, hills and mountains.  He then realized that these lights were communicating with this light above him that he thought was a star or a planet.  He said such a bad feeling came over him that he went i! nside his cabin and locked the door. 	About a week later he was talking to a girl that lived in the cabin about 100 yards from him, and she said that on that same night that she had this horrible feeling come over her that she decided to lock there door. 	My friend has tried many times to reason with this event.  Was it a car reflection in the distance that lit up the mountains?  For some reason was a secret military training drill going on with soldiers in the mountains at 1:am in the morning?  What could this have been?  But when he talks about the feeling that came over him and his neighbor as well as the light in the sky communicating with the ground lights, he tends to believe this to be the strangest and unexplained.

As we were walking, we reached an area void of streetlights (near E 4th St and Oregon Ave) and my friend was trying to find some constellations.  As he was looking, he exclaimed, ""Dude! Look.""  I looked up just in time to see a triangular shaped craft with three lights fly silently and quickly over our heads and across the sky before flying off into the distance, heading South-West. There were no trees, so we both got a clear view of the craft.  Neither of us were certain how large or how high the object was, but it appeared perhaps around 250 feet in the air and around 20 feet long.  It flew fast enough that we were only able to watch it for around 5 seconds.  We were both confident the object was some sort of UFO.",2019-04-25T00:00:00,45.586,-95.9544

Along their way home she continued watching them, and about 15-20 minutes later when they arrived home in Sissonville, WV, they came straight up to our home and they said, dad, you’ve got to come outside and see this, and I said, why, and my son said, just come outside. I said, ok what the heck! So, I went outside on my front porch and said, now, what is it that you want me to see? They said, come out into the yard. So, curious as hell as I was, I walked down int the front of my house and started gazing into the shy. I saw nothing, and then we walked back a few more feet in the fron! t of my house and then,they said look, look straight up and I did.  At first I didn’t see anything, probably because my eyes wasn’t focused yet. And then, I saw a light, then 2 light, and then 3.  All 3 were in a triangular formation. And then they said, dad, look there are more.  I looked, and yes I seen more coming behind the first three again in some form of a triangle. I thought, DAMN, WTF???!!!! WHATTHE HELL??!!  We continued watching and here came about 3 or 4 more, and then a few more, and a few more, we again continued watching, and they just kept coming.  The direction was coming from North West to West in an orderly fashion. It definitely was not a meteor or stars because they continued on in formation and faster than a jet. I live about 12-15 miles from the Charleston, WV, Yeager airport on a mountain and I see jets all day long, but never have I seen more than 3 or 4 in the sky at the same time. Well, we kept on watching, and they kept on coming.  All heading from NW TO W direction.  By the time I seen the last one, there must hav! e been 5 0 or more.  After I seen the last one, I went in to our home and tuned in to ALL of the News stations, thinking that there may be some kind of a terrorist attack or whatever. So, I checked each and every outlet that I could, even local, but NOTHING. Called my oldest brother Danny, and told him about it and then he told my other brother about it, and about a half hour later they group face timed me and wanted to know all about it. Well, I told them exactly what I just typed, and they were like, WOW!!! They said, you might want to report this to MUFON or to you, I said, they aren’t going to take it seriously. But, they continued to harp on it that I should atleast report it. So, I am, and if you’d be interested in checking this situation out here in Charleston, WV  out, than do as you may. I’d be very interested in ANYTHING that you would possibly find out about it!  I don’t have a cell phone right now that is active, but if you’d like to reach me, then you can call my brother !

My “UFO” sighting occurred on the early morning of September 18, 1991, while on Jekyll Island, Georgia, in an Atlantic Ocean front motel room by myself.  I was there as an employee of the United States Customs Service attending a supervisors' training class with a co-worker.   On the morning of Sept. 18, 1991, at 3:00 a.m., I woke up wide awake, so I went out onto the balcony overlooking the ocean.  The sky was partly cloudy with moonlight illuminating the clouds and waves.  I didn’t see the moon as it likely was on the other side of the building out of my view.  The hotel building or my room was situated so the at ocean view was looking south down the beach not directly viewing the ocean.   Within a minute standing there on the balcony, I saw a very fast flying whitish (similar shade or brightness as the moon would be) oval shaped fuzzy not sharp edged light about the size of a 1/4 full moon (LARGE!) - flying overhead very fast (above the clouds) over the hotel building! from north to south down the coast (disappearing within 3-4 seconds).  It didn't make any noise that I could hear.   About a minute later I saw another one exactly the same flying the same trajectory down the coast.  Then about a minute later I saw another one (or at the time I was thinking it might just be a satellite going around the Earth, but it was too big and too fast from other satellites I’ve seen...).   Then I saw two of these lights flying side by side in formation and knew it wasn't the same one I had been seeing.  Then one zig - zagged and others were flying slightly different trajectories all from north to south down the ocean coast.  All were the same size and brightness, going the same speed and making no noise at all.  In those 15 minutes between 3:00 and 3:15, I saw 10 of these ""lights"".    My theory is the bottom of the “crafts” were being illuminated by the sun beams which had not yet made it to the east coast in other words there were no lights on the crafts, it looked more like reflected light.  If someone could model that, the size and distance and speed of these crafts could be calculated.  These things were not man-made… they were too big and far too fast for humans to have created them. I never saw anything in the newspaper or on TV about what I saw, and then as time went on didn’t think about it much.   Years later when the Internet was available to general public, I learned that the Space Shuttle STS-48 mission was supposed to land at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) at 3:30 a.m. on Sept. 18th (just 15 minutes after I stopped seeing the UFO’s), but NASA aborted or redirected the landing to Edwards AFB in California instead, citing bad weather in Florida.  My location Jekyll Island is only 180 miles north from the KSC and the weather certainly wasn’t bad at all that morning.   Years later someone discovered a STS-48 NASA TV footage recorded on TV (from the STS-48 Space Shuttle cargo bay camera televised on the NASA cable TV channel) that was apparently or estimated to have been recorded on Sept. 15, 1991, showing really interesting ""lights"" in what appears being fired upon from a ground based laser beam – and making evasive moves!  I wonder if what I saw three days later was related to that recorded incident.  NASA called the lights in that video ""ice crystals.""  I question why would we be using ground to space based laser beams (President Ronald Regan’s SDI program?) to shoot ""ice crystals"" in space?  Check out the STS-48 UFO videos.  What did NASA see on that same morning, which caused them to abort and redirect the planned KSC landing over to Edwards AFB instead?",2019-02-01T00:00:00,31.0671,-81.4206

The object appeared out of the sky from the West over the mountains at about 8000 feet, and was bright greenish in color - moving east and downward at a 35 degree angle, approximately at 500+ mph (as if it was slowing), lowering altitude to approximately 2000 feet, then it changed trajectory and angle and move upward, heading northeast, increasing speed to approximately 2000+ miles per hour.   The event was witnessed on HWY 27 northbound near the overpass at the park in Dayton, TN.  Several cars stopped and a few people - including myself and my girlfriend, and other unknown motorists exited their vehicles.

It was late afternoon & I was driving north on the Taconic State Parkway, headed along the ridge just south of Peekskill Hollow road, my intended exit.  Looking ahead through the trees a large bright light hung.  My brain kept trying to register it as a large street lamp, but that didn’t make sense given its position in the middle of the valley.  So I thought I was getting glimpses of a plane’s headlights. There is a point where the road heads down hill into the valley (before disappearing back into the hills on the other side) & the trees get sparse.  Then the exit for Peekskill Hollow road off to the right at the base of the hill; a wide left-banking loop around a large open space of gravel.  It’s an extremely sharp right-hand exit, so my attention was on that despite the large object in the sky above the exit. As soon as I pulled off the exit I had to stop to stare up into the sky.  I stuck my head out the window as far as I could to look up.  A HUGE disc shaped object hung in the sky above the valley. HUGE.  So huge I could not tell if it was twenty feet off the ground or 100 feet.  But it almost entirely blocked my vision of the sky from where I sat!  There was a center circular...difference...an opening, different metal, I’m not sure.  I stared at it for a few moments as I tried to take it all in.

Since they did not move, I took them for stars.  The lights were very distant and clearly located in space (and not within the earth atmosphere). The lights were very bright, steady (not blinking) and of orange colour.  That is also why I watched them constantly for the next 15 minutes.  After five minutes I remembered to me that the brightest light in the sky is Venus (after the moon).  Since the lights were clearly A LOT brighter than planet Venus, I concluded that they could not be stars or planets or other known heavenly bodies.  The lights were approximately 10 times brighter than Venus. Therefore, I called my daughter and wife to look at these objects.  They looked at them and confirmed my observation. My wife then called her aunt which also confirmed my observation.  The aunt that was obviously not interested in astronomy left after 1 minute since she rather wanted to cook (!). Me, my daughter and my wife continued watching the objects.  Approximately 10 minutes have passed and the objects have not moved a bit. At this point in time, one object moved away from earth very quickly.  It moved on a straight line.  It disappeared from sight within approx. 5 seconds.  They other object moved across the night sky at the same height.  It moved approx. 20 degrees within 1 second.  At an assumed height of 400’000 km I estimated that it may have moved 140’000 km in 1 second or 504’000’000 km per hour.

One appeared disk shape. January 21, 2019, Approx: 00:45 AM - 01:10 AM Greensboro, North Carolina Guilford County   During the duration of my viewing of the eclipse, I was glancing at the star clusters near Orion’s Belt.  I was looking back and forth from the moon to Orion’s Belt, numerously throughout that night.  After a while, all of a sudden, I witnessed three orange, hazy, glowing illuminations (ufo’s?) near Orion’s Belt.  I refer to them as illuminations because at first they had no defined shape, other than being three small, out of the ordinary, orange glowing shapes in the night’s sky.  It almost seemed like they flew towards me from the constellation Orion because the illuminations got larger and seemed to get closer.  They weren’t hovering directly overhead, but were hovering in the distance.  I’m not exactly sure how close or far they we’re from me.  I guess if you held a ruler up to the sky in front of you and measured the size of the object I would estimate it to be 7-8mm.  There were no small or flashing lights on them.  They slowly traveled together, horizontally, kind of side by si! de, but not ridged or in any defined formation.  They seemed to fly somewhat wobbly or unstable and with a slight bobbing motion.  One of the illuminations/ufo’s suddenly veered left from the other two, somewhat erratically.  Almost like something was wrong. It then began to fade in and out, leaving an orange trail, then disappeared completely.  The other two remained solid and did not fade in or out.  A few seconds later the other two flew upward then vanished.  I would say my experience lasted for approximately 30 seconds. As they got farther away I could make out one faintly shaped saucer.  The sides were tapered and gradient with a contoured top and bottom. When this occurred I was alone, outside in my crystal/meditation garden, putting out all of my indoor crystals to be charged and cleansed by the super blood wolf moon and total eclipse.  My crystal garden is comprised of three 3’ amethyst geodes and three large 1’ quartz crystals positioned triangularly and in an equilateral formation.  Basically like an invisible hexagram.  In the center of the hexagram is a birdbath with a 12” quartz crystal that I often refer to as my receptor.  Surrounding the receptor are various gemstones and crystals.  The crystal garden has natural indigenous quartz stones surrounding it, as well in many other parts of my yard.  I feel it to be a powerful point of energy, both physically and spiritually. Also, for the past year or so I’ve been instinctively drawn to that constellation.  Practically 90% of the time when I look up to the night sky I immediately see Orion’s Belt.  I don’t have to search for it.  It’s always right there!  Also, when I meditate or simply look at the stars, I’ll talk to any light beings, whoever or whatever may be out there.  My spiritually is greatly influenced by metaphysical, esoteric, and humanistic/pagan philosophies.  Dr. Steven Greer’s and other ufo researchers have also been, to say the least, eye openers to me. I’m a 51 yr. old white male, self employed retailer and truth seeker. This my truth and hear-by swear upon everything I hold sacred that what I witnessed is true.

It caught my eye whereupon I noticed way above it an extremely bright jet shaped object (no wings or tail fins and brilliant white) streaming across the sky.

Remained Motionless to the Left (South) I stepped outside as I often do at night at about 1:10 AM on 03/02/2019.  My wife and I are night owls. I usually look at the sky just to check constellations and planets by eye.  I saw something bright and scintillating in the Western sky.  It was far enough off, but really sparkling.  I thought it might be the running lights of a plane moving East towards me (but that is not a usual flight path).  However, it appeared to remain motionless.  I then thought it might be a police helicopter in the distance. I went inside to retrieve a small folding pocket binoculars and returned to my front lawn.  There seemed to be two objects but I could not be sure if ambient street lights were causing me an optical illusion.  There was a cluster of intense points of light, mostly in the white to bluish-white range but periodically a point of orange-red light seemed to brighten such that it was noticeable with the naked eye (I was not wearing distance glasses which I need primarily for my right eye which has an intra-ocular lens).  At that observation, I ran inside to get my wife to corroborate my experience. The scintillating object began to move about.  Movement was erratic in a relatively small arc of distance and seemed to the eyes to describe a bright line-segment, or perhaps it was shaped more linearly than any other shape.  To the left (South) of the moving object there seemed to be a hazy gray-white parabola, curve pointing West.  My wife saw a complete saucer shape (double parabolic form).  I interpreted that the lights from the moving object may have been illuminating the nearest surface of the parabolic shaped object and that it was a dark color so I could not see its entire shape (my wife’s eyes are perhaps better than mine without her glasses). My wife also was convinced that we saw something that we could not identify and she went inside.  I sat on the sidewalk to better steady my hands and continued to watch the scintillating object through the binoculars.  It seemed to become smaller, lost scintillation and became a point of white light as it moved towards the Western horizon where it disappeared from sight 20 minutes or so after I first noticed it.",2019-03-14T00:00:00,,

I figured it was a neighbor's house light through the woods. I later got up and checked it out. In the woods you could see a few lights--spread out over a few hundred yards.  The one constant was the light in the middle- it did not disappear as the others would occasionally do. It was hard to determine the size of each light and the distance from me in the dark.  It was also hard to definitively say how many lights, as they went on for a short bit, then after a minute (or few minutes) would disappear.  Then another light, in another position, would light up.  At one time you might see five lights, and then only two lights a minute later.  The lights were predominantly white, but would change to red, and occasionally greenish.  It was hard to detect much motion in the lights, as they were small (almost like looking at a star sized light, in the woods), and just moving your head gave it the appearance it was moving.  But by readjusting your position in the window, you would see more lights that might have been hidden from your line of sight behind a tree. It was not a series of campfires, nor flashlights (my first thought).  Not sure what it was, but it was there for a good two hours before I went to bed. A number of years back, I did report a huge white light on ground level in these same woods.  That light was no more than 100 yards behind my house, in the winter (no foliage to obscure it).  That light was steady, and I alone observed that for a few minutes before getting scared and going to bed to hide from it.",2019-04-08T00:00:00,41.4047,-73.2504

It was around 12:30 AM. I had left a friend's house at was riding a  bicycle. I was heading East on Auger Street.  There was  no traffic on the road and the neighborhood  was very quiet. I was riding in the middle of the road, and  looking up at the wonderful starry sky.  I was  looking toward the north-east part of the sky. As I was looking up, I seen a glowing sphere  appear out of nowhere. It appeared about 30 degrees above the horizon  line, and was directly facing me. It was perfectly round. At my distance from  the object, I couldn't tell if it was a sphere or a flat disc.  I assume it was a sphere like  craft. It glowed quite bright with a red-orange  color.  It didn't really pulsate, but it didn't  stay completely constant either.  It had slight  fluctuations, like dimming and brightening...a  slight twinkling effect. Approximately 20-25 seconds lapsed after it appeared. At that point, 7 other crafts exited, or  ejected from the original orb. This happened instantly. In one second, they  exited and traveled to another part of the  sky, and stopped instantly.  They stayed  somewhat in the vicinity of the primary craft. In my estimation from my ground  perspective… Maybe 100 kilometers apart. They  moved to my left, with a northerly trajectory. Again, from my perspective, maybe 35-40  degrees. The smaller craft all stayed in close  proximity to each other, but in no particular formation. They hovered somewhat still for  about 20 seconds. At that point, all the ships flew off  instantly, to the exact way-point.  I also  noticed they seemed to travel along a curved  flight path or trajectory, as if bending  space. After they disappeared, I didn't see nothing afterward. I stayed there for about another 10-15  minutes, and went on my way. Of course,  it was exhilaration. I've always believed we are not alone in this  cosmic domain. Witnessing that event reinforced my beliefs,  and satisfied my opinions relating to how man can travel far in an instant. The key has always been hidden in the conquest  of using space itself as our vehicle.  This is  what will give mankind the capabilities for  true space exploration.",2019-02-01T00:00:00,,

This report is a single event involving this UFO.  I do not think it is extraterrestrial.  I think it is man made.  I have viewed this object multiple, multiple times in the past 3 months or longer.  I can view it during any night when the sky is clear. For the past 3-4 months I noticed a star in the sky, first to the SW of my property and now to the SE of it.  The object appears to be a star, but it is too bright to be one.  I investigated a website that gives the minute-by-minute location of the planets in our solar system and the night of this sighting only three of the planets were visible at the time of my sighting, and all three were located to the North of my location.  In the opposite direction of the star as I observed it.  I took multiple photos of it and some video clips. I used a Canon PC-2200 camera with a 50X zoom.  When zoomed to 50X the object can cover the entire viewing area of the camera.  The object is oval or relatively round.  It does not have the appearance of any of the planets in our solar system.  And I believe it is too large in the viewing area of the camera to be a star. I also observed this object and pursued it early one morning between 3 AM and 7 AM. My thinking was as I approached the object its angle from my position would increase if it was at a relatively low altitude, one a star or planet could not be found at.  The closer I would get, the larger the angle would become.  If that makes sense. I was not able to make a determination that morning.  I drove about 25 miles to a nearby town in the course of my driving.  I watched the object from my truck while I drove.  It was a very clear night with very high cirrus clouds.  After driving about 18 miles the object began to grow small and dimmer and disappeared when it went thru the cirrus clouds.  I stopped my truck, got out and viewed the entire sky for about 3 minutes.  The star was gone.  So, I terminated my trip and turned around to return home. About 5 miles down the road is a small town with a pizza restaurant I frequent.  I decided to pull into its parking lot and take a look to see if the star was not there.  It was there, clearly.  So, I proceeded along my original path until I was about 25 miles from my home.  I did not notice a discernible change in the angle of the star from the ground, and concluded it probably was not within 50 miles of me, maybe more. I stopped at a Walmart to buy something.  When I returned to my truck I remembered I had a pair of binoculars in it. I took them out and viewed the object. I will describe this object not as an oval but more like a fat football. The binoculars have a power of about 10X or 12X. The object took up about 50% of the viewable area of the lens. That suggested to me the object must be relatively close, a location far too close to have been a star or a planet.  The object consisted of chambers that appeared something like the cells of a honey comb but they were shorter and more blunt. They and the object, star, all appeared to pulsate very slightly. The object had 3 black spots and what I can only describe as a smile. The cross section of a smile. It too was black. The object rotated as 2 of the 3 black spots disappeared as did the mouth. In the course of about 15 minutes the 2 missing black spots reappeared. The mouth did not reappear. I left and went home. I have not seen that object again.  Almost every night the star/orb appears to the SE of my property. Some nights it seems to move across the sky like a star or planet. But the majority of nights it does not. I view it between 23:00 PM and 24:00 PM and then against at 5 or 6 Am and its in the same general location. This object starts the evening out at a very high altitude. During the night it descends to an altitude where it appears like the Star of Bethlehem in many Nativity photos. Relatively big and with 4 points to the naked eye.  Again, I have seen this star in the sky almost every night for 3 months, maybe longer. I ignored it for a month or more, though it did not appear to be a star or planet to me. I don't think it can be either one for several reasons detailed above.  That's a synopsis of what I have witnessed from my residence for over 3 months. The objects I have seen do not behave like those described in most UFO reports, darting, high speed turns, etc. This star(s) is relatively stationary, and the only speed it ever demonstrated was the morning it ascended and disappeared into the cirrus cloud during the trip I described above.  I have other witnesses to this star(s).  Very Best Wishes",2019-02-01T00:00:00,,

My dogs had been gone over an hour.  They were over due to return. Coming out of no where I heard what sounded similar to someone hollering or yelling something.  I immediately turned around in my seat to look for what made the sound.  Through my  rear car window in the distance, about 100 yards away, I saw colored  lights high up in the trees.  In that same glance I saw my dogs very rapidly, running back and forth while jumping and running and jumping  repeatedly. It was 1:30 am and dark.  The only lights are the two street lights near where my car was parked.  Yet the small area surrounding my dogs was illuminated by a low light.  Where they running and jumping was directly below the colored lights.  My urgent thought were I had to get my dogs!  I jumped out of my car as fast as I could while grabbing the dog leashes and went to the other side of my car to try and get a better look at what I was seeing, while I put the leashes around my neck as I was preparing to go retrieve my dogs.  The colored lights high up in the trees were astounding.  What was that?  I could tell it was something standing and maybe it was looking down at my dogs down below and the ruckus they were creating.  The only thing it looked like, I quickly concluded, was some kind of machine or a robot.  It had power because the lights were on.  I concluded again that it must be a quite large, and very tall robot. I could not make out an outline of the shape for this robot but it had a large round red light in the center of its head or the top part of this thing where a face would be.  This was incredible, unexpected, and amazing to see what really did appear to be robot out here.  I  thought this robot must  belong to the Weyerhaueser company and they were taking their robot for a late at night walk?  Of course that did not make sense being that Weyerhaueser was a tree growing comp! any. I just watched in amazement what was happening before me. In addition to the round red light that was near the top or the head of the robot, I saw at least 3 more lights.  On the right side and a bit lower was round medium dark blue light.  On the  left side  was a  green light and a white/yellow light.  The lights on the left side were lower than the blue light on the right side.  And Somewhere from this robot was a light that illuminated the ground below it.  I could not see any spot light or beam of light to the ground.  I also could not see any extremities or feet.  I wish now that I would have looked to see beyond where my dogs had been running and jumping in the low light.  That must have been where the feet or the base for this robot was.  I recall seeing the grass as they were running and jumping but I don’t recall what was behind them. This was all very fascinating, and almost unbelievable, but I knew what I was seeing was real.  I was not scared, but I urgently wanted to get my dogs.  A minute or so had passed since I was out of my car getting ready to walk.  I continued to look at  the robot and began to call my dogs names.  The robot heard me.  The red light was shifted where it had been looking and now it looked directly at me!  Our Our eyes locked in a gaze.  To clarify that would be my eyes and the red light.  I wondered what it was thinking about as it looked so directly at me.  I do believe we both knew we had been spotted by the other.  I ended the gazing after a few seconds because it was creeping me out and it's not a polite to stare.  I set out to retrieve my dogs.  Instinctually, I knew the robot would see that I was on my way to get my dogs.  I did not freak out, I did not threaten.  I went back to minding my own business.  It was probably relieved that I was going to get those annoying dogs out of his way.  I called out to my dogs again to come and began to walk very quickly in a diagonal direction across the field towards the where the robot was and where my dogs were.  I called their names again, Juno!  Thor!  Come! Juno! Thor!  Come!  My focus was completely about getting my dogs and nothing else. I ignored the robot.  As I kept walking another dozen steps or so, it occurred to me for the first time that getting close to the robot could be dangerous.  Could be, but for some reason  I was not afraid.  However I did adjust my diagonal direction to be  a bit wider-as to  keep a little closer to the road and end up farther away from the robot instead of directly in front of it.  I kept looking ahead for my dogs and called their names. After a couple minutes of walking, I stopped and turned around.  I don’t know what made me stop and turn around to look, i didn't hear anything.  That was weird.   When I turned around, there they dogs sitting there unusually calm.  I put the leashes on the dogs and changed direction to head directly to the road and my car.  I was now on the path that is near the tree line that goes through the field. I was feeling much relief having my dogs back.  After a moment  I turned around to take one last quick look at the robot.  It was not there and I did not see any sign of it when I took a quick look around.  I resumed walking but not for more than a few seconds and I decided I was not satisfied with the sudden disappearance of the robot.  I knew it couldn't have got too far.  I looked for the robot again.  This time I looked  harder and farther, nothing.  I walked a short way towards the center of the field and then up a short ways to  get to higher ground.  That worked and I could see farther.  I saw the robot in the distance, I'd guess a couple hundred yards, or so.   The trail has a gradual curve to the right as it goes on to the north.  The red light caught my eye or I doubt I would have seen it. The robot was taller than the trees right there.  I had a pretty good idea where the robot was at that point.  I know the trails on this side of the campus well because I have walked this area with my dogs easily over a  hundred times.  I could see the robots shape  better  in the distance than when it was close and in front of me.  But  I could only see the top of it  because the rest of the robot was hidden by trees.  I could only see the upper part of it,  which was the shape similar to what a human looks like.  I could see a head above shoulders and part of the upper back below the shoulders.  That's as far down as I could see because of the trees.  The red light which was in the front of the head when I first saw it, was not on the head at all.  It was extended out on the rights side of the head  being supported by two brackets that were maybe a couple feet long.  The image reminded me of a man wearing a painters cap with the visor part off to the side.  The robot was lo! oking off to the side and downward.  The robot was looking for something and it swayed gently from side to side with each step.  The low light was illuminating below the red light towards the ground. But I could only see the top portion of the robot and the light.  It was walking away from me heading north and I could tell and it was looking for something. How incredible this had all been.  I was elated that I got to see this robot.  How many people get to see something this cool I thought to myself as I began to walk back to my car.  I took my dogs home and dropped them off.  I didn’t even go in the house because I was excited to go see a few friends that I knew were hanging out together that evening so I could share what had just happened.  And I did just that.",2019-02-01T00:00:00,47.30653737623763,-122.34290074257426

We had barbequed a turkey at my folks place southeast of Spokane, WA.  Most of my family was there, including two sisters, two B-i-l’s, mom, dad (skeptic) and me.  My two sons had gone home to Washington earlier in the day.  Well, I like an occasional cigarette after dinner and Tim, my skeptical brother-in-law is a confirmed addict.  We went out on the back porch to smoke after dinner.  It was very dark, very clear, and cold.  I happened to look up and saw a white circular light/object moving from west to east and very high up (seemed to be anyway.)   This light was very much like one I’d seen about 10 years ago in Fall City, WA. (reported to NUFORC) but seemed higher up.  If I hold my hand straight up and away, the object would have been about 1/8th of an inch or so wide.  Much bigger than any star.  Once again it appeared to be a weird, “confined” light.  I immediately shouted “look at that” and pointed at it.  Tim looked up and didn’t say anything, but he wa! s watching.  He saw it. The light approached a smaller, less well-defined white light that looked like a big star.  My first thought was “satellite” but the moving object seemed too big for that.  Then it slowed down and seemed to merge with the smaller light, then they both changed direction to the south and poof, they disappeared. Several observations:  It was much larger than any star in the sky and once again it was that weird, seemingly confined white light.  Not terribly bright, but very obviously moving.  If I pick a spot on the ceiling of my office, while sitting in my chair, the object would appear to have moved about 1 foot across the ceiling/starfield, if that makes sense. When we first saw it, it was moving, once again, in what seemed a purposeful way (we’ve discussed this before) from west to east.  Tim saw it almost immediately after I did and we both saw it slow down and approach another light/object that was similar in color, but appeared smaller – maybe ½ the size.  They came together and became a single light/object – no size change.  Once they merged together, they turned but not in an immediate, 90 degree turn that is often described and seems physically impossible.  This was more gradual, as though going around a corner, but a sharp corner.  In the previous ceiling example, it would’ve executed the turn over just a couple of inches.  Then it was moving to the south.  While we were both staring at it, it just blinked out.  Gone.  We waited a bit, looking, but no other objects appeared to be moving.  I asked him “you saw that didn’t you!”  He said “yeah, I did….and it was weird.”  He was obviously taken aback.  Not quite shaken really, but definitely weirded out.  I can’t tell you how happy I was to have someone else see it.  We went back in and I told the group around table that we’d seen a UFO!  We'd all had a couple of drinks and they all jeered a bit, of course, but I think that Tim’s behavior caught them off guard.  They know him very, very well and know he’d be jeering too if it hadn’t been quite a sight.  It was that, alright.  I checked on the ISS and it was in the sky, but much later that night.  I also check flightaware, etc., there were airliners up of course, but this wasn’t an airliner.  Airplanes don’t slow down that way and then execute a quite sharp turn. It was almost an instantaneous 90 deg. turn, but not quite.  No noise of course.  Don’t know what it was, but for now at least, we know it was a UFO.  I don’t know if these things are extraterrestrial or not, but I would sure like to know. I need to report to Nurforc and will do so tonight.  Should’ve called Peter D. before now, but was very busy and oddly, I didn’t t! hink to do it immediately, nor did either of us think of trying to pull out a phone.  It was one of those things where we were both sort of stunned by what we were seeing.  I’ll give it more thought and file a report with Nuforc and Mufon tonight.",2019-01-11T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

About 7pm, someone noticed a light out over Lake Ontario.  I initially thought it was a small plane which was heading to the Toronto Island airport.  Within a few seconds I could tell that the light was stationary.  I happened to have a small telescope already setup in our spare bedroom.  I brought it out to our balcony and focused it to the light.  It was a round shimmering ball.  Not hard surfaced, but gaseous.  I could focus to the far side of the lake and see trees and buildings on the far shore.   Focusing back on the light, it appeared to be at least ¾ of the way across the lake, maybe more.  Hard to estimate the size of the light/object:  maybe as small as a Volkswagen, or as large as a small bus?   We were on the 16th floor our apartment building at 22 Close Avenue in Toronto.  Our vantage point was to the south.  The light/object was at about the same height as us.  Around 8pm we went inside to have dinner.  I left the table several times: the light was still in scope.  I never moved my scope once.   Shortly after 9pm, I went back out to the balcony and before I could put my eye to the eyepiece, I could see the light was finally moving; slowly but steadily to the right, heading west towards Hamilton, Ontario.   I lost sight of the light when it went out of view behind the corner of our apartment building.",2019-04-12T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

My husband and I have not been able to find a report from anyone else that is similar to what we experienced.  I'm posting in the hopes that someone will come forward. I don't have an exact date, by it was fall of 2017.  We we're driving home to Montana in the wee hours of the morning (2 am) and were on the north bank of Lake Pend d'Orielle between Sandpoint and Trestle Creek, closer to the latter.  We enjoy rockhounding and there is supposedly a popular site just off the highway through there, and even though it was 2am we decided to try and find this spot.  We've hounded/navigated with flashlights many times and we were armed.  We find what we thought was the correct pull off, get our gear together, and start hiking, despite heavy rain.  Foolish, yes, but that's besides the point.  The country is very steep, with lots of rock ledges and outcroppings, and pretty thick with vegetation, so the going is slow and careful.  We had been hiking for about 15 minutes and had a view of the Lake and our truck in the turnoff below us when we see an officer pull in and light up our vehicle.  We had been keeping our lights aimed low and pointed away from the road and lake so as not to alarm people down below.  Anyway, the officer was at our vehicle for about 10 minutes while we stood in the dark watching, curious.  He leaves, turns around and does another drive by several times, even turning on his spotlight at one point.  At this point, I assume he is concerned that we are broke down and out walking in rain in a pretty isolated area.  Curiously, he never lights up or seems to search the other side of the road, only the side we were on.  My husband and I are reluctant to come down considering the effort it required to get as far as we had but we're discussing it when the officer apparently satisfied we aren't in the area, fails to come past again.  We turn on our flashlights and briefly shine them down towards the empty highway and lake, looking at the terrain we had scrambled up. Now, this next part happens so fast, a couple seconds at the most and probably less then even one second, that it is only from discussing and writing down the event a few days later that I am able to provide as many details as I am now.  We switch our lights to red light mode (less visible) at more or less the same time and haven't even finished turning back towards the mountain when we hear a projectile of some sort come from all the way across the lake, pass just over and between our heads, then up the side of the mountain and gone.  This projectile was moving much faster than we thought possible.  We are both experienced firearm users and this was not a bullet.  It was larger, faster, and there was no sound of a weapon being fired.  At all.  Nor was there an echo of any sort, which given the location there should have been.  Even our  voices echoed.  The only sound we heard was the air around it moving as the object came across the lake and over the mountain.  It was about as loud! as you'd hear if a hard flung ball or rock barely missed your head as it went by but different in pitch.  There was no light.  Additionally, had it been anything man made or nature caused coming at us like that, there is no way it wouldn't have smacked into the cliff directly behind us or into any of the trees or rocks above us.  It was only a couple feet above our heads and the terrain was very steep and very thick in addition to it's speed.  Its just not possible.  We actually heard/sensed it maneuver, with intent, through the canyon and then the trees as it went.  My husband actually dropped to the ground in self preservation, while I, trying to process what that could have been but knowing it wasn't anything I'd had experience with, stood there in shock.  His flashlight had turned off completely and mine had changed to strobe mode which I had trouble turning off.  We crouched there for a couple minutes not saying much except what the hell just happened before deciding to abandon ship (pun intended) and get off that mountain.  We knew we h! ad to tu rn our lights back on in order to do so safely despite our fear.  Being him, he all the sudden says ""screw it!"", turns his light on the brightest setting it has (way bright too) and starts heading down with a purpose and in quick fashion.  I followed using my light sparingly but not in red mode.  We make it down in one piece and get on our way. When we got in the truck we checked the time and got mad chills- it was still only 2am give or take a few minutes. Two days later we decided to write down everything about it that we could, plausible or not, and compare.  There were no discrepancies.  In fact, the similarities on some things are eerie.  Such as we both felt rather then saw that the mass of the object was about the size of a basketball but much more streamlined.  It had energy within it, for lack of better words. It had intelligence.  We both felt that it could have taken our heads off if that was its intent, but had instead given us a warning.  There are other things but you get the jist. The phones we had at the time began to malfunction and glitch out and had to be replaced soon after, same as the flashlights we carried that night. Being Christian's and not into such things as UFO's, the paranormal, or supernatural, we are hesitant to put such a label on what happened.  But that's our story, make of it what you will.

The degree of brightness is what drew my attention.  The aircraft was not moving in a specific direction, left or right, rather seemed more side to side but hard to confidently say with the wind and treeline moving.  After about 5 minutes, it became clear the object was heading in a Northeast direction, almost straight to me.  At some point the blurry bright lights broke the treeline and it was 2 sets of the bright lights, blinking.  Im guessing about 1 second intervals between the two sets, for a total of 4 lights.  At this point, I went and got my youngest daughter, 9 yr old, I assumed the object to be in a “cigar” shape, as the two sets of white lights were horizontal.  About 10 minutes into sighting, the object made no sound, no noise at all. I assumed this was a drone, although everyone around me is older, my closest neighbor are family or friends, no possible drone for a! estimated 1/4 mi radius.  At some point of moving Northeast, say 12-15 minutes into sighting a third and forth set of blinking lights began, red in color.  Then, 2Sets bright white, 2 sets red, white in front red in back according to flight direction. My daughter says...what in the world...then a line of white dots, not flickering, appeared under the 2 sets of white and 2 sets of red, estimating 10 non flickering, smalller “dots”. Object remained to appear in cigar form until it turned, in which it made a 90* once it had passed being perpendicular to me. When this happened, the lights seemed to spread out, as in a 4 corners pattern, 1 set percorner with white remaining in front and red in back.  At this point I was yelling into house for my wife, she lacks the capacity to make sense out of shiny moving objects in the sky, she simply nervously laughs but knows the lights arent natural.  Let me back up, after the lights Turned into four sets to 1 to 0 in the bottom but right b! efore it had reached us a perpendicular to me I finally heard ! a jet en gine that seem to be coming from the onject.  Seemed out of ratio though, awefully loud for what looked to be further away.   4 sets of light, ( one in each of the 4 corners, jet sound, making what ended up to being about 120* turn heading due west towards Lambert Airport the flashing lights made a “outline” of a circle, a circle inside the 4 corners. My 9 yr old pointed it out and started to get nervous.  Not sure if wife seen the circle inside the 4 lit up corners, once the object got far enough it ended up being just the 2 sets of white lightsagain in a horizontal  direction.  The entire event took about 25-30 minutes in total.  I went back outside after warming ipfor about 10 minites, seen another object with similar lights including the degree Of brightness, going in back towards location it had begun from but no jet sound and furthur.

When the planes are headed directly towards your line of sight, you cannot see flashing lights, but they tend to appear yellowish-white; this craft was a solid, orange ball.   Secondly, it was going way too fast relative to its  apparent altitude.  Had it been a plane at that altitude, it would have been moving much slower across the sky.
