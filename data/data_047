While watching TV at 10:30PM, I glanced out my living room window and noticed two bright lights that looked about over Lake Travis, just to the right of Mansfield Dam.  They looked stationary, which seemed odd, so I got my 30 power binoculars out and went out on my deck to get a better look.  I watched these two lights for about 5 minutes which stayed at the same altitude (I’d guess about 2,000 feet) and parallel to each other.  They were rock solid and did not move up or down and stayed the same distance from each other.  I’d estimate they were at least 100 yards, maybe further, from each other and very large and bright.  The light emitted seemed elongated on the bottom side of the lights, so maybe the light of both was being directed downward.  There were no other lights such as colored navigation lights, strobes, etc.  I thought this was very odd.  I am very familiar with all kinds of aircraft lighting as I was an aircraft maintenance specialist (jet over two engines) in the Air Force.  This was no plane or helicopter(s) hovering.  All of a sudden, after about 5 minutes of observation, both lights slowly dimmed down to about 20% of the original intensity.  Then they began to move, one going lower than the other as if a very large craft in a banking turn to the north east.  It then moved to the east and I was amazed that this appeared to be a single craft, not two individual ones.  The lights still kept the same relative distance from each other and sped across the horizon in a matter of seconds, it was totally gone in 4 or 5 seconds.  I never was able to make out a clear structure, but believe it was a chevron or triangle shaped, by observing the lights and how they moved together.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

I am ex Royal Air Force so Im pretty used to seeing many things up in the air (I stress that Im not or ever have been a pilot). We both take great delight in watching the skies at night and have witnessed many things but never have I considered any of them to be a so-called UFO. Neither I nor my partner could identify it, so I have labelled it as such. The event is quite unremarkable and possibly has a valid explanation, I was however left slightly confused after the event but by no means will I exagerate anything witnessed. The object in question had no shape (round shaped if any) or visible form other than a very bright white light. It was spotted initially whilst my partner and I were facing South. With any aircraft in the area its very easy to determine distance and height, and additionally you can hear each individual aircraft. This however, was substantially different as it was near impossible to ascertain its real height or distance, which struck me as odd given the intensity of the light. Initially it looked considerably low for any type of aircraft, and I had also assumed at first that these must be lights at the front of an aircraft but its heading (approximately a NW to SE direction) did not confirm this. The object moved in a straight line without any deviation but moved rather slowly. (again I discounted the fact that this could have been a shooting star due to the speed of travel). We both would have discounted this totally had it not been for the end result of this light. After a couple of minutes the intense light seemed to diminish. Not so much fade out but seemed to get smaller very quickly to the point that it resembled a faint and distant star, until at last it vanished. During this time its movement did look constant. I wouldnt have considered submitting this if it had not been for the latter detail, and of course the other facts brought together.  I have discounted fireworks also, given that the course and apparrant height was linear and never deviated.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

We stayed at an oceanfront hotel and the first evening we arrived, we went downstairs to take some pictures of the indoor lazy river and the outdoor pool area of the hotel.  We noticed a very bright white light with a little red in it, in the sky over the ocean.  Thinking it was a plane at first, we still continued to watch it because it was so bright!  It was moving very slowly to the left (north).  After about a minute or two, another light shot out of the bright one (to it’s left) and then 2 other lights lit up in a straight diagonal line with the one that had shot out.  They lit in sequence at evenly spaced intervals of time (about 2 seconds apart).  They were bright white also with a little red in them, but were smaller in size than the initial one.  The initial bright light and the 3 other smaller lights all moved very slowly to the north in the same formation (still over the ocean).  The initial bright one went out after a couple of minutes and the smaller 3 lights went out about a minute later, one at a time and at evenly spaced intervals of time.  Then just a few seconds later, we could see 2 very small white lights traveling at a very fast rate of speed much higher up in the sky.  One was slightly below and behind the other.  They were also traveling northward.  We did see a plane in another section of the sky, and observed that these smaller white lights were moving so much faster than the plane!  We have no idea what any of these lights were, but we were certainly fascinated by them.  Dumbstruck might be more like it.  I had a camera in my hand and didn’t think about taking a picture until after the first bright light had already gone out.  I tried to take a picture of the other 3 lights that formed the diagonal line, I used the 12x zoom, but I had just gotten this digital camera and am still learning how to use all the different settings, so the picture came out very grainy.  The lights also look rather orange in the picture, but in person they were white with a bit of red.

It was a very clear night, and I saw multiple white lights moving across the sky at high altitudes independently of each other. I don't think they were satellites because they did not move in a steady line across the sky, instead they zig-zagged from east to west. As I was standing outside watching the lights, a large red ball of light appeared above the tree line in the southern sky. I was so frightened that I got in my car and drove 4 miles down the road to get my neighbor so he could see what i was seeing. He wasn't there so I went back home, hoping they would be gone. It was there again (or still) and then seemed to split or multiply. The second ball of light emerged in front of the first one, the third emerged from the second one, and by the time there was four lights I had gotten in my car and was speeding to another neighbor's house. By the time we got back it was gone, but the white lights were still in the southern and western sky. My neighbor thought that they might be military aircraft watching the American/Canadian border. I had no idea who to contact, so it wasn't documented at all.

What I would like to know is if the crafts that Vancouver saw was traveling horizontal to earth or at an angle as most pitures and drawings that we see of triangle crafts. Because I originaly reported it as a cigar shape but what if what I saw was a side profile of the triangle, like seeing the rim of a book.  ****  note **** The skies were still blue at 19:30 about 1/2 hour away from sunset.  Vancouver, WA to Brooklyn, NY is 3000 miles apart. WA reported it at 13:55 (PDT) that's 15:55 (EST). I made my report at 19:30 (EST).

When the object came in from the horizon at 260 deg SW flew at the closest point over my house I ran from the back yard to the front ( 60' ) just to see it come out from over my house and head NE at 80 deg toward Long Island.  As I stated in a previous post, after the sightings, I veiwed a commericial jet plane ( close enough where you know it's a plane but can't tell what airline and about the same size as the crafts) flew over the same path at about the same speed it took the crafts to reach and pass over my house.  So if a plane cruises about the speed of 500 MPH and the craft travels at 1000 MPh and they both took about the same time to cross over my house then is it possible that that crafts were twice the size of a jumbo and were flying twice as high giving the illusion that it was the sze of a jumbo and needed to travel more distace then a plane to cross over my home.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

It immediately caught my attention and I pulled onto the shoulder to watch it. The light maintained a consistent intensity and did not move in any direction.

I then proceeded west on Broadway and kept looking at the general area where I had seen the copper colored light a couple of minutes prior.   The light suddenly reappeared, with another copper colored companion light, the second light being about ten degrees to the right of, and about ten degrees above the first light.  Both maintained a consistent intensity, but were brighter than the first appearance a few minutes prior.

I am writing this down for my mother, who is now elderly.  She is a native of Ojai, California.   In 1948, she was working in the Ojai Valley as a waitress.  Her sister was also working at the same place.  On a summer evening in July, she and my aunt left work after 10 pm.  They drove in their car to a small hill looking in the direction of Los Angeles, towards southeast.  They parked the car and looked out at the bright stars and clear sky.  Suddenly, they saw all of these peculiar little white lights, more than a dozen of them, hovering and darting around in the sky.  They couldn’t distinguish whether they were small and close, or large and far away.  They watched them for about 15 minutes.  They darted around in every direction, so fast they could barely tell whether it was up or down or which direction.  Then they disappeared, quite suddenly, as if they just blinked out.  Three or four days later, mom returned to the same spot, with another friend, and they both observed the lights again, spinning and darting around above the Black Mountain area.  It was still very difficult to tell distance or size.  They appeared to be round, similar in brightness to the stars.  Mom says if they hadn’t moved, they would have thought they were stars.

I stopped thinking it was simply just a powerful light being emitted from the ground after it had been racing back and forth across 120 degree span from where I was watching it. The intensity of the light hadn't changed as it was moving either, so it couldnt have been an image being emitted from the ground because such an image would lose intensity as the light beam stretched further away from the origin.

By this time it was dark and had grown chilly from the breeze coming off the lake and my girlfriend went into the tent to put on a sweater. After a few minutes I started to get this feeling like there was something behind me and I was getting this strange electrical sensation up and down my spine and the hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end. So I stood up and turned around and there was this white sphere hovering over the treeline. I stood and stared for a second then I looked over at the tent to yell at my girlfriend to come out and look at this thing and she was already standing there looking at it too. She said that she felt this strange electrical sensation too so she came out of the tent and there it was. We stood there for a moment looking at this sphere and all the sudden it flashed at us three times, a pause, three times again, another pause then two times and then disappeared leaving this weird haze behind. I know this because the moon was almost full and shing very brightly that night but this was definitly not the moon! We discussed leaving but didn't. The next morning we were talking to the people who own the campground and they have a house with a big picture window that overlooks the lake and they said one night they saw something hovering over the lake and sending a beam down into the water.

We were on a hill situated in the middle of the Transcontinental Pipeline that ran through our property,  This pipeline originates in Texas and terminates in New York.  It is natural gas and carries within its trajectory also, the Viacom cable that lies beside it. The path of the line is about two hundred feet wide, bordered by dense growth and large pines with an occasional home here and there. My Granddaughter and I were in a small tent with openings on four sides, it sat on the top of a hill looking NE on the open pipe line when we saw it. It emerged from the pines below tree top level.  The trees were about forty feet grown for lumber. It  simply glided at that low altitude across the pipeline, across a small country road, over the roof of my neighbor’s house, on the hill top, and disappeared into trees on the other side of our property. It was oval, but flat towards the edges.  The color was yellow/white or golden and luminous. It seemed to be the size of a large vehicle in length. like a large truck size. in relation to the size of the home it cruised over.  It was perfectly silent.  My granddaughter and I saw it at the same time and couldn’t grasp what we were observing.  My far sight is blurry so I couldn’t make out surface details, only the form. I knew a helicopter could fly low…but not without sound. It was, at the closest, about three hundred feet away. There were no other sounds as it was late at night and we were simply out there to look at the stars and talk. The craft glided,  and appeared to be untroubled by obstacles in it’s path. No other craft that I’m aware of could hover that low and maintain altitude???   My grandchild has never forgotten it--neither have I.  We were amazed not afraid.  I have a simple philosophy. I believe in everything--just in case. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2007-06-12T00:00:00,34.088,-83.3127

We were talking all night to one another about our future and summer plans as we decided to call it a night and return to our respective homes.

It appeared in the northeastern part of the sky and moved in the shape of an arc or bow toward the northwestern part of the sky and disappeared 'into thin air' very quickly. It was circular in shape and was only slightly brighter than a full moon and had the same type of brilliance, size, shape, and likeness. It did not make any sound.

I saw a large stationary craft and in a moment or so smaller craft emerged single file almost, first to the west then from the opposite side of the craft to the east but this was going on simultaneously. About a dozen in each direction emerged, (without counting)  I was then urged to look to my left and up to the tree under which I saw a ball of white light smaller, but not much, than a basketball. It appeared to have an intelligent presence and was observing me from a distance of only about 15 feet. Seconds later, as though driven away by my attitude it took off in a westerly direction climbing at an angle of about 60 degrees. As it did so it elongated into a tail of light then disappeared, not in the distance but simply a short distance away - it just vanished. Time travelling came to mind. The weidest thing was that throughout as is often the case it appeared as a normal circumstance and nothing to worry about and this feeling lasted for three weeks after which time it literally wore off and I freeked out. I also want to record several other sightings. Several times around 2000 I witnessed the searchlight which seemed to go on forever but unlike some other sightings I believe I was given an explanation on one of these occasions and far more detailed and absolutely fascinating observations. The searchlight emanated from a stationary craft, quite close, in the sky and went to and fro ad nauseum , not on the ground but on thin air! in the sky around an axis point roughly level with the originating craft on the horizontal plane, in an arc of around 130 to 150 degrees of a circle.to and fro, to and fro ad nauseum. the 'spotlight' a kind of end circle with the conical beam just like you see normally but only a short distance from the originating craft . Hard to tell air distances but around 100 feet at a guess. But on one occasion it got very interesting and I was told to watch this... a narrow beam of light shot out from the originating craft independent of the searchlight bisecting the searchlight arc and stopping at its extreme perimeter. this then disappeared and a blue rectangle of light appeared vertically over the area of the arc search in a flash and remained for a moment or two then that too disappeared. It seemed to my mind and I don't know how , except to say intuitively that the narrow beam was like a fishing line and that the rectangle of light was the hook which retreived the INFORMATION, the whole point of the exercise, that the searchlight had been gathering about the people below it asleep in their homes and or the physical environment and that when these two lights disappeared the information was retreived safely on board the space craft. I found the whole thing fascinating and still do. Now why did they want to show me these things unless they were friendly craft - right? If you appreciated hearing about this please let me know I may or may not be allowed to detail a myriad of other things including scoop marks missing time seeing my abductors, responding to implanted thoughts, always benign as if they were my own,a cigar shaped vehicle having trouble leaving this time dimension - I can prove this using Einsteins exact same descriptions for the same. My own time travel back to the building of the pyramids of giza,and information about it also corroborated by someone else, I don't know how he knew, and other fascinating things which would take lengthy pages to adequately detail but they point to meaning and communication, the missing ingredient in most reports.

We were perhaps 100 feet away from our friend’s home when we both noticed a large, bright green light blinking on something that was moving through the air away from us.  It couldn’t have been more than 50 feet above the ground as it moved slowly from our left (south) diagonally away from us toward our right (northwest).  It was approximately two football fields away from us when we first saw it.  All we could see was the extremely large, bright green light blinking on and off for 1 to 1 1/2 seconds at a time.   I realized that I wasn’t able to hear any sound coming from whatever it was, so I asked Dave, ""Can you hear it?  Can you hear it?!""  To which he replied that he couldn’t hear anything from it either.   At that time, I ditched my bike and we both began running toward the object which had by then stopped flashing the green light and began flashing a gold light 10 to 15 feet forward from where the green one had been.  The gold light was as large and as bright as the green one had been, and it was definitely more captivating.   Just as the two of us had reached a full-speed run, the object abruptly changed direction and began flying directly towards us.  There was no curving turn like an airplane would have to make, no sweeping change like a glider, the object just stopped going away from us and began heading immediately toward us.  I think even a helicopter wouldn’t have been able to change direction of flight as quick and immediate as the object did.   Then we were scared!   We turned and ran back to our friend’s house.  We pounded on the door for him to let us in, and he opened the door just as the object flew directly over our heads.   At that time, there were no longer any lights flashing, but we could hear a faint humming noise.   As the object flew over, all we could see was its black silhouette against the night sky.  We both agreed that it was triangular in shape and small like an ultra-light.   We do not believe it was an ultra-light.

As I'm returning back to my house, I catch a glimpse of a light to my right out of the corner of my eye.  I turn and I see a large triangular craft hover slowly overhead.  It was clearly visible in the flood-lights in the parking lot, though no detail could be seen through the snow.  It was no more than 20 feet above the tree line, and moved no more than 15MPH. After it passed overhead and started to head off into the darkness, I was able to gauge its height above the tree line.  I was also able to see a slight profile of the craft.  It seemed to be triangular in shape - more like a stretched out pyramid.  It could have been boomerang shape, I'm not entirely sure because of the snow, but I was able to see blue-white lights on its edges/corners shaped in a triangle fashion. The craft made no sound whatsoever. One thing I noticed is that my ears popped during the encounter.  That could have just been a coincidence as it is common at that elevation. My opinion is that the snow storm was too bad for any known aircraft to be flying that low. After this incident, I seem to be experiencing a phenomenon called ""street-light interference"".

In the afternoon I was on a major north south road in the city’s east end. I was seated inside my parked auto facing north. I was looking at the heavily overcast skies when something caught my eye. I looked directly overhead and saw a large golden orb. It was within the clouds but the bottom of the orb was slightly lower and visible. The clouds were low but I could tell this object was huge. It moved northbound at a high rate of speed causing a wake in the clouds. I could see it was indeed an orb from a distance before it went out of sight. After several minutes I texted my radio dispatcher by way of the computer and asked if there were any calls for a meteor or lights in the sky. The dispatcher after several minutes confirmed some calls did come in regarding lights in the sky. I kept my sighting to myself and made no report to my superiors.

As it moved across the sky it passed over the highway in front of us. Its profile I can only describe as flat, like a pane of glass. As it passed by it rolled toward us and revealed its shape, which appeared as that of a diamond. It then rolled to its former profile, paused, then darted away.

Phase #1:  I was sitting on the living room sofa, which faced me to the NW, looking out a double window.  There is a high hill directly behind the house.  I saw a glow at the tree line, the tops of the trees lit up.  Then a line of lights in a row, rose in an arc, maybe 9 or 10 of them.  They were orange, bright orange with a steady glow, not pulsating.  They were bigger than Venus and brighter.  Maybe like hand-held spot lights.  They illuminated the tree line. Moving not too rapid.  Moving from left to right.  The  formation slowly reveled itself. Looked like something big in that direction.  It looked like the leading edge of a solid object, with more hidden down below.  I thought, ""I’ve got time (to get to the back door)"" and jumped up and ran to the back door.  By the time I got out there, they had slid down below the hill.   I could still see a glow.  At the top of the hill, the glow dissipated.  I called my wife, but by the time she got there they were gone. Phase#2: My wife and I saw this.  Over the hill to the North there were weird looking strobing lights.  They were white.  I saw at least three, and they were set to form triangles in groups of three.  Three with three lights each.  These were a little dimmer than the string of lights.  A real fast strobe, a series of fast flickers, then nothing, then fast flickers, then nothing.  They all strobed at the same time.  The size of the clusters, each triangle of three lights was maybe like a quarter held at arm’s length.  Larger than a dime.

I was amazed of how clear the night’s sky was, and also how well you could see stars.  I started to focus my attention at the brightest star in sky. I stared at it for about 15 seconds pondering if it were in-fact the north star, then realized it was more eastern.  At about that moment of realization, the frozen star-like light started slightly moving to west in a straight but slow motion. I started yelling at the other 3 people outside with me, and pointed out the moving (non-blinking) bright white sphere of light. We all had a sudden rush shoot through our body’s once we had all realized we’d never seen anything like this before. No one said a word, just mumbled slowly stuff like oohhhhhhhhh! or whattttttt! (I could tell that everyone was truly freaked out.) The light started speeding up gradually while swerving slight zigzags in the sky. About 2 minutes into  seeing this object pass across about 3/4s of the visible sky , it suddenly disappears.  We instantly ran across the house to front yard to see if we could still see anything from a different angle.  Around 45 seconds after seeing the light go out/disappear we all 4 see a super bright shooting star looking thing with a long bright tail zoom across the whole sky(diameter about- 8 gauge). While these events were going on, flashing lights like lightning were striking about every 10-15 seconds and no one saw any actual lightning, nor heard any thunder, we just saw light flashes in the distance.  I’m not too sure if that has anything to do with the light object we saw, but it could perhaps.  This is the 3rd time I have seen unexplained UFO objects with more than just myself viewing, but my 4th time to ever see these floating lights in Nacogdoches within a year and a half. Every time they have been about the same, my first 2 sightings the light was 100% bigger and seemed more of a blue-ish white light- and my latest 2 encounters I’ve been seeing a more white based light circle about the size of a lower-case o (size 12 font).  I’m just looking for a possible explanation for what I’ve been seeing, or if anyone else has seen the same things that 7 of my friends and I truthfully saw.

I was on the Golden State Freeway (I-5) in Los Angeles, CA heading northbound at approximately 1:40 a.m. on Saturday, 03 May 2008.  The temperature was 59 degrees Fahrenheit; clear skies; 58% humidity; visibility 10 miles (weather.com).  At the 101/I-5 junction in Downtown Los Angeles, I noticed a bright light near the Downtown LA skyline.  As I connected to the 101 freeway junction heading toward the light, I noticed that the light was in fact two (2) lights pointing down.  At first, I believed it to be a police helicopter; however, it appeared to be “locked” in the same spot, too steady to be hovering.  The almost-golden colored lights were large and close together; reminiscent of heating lights used to keep food warm at a buffet restaurant.  Noticing that there were no vehicles behind me nor ahead of me, I proceeded to slow down to 30 miles per hour (I was initially traveling at 65 mph); at which point I was observing the object above my vehicle slightly to the left, allowing me to see it without the roof of my vehicle obstructing my view.  The object appeared to be at about 700-800 feet in mid-air.  The shape of the object as viewed from directly underneath resembled the shape of a human eye; almost that of a football.  The lights were pointing down and were definitely not police helicopter lights (of which there is only one per craft; usually unstable and blue-white/halogen type).  Combined, the two lights took up an estimated 70% of the shape in which they were contained.  The object did not produce any visual/audible means of propulsion.  Its surface did not display any flashing lights, such as those of a police helicopter (flashing blue and red strobes on the sides) or any conventional aircraft.  The surface was dark-metallic.  Thin, fine, vertical and horizontal could barely be seen across its dark surface.  The top or “side” of the object was not visible, since it was viewed from underneath.  The area in which it was hovering in is assumed to be restricted airspace for airplanes; both private and commercial due to its proximity to the skyscrapers of the downtown district (less than a mile).  The nearest airport, Los Angeles International is approximately 15 miles southeast of Downtown LA.  Commercial and private airplane routes approaching the Los Angeles Metropolitan area head westbound almost directly above the 105 Freeway, which connects North Orange County/South Los Angeles County to LA International Airport.  This busy and well-known airplane route is approximately 10 miles south of Downtown LA.  It is also viewable 24 hours a day.  Goodyear blimps are known to fly in the area since Dodger Stadium is nearby; however, blimps are not known to display large, exceedingly bright lights.  The object observed was definitely not a blimp; it did not glide or appear to exhibit slight movement.  Dodger Stadium was not hosting any events that evening.  After reviewing a map of the area, I estimate the object’s position to have been directly above Santa Fe Avenue & 7th Street (near the 7th Street bridge over the LA River) in Downtown LA.  As I was observing the object from my vehicle (window down, traveling at 30 mph); I glanced ahead quickly to make sure my vehicle was on track before I glanced back to observe the object again.  This went on for about 45 seconds.  As I glanced at the road quickly (about 1 second), I looked back up and the object was gone.  The area of sight in which I had the object in was large enough for me to track a helicopter or an airplane even at high speeds.  As I circled the Downtown LA area via the 101 junction ramp (first northbound, then northwest bound); I scanned the area for the object; however, it was no longer present.

I was coming back home and noticed a bright orange star to the northeast. It was far away with other stars but I thought it curious and I wondered if there ere any other orange stars in the sky. I panned from the orange star in the sky to the left looking down my street. To my absolute astonishment there was a glowing orange ball approximately 100 yards above my neighbor’s home just sitting there idle. I thought to myself ""there is no way I'm seeing this so I rubbed my eyes and did a double take but the object was still there. It was a glowing bright orange ball just hovering over our neighborhood. When I realized that it wasn’t a figment of my imagination I started running down the street dragging my dogs behind me. I have 2 bull dogs and one of them is older and doesn’t run very fast. After trying to drag her I finally just threw her leash away and left her in the street while I ran home. My father and daughter were both home and I yelled in the house “you’re not going to believe this but there is a UFO outside.” Both of them came into the back yard and witnessed it. While I was running home it moved slowly from above my neighbor’s house across the street to the east over our back yards.  We sat there looking at it in awe. It looked kind of like a party balloon as it was circular, but it was glowing orange. So bright in fact that you could see the light from it emanating off the neighboring rooftops. After it hovered over out back yard for about 5 minutes it then started moving south. I new I had to tell more people so I ran over to my neighbors, knocked on their door, the wife answered and I told her she had to come out side and see this UFO. It was starting to get further away moving slowly thought the sky but we both sat there and watched it move southward stopping periodically and hovering for 5 or 10 minutes and then continuing on to the south. This happened in Oceanside California near the intersection of Lake and Ridge. What was reall! y amazin g is that it just hovered over my neighbor’s house and then moved eastward. Stopped, hovered again and then moved southward stopping periodically and just hovering. There was no wind out and the light was so bright that it could not have been a balloon with a light inside or on fire because it was visible from at least a mile as it continued southward down Melrose Ave towards the city of Carlsbad. We did get 2 pictures of it and there has to be more people that saw it. It was not necessarily a craft but it was able to maneuver and shone so bright that as it passed the neighboring homes the rooftops glowed orange.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,33.247651756440284,-117.33448852459017

The next second they crossed each others path very quickly and then resumed there slow pace. At that point I was stunned and amazed at what I was seeing. The sudden precise movements that they made were not of man made technology in my mind. These things were completely silent. If I wouldn't have looked up just at that moment, I would have never known they were there.  The next second, the bottom one from what I can see just darted straight up to a higher elevation with that same precise movement as before. They continued at the slow speed together but further apart from each other. Then all of a sudden they both merged closer together very quickly. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. Then one more time they both made a sporadic different maneuver but at the same time and then they just kind of vanished.

My family member said that at time there should at most only be one bright “star” in the West and it should be Venus.  This family member became curious and walked away from the building to get a clear view of what I was looking at. We were looking at partial moon several degrees above Venus and that there was another bright object, about one inch (at arms length), to the left and slightly below Venus.  After watching for a few seconds we realized that this object was moving slowly up and a little to the right in relation to Venus.  As the object moved it slowly became less bright and disappeared from sight in about ten minutes.  The total “distance” traversed during this time was about three inches (at arms length) up and to the right and then it disappeared almost directly above Venus but very slightly to the right.  On a clock it would appear to be at three minutes past the hour.  During this slow transit we realized that there were very tiny and very difficult to see flashes of light at a distance of about one quarter of an inch (at arms length) in all directions from the object.  These flashes seemed to both come from the object and come from outside the object.  My family member said that the apparent movement of the object would indicate that it was not inside of the atmosphere.  If the object was, it would have to be increasing in altitude but somehow reducing in reflectivity.  At that time of day (just after sunset) the object did not move far enough East to pass the solar terminator and lose its light source.  The object also did not seem to be moving fast enough to reach escape velocity.  The sight of the moon and two “stars” was so beautiful.  If I had not stopped to look at them, this sighting would never have happened.  My family member would not have come to look at it, too.  We would not have realized that one of the “stars” was moving and wasn’t a star at all.  My chant to everyone I know is to look up!  Cloudy or Clear! Day or Night!

Amber light observed in rural Nevada very far away from military test range,Current,NV,2007-12-04T17:00:00,unknown,45 minutes,"Occurred : 12/4/2007 17:00  (Entered as : 12/04/07 17:00) Reported: 12/31/2007 1:02:38 AM 01:02 Posted: 3/4/2008 Location: Current, NV Shape: Unknown Duration:45 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60574.html,"Amber light observed in rural Nevada very far away from military test range I am a Police Officer with many years of experience in rural Nevada.  On December 4, 2007 at approximately 19:00 hours I, along with another officer, observed a single bright amber light while driving southbound on state route 379 in Nye County Nevada.  The light pulsated and disappeared as the object generating the light moved quickly to the other side of a small hill.  It was dark but the sky was clear and I am very familiar with the hills and mountain ranges in the area.  We continued southbound on 379 for another 15 miles to US highway 6 without seeing a second sign of the object.  At the junction we decided to “black” the patrol unit out and look down the valley toward where we saw the object.  We had a clear view of the small mountain range.  In the desert valley 15 miles is not too far to see clearly and mountain silhouette was recognizable even with the nightfall because of the star light.  After a few minutes of observing the mountain range the amber light again appeared.  It moved slowly at first then suddenly moved very vast along the range.  It reversed its direction and seemed to climb and descend at great speeds then occasionally stopping after accelerating to what seemed to be supersonic speeds. It would traverse literally in the blink of an eye an estimated distance of about 5 miles.  As I said earlier I am very familiar with rural Nevada and I have had the opportunity on many occasions to observe supersonic aircraft flying overhead.  From these experiences I know that after seeing an aircraft accelerate to those speeds a “sonic boom” can be heard even at that distance.  We heard nothing aside from the usual sounds of the high desert.  Also I can think of nothing living or inanimate that would be able to survive the “G” forces associated with those maneuvers, though I must admit I do not have an aeronautical background.  This was just common sense.  After watching the object for about ten minuets a second suddenly appeared.  It emitted the same amber light and flew in the same manner as the first.  There were other vehicles traveling down that stretch of highway.  We observed something that leads us to believe that the objects were not without intelligence.  As the vehicles on the highway approached the mountain range the lights would either disappear or move to the other side of the mountains.  It appeared that these lights were avoiding the cars.  We observed this activity for about half an hour before we decided to continue driving.  We drove East bound on Highway 6 for another ten or fifteen miles when just on the East side of Current Summit at the Nye and White Pine County Line we observed two more sets of amber lights behaving in the same manner as the first set.  I do not know if these objects where merely the same as the ones we’d seen earlier or a different set altogether.  These objects hovered over the trees of the Humbolt National Forest at about fifteen feet.  They were only about two miles to the North of us we again “blacked out” and observed the lights which had to be aware of us at this point.  We observed for only a few minuets because one of the objects disappeared and the other seemed to be distracting us by hovering in plane view.  Since it is said that curiosity killed the cat my feline compatriot and I decided drive away as fast as was safe.  I cannot say that this was my first experience with these objects.  I grew up in this area and this experience marks the fifth time I had seen these lights.  I was 15 the first time and I had been traveling the same stretch of highway with my grandmother.  After we had seen the object and it disappeared my grandmother told me that she had been seeing the lights since the early nineteen thirties in the same area and that most people just didn’t talk about them.  I can say that I am very concerned about these objects.  I have tried to rationalize what I had seen before as military test aircraft.  However the area where I’ve seen these objects is about a hundred miles from the Tonapah military test range and I would assume that the US military would want to keep top secret craft within secure airspace.  There have been reports of cattle mutilation in the area as well. I have to say that whatever these objects are they worry me.  I cannot fathom what their intentions might be; frankly that’s what scares me.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,,

We all folowed it with our eyes it passed across the sky vry quikly, before we knew it we were all running into the front garden to watch it and get a better look and we watched it for as long as we could as it passed over the housing estate (clay lane). the experience lasted a good 50 seconds which was long enough to see it had no tail it was not a plane, it was moving extremely fast, faster than a satelite (my uncle pionted out). This is the second sighting ive posted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It’s normal appearance was that of a medium bright star, it then flashed brighter, and in a second appeared to have moved lower next to the star Aldebaran.  My daughter couldn’t locate it with the pair of binoculars we had, and she quickly gave it to me.  As I tried to locate it, I heard my son say it flashed again.  My oldest daughter told me that it was near the top of the right most star in the constellation.  It had apparently changed direction upward from the middle of the constellation.  I quickly found it with the naked eye, and then looked in the binoculars.  It appeared to be at least as high as an orbiting satellite and still moving across the sky to the right.

We stopped in open countryside on the Fosse Way about half a mile south of the M40 to watch the final stage. The sky was clear, we could see commercial aircraft about, there was no immediate light pollution and the moon was sharply defined.  At 22.50 I got out of the car to took a photo with my 5 megapixels digital camera.  It was shakey (I was cold and tired but didn’t want to miss the eclipse) but there was a clear red point below the moon and a little to the right.  I thought it must be a glitch, so I took several more photos (all shakey but with same red point) then I was too cold and got back in the car.  We watched the rest of the eclipse thru’ the (murky!) windscreen.  Because I was sure it was a camera glitch, I didn’t scan the sky for the dot - all my attention was on the eclipse.   When I looked at the photos on the PC, I found I couldn’t put the red point down to a problem with the camera, however I played about with the photos (using very basic Kodak software).  Other blips were obviously just blips, but this one appears spherical and holds up as that under zoom.  When I saw the Puget Sound photo, it looked to me just the same.

Anyway the one object became 4 and the moved in and out of a ""V"" formation (covering about 1/4 of a mile in their wanderings).   Interestingly a white Cessna was moving directly at them at what looked like exactly the same altitude.  Once the cessna was about a couple of hundred yards from them, they regrouped in a V formation, and the formation became a light red and then they all disappeared from view (almost as the Cessna was on top of them and within a few seconds of changing color).

On Tuesday March 6, 2007 at 2038 hours, I was driving south on Starkweather Road in Plainfield, Connecticut, returning home with my son after dropping off one of his friends. Starkweather Road is a winding country road, and it was very dark, the sky was beautiful and clear with many visible stars. There were no leaves on the trees to interfere with the view of the sky, and I was driving past a clearing or small field. According to Google Earth, the coordinates of my approximate position at the time were 41* 41’ 23.22” N, 71* 53’ 47.07” W, elevation 271 ft. It was three days after the total Lunar Eclipse which took place on March 3, 2007. I was looking straight ahead, concentrating on the road, careful of deer that sometimes enter the road without warning. Out of the Eastern sky, a bright light caught my eye. I thought I was seeing a shooting star, but this light was perfectly round, with no aura or tail, and did not disappear in a flash as a shooting star does. It was slightly smaller than the end of a pencil eraser in the sky, but I have no idea how large it really was. It seemed much higher than a plane would fly, and did not blink or twinkle like an incandescent light. It was pure, bright white, and traveled from horizon to horizon, East to West in approximately 2 seconds. I was so surprised I slowed my car to almost a complete stop. My son is much taller than I am, and he did not see the light because the roof of the car was blocking his view. When I got home, I called my boyfriend who is a mathematical engineer, currently residing in Utah to tell him about “the biggest, brightest shooting star I have ever seen”. He believes what I saw was a UFO. After discussing it in detail, I came to the conclusion that it was not a shooting star because I have seen many in my lifetime, and this had none of the same characteristics.

Bright white light appeared suddenly at about five minutes past dawn. Haze located all around the light seemed to be morning cloud cover considering it covered a much larger area than the light traveled as I watched. Stars were not visible towards the west where the cloud cover was minimal neither were they visible towards the east. The clooud cover that the light sat admidst of, at the time it was visible, was quite thick yet light seemed to be visible below the cloud line. It brightly represented itself 10 degrees to the right of your view if looking towards the east for the sunrise according to my view. Moon was still visible at the time and located towards the west. First sighted through tree line. Light had displayed itself in my line of sight, about half way up the hundred foot trees(approx) as I stood approx. one hundred yards away.  Rose in altitude semi-quickly. 10 minutes later light shown about thirty feet or 1/3 of tree's height(approx)above the tree that it shown through the midst of about ten to fifteen minutes previous. At this point it seems to be getting duller in light. My hypothesis considering the amount of decrease in the intensity of the light leads me to beleive that it may be traveling easternly slowly but is increasing in altitude dramatically. From the half hour mark when I walked out of view of this sight to about fifteen minutes after, the amount of wildlife and general noise coming from the wooded surroundings picked up dramatically. Birds came quick and plentiful. I have no idea if this has anything to do with odd light sighting but it was a very quick nature wake up if i must say so myself.At approximently forty five minutes after original sighting, sun is breaking the tree line, absolute no sign of bright light that was originally sighted, nor sign of anything resembling with lower intesity, which was my hope. At least to see some sign that it was really there. My guess is that this sight would have been easily viewable in the south eastern corner of Pennsylvania maybe as far as Philadelphia. Definetly would have been viewable from all locations in and around Berks County, PA.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,40.4513,-75.8094

With my best friend from school, while in the side yard at his house, we heard loud sound of jet plane coming over trees in park across the street. In less than one second there was an F-4 fighter plane chasing a glowing orange ball about 20 feet in diameter, 75 to 80 feet in front of the F-4. They flew almost directly over our head at less than 200 feet. The F-4 and the glowing orange object continued out over the adjacent interstate highway for a mile or so, toward the River de Peres. Before they got to the river, still at just above treetop height, the orange ball abruptly changed direction by approximately 90-degrees, and increased speed to the point that it was able to cross half the sky (60 degrees of angle) from left to right and achieve an altitude of 10 miles or more, in less a quarter second. The object then, just as abruptly, stopped dead in the sky, and it appeared to be taking a position so as to better observe the F-4 as it banked around looking for it. Or so it seemed to a 13-year-old’s imagination. After the glowing orange object abruptly changed course, the F-4’s engines--previously very loud--suddenly became almost silent, and he banked right and left a couple of times as if he were looking for the object. He then continued for a couple of seconds, and made a wide sweeping turn over the River de Peres, and doubled-back over his previous path. After a few seconds, the glowing orange spherical object sitting still in the sky shot away at incredible speed and was completely out of sight within an eighth of a second. It has been many years since this occurred, and I just want to make sure that it gets reported. Back then it never occurred to me to report it; much less did I know whom I would report it to. I have discussed this with the other witness as recently as 14 years ago, and our recollections were very similar, but not in the level of detail as I have included, herein. For the record, I believe there may be good explanations behind such phenomena, which go beyond ascribing them to alien intelligence.

Early morning drizzle stopped around noon, sky was clear blue with low white cloud rolls which were approximately 300 feet above the small hills of about the same height.  While driving south on PA State Route 51 a few miles south of downtown Pittsburgh just after noon a darker spot appeared in the end of one of these clouds seen at the top right of the windshield.  A quick look determined it was probably a puff of black smoke but another look was surprising to see a round saucer shapped craft slide out of the cloud into clear blue sky.  It was moving slowly from right to left bringing it closer but was tipped at about a 45 degree away.  Shortly after appearing in clear sky the craft went to a higher level about twice the height it had been at.  When it reached the higher level it still had the slow sideward motion and same degree of tip.  The motion to the higher lever was faster than the slow sideward movement but did not start out slow then get faster and slow down before stopping.  It was one smooth move and being tipped at that degree it carried the craft farther away and easily seen from the top of the windshield as it slowly crossed over the highway.  When it reached a point where it could be seen out of the driver's side window it suddenly came back down to about the same level it was when first seen.  The smooth fast motion back down was the same as when it went up and the tip never changed so it came closer.  When it stopped it still had the same slow sideward motion and it was observed sliding into the end of another cloud roll.  This craft never wavered and moved as if it was following a beam, when it went higher the craft maintained the same slant.  Assuming the visible part was the bottom of the craft no features,lights or sound was noted.  Judging by the height of the hills and clouds the size of this disc would be about the same as a small plane's wingspan.

I said to her, ""Do you see what I see"" and she said ""yes"" or ""I think so"".  It was like seeing something and not believing what you are seeing.  I wish I had taken her number or she had taken mine.  I said it must be some kind of publicity stunt for an upcoming movie or a radio station promotion or something like that.

A week later as I was 19 years old and living at a rooming house  as I went to take a shower on the third floor on a Saturday afternoon as I had a date and a young man with long Blond hair and wearing a white outfit and wearing dark sunglasses walked into the restroom and came straight to the shower as I opened the door and he grabbed me by my groin and turned and left. I immediatedly got dressed and went to the lobby to report this to the desk clerk and asked him if he saw a young man with Blond hair wearing dark sunglasses come down and he said no as at that time another man came down and said a young man wearing sung! lasses o pended the shower door on the second floor and turned around and left but did not touch him as he did  me.

It was about 8 or 9 pm, and as we were walking towards the sea, we could feel a presence or something. I turned around to look behind me, and I saw 7 to 11 little bipods who looked like penguins. They appeared to be about 3 feet tall, and the reason the reminded me of penguins were because they had no ears, and there was a V-shape lighter color on their chests, like the coloring of penguins. I turned to my companion, who was also 16, and said, “ Don’t look now, but we are being followed” My friend stopped and turned to look, and I said, “Do you see what I see?” and he said yes, and I said, “ Let’s run” and so we did, we ran until we were wore out, about a quarter of a mile, ( which is strange because we both did track sports well ) and we turned and faced the strange guys following us, and we were breathing really hard, and I noticed they were not breathing hard at all. They looked at us, and then walked, single file, around us and disappeared into a coyote bush, by the side of the dirt road we were walking on.  We caught our breath, and we ran to the edge of the cliffs overlooking the sea. We sat down and talked about our strange experience, and then we decided to go back to the bush and attempt to talk to them. We did that, and we heard nothing. They were gone, seemed like. We then got our senses back, and became very frightened, and hurried home. When I got home from what was a short hour walk to the beach, we discovered that we were missing at least 3 hours. I got in after 12:30 AM and was grounded. Other people saw things that night as well. My high school news paper wrote about it and said a lot of people thought they saw a UFO but it was a weather balloon.  My little brother, who was 5 at the time saw it (the craft), and was so frightened that he ran and slept with the parents for a week. The man next door, who saw it, start! ed drink ing again. I have no recollection of seeing any craft; I have a healthy fear of grays and other alien creatures. My experience was also written about in Tom Dongo’s book, The Alien Tide. (pg 59) I apologize for reporting this some 40 years later. I am really frightened of the grays. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",,34.5021,-120.1287

The disc was east of Mt. Cucamonga and was above the Cajon mountain pass.  When I first noticed the disc, it was stationary.  It then descended from its position high above the mountain range moving diagonally from right to left at an angle of about 45 degrees.  It covered that entire distance in less than three seconds.  I see many commercial planes in the valley flying into and out of Ontario International Airport, which is in the valley below the sighting.  I would judge the object to have been three or four times larger than a large airliner.  The object could have been larger as I have no way of knowing its distance from my location.  It descended at a steady pace and disappeared from view behind the mountain range, so I feel certain it was not over the valley as its size remained constant.

Looking to the NNE, I saw something approaching in the sky, about 20 degrees above the horizon, that I thought was a piece of paper blowing in the wind. It was bright white. I noticed what I thought was a jet and contrail behind it in the far distance when I first saw it, but could not resolve it.  It did not tumble, except once or twice it dimmed as if it might be tumbling. I thought it might be a bird, but it was clearly not acting like a bird, in that it was not dimming and brightening regularly like a bird would do flapping its wings. It seemed to be simply blowing in the wind. Fortunately, I had a camera, and took some pictures of it. The photos do not clear up what it is, however. It moved overhead and I lost it in the sun.

It was, like the airport itself, directly north of my position and about 60 degrees above the horizon line.  The object maintained its exact position in the sky for 10 minutes, though, as its coloring shifted from white to gray, it may have been rotating.

I at first thought it was one of the planets, but realized it was still too early and not yet dark enough to see any stars.  I told my wife I thought it was something reflecting light from the sun but it was stationary and rather large.  I told her I thought maybe it might be the International Space station but I frankly do not know if that is ever visible to the naked eye.  I just sensed it was unusual so I went into the house to retrieve a pair of binoculars. I returned to the backyard and looked up at the object and could see then what looked like red glowing lights around the bright center circular object.  We could also see a jetliner moving through the sky and it too was reflecting some light.   My wife looked at the object through the binoculars also but did not try to adjust the lenses to her eyes and did not see the detail I did.  She said she could only see that it was a bright object.  This is when it got very interesting.  I got the binoculars back from her and as I was looking at object I saw approximately six smaller bright looking circular lights move away from  the brighter object we had first seen.  They moved away slowly from the center object at first and paused in a pattern around it.  They then suddenly took off at high speed and simply disappeared from view.  The center glowing object disappeared also.  As I was telling my wife what I was seeing she looked back only to see the original object was gone and the sky was now empty in the area.

This lasted 5 seconds or so before it disappeared. Our daughter had joined us on the patio and about 20 minutes later I noticed in the approximate same spot in the sky as I had seen the meteorite 3 very bright large lights just stationary in the sky, in a shape of an arch.  One on top, one below it but slight out to the right and then a 3rd beneath it, and slightly into the left.  Suddenly a 4th light appeared parallel to the second but much farther to the left of the others.  Then a 5th appeared, and then the 1st one disappeared and then reappeared. The lights were not fading in or fading out they just appeared.  There were stationary the entire time. My husband went in to get his camera and took a picture of three of the lights, but the shutter speed was not correct and the picture did not come out very good.  Our daughter grabbed her digital camera and came back out with the video feature turned on.  She captured a few seconds of it, but unfortunately handed me the camera and I not realizing she had it on video tape, held it down to my side, when she told me she was videotaping and I got it back up facing the direction the lights were in they had all disappeared. The lights were over the Keller/Southlake direction looking toward the airport.  There were several plans visible in the sky, and these lights were 100's of times larger than planes. We snaped a picture of a plane that was in the sky, slightly further away and to the south east of us, the difference in size is incredible. We watched the news last night and this morning thinking that several people would have reported seeing this, but have heard nothing. I would expect that pilots flying in and out of DFW would have reported this sight to the Tower. I looked at the picture my husband took today and was surprised at what I saw.  I was expecting to see three blurry blots of light, but instead all three look like a child had scribbled in the night sky using lights. The video my daughter took clearly shows two of the lights or orbs. ((NUFORC Note:  No time for the sighting indicated by witness.  PD))",2007-11-28T00:00:00,32.93451,-97.251655

Then the fiery streaks stopped dead in their tracks and started floating, seeming to hover.   The lights were much brighter than that of other airplanes seen flying into the Dallas Fort Worth airport.  Then one of the lights went out then reappeared again.  Then all lights disappeared.

I said to her, “What is that, a blimp?” and she responded jokingly, “No it’s a UFO!” We first saw the object when we were about a mile away from it.  As we got closer our mouths dropped open and we both just said “what the  ....” We were shocked.  It was right above us just hovering over the road.  You could see the UFO almost perfectly.  It had three bright lights on the bottom in the shape of a triangle.  It was saucer shaped, silver a little ""bubble"" type thing on top.  It was spinning and just hovering.  We pulled over because we wanted to get a better glimpse.  There were about six other cars behind us that were also stopped looking.  As soon as we pulled out the camera it moved upward behind the clouds, (it was a cloudy night) Like I said, it was clearly visible and big but you could tell it was a pretty good distance above.  At first sight it was hovering below the clouds but once people started stopping it hovered up farther into the sky.  It started to move west so we decided to follow.  Once again we pulled over and started trying to take pictures but every time I would move so we could see it would move a little more hiding being the treetops.  We took five pictures with my friend’s digital camera.  Then it vanished behind the treetops.  There was a bank parking lot so we decided to pull in the lot and park.  As soon as we parked and were about to get out we started hearing this strange loud noises.  Noises I honestly can not explain.  We have NEVER heard anything like it.  For some reason, as scared as we were we got out because we wanted to see if we could actually see what was making those noises.  It almost seemed like two “aliens” communicating to one another.  We were both just frozen there so scared and then all of a sudden the noises started going “crazy” and a dog that was in the backyard where the weird noises were coming from started barking and honestly seemed like it was being att! acked so we jumped in the car and took off.  We both were just stunned and so scared.  Neither one of us really believed in this, until now that is.  After returning home we decided to see what her camera had caught.  All the pictures were gone except one which you can barely see anything.  If you zoom in you can see a white object.  Now this was the last picture taken and this was when the UFO was going away before it vanished.  This area was very lit up and there were a lot of clouds in the sky, but you can see none of that except the UFO. This should tell you how bright it was.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,42.58140054054054,-82.92209621621622

She called to me to come back outside with some urgency in her voice and I did so and she pointed up and said ""is that a plane?""  I looked up and saw a distant object almost directly overhead about the size of a pea reflecting sunlight causing a glare that made it difficult to observe.  My wife remarked that she had been watching it for a couple minutes and it had been stationary with slight movements from her vantage point of leaning back it leaning back in a swivel rocker type of patio chair.  Additionaly she had been observing it where the eaves of the garage and main house came together at a 90 degree angle and and so the object was framed in that view.  She didn't call me until it began moving and she wanted me to see it.   When I couldn't see it clearly I went inside and grabbed my 8 x 42 fieldglasses for a look.  The obect could be seen very clearly then.  It was all white, with a flat square bottom with radiused corners, and a domed topside.    For all practical purposes of comparison it reminded me of the porportions and shape of a dome shaped 2' X 2' replacement skylight cover if it had radius corners instead of 90 degree corners at a builders center.   It's course was basically north to south but in a bobbing weaving fashion rather than straight line.   The size in my field of view of the field glasses was about the size of the skylight on my neighbors' house which is about 80 feet away.  It was easy to keep it in view and focused there were no control surfaces or propellars or engine nacelles.   We traded the glasses back and forth several times and I had to move to end of house when a pine tree blocked viewing.   I thought I would lose view when it went over the moutain but instead it descended in front of the mountain and it was obscured by the foothills in an apparent landing.   Being that we are a few miles from Ft. Huachaca it could be new technology.   It wasn't 'old' technology as I have seen examples them in flight.

He asked excitedly if I remembered the video of the Mexico City sightings on tv?  (A UFO surrounded by numerous white lights in a formation in the sky) Yes was my answer, then he stated he was looking at that type of sighting from his home.  He described a craft with about 40 white lights in formation and gave me a local landmark for a reference point so i could confirm what he was seeing.  I ran outside only to find a large tree was blocking the location of the sky this formation was observed. However, I continued to talk by phone, getting updates about the sighting.  Within 5 minutes, I too noticed a bright white object about 30 degrees above the horizon just seemingly hanging in the sky to the east of my location, I confirmed with the original witness where I saw the object and concluded that we were viewing the same craft, (Except I could not see the dozens of starlike objects) very slowly drifting ESE.   Please note, that the sky condition at the beginning of this sighting was a high thin overcast with numerous breaks and as the observation continued to its conclusion, from west to east, a more solid condition developed.   I was so excited I forgot for about 10 minutes that I had a pair of binoculars in my car, so I ran for them hoping for a better look.  With them, I now could see dozens of white starlike objects moving independently but in formation around the craft.  At this point I just wanted to concentrate on watching this and terminated the phone conversation.  As I focused on the 1 main craft, the largest object, I could see it was a saucer shaped white object, rotating, that seemed to change shape streching vertically with odd shaped structures on it.  It seemed to dart around at times, forcing me to search for it, eventually turning to the west and started to track towards me.   Most of the time it just appeared to hang in mid air rotating, but as it eventually moved closer I had better resolution on it, noting that the bottom seemed to have a yellowish glow.  Also, several times I saw air carrier jet aircraft tracking N-S or NW-SE in the area above 10,000 ft. wondering can they see what I see?   I was so awed by this craft, appearing to change shape as it rotated, banking and wobbling at times.  At one point only, I saw what appeared to be brilliant crystal like lights on the parimeter of the craft.  The craft eventually moved to a point about 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon when I lost sight of it in the overcast.   When I returned home, I made notes, checked for the 4 and 5 PM METAR weather at the local airport, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Int'l. (KAVP), both report were, no clouds below 12,000 ft., also the winds aloft for the area, noting that at all altitudes a west (260degrees)wind was blowing.

Finally checking the NUFORC log today, I found 3 reports around 5am of May 9 that share elements of my sighting, but I believe that I witnessed a more complete, longer duration event.  Returning home after a very late night at work (normal for me), I had just pulled off I-280 at the Foothill College (Moody Rd.) exit when a bright light in the southern sky caught my attention.  I am thoroughly familiar with the constellations and celestial bodies, so anything ""out of place"" is immediately evident.  This object was at least Sirius- or Jupiter-bright, in the constellation Ophiuchus and somehwat east of Arcturus.  Jupiter had already set or was obscured by the coastal ridge.  The object was moving very slowly north- or northwestward and at first I took it to be an incoming aircraft.  Expecting its brilliant, steady white light to begin strobing any second, I was astonished when instead it sprouted a ""vapor trail"" on its left side that mimicked a classic comet tail (I noted the time [5:06] on my car's digital clock about now).  This trail was highly structured and almost perfectly triangular.  It then began to grow steadily but maintained its geometrical shape.  As I continued to watch (I had parked my car on the periphery of Foothill College by this point) it was as though the mass of the original object were being converted into this growing exhaust trail.  Eventually, the object was completely ""consumed"" and no longer visible, leaving behind a glowing elliptical cloud with a very long major axis.  This cloud easily covered the area of a small to mid-size constellation, perhaps larger than Ursa Minor or about half of Hydra.  It faded gradually but I could still make out traces of it 10 to 15 minutes later when I arrived at home.  As far as altitude and location, I would estimate it to be somewhat higher (2000-3000 ft.) and closer to the coast than the San Jose observer.  I fully expected some mention of it to be made immediately on local radio (there was nothing subtle about this!), but KGO, KCBS, and KQED-FM were all silent.  Nothing could be found in print the next day.  I have been intending to check the NUFORC log all this time, but the more usual weirdnesses of life have kept me distracted.  By the way, I am a CSETI member and have witnessed a wide range of UFO phenomena, but nothing before quite like this.

I got the feeling it was one object at the time but was not sure ,I could not see any mass between the lights. The sets of lights appeared the same color with a white center light changing to a light but bright blue, with what apeared to be rotating or flasing lights around it (they were changing from red ,green, yellow ).I got back in my vehicle and headed on to work , this was the same general direction the lights were moving.

I again could see the lights which had moved on farther towards Moscow (and above the Snake River Canyon). The perspective of the lights seemed to change but it was from the greater distance (I still believe it was a triangle shaped object but at a greater distance from me). The distance was greater and so was the haze but the direction of the object changed slightly as almost following the river.

We were surprised this hadn't been seen by the volume of traffic on 101.

Lauderdale spiraling pinpoint of white light, spirals across the night sky with neon green cloud alongside. I was 15 and living with my married sister (26) while she was pregnant in a residential area of Fort Lauderdale, FL near the inter-coastal waterway. We went into her backyard, behind the pool to steal lemons off of her neighbor's lemon tree.  It was dark and a clear night. My sister exclaimed & grabbed my arm & pointed up towards the sky.  STRAIGHT UP was the brightest white light I'd ever seen (brighter than a Klieg light), a pinpoint of white light that spiraled out in lines that were so even they could have been made with a 'compass'... the pinpoint of light continued to shine as the spiraling lines filled the entire upper horizon... but what was odd is that we could see through the widening white, spiraling lines... we could see the starry sky through the widening white lines.  Next to the pinpoint of white light was a neon green cloud.  A cloud, like a white cloud you'd seen on a blue-sky day, except this cloud was green and it glowed like a green neon sign.  We both stood there with our mouths agape and watched this entire phenomenon for about 2 minutes... the white, transparent, WIDE spiral lines filled the entire upper horizon and then the white pinpoint just stopped emanating light and the green cloud took a few more minutes to fade away.  Apparently, thousands of people in Ft. Lauderdale saw this and called into police.  NASA claimed the next day that it was a 'reflection off of a rocket that was shot over the ocean... as the sun was going down.'  The only problem is, it was DARK, it was 8:30 PM and the sun sets on the Gulf/west side of Florida.  We were on the east side of Florida, quite close to the Atlantic ocean (perhaps 1 mile).  There was no way this was a reflection off a rocket as it was STRAIGHT UP and the pinpoint of light was emanating from above the earth (from space) and it shown down to the atmosphere where it spread out across the entire upper sky.  In my opinion, some superior visitors were taking a very large 'photo' of the area.  The green cloud was translucent.  The white spiral lines were transparent.  I work in the film business and there is no light we have today that is as bright as the pinpoint of very white light was.

When i zoom in on the photo (which is 5 mega pix), the object appears metalic, spherical, and does NOT resemble a plane.  I only have this one picture and did NOT see the object when taking the picture. I was looking for someone to help identify the object in the photo.

I looked up over my head in the sky and noticed a bright light. I pointed it out to my brother-in-law. It wasn't easy to find because it was very small. Smaller than a planet when you can see it in daylight. The light looked as if it were reflected light from the sun on the object. I could not tell the shape of the object but soon the reflected light turned about 90 deg and could not see the light no more. I could tell that there was an object but it was too far away to discern it's shape or color. All of a sudden, there seemed to be a billow of smoke. Best described when a vehicle punches the gas and the exhaust billows from the tailpipe. Very similiar to that. Then, it appeared as if the object moved vertically from it's stationary spot...and disappeared into thin air. This all occured in the clear blue sky and no clouds around. There was a jet flying near by but unrelated to this object (different elevation and stayed on vector). This object did not behave the normal aircraft I have seen. Kinda cool!

It was around 9:45 pm. and I got up to look out of my back door and I saw almost in the same location as my other sightings, a light. This time it was farther away and a lot higher in the sky. To the naked eye it looked like a star. But with the binoccoulars you could clearly see that there were numerous flashing lights on it. I could not see the shape of this craft because the lights were facing in my direction. The lights were flashing red, green, and a white/yellow color. There was no paticular pattern to the lights and the lights were very brightly colored. The craft stayed in the same spot for almost 20 minutes. Then I turned on my flood lights to see if there were any deer in the field and there was. Not that that has anything to do with the sighting other than deer have been in the field each time I have spotted activity . Then to my disbelief.....I looked to my right and going just tree top level there was this craft as plain as day that was .........hmmmm.......lets say a Stella Dora anise biscut shape (lol) no really...take one of those biscuts and look at the side shape of it and that is what this craft looked like and it was totally outlined in very bright lights that were round and flashed on and off. It moved quickly and quietly and I got to see three sequences of flashing lights and then it was gone. Then the other craft that I had been watching slowing moved to the right and away and then up a little and then it was just gone. Like the lights went out or it just dissapeared. I can't believe that I have seen so much activity or that no one else has seen anything. Oh yeah..one more thing. I do not know if this is related or not but on 9-11 around 2 pm I heard some jets that sounded military so I looked out my back door and there were two jets flying wing to wing , tree top level, and they were sky blue cloud color almost hardly visable. Then about 5 minutes later a big jet flew over in the exact spot that these two j! ets were , now this wouldn't pique my interest so much but they flew over in the exact spot that I have been seeing these crafts. Now I thought that it might be the Presidents plane because he was in Pa. that morning but if it was his plane entourage why was his group flying so low. Unless that is what they do. Anyway, that is all I have for now. I can't wait for this sight to get updated. And I hope that all of my entries have been going through........  blu :) ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

The object seemed to be diamond shaped.  It was viewed through fairly high powered binoculars.  The object remained stationary fairly high up in the sky for about 30 minutes after initial spotting.  It then completely disappeared for about 1 minute and then later reappeared in the same spot.  Other stars could be seen in the background while this object disappeared, so I don't believe any cloud obstructed it.  It was a very clear night. The object remained in it's original spot for another 30 or so minutes, during which time a small ball of white light was emitted from it.  This ball of light travelled underneath the main object, in a straight line (left to right) for about 5 seconds and then disappeared instantly.

While things have been real slow the past 2 years ,it certainly was not the case 3-4 years ago . But I still take time to view at least once or twice a week .That being said , While laying on my back looking and scanning skyward ( I use nite vision due to so much light pollution here and I have managed to darken the street lamps around my location ) expecting at best to view a few satellites or un explained light movements since it is extremly hard to distinguish shape and form at the usual distance I encounter as  I work the sky  in quadrants I was totally taken back when from the NNE I caught the outline of a V shape closing in. At that initial distance I thought it was a repeat of the diamond formation of four indivisual craft That I viewed 3 years earlier ,As it became closer I realized it was a single craft, very large, how large I cannot say as I had no reference pointsbut easily seen with scope  sillouetted against a las vegas night sky . B-2 was a quik second guess as it had more ov a delta shspe but this was quickly elimanated as it passed directly overhead it was more delta shaped leaning more to a boomerrang -V shaped another thing that i found aerodynamically strange was one side being slightly more elongnated than the other, there seem to be darker pod shapes under each side (wing??) still no lights and no sound and no contrails of any kind and was not on a glide slope of any kind as it was definitly under its on power. Also never has there been any commercial traffic use this path that I can recall in all my years here . Its speed seem to be at a pretty good clip my guess is at least 400 knots but hard to say as I had very little reference points as to size, height  only that it covered f! rom my i nitial sighting which was approx 20 deg above the north horizen (darker sky & better viewing) to where I lost sight as it approached the more lit up sky over the strip approx 11 mi away in about 40  to 45sec .

It's DARK here.  'Somethin' catches my eye that's 'not there' normally. I'm facing due West and I see 5 'yellowish lights' in a line over the Silverbell Mountains about 340 degrees relative @ 30 deg azimuth. *   * *   *   *              Kind'a like this, but in more of an arc. .  They all just 'appeared' and hovered.  They weren't aircraft markers 'cause they blink even viewed dead on... I'm used to seein' those.  They weren't flares either... My long distance eyesight is really good (after the operation) While I'm lookin' at this... a meteor makes a trail left to right 'n vaporized like a flare. 'Seen that before too. So... all of these lights decend in unison beyond the mountain and in the same formation. I keep lookin'.  All of a sudden... now I have 3 lights of the same intensity about 350 degrees relative... 20 deg azimuth.  * * *  Not quite as high (altitude) as the 1st set,  but these disappear in about 3 seconds.  They were moving south very slowly. (Wind here is from the south... so they were against the wind.) There's a 3/4 moon w/no clouds.  Today I stood exactly where I'd been last night 'n gauged where I saw 'em relative to this rather tall leaning saguero in the distance.  'Can always see the shadow of that.  The Silverbells are about 30 miles away... maybe a bit more.  All of the 'lights' disappeared beyond the Silverbells judging from the mountain contour.  They weren' pop flares or parachute flares.  Luminosity was steady, altho not 'starlike'.  There's nothing' on the west side of the Silverbells for a good long distance. Gauging from the leaning cactus as a vertical marker... they were above and beyond the Silverbells.  I see the helo's from D-M AFB on nite-ops frequently... so it's not them. These lights weren't as bright as anti-collision lights 'n did not move other than up 'n down... altho I never saw them go up.  That was prob'ly due to the mountain contour. My wife was outside (same time) but putterin' with the garden hose waterin' the trees.  She swears she's not hard of hearing... but she is... 'Cause I'm yellin' ""LOOK, LOOK WEST..."" 'n she's oblivious. Somethin' else happened while I was starin' west.  An airliner flew directly overhead.  They never do that.  Altitude about 2K'.  'Flew directly between 'me' 'n the moon so I could determine it was a 737 type by the shape 'n engine locations.  'Wonder if the crew didn't vector the aircraft for a look at what I was lookin' at as well?  He was comin' from Tucson airport flyin' West by NW.  'Lowest I've seen 'em fly 'cause usually I never hear 'em.  'Heard this one tho. Picked up his outline when he crossed the moon clearly.  They usually transit way south of here in that direction. I know that when ya look at a light in the dark long enuff... it'll appear to move... which is why I took that bent cactus as a reference point. In relation to the bent cactus... they moved.  I'm lookin' West by Southwest.  Phoenix is 180+ miles N/NW.  All the roads here are laid out true N/S/E/W so it's easy to orient direction.  I'm lookin' at these lights at approx 25-30 deg azimuth to the horizon.  Dunno how tall the mountains over there are, but at least 800'-1,000' above this plateau.  Yuma's too far NW 'n in this direction.  It'd be south of Ajo 'n even that would be NW of where I was lookin'.  Only thing inna straight line would be the Organ Pipe Cactus Nat'l monument north of Soronito Mex.   I'm facing Mexico 'cause of the angle the Pima county border runs.  Whatever they were... they would be too high to be flares I think... 'n not bright enuff.  Those mag flares burn rather 'blue'.  'Saw no other activity in that direction... 'No aircraft lights or anything.  These were yellow(ish) 'n not as bright as the stars (which were visible) but ruffly the same diameter as a small star. 'Bout the size ya see in Orions belt. I considered all that when I eyeballed these things.  There ain't s'posed to be NUTHIN' in that direction. There's no habitation in that direction 'cept for a few Rez shacks scattered about. No real 'roads' either other than Rt. 85. Rough measurements using Microsoft Streets and Trips, straight line distance, statute miles:  Roughly this location to rough location of Luke AFB: 110 miles. Roughly this location to areas south of Gila Bend: 80 miles. I think there are targets there. Roughly this location to middle of restricted area east of Yuma: 150 miles   Direction of the lights would be over the Papago Rez toward Organ Pipe Nat'l Monument. That's south of Yuma.  I'm on the western edge (and middle of) the Saguaro National Park West.  'Bout 1/8 mile east from the AWP canal... (due west) 'n the Rez is on the other side of that. 'Canal runs N/S and angles to the S/E 'bout a half mile or so south of my pos. Gila Bend is NW from my pos.   As I mentioned... from my LOS... these things were south of Ajo, in-line with the Organ Pipe NM.  There's nuthin' else out there 'cept RT. 85 between the mountains.  No clouds... This wasn't a reflection... these lights were distinct. Other witness:  My sister-in-law spotted 'em when she was leaving last nite before I did.  'Sez she sat in her car (in the road) 'n watched 3 of 'em for several minutes..  One thing... she said she saw one of 'em rise and cross over the top of another , then settle in formation alongside. Then they all disappeared together. Military ranges:  All that kind'a ran thru my head while I'm lookin' at these lights. Too far south... unknown distance bu my sis-in-law said they appeared larger and were a bit further north (about due west) than when I spotted 'em... which indicates they moved SW.  Only other lights are the Silverbell mine road... 'n they're orange 'n sort'a 'wink' in the distance 'cause of the atmosphere.  These didn't and were steady.  They didn't behave like flares or helos.  Way too fast for either when they did move.  Neither did they describe an arc.  They were rather up-down or straight lines. Weird!       I'm not given to makin' stuff like this up... 'n bein' a sailor I've seen lots'a stuff at sea 'n while airborne at a great distance... aircraft, birds, clouds... reflections, explosions, flares, weather balloons, sea critters 'n even waterspouts.  'Livin' where I do... I'm always concious of 'what's out there'... especially at night. Anything 'new' will catch my attention. I know there's normally nuthin' in that direction, so this got my attention 'n I eyeballed it for as long as the 'lights' were visible... Taking bearings and approximate azimuth in my head... which most 'lubbers' dunno how to do. Flares don't behave like that... 'n neither do helo's.  I see enuff H-60's 'n UH-1's out here... as well as the stuff Border Patrol flies at night to know what they look like at a distance. These 'lights' fit none of those parameters. The lights never wavered in formation and were distinct.  None of that 'winking' or fuzzy effect.  I mite add... nobody'd been drinkin' anything prior.  Well... that's IT.... I'm convinced I've finally seen UFO's... 'cause there's no other way to explain it.   There is NOTHING... in that direction but desert all the wa to the border.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,,

It was raining lightly that night. We  had  left Ladner on Hwy 17 North and were on the southbound exit to Hwy 99, when I first noticed the large bright multi-colored lights (blue, purple, white, orange and green) to the northeast over Surrey.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, but as we neared the Boundary Bay Airport the craft passed over our car and despite the fact that we were going 100 km/h seemed to hover keeping pace with us.  I looked out the passenger window and saw the expansive square-shaped dark grey underside (no identifying markings) with 4 sets of 3 equally  spaced  (about 30+/-10 ft apart) oval lights lined up end-to-end emanating from the center to each corner.  It was no more than 1000 feet off the ground and large enough to block the rain. There were no seams, hatches, flaps, or tail rudders visible, no discernable means of propulsion , and no sound. It continued southwest, and when I last saw the craft it was following Hwy 17 South  in a slow and unhurried manner. The sighting left me shaken and dumbfounded .  I called McCord Air Force Base  about a year ago to see if anyone could help to explain what I had seen, but I have yet to hear from them.

The first night we witnessed the same object approximately at 7:00pm while trick or treating with my wife, my neighbor’s wife and our children. All three of us witnessed the object traveling in the same direction height etc. I witnessed the object again on 11/1/05 around same time and on the third evening I was outside and it appeared again. I ran to my truck and got my Nikon D70 digital camera and quickly tried to focus it on the object, while resting the camera on the hood of my truck to steady the camera. The camera had trouble auto-focusing and I switched the auto mode to sports, and was able to get three pictures, 2 of the object and the third of nothing many seconds later. I have the RAW – NEFF pictures for anyone who wants to analyze them, however you will need Nikon Capture 4 software to view the images. My neighbor wants nothing to do with this, nor does my wife. An unknown man near to us during the Halloween sighting on 10/31/05, exclaimed, “It is a UFO!,” but we don’t know who he was, he was not from our neighborhood. After I did a radio interview on Coast to Coast, a Suffolk man contacted me and described seeing the objects again three nights in a row. This is not the first time I have seen orbs traveling in this direction (roughly South to North) a friend and I practically chased one in the daytime in the fall of 2000. I have since learned how to set the parameters on my camera and will be ready the next time to hopefully get better pictures. I have been told that digital pictures are not as reliable as film photos, but still a pretty good amount of detail and authenticity should be able to be gleaned from these two photos by those who know what they are doing, since I have no background or experience in this type of research.

We went here to be alone together for a while before we went home (lived with her mom so this was our alone time ;) around 1 am we both noticed what looked like car headlights in the sky ahead of us. we soon noticed 3 pair of the lights flying in a strait line. They seemed really low 80 meters (just a little above the tree tops) and the lights were way more intense than anything I've ever seen on any aircraft. this would not be that unusual if there was some sort of sound but there was ""NO SOUND AT ALL"" and the lights would hover in one spot for minutes before moving. they all came from the same direction in total there was about 15 of them came in packs of 3 to 5 . They all seemed to come from the direction of the lake and end up going toward Louisville. They would all travel strait until they reached one point just about directly above us where they would separate travel in different directions then they would meet back up to begin traveling in a strait line again toward Louisville. The best way to describe it was a SILENT helicopter with two very large super bright spot lights mounted on the bottom. I could not see the shape of the craft because the lights were so bright. I must say the weirdness came from the craft feeling like it was 80 meters above me hovering and there was NO SOUND AT ALL all you can here is crickets and the occasional car in the distance. The crafts seemed to move a constant slow paced speed other than when they were completely hovering still.

I spotted a silver object hovering in the sky. Taking it for a plane, I returned my focus to the road. But within a few seconds, I glanced up again to see where the plane had moved to and it was still in the same spot. I watched it with full concentration, thinking perhaps it was a plane flying toward me, so it would soon get bigger as it approached. But it didn't. It stayed in the same exact spot. As I observed it longer, I noticed it was round in shape, not long and thin like an airplane and bright silver against the sky.

The area is between my grandparents house and my great aunt house. I got out of my truck noticing my headlamp needed batteries. I had gotten out my gun and was proceeding to get my hunting clothes and some spare batteries, when I heard some dry palm fronds cracking about 50 to 60 yards away. The moon was about half full and I believe it was waxing at the time. I noticed a very tall figure that seemed to look ash gray colored and seemed to be looking straight at me. I was having a difficult time  realizing what exactly I was looking at. In just a brief second, the being began moving across in front of me at an amazing stride. I realized this was really happening to me and quickly grabbed  and loaded my gun, not knowing what to expect. the being proceeded across in font f me approximately 35 to 40 yards until it came to the end of the yard. Then, in this amazing stride it stepped over(not jumped) a 6 strand bob wire fence. The fence was about 41/2 to 5 ft tall. For about 5 seconds U thought I was going crazy, and started to doubt my eyes. Then, all of the sudden, about 150 -175 yards away, a flock of sandhill cranes just erupted and went crazy cackling and slapping wings. I started thinking h my god,thi is really happening. then out of no where I saw a flash of light that appeared in the shape of an oval about 20 feet long to my left about 50 ft. the flash was almost that of a camera but only n the ground in a specific place to my left. I very quickly decided to get back in my truck and wait until day light to go hunting. As I calmed down, I realized this being didn't seem to have any body hair . I never saw the face. It was very slender with long legs and arms. I was VERY uncomfortable in the deer stand that morning and got out of the woods early that day. I reluctantly decided to talk to y grandparent about  what happened in fear for them because they are in their mid eighties. My grandpa told me he had heard something tapping on his window a few days before. they then told me to tell the police, who referred me to the local game warden. He suggested that I go out to the open field where the being had stepped over the fence and look for tracks. At that time only a few feet into the field (which was thick mud mostly). I found the first track. It was about 11 inches long about four inches wide at the toes. their were only three toes. It was about 3 inches wide at the  heal. I found a total of 3 tracks: 1 Full track and 2 partials. The stride was about 6 to 7 feet long. I reported it to the game warden who seemed to be uninterested in believing me. So I unintelligently decided to just leave this issue alone. Hunting early in the morning has been very difficult for me now since the encounter. I thought this happened in late October. after reviewing the star I marked in my journal, I realized the exact date was Nov. 4th. I apologize for letting you and other people down by not moving forward sooner. If ever given the opportunity again (which seem amazingly li! kely) to me, I promise to report the incident immediately.",2008-07-05T00:00:00,29.425400000000003,-81.3384

Interestingly, one of the skateboarders made the comment, ""it's spying on you."" My friend and I continued to play catch as the whole event felt somewhat surreal and there wasn't an instantaneous cohesive response by us. However, a few minutes later it grew too dark and we stopped playing catch. At that time we discussed the event and did not know what to make of it. As we walked down to the parking lot below the batting cages we hoped to see the skateboarders to ask them what they honestly thought it was but they were gone. After discussing the event, we postulated the only logical explanation was some sort of runaway kite but the seemingly constant altitude and velocity on a clear and breezeless night made that postulation unlikely to us.

On the night of May 4th at approximately 12:00 AM, I was sitting on the back porch having a cigarette. Earlier in the week I was driving down a highway (FM 2004) near my home. To my left I noticed what appeared to be two bright objects much larger than any star. They appeared to be changing positions, almost making formations with each other. It was hard for me to look at them and pay attention to the road at the same time. My first instinct was that I was crazy, and that they had to be planes or helicopters. The next time I had a chance to look for the objects they had moved a large distance in the sky. The next time I looked for them I could not find them. I was very curious about what I had seen, but it did not phase me that much. As I was nearing home I can see what appears to be a military aircraft flying overhead at a low altitude. The plane was flying low enough to where I could clearly make out the body of the aircraft from the lights on the underside of the plane. It was sort of an F16 type shape. It was definitely not a common aircraft. I do not recall if it made any noise. I got home and told myself that all I had seen were some uncommon airplanes flying in the area (possibly military). Throughout all of the last week that night has replayed in my mind. The more I think about it the more odd it becomes. On May 4th, as I was sitting outside something caught my attention to my left. I don’t know why I chose to look that direction at that time, but I almost wish I didn’t. What I saw left me sitting in my chair unable to move for several minutes. An object moving at an extremely rapid speed bolted across the sky away from my position. It had four lights lined up horizontally. They were huge and bright. They were mostly white but appeared to have a mixture of green and blue. I sat motionless in shock trying to come up with words to describe the object I had seen. My first thought of how to describe it was that it might have been 4 single objects moving sort of like a wave in some sort of an aura. While I was looking at the sightings report form on your website, I saw the word gaseous in your checklist. The word gaseous perfectly describes the object that I saw. The four lights were very individual, but they were all encompassed in the gaseous aura. It was a hazy gray color which was very contrasting to the bright white/green/blue’ish lights. It appeared to be shaped sort of like a boomerang. It was either flying at a very low altitude or it was an enourmous object. It was simply the largest thing I had ever seen in the sky. The final detail is that it dead silent and it seemingly appeared out of nowhere only to disappear as it bolted across the sky. I would say it was only visible for a few seconds, but I was looking at it head on from start to finish. The sighting really shook me up. I can definitely say that it was unidentifiable. I became very emotional, sort of terrified. I shed a few tears and finished my cigarette. I couldn’t stop looking at the sky even though I desperately wanted to go inside where I feel safe. About 5 minutes later I’m still sitting outside and am now having another cigarette. I have settled down a little bit. My eyes are still fixated on the sky though. I see what I am almost certain is a helicopter. This is not unusual at all and I did not think anything of it. I could barely hear it; it was pretty far off in the distance. A few minutes later, I start to hear a dull rumble. I recognized the sound as a jet instantly. It wasn’t loud, but it was the loudest noise at the time (it was very quiet). When I see the jet it was very similar to the one I had seen earlier in the week. Although this time it was at a much higher altitude and much farther away. It was flying in the relative direction of the unknown object I had seen about 10-15 minutes earlier. I’m writing this right now and it’s only been about an hour since all of this took place. I wanted to get my thoughts while I could still remember all of the details. I don’t know if I am going to talk about this with any of my friends of family yet. I’m scared that they’ll think I’m crazy. This sighting is so haunting to me that I feel I have to report it. I believe that I saw something that is truly unexplainable.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,29.0322,-95.4699

I ran through the house to get to a better vantage point, but by that time all three objects were gone.

(I was on the upper floor and didn't look up but sideways through the angled skylight.) At first I thought it was an odd reflection of a car on the street below, and for about 10-15 seconds I tried to get my bearings, figure out how in the world it was reflecting into this upward facing window. I then realized it was a flying craft.  I ran to the next skylight which I could stand directly below (inches from the glass) and continued observing the object. As the craft approached my vicinity, I noticed there were more than just the two ""headlights"" on the front. There was a series of six lights on the bottom of the craft about midship, in a 2x3 rectangle configuration extending from fore to aft. From either side was a light on each of what may have been the tips of a very short wingspan.  In total, there were 10 lights on the object, each off-white. (Groups were similarly colored, and each group varied in color temperature only slightly.) There were no blinking lights on the craft, and no red or green beacons, as per federal aviation regulations.  The object appeared to be about 50-100 feet above the treeline, due East, almost perfectly so. I could hear the object clearly through the window. It made a loud, low whooshing/rumbling sound unlike any aircraft I had heard before - almost otherworldly, like something you'd hear in the movies. It traveled fairly slowly, perhaps between 20-50 MPH, although this may be a poor estimate. Regardless, it was traveling FAR slower than a plane, and slower than I have seen most helicopters.  It flew over me, almost perpendicular. When it had passed over me, I could see what appeared to be two thin poles jutting out of the front of the craft in the vicinity of the ""headlights."" As it eclipsed my view, I quickly darted downstairs and out the door to continue my observation.  At this point, I had been observing the craft for about a minute and the trip downstairs took approximately 5 seconds. When I got outside and looked at the sky, I could no longer see the craft. I have a clear line of sight in the direction it was heading and estimate it should have taken approximately 1-2 more minutes for it to evade my sight. I also could no longer hear the object.  All said and done, I have never seen this lighting configuration before, and the sound it emitted was very odd - neither the sputter of a propeller nor the hum and hiss of a jet. I've lived near airports - large and small - all my life, and I've seen and heard a lot of aircraft, and this one was unlike any other.  Regarding this location, it is a heavily wooded and sparsely populated area and the nearest airports are 10 miles North and 15 miles South/South West respectively. There is, to my knowledge, no place within at least 5 miles to land an aircraft, even a helicopter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

As I got closer to it, I slowed down and rolled my window down. The formation was also heading north just parallel to the Interstate.  The formation of planes appeared to be flying very slow. Still heading north on US-127 and just past Broomfield Road, I went directly under it. It was not a formation of planes. It was a very large black triangle. I actually saw the shape and texture of it. It was about the size of a football field or bigger. It was approximately 400-600 feet off the ground. It made no sound that I could hear.  It had faint white lights on each corner as well as brighter red lights on each corner. The red light at the front of it was flashing as if a Strobe light in a weird sequence of blinks. Almost like Morse code.  When I got out of work in the morning, it was beginning to get light out. I remembered the exact location that I saw the object the previous night. Lo and behold, there was something in the sky at the exact location. This time it was much higher. It was barely moving.  It was hard to tell the shape of it. It had faint blue lights, and three very bright white lights. The middle white light was flashing just as the red light did the night before. It made no sound that I could hear.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,43.6059213740458,-84.80228625954199

I was in my second to last week of the fall semester when the sighting took place. On the night of December 6, 2007 at almost 8:00PM on the dot I saw four circular craft flying in formation doing aerial maneuvers.  I was walking back to my apartment from campus to pick up supplies for a computer animation I was working on for finals.  Just as I got through the back parking lot I looked up at the roof and balcony of an apartment building that flanks us on the right side (I've been watching the icicles grow on their side from all the snowfall).  When I did, I saw four low flying craft that were a dull silver and without lights flying well below the heavy cloud cover.  They were flying low enough that the lights from town were shining on the bottom but I was standing in such a way that there were no lights to cause glare so I could see them very clearly.  I could also see an under-carriage type object that was also circular and about half the diameter of the craft.  They were flying from the direction of the Edinboro Lake, which is about a mile away from where I made the sighting and heading for the river located behind my apartment building. They were in a sort of triangular formation so at first I thought I was seeing the engines of a really low flying jet plane but it was dead silent and I couldn't see the wings attached to these 'engines'.  Just as I was thinking this, the one on the far back right of the triangle formation did a swap with the one on the back left before they formed a more diamond shaped formation and I lost them behind the trees on the backside of the parking lot (I’m sending an email with a diagram and illustration of what they did and what I saw). I’m not sure if this is prudent or not, but the night before this sighting, the town power grid where the sighting happened lost electricity.  Even the campus I attend lost power for a few seconds before the generators kicked on, however the traffic lights and street lamps were out for about an hour or so afterwards.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,41.935936363636365,-80.14508181818181

My friend was the first to point it out, but once he pointed I saw them. There were two green lights hovering stationary above the horizon, about 2-3 miles away (estimated).  We thought they were sparks from the fireworks that were falling to the ground, but they never fell and they were very large at the distance we were viewing them.  They started to move apart from one another slowly in a horizontal manner.  Then the light on the right moved vertical above the one on the left.  At this point my mind was reeling trying to figure out what this was we were watching.  Next, the lower light moved to be even with the light on the right and very quickly after they were even, the light on the right blasted straight up ward at a speed I have never witnessed before, very very fast.  After that one was about half way out of sight the other one on the left took off at equal fast speed. These lights never changed colors they stayed bright green the whole time.  They never left a trail of light either, just a small bit behind the craft as they went up into the sky.

I was seated directly where the wing was and at first I just looked at it for a few seconds not thinking anything peculiar about it, then it just went straight down and disapeared.

The sound could best be described as distant rolling thunder but very constant.  We watched for many seconds and wondered what it could be.  Then the four lights began to drift away to the north (toward Lake Havasu City, AZ) together leading me to believe it was one very large craft as opposed to four separate ones. The sound also diminished in proportion to the lights.  When I asked a local resident (I was new to the area then) days later, what that could have been.

I was in my school's marching band and we were having a rehearsal outside on our football field, it was around 8:00 at night and it was mostly dark, because I think that the sun had set by then.   Our football field is laid out so that the end zones face north-to-south, and there is a set of bleachers on the west side of the field.   We were marching in a way such that the entire band was facing the west, towards the bleachers.  While we were marching I noticed a bright green spherical light source move from behind the bleachers, form the west or southwest, and move northwards and upwards so that the light source was, from my perspective, north of the bleachers and slightly above them, I'm guessing 1 to 1.5 miles away from the field.   The light source paused for about 4 seconds, not getting any brighter or fainter, which meant it was probably holding its position relative to me.   I stopped marching when I saw the light source appear.  For those 4 seconds a friend of mine who was also marching (he was a few yards away from me in the same formation), took notice of the light source and stopped marching as well.   After about 4 seconds the light source suddenly began moving away from us, towards the southwest, and increasing in altitude.  The source appeared to leave a small trail in the sky, most likely just a blur because of the speed at which it was moving.  Within about a second the light source was out of view.   My friend confirmed that he had also seen the object, and also described the things above.  If I were to estimate, I would say that the light source was about 80-100 feet in diameter.

I looked out the window of our pick-up and noticed a large orange ""star"" or so I thought.   I said ""Look how orange that star is, I'm going to stop and check it out.""  I was just looking at it with my window down at this point, then it started to move.   It was in the northwest sky and traveled a little south, then stopped, moved again south a little farther, and stopped again.  It just stayed there then moved once again,  I told my daughter I was going to follow it because it was moving again.  I was going down a street and I blinked the my lights several times rapidly and the object stopped.  I think that was just coincidence though.  I had to turn by that time to go around the block and when I looked for it, it was just gone!    This all happened faster than the telling.  It also moved rather quickly.  It didn't actually twinkle or blink but I got the impression of something swirling around it like air maybe.   When I got home I asked my husband if there is any standard aircraft that would behave like this did. He said not that he's aware of. I told a woman I work with about the incident and she said her daughter seen an orange object once also. Report taken by the Missouri Investigators Group - B.

My partner and I were out on the Susquehanna River in our cabin cruiser. Shortly after sunset we were motoring slowing up the river, which is actually westbound watching the campers along the river close up their sites for the weekend since it was a Sunday night. Naturally as soon as the sun had gone down the air temperature became a little cooler and my partner went below to stay warm while I continued to slowly “chug” up the river enjoying the calm, cool weather. Approximately around 9:45-9:50 I was looking directly ahead of the boat. Just above the small hill there was a bright orange/reddish light. Since it was near the top of the hill, I didn’t give it much thought thinking it wasn’t anything special. I had just thought it was someone hosting a bonfire party to end the weekend. So I glanced away for a few seconds to see the camp sites along the river and when I returned looking forward the light had definitely increased in altitude. This caused me to wonder what it was since it was an odd color. It was EXACTLY the same color as a camp fire, a very big and brilliant camp fire in the sky. It surpassed in size and brilliance any other lights in the sky including airplanes, stars, planets, etc. At this point I thought “How strange? Normally an airplane would not be an orange color!” I pulled back the throttle of the boat into neutral and examined this strange light. It raised directly above the western horizon in altitude and followed an arch like course directly over top of us. As it approached it gained more and more altitude. Which was strange because I thought if it was a plane, like I have seen many times before, the altitude would not increase so drastically. I could tell the altitude was increasing because as it came closer to us overhead, it became dimmer and dimmer.  I couldn’t make out any type of shape except it looked like a camp fire in the sky. Orange/Reddish color with no exact shape. I was concentrating to see if there were any red or green airplane lights on it or if it emitted any sound, which it didn’t. At one point it was directly over head, still traveling in a west to east course.  I was so intrigued by it that I quickly ran downstairs to grab my binoculars, but by the time I got back up on deck it had disappeared completely.  Now I have seen satellites and even the space shuttle shortly after sunset with a naked eye, but every time I have seen these they were going east to west because the setting sun below the horizon is reflecting off of the higher altitude craft. But in this situation it was moving west to east and surely I could not see any reflection from the sun off of the dark side of the craft. So I know it was emitting it’s own light source and was not a reflection. Also it was not a meteorite since it was gaining in altitude and it had a constant speed across the sky which was somewhat fast for a plane, but slow for a meteorite.  I believe in UFO’s and many of my family members have seen them around central Pennsylvania over the years. My brother, mother, aunt, and others all have seen them, so I grew up with the belief that they do exist, but not until that night did I actually see something that I can’t explain.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,41.381240094339624,-76.82344056603773

I got up and approached my window to see what it was, but by the time I got there... It was gone.  So I layed in my bed, and just assumed it was a normal aircraft. Then, at about 2:20AM CST, I heard the sound again in the distance. This time I was prepared and immediatley went to my window. I stared out there for a good 5 seconds. The ""hum"" got louder and louder. I kept starring... and saw nothing. No lights, nothing. Finally, in my peripheral, I saw a large, dark object sort of casually fliying across the sky. And I followed it through the trees.  The craft was flying relitively low, as well as slow. And it had no lights at all. Because the craft had no lights, it was very hard for me to distinguish shape. It was kind of triangular, but still had other characteristics... which I can not completely describe. I attempted to take a photo; however, due to the light, the craft simply looked like a dark ""smudge"".  The craft was flying towards a nearby USAF base. Could it be a some kind of ""stealth""? I do not know that much about planes. Even if it is an actual plane, though, why would it be flying so low? The base is close, but not that close. Also, why was it flying so slow? And why wouldn't it have any lights? And I've NEVER heard a plane sounds like that.  As of now... The craft has flown by many times, off in the distance. And I'm a little nervous. I just would like to know what it is, if that's possible.  Thanks.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,32.49526862745098,-86.50345098039215

It flickered with no pattern and was sometimes very bright.I thought It was my dizyness but Another appeared and moved from the high southern sky to the east.

The object was much further than the jet but was traveling much faster. More star like objects appeared and flew in different directions disappearing and reappearing, flickering and flashing. It seemed like they where reflecting the sun light cause no light can be seen in the daylight that brightly. There were no wings or noticeable shape. When it didn’t reflect the sun, it seemed to disappear. This I think would be something you wouldn’t see without light reflecting on it. I ran inside my office and grabbed some co workers.

I am an avid watcher of the sky. Always listening and looking for aircraft, of the military kind. Living 65 miles East of Whiteman Air force base, I am fortunate to see a lot of aircraft day and night. On this particular night, it was clear with no wind, and warm enough to be out with a light jacket. I was standing on the upstairs porch when I noticed two stealth bombers flying slowly to my South heading East toward Whiteman. I glanced around and noticed what I thought to be a satellite making it’s way across the night sky. That is when I realized it was heading directly toward me. It appeared to be a car with it’s head lights on bright, heading North to South as it approached I could tell it was some sort of aircraft. While it was directly over me I noticed three greenish white lights in the shape of a triangle underneath the craft, rather close in formation, not at each wing. There were no other lights on the craft to help identify its shape.  Once it pasted over me I could no longer see it, however there was a noise, like when the stealth is in silent mode and you hear the air moving across the wings, however unlike stealth, there was no initial rumble as it approached.  Just as this craft made it’s way on, I could feel a vibration, almost as if it were in my chest, not an external vibration. I looked up to see to aircraft one apparently winging for the other. They appeared to be large, larger than stealth the only light visible on these two craft very two small bluish lights on the underneath. These two craft were heading East to West. Not more than two seconds behind them were two stealth’s’ (I feel I pretty good at identifying them with their two stationary lights on the back to wings.)  The two craft I could not identify seemed to vanish as I watched the stealth’s tail them.  Shortly after this sighting I noticed four aircraft to my North that appeared to be dog fighting and two more Stealth’s heading in a Southeasterly direction.  Nothing about these craft made me uneasy, no more than people felt when the Stealth was first made public. But I just wonder has anyone else seen the ‘flying cars’ as I like to call them.

The jets flew over the H.S. this evening around the same time the lights were seen last night.  The jets came from the north and flew towards the south.  I could see two red lights overhead.  I felt good, was ready to home, enough of this stuff.  As soon as the jet noise dissipated, I saw a light.  Didn’t believe it would ever happen again.  They were further away, just above the treetops.  Two of the lights were southeast and one was southwest of the H.S.  The lights went on and immediately off.

It was somewhat oblong; white with a warm yellow center and it all glowed/ somewhat the shape of a full moon but oblong.  I first saw this 3/8/07 between 8:30-9:00. At that time there were two red objects, they were observed closer to the ground and higher moving in erratic patterns/ almost like searching through the fields. I tried to take a picture. It hung there after I noticed it for about 20 minutes. On going out to try to observe the red lights vanished and I saw a twinkling object moving rapidly across the stars in again erratic patterns. It looked like a star with red and green lights. I observed another   object similar, closer to the ground and the white object was gone.  I have since observed this only further away appearing as a huge bright light, somewhat Y shaped. I have since observed this happening multiple times to current date 3/13/07.  My husband also observed the larger light.  It seems to have become a nightly occurrence.

My search rapidly digressed and I found myself reading UFO reports for Indiana filed over the last year. I found the reports for Kokomo, March 2006 most interesting. As some of them describe what I've seen near there previously this time of year, but with a few more twists. Funny thing is....if I hadn't seen what I've seen for the past two years and this sighting tonight I'd probably remark.'What a bunch of Looney Toons.'  Based on the past. I expect the Plymouth,IN to Grissom AFB sightings to occur now through April when we have... Clear Air with Visibility Unlimited and little to no moon illumination. Flight appears to be less than 2000 AGL and within 5 miles of US 31 out to the west. Most of my own sightings have occured between Argos and Mexico after sunset and prior to 22:00 local. The UFO reference in this case does not imply craft from another world, dimension or whatever. More likely our own military on night training maneuvers in the MOA. Do I think these are Top Secret craft capable of flight previously not realized? Hmm......It's highly unlikely they would adhere to a schedule so predictable over a populated area such as this. I am a 30+ year licensed pilot, so I have some familarity with aircraft....... I have witnessed some pretty remarkable moving light arrays out there that I find myself wondering what the hell I just saw. Know what I mean?  The thing is many have seen exactly what I have seen, it's been briefly covered in the local media. It occurs with regularity, so why does not somebody associated with this occurance come forth and set the public mind of these communities at ease?",2007-04-27T00:00:00,,

Don't remember the exact date, sometime in 1970, I believe in the spring.  There were about 30 of us watching a movie, ""The African Queen"" in the Student Union in the middle of campus. The movie was over around midnight, and we all walked out of the building. There, hovering approximately 20 feet above the ground in the open area near the Student Union, was a disk shaped, grey metallic craft. It was not small, I'm guessing approx. 50 feet wide. It had red lights in a band around the middle of the craft. It was completely silent, and was not moving.  I had the feeling that time stopped, we all stopped moving, stood where we were, as if frozen in time. No one said a word. I don't know how much time past. The next thing I remember is that the craft lifted straight up, made a perpendicular movement, then straight up again, and was gone. Its speed was faster than one could even imagine. No acceleration time, it was at a standstill, then gone.  No one said a word, we all just walked back to our dorm rooms on campus. This was very out of character, because this was a very ""radical"" 60's type college, with a very verbal student body! I was walking back to my dorm with a friend, and were walking very slowly, as if walking through mud. I said to her, ""Maybe we should tell someone"" and she said ""No, don't bother"". When I got to my dorm, I called the TV station (left a message) and the police (who didn't believe me).  That was it. No one ever spoke about it. I forgot about it almost immediately. Then I started remembering it in detail around 20 years later. This was the only time in my life I saw a ""UFO"".

Movement appeared to be from South to North at a speed I would now estimate at no more than 55 knots. I calculate the speed by using other more common references such as identifiable aircraft I have seen in the same vicinity on other days. The object I observed and the object / crafts unusual attitude is something I have never seen repeated with any modern aircraft past or present.  Description of object: Cigar shaped (ends pointed), dimensional measurements estimated as follows – Length 250’, 30’ girth, color a dark gray, almost black.  Detail of sighting: On the day of the UFO sighting, 3 friends and I where playing football in my parent’s backyard, I was the first to notice the object. My friends where more interested in playing football rather then studying the anomaly which I alerted them all to … I can remember one of my friends stating after looking at the object that it must be an aircraft banking and thus no visible empennage or wings. I continued to watch more intently after the friend’s suggestion and waiting for what seemed to be about 2 minuets as to view the craft turn and expose some identifiable surface. However I did not notice any change in the flight path of the object nor view any recognizable aircraft surfaces. In fact the angel of the object and its assent seemed so unusual I thought perhaps the object was a blimp, but I concluded that was not logical seeing its shape, speed, lack of identifiable markings, attitude and size. After about a total of 3-1/2 minutes I turned to my friends again to explain to them my thoughts and when I turned back the object was gone. The last point I saw the object put it in the clear of clouds and its disappearance in just an instant still amazes me even today.

The peak is named Verdi Peak and it is 10,900ft. msl.  What I thought were 3 white birds was the suns reflection off this UFO that was headed straight at us!  It came over Verdi peak and stopped and hovered approximately 150 ft. above an 200 ft. west of our position.  The craft had a mirror finish, no seams or rivets, no windows, no front or rear.  It made no engine or any other noise. The most amazing thing to us, was that the craft never changed its attitude in any way, aways remaining ridged in space like a gyro does. The craft was shaped like an cartoon cigar, like a foot ball.  It was so close, we all agreed that it was approximately 70ft. long and 40ft in diameter.  We all had the intense feeling that we were being ""check out""!  IT scared the daylights out us.  Then things got even stranger, from a hover, the craft rose straight up until it had gained about 3000ft. of altitude from where it had been hovering, enough altitude to clear the mountain ridge and it flew north with a sudden burst of speed, the likes of which I have never seen, before or after the sighting.  We could see the Jarbridge Mts, about 100 miles north, into Idaho from our vantage point on the mountain ridge.  We watched this craft go from right above us, to a little speck that disappeared over Idaho in about one and a half seconds!  We were pretty shaken up and all agreed to hike out of the mountains back to our car and go home.  It would take us a bit under a hour to get to the car.  When we arrived we all had noticed how low the sun was and that things were not adding up on the time we were gone and the time when we got to the car.  Only one of us had a wrist watch, and he had left it in the car. When he announced what the time was, we all were just dumbfounded!  We had 4 hours that we could not account for no matter how we tried to rationalize.   We had made the hike at least a dozen times over the years and knew how long it took. So we decited to never tell anyone about this.  I thought that it was time to speak up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Then a streak of what looked like fire shot from the north side of the object.  When the fire dissipated  it left another smaller ball of light just north of the larger object. They both sat there for a few more minutes and then the smaller ball of light left to the southwest so fast that it left a small trail of light behind it, this trail lasted only a fraction of a second.  In just a few minutes the larger ball of light did the exact same thing.  There is no noise.   I have no idea of what I saw.  I have no idea how large they were because I have no idea of their altitude.  I do know that in the late 60's and early 70's the Air Force was flying B52's at low altitude over that area.  I may see as many as 4 or 5  a day always flying the same track or course.  Around 1965 or 1966 there was a military aircraft that crashed in Lincoln County close to a little town called Mckinney,  I understand there were several crewmen that died in that crash.

A friend and myself 34 years ago were traveling down a dirt road on our way to hunt in some local timberland areas.  We are from a small town in southwest Alabama.  As we travelled down the road we were talking and shooting the breeze like most teenagers would be doing.  I don't remember which one of us first noticed the object, but, we observed a shinny object streaking across the sky.  We took the time to decide if it was a plane with the sun reflecting off it or not.  We came to the quick conclusion that it was simply a cigar shaped object moving at a very rapid pace across the clear blue sky.  We of course, could not determine the speed or size of the object , however it was quickly making its way out of our view.  Stunned at what we saw, we both decided it must have been a jet of some kind flying extremely lower then we antiscipated and fast, until we noticed a fighter jet on the same plane and general area of flight pattern as the first object.  It appeared to be chasing or mirroring the objects movements but obviously not moving as fast as the object had been moving.  But it was evident that they were not the same size and the sun was not reflecting off the jet, so the first object must have been different.  Whether or not we were witnesses to a ufo or not, it is a memory that will never leave me.  I would like to believe it was.  It has been a thought of mine for all my life, that we would be a very arrogant planet of people to think in all the universe, that we were the smartest or even alone in the vastness of space.  Who are we to think God didn't experiment with many planets with many Adams and Eves.  And if on one of those other planets, Eve didn't eat the apple, wouldn't that society of people, all of like thinking without hate, judgement, and malice, all come together thousands of years ago to learn, invent, and explore the universe quicker than the way our society of warlords and human haters have done it?  Wouldn't and couldn't they have come a long way further in a shorter period of time than we did because we were greedy and self absorbed in ourselves rather then working together for the common good?  Our world is too busy tending to each others business and building technology to destroy each other, rather than building a united world toward the betterment of mankind.  They would be so far more advanced then we will ever make it. I personally believe  all this is very possible.  If we developed in a world of togetherness, just what could we have invented or produced to this point?  Anyone who says we are alone in the universe, is a fool.  As much as anyone who says there is no God is one.  Athiest are the dumbest people around.  Smart wisdom would say that you should believe in God and the afterlife and other life.  After all, the atheist has nothing to live for after they die, but if they are wrong, they will be sorry.  Smart money says take the Christian way , just in case, we are right , and you are wrong.  You have nothing to lose doing it the Chirstian way, because your way just ends either way..  Why take the chance?  The same way of believing in ufo's.  If we don't believe as a society, then we lose the wonder of it.  If they do exist, then we have much to learn about how we treat each other.  If they do exist, then hopefully someone will prove it one day, and our world of greedy selfabsorbed people, might, just might, grow the hell up and work together.  Enough said....  Tell me what you think.  ((e-address deleted))",2008-02-14T00:00:00,31.509575510204083,-87.33105918367347

This event took place in 1973. I was 21 years old and traveled from San Diego County to Portland Ore with my brother and his wife on 4th of July weekend.   My brother was in army aviation at the time and I was a student pilot.  Another brother was an air controller for the SAC, a close cousin an army pilot and his brother an Air Force kicker.  We grew up adjacent to air bases: Kirkland, Biggs, Mira Mar and Camp Pendleton. We are very familiar with aircraft and their abilities.  On the return trip from Portland we were at the cloverleaf of I-5 and I-580 in the Stockton California area at dusk. (perhaps 8PM). The freeways were very busy. My brother and I saw a craft coming from our 10 o'clock position very low. Our first assumption was that it was a crop duster as they are common in that vicinity and they prefer to work right up to sunset. The craft had three lights, red, green and amber, not unlike any aircraft except that they were in the wrong positions and the anti-collision lamp did not blink.  The craft came in right over our windshield at about 60 -100 ft AGL!  We looked directly up at it but only saw a blur. It appeared to be transparent. It past over us to our 2 o'clock position and only about 300 ft lateral and 100 ft altitude. I got a good look at it. It was tubular with a simple frame for a fuselage. The craft was transparent as if made from see through covering. It had short stubs protruding from its sides that were not sufficient to be wings or airfoils. It had no engines.  It immediately, without turning, returned in our direction while descending.  An impossible maneuver for any aircraft that I know of. It's speed was slow, perhaps 45mph. The stubs turned out to have bright lamps attached and they were activated nearly blinding us. The craft flew down to the deck illuminating the field of wheat (or rice) and pushing it aside as it moved a few feet above it. I again got a close look and the craft was not a duster or helicopter. I have never known dusters to use lights as dusting is too dangerous at night.  We looked at other motorists at they seemed not to notice. We followed the progress of the crafts as it continued to crisscrossed I-5 in a similar fashion as we moved south at about 80 mph. Complete darkness fell swiftly. We then saw many craft with two lights performing the same maneuvers amongst the fields. They were acting as if they were looking for something on the ground by ""strafing"" it with their lights which were too close together to be mistaken as autos in the distance. We also noticed that at times they would stop and hover over the California Aqueduct and shine their beams downward. We stopped several times to witness the events. Though many times the hovering objects were close they made no sound.  Again other motorists seemed to notice nothing. There were usually three in sight at all times. We tried to rationalize that it was helicopters, agricultural machinery or autos in the distance. However, in the following years i made that same trip many times at night and never saw anything like it again. Our only rational thought was that it was police looking for someone. We listened to the radio in ernest hoping for a news announcement. Of course there was none. The object(s) began following us at fence top level along the opposite side of the freeway, about 100 yards behind. We tested them several times by speeding up to 140 mph and then slowing to about 20mph. The craft(s) kept pace with us! When they seemed to be bored with this game they would fly off laterally at high speed but still stay within sight. Often they would be replaced by another in their former position.  After the initial first sighting near Stockton, my sister-in-law fell asleep in the back seat. We attempted several times over the next few hours to awake her to witness the show but were unable to. She was clearly alive but slapping and shaking could not wake her.  We were totally confused and decided to stop in at a truck stop a few miles off the freeway near the bottom of the Grapevine. We had witnessed this phenomenon for about three hours at this point. We made casual inquiries in the restaurant of the staff and truckers but no one saw anything. My sister-in-law remained unconscious. We continued on our trip south and had no more sightings.  Upon awaking the next day my brother and I went over what had transpired. We discovered that we were missing somewhere between 90 and 180 minutes of time. We checked our gas receipts which were dated and time stamped and new our speed averaged 80 mph except for the few times we stopped which we accounted for. We had no sensation that we were abducted then or since and suffered no ill effects.  Many years later I read a book by a UFO investigator that stated that 1973 was a big ""flap"" year in California and the Central Valley in general.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,37.982735720844815,-121.31976694214876

I am writing about something that happened when I was 19 years old.   It occurred on Wednesday, October 17, 1973, on the outskirts of Montgomery, Alabama.    I have always wanted to report it, but I never realized there was a National Reporting Center until now.          When I was 19 I kept a diary and I wrote about this incident in my diary.  But even if I hadn’t written about it at that time, the occurrence and the terror we felt, will always be clear in my memory.      This is my account of what happened:   It was approximately 11:30 p.m. on Oct 17 1973.  My boyfriend (who was a sergeant in the air force) and I (a college student and worked full time) had driven out to the country.  We wanted to find a quiet, romantic place to park and spend some time alone together.       We went to an area where some new roads had been cut through the woods.  An area that was being prepared to build new homes, but no homes had been started to be built yet. Only the roads had been cleared.  The woods around the roads were still thick with trees and undergrowth.    We drove a good distance down the first new road until we came to a small cul-de-sac road that was cut back deep into the wooded area.  We drove to the end of the cul-de-sac and parked the car, facing up hill to the main road. We sat and talked for a while before we noticed a bright light moving slowly across the tops of the trees in the distance...it was across the main road a distance away.  We both watched this light for approximately ten minutes.  At first we thought it was a helicopter because it would move slowly across the trees and then stop in mid air, hover for a minute then continue slowly down the tree line. Once or twice it disappeared down behind the trees but it would reappear a few seconds later.     We rolled our windows down to see if we could hear the whirring of helicopter blades - but there was no sound at all.   Total quiet. We kept speculating what it could be as we were perplexed that it made no sound.   It finally moved on out of our vision so we shrugged our shoulders and changed the subject.  I’m not sure how much time passed...maybe 5 minutes but not more than 15 minutes when a bright light, like a huge spot light, flashed across our vehicle.  It didn’t stop and shine on the vehicle, it only flashed across our vehicle.     We both jumped and said, ""What was THAT?""  My heart started pounding.   We looked all around us and didn’t see anything that would have caused a bright light like that to flash on the car.  We looked at each other, both of us frightened, said not a word but my boyfriend cranked up the car to get out of there. As soon as we cranked the car, a bright light - about the size of a basket ball - came floating out of the woods - about 5 to 6 feet off the ground - quickly towards our car. I say floating because it wasn’t bobbing up and down like it would if someone had a big spot light and was running with it....it wasn’t making any sound at all so it wasn’t a motorized vehicle, no bicycle could come through those thick woods like this light was...it was floating out of the woods at a very fast speed directly towards the car. We sped up the hill to turn off of the cul-de-sac onto the main road that lead out of that area.  As we approached the main road, a second light appeared  from the other side of the cul-de-sac and  began pursuit of our car at an even faster rate of speed.   My boyfriend floored the accelerator as we turned onto the main road.    The two lights did not follow the road behind us…..they took a short cut across the woods  between the cul-de-sac and the main road …. I mean straight through those thick woods…never slowed down, never veered or bobbed around….never making a sound…just floated straight across and through the heavy woods and out onto the main road  directly behind our vehicle.     I was panic stricken and screaming to go faster, go faster.     The lights stayed right behind us and my boyfriend was driving as fast as he could on that back country road. As we approached the exit out of that area onto the county road where there was other traffic, the lights vanished.

Holloman AFB 5/6,1974   I had travelled to Odessa Tx with my roommate (((name deleted)) of Calif.) to his sisters house in Odessa for the weekend.   We left Odessa, then a small town, and headed home on rt. 385. we headed West on 185 to N.Mex. and Holloman where we were stationed. We had spent the Holiday weekend with his sister and neice.  When we left Odessa we headed North on 385 to Seminole and grabbed a coffee.  We then continued to Hobbs before we turned West.  We were on Hwy #529 then headed for Artesia.  It was an 'empty' land back then.  After the #180 junction, and we knew where we were going, we stopped, to take a leak.  Back then the land was empty and dark.  Not like my NYC my home... so here it gets strange.  We stopped about 1/8mile outside town to take a leak near a phone booth.  We got back in the car and started to drive and in about 1/4mile a UFO appeared in the sky, it came from the west and stopped about 250ft above us, it was hovering on us.  Jim pushed it to 140mph. and it held, we slowed to 20mph and it held; we stopped, and got out.  It had sparks flying out of it when we stopped...and I said to Jim, it looks like it is having trouble, Jim agreed. It was 11:15pm then...next time we looked it was 12:30pm.  We got back in his car and tried to outrace it; we couldn't (we went 160mph); we slowed and it did not leave. The entire incident to point was about 5.5miles in duration, an 2hrs.  Then we saw 3 F-4's with BLUE tails headed towards us. We knew the planes because we were their mechanics. The round, UFO was still sparking when we stopped to watch... then, in an instant it was hundreds of miles away to the North West, at the base of the upcoming mountains (near Roswell)(NOT ARTESIA)... the F-4's, OUR PLANES; made the 120 degree turn to pursue the craft and it had gone from here to there (300miles) in an instant. It was a 60 degreee turn, with no radius, and just a simple 140mph backwards motion to a simple 60 degree turn to the Northwest.  The Planes arced over our heads, and thier efforts seemed so insignificant to the speed the craft was able to move at.  The ""Saucer"", and it was a 'saucer' this time; moved from the center of the flat desert where we were...to the near side of the upcoming mountains in 1 second, what our planes could do in 20; about 200miles!

Within 200 feet of both. It’s been on my mind lately, in 1974 I was near the Palisades Power Plant in Covert Michigan while it was being built if I remember right. Anyway I was on apart of US 31 which had been cut off because of the building of the power plant, watching the sky as I usually did back then. I was sitting on the side of the road facing south. As I watched to the east, south and west I saw a large saucer shaped craft probably 80 to 95 feet in diameter rise up out of the swampy area to my left and a bit behind me. What has always bothered me is  that there was a smaller saucer shaped craft docked on the side of the large one. Both craft were a gray metallic color but had no lights of any kind. There was absolutely no sound, I sat watching it rise up to about tree top height and then it stopped  and hovered. I was about 200 feet away from the crafts, it just hovered there for about a minute as I studied it. Well it was not moving so I decided I  would. I turned my Datsun pick up around moving back to the North, drove under the crafts. I know they were real because I saw them in my mirror and saw the crafts move across the road to the west as I drove away. Like I said the one docked on the side really bothers me, I have never heard of a UFO with one docked on the side of it. Have You? I was not abducted I know that for sure, I went immediately to a near by friends house. Had him grab his camera and go with me up into the hills between US 31 and Lake Michigan. As we neared the area just north of the power plant where a boy scout camp was located we saw the out line of the craft through the tree canopy above. We could not get any kind of a picture because of the tree cover. It continued westerly out over Lake Michigan. By the time we reached the bluffs above the lake the craft was out of sight. Also my pick up started to run very rough, missing and spitting . I returned my friend back to his home and I continued back to my home, barely making it. The next morning my truck refused to start, it would turn ! over but not start. I had just tuned it up days earlier and found the new points and spark plugs burned away as if they had many thousands of miles on them.

I looked to the left and noticed a couple of odd-looking 'stars'. They seemed a bit orange or to have an orange glow to them which I don't think is unusual (could have been ""old"" stars) except that as I was looking at each of them, actually staring at each for a time, I noticed that  the oval shape was more solid than I saw when just glancing at them.  There were multicolored lights in the center that seemed to be spinning.  As I looked at these 'things' they became much clearer.  I went to get my binoculars but could not hold them still enough to see any details and it doesn't 'see' clearly that far anyway.  I called my husabnd who i found was sleeping and went back out the door and they were not there...just stars.

My friend and I were up late watching the aurigid meteor storm. As we stared into the night sky, we noticed a light moving across the sky at moderate pace. It was moving about as fast as a jet liner would be, however, this was not a large plane. The light was about as large and as bright as mars. It was traveling from the southeast to the northwest for about 10-15 seconds and slowly went dim until we could not see it anymore. It did not change direction, just traveled in a straight line.  About 20 minutes had passed and we saw another, very similar object floating through the sky. However, this one passed almost underneath the moon moving in the high sky from the north to the south. As it passed right by it, the light intensified to a much brighter light than the stars and was about twice the size of the largest star. After it passed the moon, the light went dim, almost to complete darkness and then slowly brightened up again. Finally it went completely dim. Same as the last light, not once did it change direction. This lasted for about 10 seconds or so.  It couldn't have been 10 minutes later when we noticed yet another light traveling through the sky, and again, in a straight line. Except it didn't pulsate and was not nearly as bright. This one was traveling from high up in the eastern sky to the eastern horizon and also lasted for about 10 seconds.  In all three instances, the only visible thing was that one white light. There were no other flashing lights, no red lights, no lights you would normally see on the wings of planes, nothing. Even passing by so close to a moon two thirds full, you would think you'd be able to some some sort of shape/silhouette, but we saw nothing. Only that white light flaring up. We also knew they definitely were not meteors. They were moving too slow to be meteors and meteors, from what I remember, do not pulsate.  Although the objects seemed as though they were moving slowly through the sky, if they were normal planes, they would have to be really high up to not be able to see other lights or a silhouette.

She escaped to a back room to do something so I was sitting alone. I looked through two standing trees in her yard and saw two silverish colored, clear balloon type objects in the distance - circular I suppose - in the clear sky.  I figured they must've been helium balloons that were escaping into the sky as they were moving as balloons at first. I continued to watch and yelled for my girlfriend to come from a back room - she then came and witnessed the UFOs with me.  After a few minutes of watching we were not able to identify them as balloons - they rose higher and continued to float at what I believe to be - thousands of feet - in the air - slowly - not exactly erratically, but not as though being propelled by the wind either. I became excited when I saw two neighbors outside in the front where I had moved after the ufo's floated over the treetops from the backyard to the front.  I saw THREE very clear unmistakable shapes - lights or light reflecting - as the sun from a balloon shape.  But as my neighbors and I gazed straight up overhead at the object - there were two others close to this object - same size and dimensions - we could not say if it were a weather balloon or not - it did not seem to move as a weather balloon might - although I don't know what a weather balloon looks like in the air. I feel this is a significant sighting as there were witnesses and we all saw the same thing for several minutes before the objects just continued to float out of sight.  They did not zip off into the sky. I don't know what I saw.  I would like answers as to how this lit object could appear so large in the sky - I have seen balloons before as I live near a place that has helium balloons escape all the time from it's premises (auto dealership) - and I have watched these balloons travel high into the sky before they just disappear. The objects we four witnessed were not balloons such as these - transluscent balloon shaped - well - lit objects. I felt they were intelligently manned but that is just a guess.

I have called the hot-line, and have a callback pending.  I was returning from Honduras on Sept. 1st, 2007. I was flying toward Houston. Between 6 and 7pm.  I saw a black ""toothpick"" streak in the foreground of a large white cloud, making it extremely vivid.  My camera ran out of batteries about an hour before this happened!  As our vantage point changed, I became aware that the streak was a kind of jet stream.  The vessel looked very much like one I've seen in Star Wars, with vertical curved wings, and a horizontal deck/cockpit. It was black.  It was flying at close to our exact altitude.  It didn't sink in that I had likely seen a UFO and needed to report it until I told a friend about it.  I observed the vessel for about 1.5 minutes as we approached, 1 minute as we passed it's front, and less than another minute before we flew out of my visual range.  It looked as if it were less than a quarter mile from the plane, but it's hard to tell in the air.  The cloud as a back drop helped a lot.  I was hard to tell if it was moving until we passed it a little, and then I could see the jet stream very clearly.  Thanks for your attention.",2007-10-08T00:00:00,,

They bottom one was mostly white with some silver in the center, and the top was more silver with some grey. The bottom one was about twice as large as the top one. They did not deviate from each other and moved in perfect harmony. They were flying at a very odd forward angle that of which I've never seen a plane or helicopter fly. I have been watching planes and helicopters at a local airport for years, and these craft behaved drastically different than anything I’ve ever witnessed.

I live near an airport and am use to seeing planes fly over head, but this object had no lights and made no sound. My initial sense was a circular object with a lighter colored leading edge in a chevron shape. It moved swiftly covering about half the sky in a second. Within minutes I saw a similar object about half a mile east of me. I went inside and woke my girlfriend and told her what I had seen. I tried to assimilate what it could have possibly been. Ranging from a glider to stealth planes. I noticed my neighbors outside and told them what I had seen. Within minutes we saw it again. 3 groups, the first looking like what I had seen, then two more groups. Oddly, the last two groups appeared to be birds. One group had 2 'birds', strangly and eerily glowing in the night. I could barely discern 'flapping'. The other group had maybe 3 'birds' in it. But they moved so swiftly. I tried to compare mentally the differences in what I had seen before and after I had witnesses, and it seems they looked more like birds after I talked to the others. The disparity in viewings comes from the apparent speed of the objects as they flew overhead. I cannot seem to shake the feeling that these are not birds. Oddly enough, as many times as I have went outside to smoke cigarettes at night. I have never noticed these 'birds' in any season. Let alone the three shooting stars I have also witnessed in the sky this night.

Wright Kentucky.   My 15 year old daughter, a passenger in the car, started screaming hysterically that she saw a UFO. I laughed it off, thinking it was lights from a nearby ambulance reflecting off of something.  A quarter mile up the road she screamed again, telling me to look to my left, towards downtown Cincinnati.  This is when I caught my first glimpse of the object.  It was obvious that it was not something normal, but I was seeing it between trees.  As I drove a little bit further up the road it was clear as day to me. The object was lit up bright white with vertical tan marks on it that looked like shadows of some sort.  It was somewhat of a disk shape, with another bubble type disk at the top.  Its size was something I couldn't comprehend the possibility of it being able to hover in the air. It was easily the size of 3 city blocks squared.  I continued on Kyles Lane until I came to the bridge over Interstate 75, where I slowed to a near stop. Here we saw the object was within 2 miles of us, bright as could be, hovering just to the west of downtown Cincinnati.  We were both amazed that none of the other cars seemed to notice it.  At this point I was in total disbelief, on the phone with a friend who lived nearby, telling her to stand in her front yard facing Cincinnati and tell me if she saw it.  She saw nothing. Due to traffic I was forced to continue driving. I changed my course by heading south down Dixie Highway towards Covington and the Ohio River. At this point we saw it again, but this time it was much farther away, I'm guessing 30 to 40 miles north of the city. The shape and brightness of it was so distinct there was no confusion as to that being the same object. I sped down the hill on Dixie Highway towards Covington, trying to get near the river, and a better spot. I was hoping to find someplace to park with a clear view. I lost sight of it again while going down the hill, but once at the bottom, going east to! wards Fi fth Street we saw it for the final time. I was now near the river again, only this time it was east of Cincinnati, about 20 miles from the first sighting. Being a non-believer, I have gone over every possible scenario in my head, trying to convince myself I didn't see what I saw. There is also the fact that my daughter saw it, first I might add, and was completely shaken up to the point of hysterical crying and shaking that I could not console her in the least. I considered taking her to the hospital to be sedated, she was that upset. I also realized that I was shaking while trying to tell the story to a friend where my daughter was spending the night. I spent the rest of the night and the next morning trying to decide whether I was going to tell anyone. I consider anonymously calling the police station and saying ""Look, I don't think I'm crazy, but have you had any reports of a strange bright object seen around the city in the sky?"" I watched every news report for several days and scoured the newspapers, but I have seen no mention of anything that could even remotely be what we saw. There was a blimp in town the next day for a football game, but it was nowhere near the right shape and at least 10 times too small. So help me here, please. Are both my daughter and I certifiable insane or did someone else see this also?",2007-11-28T00:00:00,39.17450311744155,-84.48136299381886

The light got dim as it got closer and seemed to slow down then it disappeared for about 20 seconds when I noticed it again as a faint glow but this time it was moving back in the opposite direction and it got brighter as it picked up speed. It disappeared in a matter of seconds heading back to the East and I thought this was strange. After a few minutes I noticed a another Military Jet Flying around at a very high attitude Flying towards where the light came from and how I know they were Military Jets because they have just one blinking Red light you can see from the rear after they fly past and you can hear them. After the 911 attacks I saw those same Jets flying in our skies so I'm sure they were Military. I heard them fly over this area all night long. Also earlier in the evening a Military Jet did a low swoop over this area and headed straight up and it was so loud it shook the house and my neighbors came out to look as well.,2006-07-16T00:00:00,26.455547430830038,-80.11589308300395

I noticed a white spot of light up high in the sky at first I thought it might be a balloon, but it never changed shape at least to the naked eye, and it stayed fairly stationary in the sky.   Also, for reference a balloon actually did float by it and it was not even close in distance to it, this was much higher up in the sky. It looked like a star but during the day, which I thought was strange.  I was able to point it out to a couple of my relatives and they were also able to see it, though I was the one tracking it for about an hour and took pictures of it.  It slowly moved toward the sun from southeast to northwest.   I went online to see if there were to be any astronomical occurances that day.  The only thing that could be a match was Mercury was to be in that exact portion of the sky.  But reading more into it, it seemed it would be to dim to see during the day.  The pictures I took, do seem to be of a crescent planet. That would shift back and forth most likely due to atmospheric distortion.   I am really curious to as if this was a UFO or a planet.

As we were heading towards the back of the home we both immediately saw a disk like object hoovering above my Grandmother's vegetable garden. It was so close that I went to pick up a rock to throw it but my Dad smacked the rock out of my hand.I was six years old at the time !  It was your classic disk shape, light grey in color, with multi-colored lights I think that were roatating in a clockwise fashion. It was hovering not more than 20 feet from us yet it did have some movement in trying to stay in place but ever so slightly. I don't recall any heat coming off the object. I did hear a buzzing sound. The dimensions weren't very large maybe big enough to fit 4 humans comfortably inside. At a certain point I recall a small panel on the inferior-anterior edge of the saucer slide open and some sort of camera like cone shaped obect come out and pointed it at us, almost like it was observing our actions.  My Dad said to stay put and keep an eye on it while he went into the house to telephone some friends.  Ater a few seconds of finding myself alone with this floating disk I got scared and ran into the house. When we came back out the disk was gone and I was very disappointed. I don't exactly know the exact time and Month when this occured but I born in 1964 and I was six at the time so the year was 1970. I remember wearing a t-shirt so it was either late summer or maybe during a warm spell in Fall. Over the years I would every now and again mention it to my Dad if what we saw was real and he said yes it was. I'm sorry to say that my Dad died last year but I today I have found your website and this is why I am writing to you in order to remind me that it was true what we saw that afternoon. My Father was a very successful M.D. and I too am a M.D. This  experience has stayed with me forever. I did do some research maybe a couple of years after I saw it but I never found anything. I guess at the time I was too young. We never mentioned it to anyone except to family and very close friends for fear of being considered crazy. Thank you very much for the opportunity in giving my eyewittness account that was much overdue ! With regards Frank C.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I was a young child & my mother and I were walking in the yard of the family home when we saw a cigar-shaped craft emerge over the mountain behind our house (from the North). It got our attention because there were no wings! We watched as it moved towards the South. As it passed over us, it stopped and rotated to what appeared to be a vertical position & began to glow brightly for several seconds (minutes?). Altitude was at least many hundred (thousand?) feet as it was above the surrounding mountains. Eventually it rotated back to a horizontal position and moved off away from us to the Southeast. This was a distinct directional change from the original path it had been taken. During this entire event, there was no sound - another thing that we found odd. Several weeks (months?) later, I remember my parents discussing a strange burned circle in the yard, in almost the exact location where my mother & I had been standing. Seems like it was roughly 10' in diameter but that could be innaccurate based on the memories of a 7 or 8 year girl from more than 30 years ago!

Back in that day they didn’t have computers, the Internet, or any other way that we were aware of to report such things as this. In order to understand the event it is necessary for me to describe the circumstances. At this time in that area jobs were difficult to come by and those that were available barley paid enough to live on. We lived on a farm and grew our own vegetables and hunted and fished in order to survive. My friends and myself would sometimes supplement our meat supply by hunting rabbits on the roads outside of town at night. It’s not as dangerous as it sounds because as this was mostly large farms at the time the houses were two to three miles apart in places so there was little if any chance of hitting anyone or anything with a small 22 cal. rifle. I had become an expert marksman and it was not uncommon for me to make shots of 150 to 200 yards. Hunger makes you a good shot I guess.  I can approximate the year because I was 16 at the time, The month, November, coincides with the beginning of rabbit season, about the 15th. Obviously we weren’t all that concerned about the law as it was illegal to hunt from a car but if you took rabbits outside of season for consumption you ran the risk of contracting what we called rabbit fever. I estimated the time to be around 2300 hrs. because we didn’t go out any earlier to lower the risk of running across the police, and we had just started. OK, all of that being said, here is the story. On the night in question myself, and two friends, were cruising around in my car with the top down. It’s cold in November but the top of the windshield made a perfect shooter’s ledge to steady the rifle.  The older of the two, a fellow about 25 years old and a Viet Nam vet, was driving. He was a large individual and was pretty much scared of nothing. My other friend, the same age as me, was in the back seat, and I was in the front passenger seat. We had driven a mile or two East of town and had just turned South onto a long straight road. I don’t remember the name but could probably locate it on a map. After traveling about a block or two I saw a rabbit about 200 yards in front of us. I told the driver and he slowly proceeded to with about 150 yards and shut off the engine so the vibration would not throw off my shot. I took my position, acquired the animal in my scope, accounted for bullet drop and windage, held my breath, and squeezed the trigger. The rabbit dropped immediately. A perfect shot. As I put the rifle back between the seats the driver got out of the car, to relieve himself I think. My friend in the back wanted out too so I had to get out being it was a two door. 	We were facing South and to our right was a field approximately 400 to 500 yards wide and I would guess about ¼ of a mile long. At the West edge of that was a line of trees ranging from about 75 feet high to 50 feet high that ran the entire length of the field. I was facing East and my friend from the back was facing West. I heard him say “look” and as I turned around I saw this orange ball floating just above the tree line. I would estimate it to have been approximately 75 to 100 feet in diameter. At this point I’m not scared, just interested. I came around to the driver’s side and just leaned on the trunk and watched. The ball was moving very slowly from South to North just above the tree line. I followed the tree line exactly, up and down as it continued. The object made no sound of any kind. It was completely silent. At this time my younger friend and myself didn’t know what a UFO even was. The object continued to glide along the tree tops until it was straight across from us at which point I got my rifle from the front seat and pointed it towards the object. I wasn’t going to shoot at it I just wanted to look through the scope to see if I could see any better. At that point the object began to change from orange to a bright yellow. The light it gave off was almost like the sun as best as I can describe it. My friend that was driving grabbed the rifle out of my hands, threw it in the car, got in and tried to start it but for whatever reason it wouldn’t start. I doubt it had anything to do with the UFO, it was just junk. Within a few seconds the object seemed to shrink and disappear towards the Northwest. Looking back I doubt that it shrank but more probably just moved away so quickly it appeared that way. I estimate that this whole event occurred over a period of about 20 minutes or so. 	My friend was still trying to get the car started and I noticed that he seemed to be terrified. Not scared, terrified. He was visibly shaking and I think he might have been crying. It was a long tome age. I found this strange as he had seen combat in Viet Nam and would fight anybody at the drop of a hat. When the car finally did start, he put it in reverse and I had to jump over the door to get in because he wasn’t waiting. He wouldn’t even pull up so I could get my rabbit. We headed back to town at well in excess of 80 mils per hour and I was more afraid of his driving than I was of the UFO. I finally got him to pull over and let me drive. I put up the top, turned on the heater, and headed back to town. After he calmed down he began to explain to us about UFOs and having seen them before. I got the feeling that there was more that he wasn’t telling but he didn’t seem to want to talk about it. 	We went and found my step-father, who was town marshal at the time, and started to relay to him what we had seen. At first he thought we had been drinking (we hadn’t) or we were joking. After talking to us for awhile he decided we were serious and sober so he checked with the airport in Indianapolis to see if there any planes, helicopters, ect., in the area and was told that there were not and that nothing had shown up on the radar. He also relayed our report to the Rush County Sheriff’s Dept. Of course nothing ever came of any of it. 	Let me end by answering the skeptics. I spent a great deal of my time as a youth outdoors in the woods at night, coon hunting, trapping, ect. I have seen ball lightening, it wasn’t that. There are no swamps anywhere near that area. There were no power lines overhead. You cannot see the airport search lights from there. I never saw anything like that before that time or since. Later in life I move to Ohio and became a police officer where I served for 20 years and worked a lot of midnight shifts. I spent a lot of time looking but never saw anything like that again. To this day I don’t know what to make of it but there it is. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-01-21T00:00:00,39.7384,-85.5719

Petaluma California. My older brother and I were headed for the school bus just up the road while on our walk we spotted two small red brightly glowing spheres around the size of small basket balls. The red balls came out of some bushes across the road then danced around each other as they hovered in front of my brother and my faces. Both of us were stunned and starred as these hovering balls of light moved around us then proceeded up the middle of the road as they sped off. When the reached the top of the hill they headed straight up then disappeared.  My brother and I just looked at each other without saying a word. My brother shrugged his shoulders and shook it off as if he’d just seen something that didn’t exist. The other kids showed up at the bus stop and I asked if any of them saw the lights when one of the kids said, “They were car lights you saw you moron.” I dismissed the incident and really didn’t think any more about it till later in life.  One summer night in 1977 my older brother, two girls and myself were in the Sonoma Mountains in Sonoma County California drinking a few beers like a lot of teens did at the time when my first incident occurred.  It was late night, around midnight, my brother and I were standing outside the vehicle while the two girls were inside when my brother pointed to some bushes around a football field away and said, “What the f---- is that?” I looked to where he was pointing and I saw a rather large glowing orange dome just on the other side of the trees. Not knowing what it was I replied, “I don’t know.” I became entranced with the object as it began growing in size getting bigger and bigger. My brother ordered me back in the car and said, “Let’s get out of here.”  I said, “No, wait, let’s check it out.” He once again ordered, “Get the f---- in the car little brother or I’m leaving you here.” I jumped in, we took off down the mountains and nothing more was said about it until a few days later when my brother asked, “Do you know what that was we saw in the mountains?” I replied, “I don’t have a clue.” My brother continued and said, “Little brother, that was God!”  Thinking he was kind of nuts for saying it I dismissed the conversation. This concluded this incident.  Later on that same year, sometime in the winter evening, I was once again parked close to the same spot in the mountains with a different friend this time. It was around 10:00 pm. And we were talking about things we wondered about. I was saying I wonder why this and this happens when my friend said, “What I wonder is what the hell is that?” He was pointing to an orange harvest moon across town just above the other mountain range. I laughed and replied, “It’s the moon you idiot.” My friend looked dead serious to me then pointed up into the sky then said, “Oh yeah, then what’s that.” He was now pointing at what appeared to be another moon. Being rather shocked I replied, “I don’t know.”  We watched as another harvest moon appeared next to the first one in the mountains, soon a third one appeared.  “We’ve got to check these things out,“ Said my friend as he started the car and sped across town to the other set of mountains. We weren’t sure exactly where they were so we guessed and headed out Two Rock Road in Petaluma California. When we reached the coast guard base we drove up to the guard tower and asked if they saw three glowing harvest moons in the mountains. Needless to say they treated us as if we were nuts and sent us on our way. That night we never did find the objects or see them anywhere else.  1984, Seven years later, I was around 24  years old working in Healdsburg California. I had to commute from Petaluma California to Healdsburg which was around a 45 minute drive everyday which I had to be at work by 6:00 AM. Needless to say I had to get up pretty early in the morning to make it there. I’ve always been a very anal person always making it to work at least 20 minutes early so I could have enough time to relax, drink some coffee and back in those days, smoke some cigarettes. This incident is a weird one as I didn’t remember most of what I’m writing about until much later in life. Anyway, I left to work one day at the same time that I always left then headed up Highway 101 north to Healdsburg. I remember leaving the town of Santa Rosa Heading North and driving through what used to be the usual desolate area of Windsor. As I was driving suddenly I started feeling very tired when I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed two very bright lights, speeding up on me. I thought to myself who’s this idiot going this fast? As the lights approached the rear of my vehicle my car slowed down to a stop. I remember trying to give it gas but it wouldn’t move. Suddenly the car went completely dead and all I could see were very bright lights behind me. I remember wondering what was going on. The lights moved from the rear of my vehicle rising above my car, when suddenly I hear a loud bumping noise much like a tow truck would make as it lifts up a car. I felt my car being lifted off the ground. I tried opening the doors but they were locked. I remember jumping into the back seat and trying the rear door but it was locked. I remember white light all around me and being totally petrified. The next thing I remember was sitting in the driver seat with my engine running but parked off on the side of the road. I shook my head in disbelief and wondered what happened if anything.  I stepped on the gas an my car took off up highway 101 as I headed to Healdsburg. I seriously didn’t know what happened and wondered if an! ything d id happen at all. I arrived to work, went in and poured a cup of coffee like I usually did. I lit up a smoke when and noticed one of my co-workers working. I asked, “Hey D--, why are you here so early?” D-- looked at me, laughed and replied, “Why are you so late?” I asked, “Late, what do you mean? I’m not late.” He laughed again and said, “You idiot, you’re 20 minutes late.” Being a little bewildered I put out my smoke then headed to the time clock where I realized he was right, I wasn’t only 20 minutes late but, rather 40 as I usually arrived 20 minutes early every day. When I got home both my wife and I checked our clocks and none of them were off. There were 40 minutes missing from my day.  1987 Three years later I was around 27 years old living in a cottage on a hill in rural Petaluma California. It was sometime in spring around 2:00 am. I woke to the sound of a humming noise and looked at the walls above my bed noticing bright lights going around them. I tried to wake up my wife but couldn’t so I hopped out of bed. I went to my daughters room next to ours and checked in on her and she was sound asleep also. I walked in the living room which had windows overlooking the hillside. I looked out the window past the grove of trees and saw bright lights. There was nothing on the hill and the lights made no sense at all being there. The lights resembled the brightness of lights used by freeway crews while working on the roads at night.  I turned and noticed the lights bouncing off the wall mirrors so wanting to get a better look a headed out the front door, closing it behind then out off the porch into the yard. In my underwear I exited the gate which opened in to the field then looked up on the hill. About 200’ in front of me was a large glowing sphere hovering a few feet off the ground. The sphere resembled a small harvest moon and I remembered wondering if I made a mistake going out to investigate. I looked back at the house and seeing the front door closed I wanted to go back in. I couldn’t move as I seemed to be paralyzed. Being very frightened I looked back at the sphere when suddenly three images appeared standing in the field. The images were men which looked just like us except very tall. They were somewhere around 8’ tall, well built and had bald heads. They were dressed in black jumpsuits and wore side arms. The next thing I remember was waking up in my bed around 8:00 am on a Saturday Morning. I remember opening my eyes wondering if I dreamed the who thing. It almost seemed like hours were missing from my night and I had a small hole or mark right in the center of my forehead which wasn’t there before.  Years later the entire incident started coming back to me and I began remembering  what happened. It was around 2000 when it became very vivid. There were not only the three beings looking like us but also others resembling the typical aliens with big eyes and grey skin. The beings looking like us seemed to be in charge and the other’s worked with them. The mark in my forehead, which is still there today was made by a long needle type instrument which was inserted into my skull. This instrument was used for something I’m not sure of. They communicated with me telepathically and seemed to download and upload information into and out of me. In summary, the visit was a religious experience in which they told me God and Jesus are real and do exist. I wasn’t a religious man before these incidents but afterwards they changed my life. What we communicated about back and forth was very in-depth and there’s not enough paper or time to cove the topics but, I’ll reiterate in saying they convinced me Jesus is still alive and went on to say that they are us and we are them.

It could have been any time between early 1974 through summer of 1976.  Though, I believe it was a summer evening in 1975 after dark, which would make it after 9:00 PM EDT.  I am estimating the time based the fact that some of the neighbors who were there moved to a different neighborhood in 1976, and I don't think I had started first grade yet, which I did in September 1975.  I put it in summer, because I don't think I would have been out riding bikes in the dark during school, but it could have been spring and maybe earlier in the evening, but it was definitely after dinner.  It could have been 1974, and I have seen similar reports from that year, but for some reason I think it was later.  I was out riding bikes with my brother and some neighbors in Newnan, Georgia.  In the summer of 1975, I was 5 years old and my brother was 8. There were 5 or 6 of us all gathered at the end of the driveway of the kid across the street from my house.  We were in a subdivision off Roscoe Road, and during the event we were facing due north. Most of the land in that direction for about a quarter mile was undeveloped forest, but there were houses on the gravel back road and pasture beyond some of the woods.  Right next to my house was a clearing that at one time was going to be a short road, and the neighbor’s driveway was directly across the street from it.  What caught our eye was a huge, glowing, orangey-yellowy circle or sphere that flew in from the west and hovered near the center of that clearing, not too far over the tree line.  We all stood and watched it hover for a moment, then it split in half vertically and fire shot up out of the middle. I don’t remember an actual fireball being released, just an explosion of fire.  Then the two halves came back together and the sphere flew back off to the west and below the horizon.   I seem to remember it went up a little before it went west and down.  All the movements – appearing, disappearing, splitting, and rejoining – were calm, smooth and controlled, like gliding. From what I remember, it didn’t make any sound. I don't recall it illuminating anything. It seemed to be close, maybe ¼ to ½ mile away, but there is no way really tell how far away it was or how large. The width of the clearing was standard two-lane road length, about 20 feet, and the object appeared to take up about the same amount of space in width from our perspective. It may have been a little narrower or wider than the clearing, but not much.  The entire event was brief, probably under a minute.  I haven't seen those neighbors in a long time, but my brother and I still talk about it from time to time.  My sister had gone in for a minute and missed it, but she remembers us telling her about it. I have never seen any mention of it anywhere by anyone else and don't recall anything at the time.  I come to sites like this occasionally to search for a description of anything similar around the same time. Not knowing where the object really was means, of course, that anyone for many, many miles could have seen it.  I’ve found a few similar stories from around GA around that time, but the only one that mentions fire at all reported a fireball from a rectangle.  A couple of years ago, I met some folks in Athens, GA who knew two guys that I knew in high school in Newnan.  They told me that in the mid-to-late 1980s, two of them were in one of their backyards lying on a trampoline and saw some type of event which they described as a UFO that totally freaked them out.  I don't recall all the details of their experience, but I do know it was different from mine.  I think they saw a line or other formation of several lights.  At any rate, I got very excited when the people started to tell me about it, because I thought it may have been around the same time as my sighting.  After I found out it was a good 10-13 years later and different, I still remained quite excited about it, because that particular guy lived about 2 miles north of my house in the Macedonia Road area.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,33.39435520361991,-84.76770678733031

I was lying in my bed on Sunday night (early Monday morning) around 2:07 a.m. when I turned my head around to look out the window (my bed is facing away from the window, but is right next to it), I started to notice that I could see some of the major stars that night which was rare. Because it is usually always cloudy here at State, but the last couple of days have been pretty clear sky and ok visibility at night which allowed me to only see the very bright stars in the sky... After looking for about a minute I saw these two lights in the distance that looked like planes at first, but became much similar in size and appearance as the stars around them. But these two objects were coming straight towards my direction (still very far away and high altitude). After flying side by side they satrted to cross paths simultaneously in kind of a figure-8 type motion. while moving very quickly, and traveling very fast.. they stopped in mid-air for about 2 seconds.. At this point, I thought it was just my eyes and maybe I had been sitting for too long. but I adjusted my eyesight, even moved closer and away from the window. I know what I saw.. It was so amazing.. Then the two lights faded into a purple-pinkish color and started moving and crossing paths again in a way that defined the laws of gravity. They would squiggle for a second, then they casually coasted through the clouds and started whisking away parallel with my window (still far away)..and as they flew away they would travel while continuously fly over eachother and then cross paths like they were joy-riding or something. it sounds weird, but it was quite beautiful, it was almost like they were dancing at one point, i was so excited and amazed by it. I followed them with my eyes as they zipped very quickly away into the clouds. There is no way this could have been any commercial or military aircraft because of its color, comlexity, speed, and it's very odd way of manuevering.. I had never ! seen a U FO in my life until now.

I turned my head from side to side to make sure it wasn't cargo being held up by a crane, or even something hanging from a nearby tree. On the contrary it seemed to not be very close to the bell tower after all but a good distance behind it, a mile or more away, and perhaps five hundred feet in the air. I pointed it out to my friends (we were all associated with the University), but by the time I got them looking in the right direction it had slowly moved out of sight into a low-hanging cloud and behind the tower. Its color was not much different than the hazy sky around it, so for all I can remember it may have actually faded out of sight entirely. 	The UFO looked like a nondescript, light gray rectangular box, slightly taller than it was wide, and it rotated slowly. It may have been quite far away, as it was not much larger than a fingernail held at arm's length. From my perspective it was just to the right of the tower, where it hovered for maybe thirty seconds (though I don't know how long it had been there before I noticed it), then moved slowly up and to the left and disappeared. My friends did not see it but during the following discussion one of them admitted having seen a similar box-shaped UFO a few years before. I don't recall the details of his sighting at this time. 	In any case some basic Google research suggests a few clues. Following the direction I had been looking, the UFO was northwest of Ann Arbor. Aviation maps reveal that the only things of any interest in that area are a public air traffic radio tower, a particularly wide section of the Huron River, and the Gooding private/restricted airspace, serial number 920-20. Most other box-shaped UFO reports I've read seemed to have occurred near a military airport of some kind, including one reported on this site from around the same time last year, here in Michigan near Sault St. Marie (which had an Air Force Station that was reportedly closed in 1981), which also occurred in broad daylight and was supposedly witnessed by several people. However there don't seem to be any current or former military bases of any kind around Ann Arbor for hundreds of miles. 	Before this sighting I was quite skeptical of all the UFO nonsense...now it seems I'm forced to take it more seriously. Maybe somebody should wander on over to those ""abandoned"" Air Force bases and do some bird watching, or if for any reason these things really do need to be kept a secret, it seems to me they shouldn't be floating their secrets around urban areas in broad daylight.

We thought this was pretty weird considerin the glow. As we watched it, It became bigger and brighter.  At first we all thought it was a meteor and beganning running, But we eventually stopped and watched the light come closer,  As it neared closer, We seen it was a craft of some sort but we all found it very odd that it was not giving off any sounds, Finally it flew overhead in a rather sluggish motion and we all got a pretty good look at what we were seeing. Around it was a faint triangle silohuette, At each corner a orangish light, In the middle a bigger white-blue spotlight and then much smaller pastel-like lights around its rim. After it hovered over us, It headed off towards New Waterford's town and then suddenly qucikened it's pace and disapeared over some houses.  This is not a hoax nor joke of any kind, There was besides myself, 3 other witnesses present at the time of the sighting.

As I stood in the doorway I noticed a very bright string of lights in the sky. They both flashed quickly and raced. Its hard to explain, I have never seen lights do this before. They where red lights. I also noticed a green light when the lights flashed off. This green light was not on the same strand of lights as with the red. I new this was not an airplane or a blimp. I could see the shape of the craft. It was similar to the disc type I have seen on TV and pictures over the years but it was a bit different. The disc was a bit thicker and not as ""flat"". Is the only way I could describe. There was also a section on top of the disc as well. It looked to be made of some type of metal. It was low enough and close enough that I could see it clear as day. I also noticed  rather then flying in one direction, it seemed to hover and move side to side slowly, like a zig Zag. I watched this for about 20 to 30 seconds until it moved to a point where the house located in the lot behind mine had blocked my view. I called my mother immediatley. She has seen one over a cornfield at our old house about 20 year ago. This one did not look like the one she had seen. Considering how low this was, and how busy the area I live in is, I would definately think someone else saw this. There is a major airport located about a 45 minute drive from me so I do see many planes regularly however I know this was definately not a plane. However about 1 minute or so after I had seen the ufo there was a place in the same area.

It was going so fast I thought something was going to crash down the road ahead of me, as it was going in the same direction as me.  I was thinking and trying to figure out what it was, and I thought maybe it was a meteor, because I had seen a meteor shower before, but the meteor shower wasn't green, wasn't fast, and it was no where near this bright. I called my friend and we didn't really know what to do, so I wound up doing nothing, but after 15 or so minutes I saw a bright green light ahead on the highway and it really scared/excited me because I thought wow, maybe something really did crash, but it turned out to be the lights from some Georgia/Mexican/kiddie-park type place's exit.   *shrug  I hope someone can tell me what that thing was someday!

The craft seemed to be only a few miles away though I'm not sure of it's altitude, but it was very low.

I asked him where it was as I could not see anything moving directly above me.  To which he stated that it was not above us but just above the horizon.  Upon looking at the object it moved across the sky to the left, then suddenly to the right again and then upwards.  Then stopped and just hovered. At first I thought this might be a helicopter, but there was no sound.  Secondly the speed the object was moving at was far to fast for a helicopter in the night to move and change directions as this object did.

I must make it quite clear, I never saw any UFO, Alien Life Form, or Supernatural Technology. The connection I have made was in fact a sense. To begin my story I must start back on the day of May 18th, 2008. It was around 8:30 A.M. on a Sunday and I was suddenly awakened which was unusual because I usually sleep in until noon. Upon waking up, I can’t describe what happened, but I felt something out of place in my house, I got up, and found that my dog who normally slept in a separate room, had been outside my room scratching at the door. This troubled me, so I went back into my room, grab what I determined to be the heaviest, blunt object in my room, (which at the time happened to be my Guitar Hero Gibson) and proceeded down my stairs leading my dog by the collar. I decided to look outside of my house and with dog and guitar in hand, walked outside. When I got outside, my dog immediately took off running, and did not come back for six days. Out side, I found nothing, and proceeded back into my house, feeling hungry and not in the mood to make myself food; I decided to go to McDonalds and to look for my dog on the way. I did not feel normal until I had left about 20 yards from my house, where I did indeed see my dog, but he would not come when I called him. All this, albeit out of the ordinary, was nothing to what I would discover in the weeks to come. When I had gone to McDonalds, eaten my food, and come home, I found throughout the day that I was no longer hungry. I had also discovered that my athletic ability, which was already significant, had dramatically increased; my times in the mile dropped from 5.03 to 4.27, and continue to go down, despite my being in the off season for track, and no longer practicing as hard. In the past week alone, I have grown 1/16th of an inch, and in total over the month that followed this event, have grown about an Inch and ½. I only now need to eat one meal a day, and my Vocabulary, Math skills, and Memory have vastly improved, and I dare say they maybe on par with others who have achieved doctorate degrees. I have noticed similar changes with my dog, which is 16 years old, and has the agility of a puppy. I searched my property and found nothing; similar occurrences have happened with my neighbors, only effects are less impressive than my own. All doctor check outs have found nothing unusual.

I frequently go to my back deck to smoke a cigarette before bed.  On this occaision, I saw a ball of light cross the sky at a high rate of speed.  It took about four seconds to travel from the southern horizon to the northern horizon (and it was very dark out).  There was no noise that I could hear.  Estimated altitude, about 5,000 feet.  I know this because I live near Philadelphia Airport.  It usually takes an aircraft about a full minute to travel from horizon to horizon, and they only go east-west out of PHL.  I was content to go to sleep knowing I had seen an Angel or a UFO, and not bother telling anyone, until I saw the footage of the British Police Helicopter.  The ball of light in the night shot is exactly what I saw.  Absolutely no question at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

We started star gazing to pass the time.  Looking for shapes and I pointed out Orion to the kids.  By vision maybe 3 inches above the screen, (facing NE) there was a triangle of what appeared to be just stars, but between two of the stars was another that was fading in and out.  Thought it was cool and pointed it out to the girls.   About that time the previews started and we quit paying attention to anything else.  The previews run about 15 minutes and the screen goes dark again before the feature starts.   Looked up to see if the one fading in and out was still there, and the triangle of stars I was using to coordinate the position were gone as well.  This time of year the stars rise in the sky, i looked above and to both sides, they were simply gone.  I dont know the exact date, about 2 weeks after the news in phoenix went nuts about the return of the phoenix lights. (I dont care what the news says they were not flares, flares do not reconfigure their positions and flares sent up attached to regular(kind you buy in the store) balloons from and individuals backyard(as they claimed even less so)can not be seen from other cities, would not last that long, nor could a reg balloon hold its position with out moving before deciding to reconfigure its position then holding again.  Getting off topic sorry. I dont know much that much about space other than i love to watch the night sky.  I know what different satellites look like passing in the sky. These too are not found to simply be sitting still fading in and out, they travel in the sky.  I have no idea what i saw.  Like i said it was just interesting due to short time following the ""Deer Valley Lights"" ""Return of the Phoenix lights"" or whatever they are calling it now. This type of thing fascinates me, I have always held an interest in this field, though  never really have done anything about it. I have heard many stories from family that are absolutely out of this world ""no pun intended"" things that i was not a witness too, but know the witnesses to be honest, most of them anyway.  Things that my family has seen that cant be explained away.  But the reason i have been looking at these sights the last few weeks was to see if anyone else had seen what i saw, or espescially if they had seen what happened to it, where did it go, how did it vanish.

I grabbed my binoculars and focused in on it. The craft seemed to be changing colors in sort of a loop fashion; repeating. At first, this color dancing thing led me to believe I was looking at a certain object that I've seen many times prior with similar color change pattern. After just a few seconds I realized this object was not anything I'd seen based on the intense colors being emitted in a pattern or loop and also how it was moving. I feel the object was more round than anything else; the color behavior held my attention greatly.

I thought at first it was a plane, because in profile, it looked to have wings of some sort, but it looked almost like an old bi-plane.  But there was no noise, and the object appeared to be too high to be a plane like that.  As I watched for the next ten to fifteen minutes, this object kept moving further and further away and also appeared to be climbing.  The only frame of reference I had for altitude and distance was when it passed in front of a smaller cumulus cloud (or perhaps through it, because this was the first time I almost lost the object.)  As it moved further away, it seemed to be more spherical than I first perceived, and was a copper color, because it glinted a little in the sunlight.  When it passed through or in front of the cloud, it looked like a black speck, but when it emerged, I could see the copper coloration again.  The only other thing that bothered me was that this object appeared to be fast-moving, because in those ten minutes, it moved in a seemingly pointed direction, all while climbing higher.

It was already dark by this time, so I looked up into the sky, to view the stars. The night sky was clear, with no clouds, fog, or haze. Moments after looking up and admiring the stars, I noticed what I at first thought was a flight of geese, or birds of some sort that fly in a ""V"" formation. The object or formation was very faint against the dark sky, and thinking it was a flock of birds, I continued to watch and listen for their honking sound. Instead, I heard no sound at all. The object was moving from northeast, to southeast and I immediately noted that it was moving at a very high rate of speed, too fast for birds. As the object passed directly overhead, its outline became more apparent, but was still very faint, and almost blended with the sky. As it passed between my position, and a group of stars, I was able to see that it was in fact a solid or at least, a contiguous object (not a flock of birds). It resembled the shape of a stealth bomber, or something like it. There were no visible lights on the object. Another curious fact about this occurrence was that the object made no sound whatsoever. If it was a stealth bomber, I would have expected to hear jet engine noise, or some faint sound, but I heard nothing. The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of perhaps 5,000 feet above ground level, estimated by its relative size in the sky, and the rate at which it moved. From the time I first observed the object, it was at about a 60 degree angle overhead. It passed directly over my house, and I was able to see the faint outline for approximately 5-6 seconds, and then it completely faded as it moved southwest.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,44.586138873239435,-123.29192676056337

On the right side the sky was orange with a white strip across the bottom and darker as we looked higher up. As we drove through the trailer park the sky on our right proceeded to grow more orange. The previous orange shade intensified. Driving down the streets of the trailer park any where the vehicle went the streetlights around it dimmed and continued to do so until we drove away. As we drove out of the trailer park the sky seemed to darken and the orange light gathered behind C's car. Driving down the main street back to K's house we were stopped by a train. A light that was previously white was now yellow and while K and C were waiting for the train to pass other colors started to appear mixed in with the yellow. C rolled her window down to see if it might have been the fog that was starting to roll in. It wasn't. She asked a car on the other side of her and the occupants of the vehicle said they did not see any light. K and C both saw the light. The train passed and we drove on. The fog had gathered to become slightly obscurant and thus we missed her street the first time around. We drove a few more feet to the roundabout and turned around. We turned onto the correct street and stopped for approximately 3 seconds to roll the window up. There was a shadow behind the car yet when K and C looked there was no one, and nothing.

The temperature was about 36 degrees, perhaps two degrees above the dew point.  My wife and I were in our spa.  It is situated where two legs of our house (an “L” shape) join such that we have a clear view towards the north and east.  Some trees block a horizon view to the east, and the house blocks the view to the southwest.  There is considerable ambient light.  At 2112 (PST) I noticed two lights moving from the northeast to the southwest.  They were moving parallel to each other, being apart about the same distance as two of the stars in the Big Dipper handle, and half as bright as Mars.  [I think it was Mars I was seeing in the northeast sky.]  I said to my wife, “Look at that!”  They passed right over the top of us, just after which my wife located them.  When they disappeared two seconds later, she said, “What was that?”  They moved fast and in straight lines.  About seven seconds elapsed between the times I first saw them above the trees until they disappeared behind my roof.  All I could see were lights, and the lights never varied until they were almost gone.  No noise was heard, although the damned low-speed spa pump was on at the time.  It was too late to see satellites.  Had they been aircraft they would most certainly have been heard (a sonic boom, no doubt).  Since the light was either generated by the objects or reflected, in my mind the only “reasonable” explanation is they were birds.  However…  These two “birds” had to be low (considering their speed) and expert fliers (to perfectly maintain their wide spacing).  They must have had bright underbodies to reflect the light.  City light varies, hence reflection varies, but their brightness didn’t vary.  I sense they weren’t that low, hence the perception of significant speed.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,44.9412471106758,-123.00423516160626

We were heading south on SE 174th just north of Powell when we saw flashes in the sky.  We pulled over to see if we could see what it was and, from our vantage point looking just west of south,  it appeared that there was a helicopter hovering over Powell at about 170th and that it was firing off a strobe of some sort.   The color of the flashes looked more like fire (yellow) than like illumination and I had the impression at first that they were circular as you would see looking at a  'flashbulb'.    We watched for three or four minutes trying to hear any sound of helicopter blades.   There was not any sound. The shape of the object still appeared to be helicopter sized but there not clear running lights and the flashing didn't recur right away.   At this point,  the object appeared to be drifting in a north-northwest direction and passed overhead and just to the west of us.   Still no sound.   Occasionally there was a flash of bright light again or two but not strobelike.   I called my brother who lives almost due west of us at about 90th and asked him to go out and look as the object was getting farther away still appearing to be slowly drifting on an air current---straight line. My brother called back and was looking with his binoculars but couldn't find anything.  The object was, at that point too far to identify in the lighthaze west of me.   I looked at my clock at that point and it was 10:27 so we'd been watching for probably fifteen minutes.   A small plane on a somewhat parallel course in the opposite direction had come out of the northwest heading to the southeast about five minutes earlier and its engines were clearly identifiable. The only scenario I could envision for this event was that a hot air balloon was drifting and was having fire problems with its propane system, but the shape of the object and the inconsistency of the flashes didn't fit and the fact that it was a December night also made it unlikely.",2008-03-04T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I saw that russion satelite enter the atmosphere, back in the late 80's and this didn't look like that. it was not a shooting star, for they happen in just a streak and its over. and it appeared that it was not that high up, like in space...more like the altitude of private planes.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,,

June 9th 2006 at about 8:10pm I was laying in a hammock in my back yard when I noticed a bright light about 50 degrees up from the horizon. There was a lot of airplane traffic that evening but the object was much higher in the sky , and it was not moving just sitting there. I watched this for about 5mins (naked eye),Thinking this thing will move shortly and Ill know what it is. After the 4 or 5 mins I was perplexed and ran inside to get my (deepspace and on a tripod)binoculars. I got them setup and focused in on the object. The object was a perfect sphere, glowing orange in the center and white around the edge. I watched it for about 6mins. and it didnt move,then out of the left side of the object three smaller white spheres appeared and in about 1 min.after that three more white spheres dropped out of the bottom. The objects on the left side were evenly spaced apart, at first so were the bottom objects but then the middle obeject moved out to the left forming a triangle under the main object. Then a small black oblong item dropped just below the triangle of spheres.These things remained this way for several mins.Then the small objects to the left of thr main object started to slowly move away. At this time the main object started to glow abit brighter.Now heres the kicker... The main object then appeared to blowup (for as far away as this was it looked like a massive explosion, it almost filled up the field of view of the binoculars)But then I noticed that it looked more like steam than smoke. Through this steam cloud I could barely see the main object and it looked like it was seperating within this vapor cloud. In an instant all objects were gone,the cloud acted like a vortex and everything was just gone.Nothing fell from the sky. There were no clouds that day , clear as a bell. I am only about 15 mins from Greensboro International airport,I have not checked with them yet to see if they picked it up on radar. I also saw this object two more times within a two week period of the first ! sighting and have a witness on one of the other sightings.  About me, I am 50 years old I own a recording studo and have been an amature astronomer for about 40 years and have seen countless meteors,three comets,almost anything you can think of but nothing like this.",2006-12-07T00:00:00,36.117557352941176,-80.07612941176471

It had a solid golden glow on the side points which extended up and down slightly. It looked like the bottom section of the diamond/cross was longer then the top and sides. We couldn't tell what direction it was moving in. It started moving up and down vertically, in a straight line and then horizontally. We then lost it behind a hill(the island is quite hilly). We drove for around 4/5 minutes before I saw a light on top of another hill and then the other observer saw it as well before it went down behind the hill. Again we drove for a few minutes but I kept getting distracted by a light in my rear view mirror, but no car would come up behind me. The third time I was distracted I saw shadows moving like something was in front of the light. I said to my partner that something was behind us. He looked back and the object was approx. 600ft behind us and 100ft in the air. He got a clear look at it and it was a diamond/cross shape with a slightly longer bottom section. There were golden lights on the two side sections spreading up and down along the vertical section. There was also a red glow on the top and bottom points, slightly spreading up and down along the ends of the vertical section. It followed us for a couple of seconds and then shot off very fast. For a few days after we experienced electrical anomalies, is this coincidence or normal? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2006-12-07T00:00:00,,

The object appeared to have a similar angular size as Jupiter (38""); it shape was not discernable as being different than circular at 7x.)  The object's motion was not noticeable to the naked eye, but became noticeable as the Jupiter to object separation increased as viewed through 7x50mm binoculars over this interval of time.  In the final five to ten minutes of observation, the light bagan to moved more rapidly westward, barely noticeble under binocular observation, though still at a very slow rate of apparent angular motion.  At ~20:50 EDT, the the object began to dim significantly.  Within 2 minutes it faded out completely, and was no longer visible, even in binoculars.  The fade out time of 2 minutes is consistent with the time it takes for the disk of the sun to set; ergo the fade-out at approx. 20:50 EDT corresponds to the sun setting at the objects's altitude, and its illumination being reflected sunlight.  IOW, sunset at the object's altitude was at 20:50 EDT, while local sunset at observing location was at 20:17 EDT (as per planetarium software).  A cursory calculation indicates this diference in sunset time corresponds to the object's altitute being roughly 250,000 feet ASL.  Starting location of object @ ~20:20 was 30 degrees altitude, ~27 degrees W of South azimuth.  Ending location @ ~20:50 EDT was ~27 degrees altitude, ~38 degrees W of South. (Location based on planetarium software data for Jupiter at local time/location)  A cursory analysis of this data, assuming same angular size as Jupiter, is an object that is about 100' wide, at altitude of ~250,000 ft, about 100 miles slant range from point of observation.  Its average speed is about ~10 degrees of angle/30 minutes; this works out to be about 35 mph at the estimated distance, slower at the beginning of the observation, somewhat faster toward the end.  Geographically, this object seems to have been located over the Catskills in New York state, based on plotting azimuth angle and estimated distance on an aviation sectional map.  I have no idea what ""flies"" at 250,000' at speeds between 0 to perhaps 100 mph, and is about 100' across, but that what the data says it was.

It moved in a northward direction, but was quite faint and I found it difficult to track the object’s movement. I watched the object for between 30 seconds and 1 minute.

The moon was almost full and the sky was mostly clear during the sighting and turned cloudy shortly after.  It was around 10:30 p.m.  We were admiring the night sky when we saw 5 orange lights appear one by one.  They were huge lights, bigger than any passing planes and much larger than the biggest stars.  They lit up one at a time with out any trails around them and without moving.  They lit up from left to right in an upwards facing bow pattern one by one.  Once all five were lit they turned off one by one in the reverse direction.  The lights were well above the horizon and appeared to the left of the moon.  The formation was huge in length and at least twice the size of the moon in the night sky.  The whole thing lasted only a few seconds.  The moon was very bright and we could tell that there was no visible shape behind the lights.  We then watched the sky for around 15 minutes to look for anything else without luck.  After this we rushed down to the beach to see if we could walk around and see if anyone else was talking about the lights.  As we got out to the beach a low flying fighter jet rushed to the north along the shoreline. 	The next night, 6/27, we watched briefly for the lights but saw nothing.  On 6/28, we decided to sit out on the balcony at 10 p.m.  The moon, even fuller than the preceding nights, illuminated a partly cloudy sky.  At 10:08 p.m., as we were gazing out at the ocean,  the same large orange lights appeared in the sky, this time there were 4 and they were in a ‘/’ diagonal shape.  Again, the moon was very bright and we could tell that there was no viable shape behind the lights. So, upon seeing them again, we called for my fiancé’s brother and his mother to come outside onto the balcony with us.  We waited, looking at the sky, hoping to show them the lights.  Over the next 30 minutes or so they showed up again a few times, but only one or two at a time.  Their locations varied each time they appeared.  Then they appeared directly in front of us.  There were 4 and they were in a ‘-_-_’ staggered pattern.  Immediately after they turned off, they same formation appeared again slightly above and to the left of the first.  Then after a few minutes had passed, another formation appeared.  This one was three lights in a ‘/’ diagonal pattern.  It looked slightly further away than the first but it was still significantly bigger than any planes or stars.  A few more minutes passed and we saw what looked like a plane or fighter jet heading in the same northwards direction towards where the lights had been. 	 I am in college and my fiancé and I are science buffs in our free time.  We are very skeptical people and always look for logical explanations to every situation.  This was totally beyond our explanation.  There was NOTHING visible behind the lights.  Each time they appeared in plain view in the light of the moon.  There were no trails like with a meteorite and the lights were not moving.  They did not dim, they simply went out. They were much bigger than any known man made aircraft.  The lights left all 4 of us utterly speechless.  We did look again at the same time on 6/29 but we saw nothing out of the ordinary.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468

Sky conditions were clear. Beginning in the East-Northeast sky (from the point I first noticed it) at approximately 60 degrees above the horizon, the light traversed almost 50 degrees, heading South-Southwest before fading out of sight near South. When I saw the light, the brightness appeared to be close to a magnitude 1 star.  Shortly after I made visual contact, it slowly (close to 10 seconds) increased in brightness until it was at perhaps a magnitude of -5, noticeably brighter than Venus in the West.  As soon as it began to brighten, I alerted my wife who was sitting with her back turned to the object.  She also witnessed the brightening, though a few seconds after I did.  I was bright enough that I did not even have to point it out to her. After reaching maximum brightness, it returned to the initial brightness in about 5 seconds, then faded out of sight in the South about 40-50 degrees above the horizon.  The entire sighting lasted less than 2 minutes. My initial reaction that I was very exited about was that I had just seen the International Space Station showing off one of its “flare” phenomenon due to the new huge solar array briefly catching the sunlight.  However, the next day I researched sighting opportunities in my area for the previous night.  The ISS was supposed to be low in the West, heading in a Northerly direction, never reaching more than 20 degrees above the horizon.  This is not even close to what we saw.  I do not know of any other satellite that could produce a reflection that bright.  Based on what I saw, I am certain it was not an airplane – its trajectory placed it opposite the sun, and the light we saw was a reflection of some sort and very likely not artificial, and there was no “flashing” – the light was purely white from our perspective.  There was also no trail behind it, so I also do not think it was a meteor skipping off the atmosphere, but I’m not positive.  I’m not suggesting anything extra-terrestrial.  It was just a strange phenomenon that I have never seen, and cannot explain as I have ruled out my most logical explanations.  Perhaps a rocket stage firing, but we don’t launch rockets from north of Georgia towards the south that I’m aware of, and as I stated before I believe only the ISS is large enough to be that bright and it was not in the vicinity of the sighting.  I’d love any other possible explanations.  I work professionally as a performance analyst and consultant.  I am also an amateur astronomer and a private pilot (though not current).

It was worm shaped, it looked kind of like a para-sail. It seemed to have three sections that were fairly straight, but combined together to make a shallow downward facing C shape - the open part of the C facing the ground. At first I thought it was a balloon or a kite, but it didn't behave like either. I ran into the house to find a camera, when I returned, it had moved to a new position, and had become much fainter. I watched it gradually, over a period of 2 - 3 minutes, grow fainter and fainter, until it vanished. It was also growing darker at the same time. It may have simply vanished into some clouds, but it was starting to grow dark outside, so it was hard to tell if there were clouds that it could have disappeared into.  I took a picture with my cell phone camera-you can see something there, but it just looks like a blurry smudge. I took some pics with a digital camera, but unfortunately, i couldn't figure out how to turn the flash off. I also took some video with the digital camera, but by that time, the object had grown very faint, and it was growing dark outside.  We did see and hear an aircraft approach the same area at great speed. I was unable to tell what kind of aircraft it might be, but it sounded like a military jet.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,40.72497775784753,-74.06215219730942

I could not find the bird, but I looked North (approx) at about a 75 degree angle and saw a very visable black line with what looked like a tail.  As I observed the object I realized it wasn't moving.  Looking a little longer I realized it was moving slowly backward, but was very very high in the sky.  I then told my neighbor to look and she saw it and immediately said it was a plane as well.  Then she was surprised as well to see it was m0ving backward.  At this point I ran inside and grabbed my binoculars. Finding the object, It was clearly NOT airplane, balloon, or anything else I've heard could be spotted.  It looked like a stick, with one end, shorter and turned upwards.  It had a slight bow in the long section.  As I watched it it moved slowly North East and then dissappeared from site.  At one point it changed shape from the previously described stick, to a full half circle or bow shape.  It could have been the angle I was seeing it from.

I went out in the backyard around 10:30 PM to take the dogs out, a normal routine prior to going to bed. I usually have a great view of the sky and love to star gaze. Blinking lights on the NW horizon amongst the trees caught my attention. At first I thought it was bright stars in the distance. But I noticed they would disappear while I stood in one place and reappear in another. As I moved to find them they would appear and disappear. I tired of this event and began looking straight up at the brilliant stars hoping for a shooting star when a series of flashing lights appeared in the western sky. At first glance it looked like a plane but as it got closer overhead I began to watch and follow its unusual movements and shape. The object was moving from west to east at a speed that was faster than an airplane, its shape was unrecognizable even though there was a full moon. The object moved in an erratic nearly snakelike formation. Many lights could be seen flashing across its middle girth in a very random, flickering red and white pattern. I couldn’t judge its distance from earth nor its size but I believe it was larger than a plane. Once the object disappeared in to the eastern horizon, I heard the tremendous trailing noise of a jet-liner back to the east where the object first appeared. I noticed a flash of dull white light, similar to a lightning flash, illuminating a cloud in the sky, as the rumbling of the aircraft tried to catch up to the object. Could it have been traveling faster than light? I watched the object for 20-30 seconds and the noise lasted nearly as long.",2007-04-27T00:00:00,29.7679,-96.5874

The object was a large circular shape that first appeared as a hole in the clouds with a stream of lower clouds being pulled up into it, in a twisting motion. This twisting motion is what first caught my attention. 	I viewed the object for about 30 seconds thinking that it was just a strange cloud formation in a perfect circle. I have seen ice crystal circles in clouds that form around the sun during the cold winter months in northern states. However this is South Florida and it was in the 70's. At that point I decided to take a picture of it with my camera phone. The sun was shining brightly in my eyes just to the left of the object so it was difficult to see how the camera was positioned. After taking the first picture I noticed that the shape/object was quickly being covered by clouds. I took a second picture less than 1 minute later to try and capture what I was seeing. After taking the second picture I walked around to the front of the house and took the third and final picture from that location due to a wider view from which to take the picture. By this point the object was gone and the clouds were returning to a normal drifting motion 	While I was standing in the front yard the customer approached me to mention something pertaining to the work I was doing and I asked her if she had noticed the shape/object in the sky. She looked up and saw what was left of the circular formation in the clouds and asked &#8220;what do you think that is&#8221;. I said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;. 	After viewing the pictures later on that day I realized that the first picture actually captured much more than I could see with my eyes since the sun was to the left of the object making it difficult to stare at it for very long. There is a light beam from the sun that is deflecting off of the top of the object as well as what looks like a small light on the bottom right side of the object. Also the twisting motion of the lower cloud being pulled up into, or following the circular shape is clearly visible in all 3 pictures. Even after the object was gone, the twisted cloud slowly drifted away as though it had simply been sucked momentarily but was not affected in any other fashion. I would liken the motion to dust following a car on a dirt road, which pulls up into a twisting motion off of the road. 	I am sending all three pictures as evidence to what I saw.

I had been pointing them out to my mother throughout the day.  My mother was with me, visiting from out of town.  I noticed a white sphere next to a chemtrail and became very excited because I am involved in the UFO phenomenon and I hadn’t had a sighting in a while, much less with so many potential witnesses, especially Mom.  So I announced to the teachers and parents on the schoolyard that I was seeing a UFO and they all saw it as well.  There was one other parent, a male, who later told me he had had a major sighting in Oregon before.  Two other teachers saw it and another parent.  I don’t remember if my mom could see it.  She doesn’t have great vision.  It was five minutes after noon.  The UFO was very high, about 75 degrees in the sky.  I was looking north and the object was just west of the Santa Catalina Mountains.  It was initially between two chemtrails, but then got lost in the one on the left.  It reappeared again.  Eventually it was clearly seen again below the chemtrail.  I now wonder if the object was stationary and the chemtrail was drifting.  I wish I had sited the object relative to a non-moving object like a telephone pole.  I took a picture of  it with my mom’s disposable camera, but I haven’t developed the picture yet and I doubt it will show up as it was very small and high up.  The two parents and I moved out into the parking lot and continued to observe the object for another five minutes, perhaps.

Two flickering balls of light hovering for hours. For the past two nights around 10 pm, there have been a number of light formations appearing in the west sky. At first I thought they were flares being dropped, but then after they kept re-appearing I noticed how they did not behave like free falling flares would. They did not decend in the least bit and their glow dwarfed the tiny flickering of aircraft that appeared off an on in the same area. I also realized that there was no military base in that area. They did appear like flares would though- simultaneously igniting and then vanishing in the same order and timing sequence in which they appeared- so they could just be a special type of training flare that would behave differently or parachute slower... but the more mysterious lights came later. I was doing a search for them when I came across the article of the person below me from the same area in Indiana. We saw the same type of lights, only I saw 2 and on a different night; tonight. In the same area of the sky that the flare-like lights appeared, there were, and still are, two bigger-than-star sized lights that are flickering and sort of just hanging out. They are not planes because they haven't moved left or right, or gotten bigger or smaller in hours. They are not planets because I know where venus and mars are located, and these are not them. These two lights, depending on how big they are, seem to be about a mile or two apart. They are flickering white/yellow/blue/red. These are not Helicopters. They are too high and too still. Helicopters do not hover for hours on end. The only other strange event of the evening is that a friend who also witnessed the lights said tonight that her business, which was toward the direction of the lights, began to suffer electrical surges when the lights came. Her store lights flickered and her computer shut off. She said she witnessed the flares, only once they dissapeared, it was only for a 2 seconds and they re-appeared and then was also told that other businesses in the same area were having power troubles. I'm sure there is a reasonable explaination for this, but at the current time these are lights that belong to an aircraft which are not identifiable to me.

They look to us more like lanterns, of some variety.  Just a guess, on our part.  PD)) I took a 9 min video of more than 25 lights traveling E over Phuket Island, Thailand The following is my testimonial to the events that took place during a 3 week vacation trip to Patung Beach located on Phuket Island in southern Thailand, on March 22, 2006 at approximate 11:30pm.  The day started with less than favorable weather conditions, raining heavily throughout the day and into the early evening.  Later in the evening the clouds broke up and the night appear clear with a salting of small cumulus clouds and what appear to be a high layer of haze above the clouds making it difficult to see any stars and the moon was not in sight.  At approximately 11:30pm, I had walk out on to the balcony of my second story room at the Tropica Hotel and while looking in the direction of Na-Kha-le bay (N by NW) I saw a dark red (almost ox blood colored) light rise up above the tree line heading in the direction of Rang Yai Island (E by NE).  My first impression was that that light was a helicopter of sorts but my curiosity rose a little after realizing that the light was not blinking.  Within the next 5 seconds a second and a third light appear with the same dark red coloring, rising above the tree line, nearly in line with the first light.  This seamed odd to me so I quickly walked back into my room and grabbed my Canon ES50 video recorder in an effort to get a closer look.  Within the approximately 30 seconds it took me to grab my video recorder and turn it on, 5 of these lights had appear, all heading the same direction mentioned above, but now the color of the lights had changed to white.  After about 5 minutes, over 20 of these lights had appeared still traveling in the same direction, on an incline of about 30%. It was clear that once they reach about the center of the island, just over the Kathu Cascades range, they began to ascend upwards at a near vertical angle.  While I was recording, some lights would pass behind the branches of the trees in the hotels court yard, obstructing their view only briefly.    I found it difficult to zoom in on a cluster of them without loosing focus.  Finally, after trying several times to get a close up, I decided to pan down into the court yard of the hotel with hopes to get the camera to focus and it appeared to work.  I put the camera on pause for a brief moment to move to the other side of the balcony to get a better angle.  I saw, what appeared to be the last light quite some distance from the others and in a clear patch of sky without any obstructions from branches.  I quickly zoomed in on the single light, which at this point was a dark orange color.  The light took on a triangular shape and moved as though it were traveling in an ‘s’ pattern but still holding the same general direction as the other lights.  I tried to zoom in more but lost the image.  As I zoomed out, the craft reappeared and then spun in a clockwise direction, disappeared for much less than a second then 2 small white lights appeared just slightly ahead of where the craft disappeared.  The two lights joined and created a burst of white light that began to gyrated until it formed a circle.  The next minutes of video taping was of this singular light pulsating from the center core at a very rapid rate.  I found I was getting rather fatigued as my hand began to shake from trying to hold camera still for the entire course of this 9 minute video.  I zoomed out from the singular light and paused the camera.  In the next minute, I quickly exited my room and headed to the pool area in an effort get a better view.  Once I reach the pool the lights were gone.  I rushed back upstairs to the balcony in my room to see if they were still viewable from that angle but found they were not in sight.  I went to the bar at the hotel and to other bars on Bang-La Road asking others if they had seen these lights.  Evidently, no one had.  I scanned the local papers the next day for any",2006-05-15T00:00:00,,

I looked out the window and clearly saw 3 silver flying saucers hovering above a big field of red flowers. They had a slight woble to them as they were sitting stationary in the air about  200 feet up. They had a circular pattern of red and white lights around the bottom and were about 40 feet across. I also remember seeing a small antennae on top of their dome.  I revisited the site recently and estimated that we were between half and a quarter mile away as we were driving closer.  After about 20 seconds, within a blink of an eye they were gone. I was twelve at the time and was very impressed by what I saw and told my folks about it as soon as we got home. The next morning when I awoke to my radio alarm clock, set to KCBQ, the DJ announced that over 150 people phoned in to report seeing 3 flying saucers throughout San Diego County. This event ocurred in clear daylight and I often wonder about what flew these things and where they come from. They seemed to be checking out the impressive sight of the red flowers from above.

Our home was across the street from a cul-de-sac and this very large circular object approached our home from that direction.  My husband and son joined me and all witnessed this enormous, silent, craft with many lights on it's underside, slowly drift over us and proceed eastward.  We didn't live far from the Islip McArthur Airport so after the craft passed over us I ran inside and called the F.A.A. and reported the sighting.  Later on that night I heard on the radio that over 100,000 people on Long Island had seen the craft and had called in to various radio stations, police departments, etc.  The next day our local newspapers ran something about a weather balloon being spotted.

I was around 7 years old at them and it was in the evening perhaps in the spring/summer of 1976 and my parents, younger brother and I had stopped by a local McDonalds for a bite to eat.   We were eating inside our car in the parking lot when both my brother and I noticed a low flying rotating object flying over a strip mall across the street.  My parents dismissed it as an airplane or helicopter or something rationale, since Cecil Field was very close to this area,  but my brother and I were just fixated on this object!   The object was maybe 400-600 ft. up in the air as it flew over this strip mall moving from left to right in our field of vision.  The object was circular with multicolored lights (red, green, blue, etc.) around its edges, it rotated like a carousel with a slight tilt to the right and angled facing us so you could see it was circular.  I could see all the individual lights and the object itself rotating clockwise.  The object also had a single light on the top that illuminated a little bit of the surface around it.   We did not hear any noise that would suggest an airplane, helicopter or blimp.  We eventually lost sight of this object, but I was left very shaken and the event has remained etched in my mind ever since.

As we exited the car and started walking to the house something caused me to look up. I then spotted the lights on a vehicle passing directly above us. These strobe lights were in a “V” configuration that began at the lead point and traveled down the leading edge of both wings simultaneously.  The object was quite large or quite low as it took up a large section of the sky above us but we were not able to accurately judge this due to the weather conditions that night that did not provide any stars behind it to outline the size and shape of it nor were there any ground lights to illuminate it.  As we watched, this object made a slow turn to the south towards Knoxville and moved out of sight. At no time did we hear any noise from this object or any other lights.  I have wondered about this for years now and have tried to debunk the experience as being a plane or a balloon but as yet can not. This object when spotted was traveling in an east to westerly direction and performed a slow 90 degree bank to the south.  It was moving at speed that would cause a commercial aircraft to stall and too large to be completely silent. We would have at least heard the air flowing across the wings and/or control surfaces. If it had been a balloon then we would have heard the engine as it moved southward. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The objects seemed to keep the same spacing between them, traveled in silence, and were not just merely floating. I would estimate their speed at 20-30 mph. The only description I can think of would be that they looked like red, Chinese globes that one might see in a Chinese restaurant or Chinese ornaments.

During the intermission I went to the restroom and when I came back my wife was in the bed of the truck looking at something in the sky. She asked me where the binoculars are and I got them for her. She was looking at a bright light in the south/western sky that started to emit red, yellow and bluish/green lights to a smaller light. It then appeared to turn and do the same to yet another smaller light across from the 1st one (the 3 of them together made what appeared to be a perfect triangle) it appeared to change shapes as it was turning. At one point it looked like a diamond and then went into a circle. After which, the 1st smaller light flashed back to the brighter light as did the 2nd smaller light. We watched this for about 30-45 minutes. We decided to drive out west to see if we could still see it. As we drove along I-80 west we could see the brighter light the whole time. About the time we got to the Grantsville area it began to fade in and out disappearing and reappearing in about 2 minute intervals. This happened 3-4 times we pulled off of exit 77 and drove south for about 3 miles and watched the same thing. After about 20 minutes I was looking at the North and saw 3 more lights doing the same thing again with the brightest one on top of 2 smaller ones on either side making a perfect triangle.

It was a bit past 7am in the morning PST on a clear blue morning sky morning (no clouds).  I looked out of my bedroom balcony toward the mountains.  I looked up into the sky and saw what appeared to be a ""white"" (colored) object.  It's shape is difficult to discern, but it was a solid mass, a compact object, with no wings (like an airplane), no propellers, just a mass moving at a very, very slow speed giving an appearance that it was hovering.  What immediately struck me as odd about this object was the rate of speed by which it moved.  I have never seen an object move that slow in the air, like at a snails pace. I observed the object for about 15 seconds, then turned way.  When I looked back, I could not find the object in the sky, it simply disappeared from the morning blue sky.  The best I can describe it's flying altitude is that it was significantly higher than what a helicopter typically flies, and lower than a high altitude plane (the ones that leave a cloud like trail).  So, it's shape is difficult to identify.  All i can say is that it was unidentified, it was flying (hovering), and it was an object.

They had blue and red pulsating lights. What caught my attention was when one of them moved and started to get closer. I saw these small UFO’s every night leading up to the morning of the 21st. I even had my son come outside and look.  On the morning of the 21st at 2::00 (am) I opened the front door of the house in Rochester Hills and I was stunned. There was an extremely bright star like object directly in line with my front door. It was distant at first but slowly moved closer and closer until I could make out its outline. I am 55 years old and I have never seen anything like it before. It was definitely nothing that I have seen in the sky or earth. The same satellite looking objects were also in the sky at the time holding stationary positions from left to right in the horizon. One was directly above the bright object.  When the bright object moved closer the wind blew the tree tops. I observed the bright object until 5:00 (a.m.). During that period of time it moved closer and then further away. It also moved from being dead center of my doorway to being to the right of the doorway. At 4:30 (am) the small satellites began moving slowly toward the big bright light and appeared to line up behind it. They then disappeared one by one inside of the bright light.

It seemed maybe 500 yards away and not far above the tree tops where the clearing ends.  We kept seeing a flash of light reflect from the ground and the trees every few seconds. It appeared that the craft was taking pictures of the ground.   My husband went and got my brother to come look at it also. He stayed for a few minutes and then left us, I guess he got spooked.  The craft was traveling very slow moving towards the south in a zig zag pattern.  My husband said it looked like a fish swimming in the water.

It almost appeared that something went to look at it and then turned off its lights.  The craft eventually got so far away that we could hardly see it anymore.

The sky was a brilliant blue, temp in mid 70's and the visibilty was unlimited. The sun was to our backs, my friend said they might be fighter aircraft but I said no way, too fast.  As soon as that object faded from view to the NE, another SPHERE came along in the general same track this one PULSED a few times along the flight path.  Again, it faded from view to the NE.  The color was a golden yellow and real sharp and defined, but small.  No estimate of altitude but it was up there. I joked, these must be UFO's any more? and sure enough, another came along this time to our  left but followed the same flight path.  No pulsing, just a steady, bright light.  Again, faded from view in NE distance and again, a fourth object, the last, came into view as same as third, but this one pulsed a few times as it zipped over head and on to the NE. The color of these objects were all consistant and the only reference of luminosity would be the yellowish hi-way lights they use to light the interstates, only more intense.  No contrails or erratic flight, just straight and true. It was really strange how brilliant these objects were and stood out against the daylight sky.

I said to my husband (who was driving) ""Look at that...what do you think that is?""  Neither he nor I could come up with an explanation of what it could be.  It was an interesting phenomena, because we both were expecting as we drove closer that whatever the object was (airplane, cloud, etc) would soon become apparent.  As we drove closer, the bright streaks of light dimmed considerably, eventually becoming just a greyish color, and we wondered if it could have been the setting sun which was illuminating these two streaks.  As we approached our exit, I could just make out a solid dark object above these streaks, and it was obviously much farther away than I had originally thought.  Due to the distance, I cannot describe the shape of the object, other than that it was wider side to side than it was top to bottom. It did not appear to be completely smooth, but to have some shape to it. The object and streaks did not move, rotate, etc. following the few seconds after which we originally saw them.

Fort Chaffee military flares or UFOs ? I was sitting on my fathers truck last night when I noticed a circular orange light flashing for approx 4 seconds and then dissapearing and reappearing in the sky.   I called for my sister and her friend to come look.  The light continued to do this for about 5 minutes, dissapearing and then reappearing.  I can't give an approx measurement or altitude, but the lights were rather bright compared to that of a normal star and the altitude seemed low for military aircraft.  Although I do not know much of military aircrafts and dropping flares at night, there was no sound or smoke. I live pretty close to Fort Chaffee, so I assummed that if they were flares, then we could of heard the planes or seen the smoke, but I didn't rule that possibility out.  After the lights faded, my sister and I sat outside and they finally appeared in the same area about 10 minutes later.  The lights began to do exactly what they did before, but this time there was only 1 of them.  It disseapered for only a few seconds and repeared much higher than it was before, and then suddenly about 5 or 6 appeared at once around that orange light.   These did not move and remained in one place for only 4 seconds. Then one by one, starting from the end, they dissappeared.  Because they appeared in a straight line, I began to think they might have been flares.  I am not totally convinced that what we saw was an alien aircraft, but we heard/saw no planes nearby.  The only reason why I am considering this may have been a ufo is because as far as I know, as long as gravity exists, flares do not hover in the sky instead of falling down as they disappeared. The disappearence seemed dramatic instead of random flares being dropped at once and disseapearing altogether and the same time. I don't know if anyone else saw this and I don't know what to think of it. My sister and her friend are convinced that aliens are here in Arkansas to invade...  and as convincing as these theories may be, I still remain a bit skeptical on ufo sightings.",2006-07-16T00:00:00,35.353695348837206,-94.38678217054263

The strangeness continued when the intense orange light disappeared from each and was replaced by three white circular lights in a triangle. They seemed to emit smoke but it was likely from super heating of the air around the lights in the cool night. The objects drifted out into the flats and landed about 1/4 mile away right in the backyard of a local ranch house in the desert lighting up the whole place. My girlfriend started running into the desert at the objects but we caught her and all walked to a better vantage point(a few weeks or months after our sighting T.Walton ran up on one too - bad idea).  We watched the objects on the ground and one of them kept going up and down, six - ten feet into the air.  Reminded me of the dance of the bees... The objects were smaller than the house, perhaps 20 feet in diameter.  The lights went dark after a time and we never saw them leave.  About a week or two later one of the witnesses and myself walked up around the hill where the objects were first seen and found a mutilated steer that had not been touched by coyotes or buzzards which were very numerous in the area.  At the time we had never heard of cattle mutilations and did not seriously connect the two events.

I assume it must have come from western side of the sky, though we spotted only from its mid point, that is from the pole star position.  Its movement towards the east was steady and it took a minute to move to the end of the horizon from the pole star position. It must have be around at a height of a high flying aircraft.

The clouds were low puffy white clouds, otherwise the sky was blue, it was early dusk so it was light but not direct sunlight. I couldn't say how high it was in the sky, but it was low enough to see in great detail that it was a disk, that it did have windows (portholes) and that it was not in any way shaped like known aircraft. It was lower than we ever saw planes in that area. The craft moved much slower than you would expect a plane to fly. We heard no noise from inside the house.

It was symmetrical in overall shape, but had all sorts of extraneous box- and cylander-shapes attached to it.

I observed this for about five minutes during which the lights came closer to me.  I ran inside and called for my mom & dad and my younger brother who was 16 at that time.  	For the next ten minutes we observed the lights as they came down to about tree top level.  They would float back and forth, moving perhaps 10 yards at a time.  Then they slowly moved from the back of out house to the front.  They paused over some trees at the corner of the yard and then slowly moved out over the town toward the north.  We watched them until they were out of sight.  There was no sound that we could hear and we could not make out any form or object, just the lights.  	We did not see the half moon lights after the floating lights left.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,39.1584,-80.3794

In 1982, my two daughters and I were on a return trip from California to Dallas. I never had the money to stop at a motel along the way, so I usually drove straight through. A normal trip with the occasional rest-stops would take me about 28-32 hours. (LA to Dallas, via El Paso). The time was approximately 2AM. We were in the desert in New Mexico, about two hours away from El Paso. The roads were clear, very little traffic except the occasional 18 wheeler. Running parallel with the highway is a rail-line. But, it is at least 5 miles in the distance. The girls were asleep in the back seat. I promised them if they rested, we would stop in El Paso at our favorite Denny’s and have breakfast. I had the window down, it was summer and the desert air was finally cool. I was very tired. My legs felt like lead, my hands were bruised from holding the steering wheel; and my eyes burned from lack of sleep. I heard a whirring noise that I thought must be a helicopter or a small aircraft. The only difference was the noise was more of a soft hum than that of a gas fueled engine. I glanced out the window and saw this object sort of hovering above my car, just a few feet above us. There was a row of lights along its cylindrical side. They were soft, blinking lights; twinkling more than blinking; nothing garish about them. When I stared up at the object, it took off at an angle that no other aircraft I had ever seen could have done. It went on its side about half-way over and then with a soft” whoosh”, it was gone. I shook my head and drove on and suddenly realized the aircraft was back, this time on the other side of the car. I leaned over and looked at it and it made the same noise and instantly was on my side of the car again. The aircraft followed my car, playing with me, dashing from one side of the car to the other; hovering in front of me, and following along behind, for about 20 miles. When they took off, I heard the soft whoosh and watched as they disappeared in the beautiful night sky. I felt such a sadness that they were gone. But, the strangest thing had happened. The girls were awake, and we were all completely refreshed as if we had been asleep for nine or ten hours. My legs were no longer tired, my eyes didn’t burn, and the girls were wide awake and jovial. We laughed the rest of the way to El Paso. While we were freshening up in the restroom at Denny’s, my youngest daughter said to me, “Mommy, those were angels driving that air car. They knew you were going to have an accident if they didn’t help you.” I asked her how she knew that and she just smiled and shrugged. After that, whenever I tried to talk about it, neither of the girls remembered the incident at all. I remember it as clearly as if it happened yesterday. I wish I could have thanked them.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,,

Suffice it to say I've seen alotta things but last night's experience was definately something new.  Last night (09/20/06) I was at the Pearl River Rest Area on Interstate 59 (Southbound) when I witnessed a strange occurrance. I was sitting in my car which was parked facing East. I had my door open for fresh air and was looking to my left (Northward) with a clear view of the sky. I noticed an airplane flying northward and I remember thinking it must've recently taken off from New Orleans Airport as I saw its lights flashing red and white as most do. I was looking at the sky not far above the treeline when I saw it, a BRIGHT white object comming from my left (West) and heading to my right (East) at a VERY high rate of speed.  The best way to descibe the object is, picture a block of round cheese (uncut) and lay it on its side. It was flat across the top and the bottom but curved on the sides. As I said it was EXTREMELY bright and pure white, there were no other colors. What was fascinating about the color was that the white seemed ""clear"" in that as bright as it was, it wasn't blinding at all. I could clearly define the shape of the object immediately. I watched it as it travelled at a VERY high rate of speed and just as suddenly as it appeared it vanished. The amazing thing about its disappearance is that it did exactly that. It didnt suddenly take off to outer space, or drop behind a treeline. Where the object disappeared there IS no treeline, it simply vanished like it flew behind a curtain. Also of note, the object was travelling parallel to the ground, neither gaining or losing altitude. I have no guess (and guessing is all it would be) as to the rate of speed it was travelling, all I can say is it covered miles in a matter of seconds. The size would be approximate to the 1/2 moon as it appears in the night sky, it was large.

When asked whether he had contacted Approach Control, to have them attempt to identify the object, he said that he had not.  The light suddenly just disappeared, as both witnesses were staring at it from their cockpit.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,44.86216021505377,-68.83885806451613

While on the balcony on the 10th floor of the Carnival Cruise ship ""Conquest"", I saw a group of blueish lights several hundred feet off the starboard side.  It was 4:00 AM and still completely dark, the lights appeared to be underwater.  I could see the electric lights of Grand Cayman in the distance, as we approached the island, and first thought that the blueish lights were a boat of some sort.   I focused my attention on the lights and noticed that they seemed to be moving as a group, but also moving individually within the group.   At first, the group of lights moved with the ship, same direction and speed.  Then the lights sped forward for a second, then again matched our speed.  They seemed to move closer to the ship and I could now clearly see that there were many individual lights, 8 or 10, moving in several different directions or circular patterns within the group.  After a few seconds they moved even closer, toward the front of the ship this time.  As the lights approached the front of the ship underwater, they seemed to arrange themselves in single file, before disappearing one by one beneath the hull.   At this point, I got dressed and went out onto the deck to see if I could see the lights on the other side of the ship.  Nothing.  I finally gave up after a few minutes and returned to my room.  I went out onto the balcony again and saw the lights once more.  This time, the lights were behind the ship and moving away...or we were moving away from them.

It was a cool, clear, pleasant evening so I stood outside in the back yard for a minute or two enjoying the breeze and looking at the stars. It was very dark outside, except for the normal lights associated with houses and streetlights. Living right next to an air force base, I also have the occasion to see and hear many planes everyday, and for a while that is exactly what I thought this object was. As I am standing there, I see what appears to be a white and bluish-to bluish-green light each one flashing alternately very close together way  in the distance up in the sky. At this point I could not see anything structural, it was at a very far distance at this point.  I do not know if this was the top, bottom, or side of the object which had the flashing lights. My first impression was that they were the lights you would normally associate with airplanes sometimes as they come in for a landing. Something about them seemed unusual to me; the weird blue color wasn’t what I was used to seeing, and the speed of the strobe was way off. The flashing lights were much faster and also much brighter than I have ever seen on any airplane.  I stood there watching it out of curiosity at that point, thinking that naturally if it is a plane, it’s heading for the Air Force base, and that meant it would have to generally head in a direction and path that was familiar to me from watching airplanes take off and land in the same place for years.  I thought this might afford me a better look at what kind of airplane it was. As it kept getting closer, I thought for sure that it was going to head toward the base, but instead of turning toward the base, it was proceeding directly toward my general location. When it got within my field of vision and I could make it out clearly,  I could only see the bottom of the object, and the outline of the overall shape, which was triangular, and the color of the triangle was a non-reflective black. It was so black that I could make it out against the contrast of the night sky. The white and bluish lights were not flashing or blinking at this time that I could see, but there were lights on the bottom of the object. A small, round, white light was in each corner of the triangular shaped object, with a larger red light in the center of it, which may have been concave. The white lights on the tips of the triangle remained constant, they did not flash or dim , however the red light in the middle seemed to glow or pulse very slowly.  At this point I still did not completely understand what I was looking at, because it was flying very low, lower than airplanes are allowed to fly, I know that.  And it was moving very slowly in a perfectly horizontal fashion. The smooth slow glide of the object put me in the mind of the idea of pushing something heavy on the ice and watching it slowly glide across in a level straight line.  That it what this object appeared to do .  It passed overhead maybe one or two houses east of my location, but nearly directly overhead. It had to be less than 300’ ft in the air, it was so close I felt like I could have hit it with a rock, had I thrown one at it.  As it glided over the houses, I opened the gate and quickly walked to the front yard to continue observing the object. It just continued in a level, straight line in a southeasterly direction, and I observed it until it was out of sight, about 30 seconds to a minute I would say total observation from the time I could first visually make it out until the time that it was out of  my field of vision. I kept thinking that something wasn’t right, and it wasn’t until it was almost out of sight that I realized that not only had it passed lower and slower than any airplane I had ever seen, but it also never made any noise at all. None. Not a single rumble, vibration or hum. Completely silent.   When it was out of sight, I went back into the house. I thought I might hear something about other people sighting the same thing, but nothing was ever mentioned by anyone or any news organization as far as I know. I am an ordained minister, and stay at home dad. I don’t want any trouble or publicity, I just wanted to tell the truth about what I saw.

It was observed and reported to me by my brother and his wife. I am 57, male, my brother is 55.  I am college educated at the master’s level. My brother works in technical design. 	I believe this sighting occurred on 10-28 or 10-29-2006 near 10 PM. in a suburb of Pittsburgh about ten miles from the center of town. A few weeks prior to this night my brother and wife went to a small observatory to view a comet. A couple of weeks later the comet had become bright enough to view with binoculars and on the evening  mentioned they were in their yard with binoculars, 7x35 and 10x50. The sky was dark and crystal clear without any cloud cover . 	As they were both looking through binoculars trying to locate the comet at a position bout 45 degrees above the horizon, my brother suddenly sighted something for which he has no explanation. He told me that he immediately realized that he would probably only have a brief  time to view what he was seeing and became intense in an effort to observe and remember details. This is where his report gets kind of weird. 	The main characteristic of  the object was, well, he said the best way he could describe it was,""“It looked like the Romulan vessel (from the TV series Star Trek) when it would become cloaked (turning invisible).""  He observed it for about seven to ten seconds.  During that time it was moving and changed direction twice.  The motion did not appear to be fast (unless this was much farther away than he realizes in which case the object would also be extremely large).  The first change in direction was about ninety degrees to the original motion and then ninety degrees back to the original path and then he lost sight of it. During this movement it moved toward him and overhead. 	When I asked him about it’s altitude, he was uncertain since there were no clouds,only stars, but said if he had to guess it was probably cloud level or lower. Later he calculated size and distance by measuring the field of  view in his binoculars at a known distance on land. The image he saw that night filled the entire view of his binoculars. He concluded if it was 200 - 300 feet it must have been about two to three thousand feet high or about one half mile. Closer and it would have been smaller. He heard no noise. Fartheraway and it would have to be larger. 	At this point, he asked his wife if she had just seen anything. Her response after a moment of hesitation was, ""Well, it was kind of invisible.""  He told her not to say another word, not wanting to bias his memory of the observation.  He asked her to come into  the house.  He got two pieces of paper and they went into separate rooms to draw what they saw. 	He showed me the drawings.  They were simple outlines.  Remember that it was invisible. Also remember that they were both looking through binoculars and the object filled the entire field of view in his 10x50.  One thing that I noticed between their drawings was that the overall proportion of width to length were quite the same.  The overall shape and proportion resembled a crescent moon but not as curved, more elongated.  And rounded, not pointed at the tips.  The leading edge was curved and smooth, however, the back edge was less curved and both curves bowed forward in the direction of motion. 	Additional detail noticed by my brother (looking through more powerful binoculars) but not his wife is as follows:  The back edge was serrated like a steak knife with seven points.  Along the entire front edge were what appeared to him as markings.  Each was a mirror image of the next and he described them as ornate curls as on a wrought iron railing or perhaps a curled animal’s horn.  This whole image appeared as translucent or transparent except for the details mentioned. 	My brother could not come up with any possible explanation for what they saw. He definitely ruled out clouds, vapor trails, etc.  It was moving, changed direction and maintained the definite shape as described.  He was glad his wife was with him in that their mutual observation verified the reality of the sighting.  Otherwise, he feels that he would question and have a hard time believing that he really saw this (?). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was headed to feed my horse (which is approximately a 20 minute drive).  It was a nice drive, the skies were clear with possibly a few higher clouds in the sky, but you could still see the stars.  I can’t recall if it was a full moon or not, but I know the moon was bright. The barn is in the back of a subdivision, at the end of a dirt road about a mile off the main road of the subdivision, backing up against a pipeline. The road is barely wide enough for 2 cars to pass one another in certain places. We had received a lot of rain in the past 2 weeks, so the road was well worn with large holes from the rain, as well as from the 18 wheelers that traveled the road headed for the M.U.D. maintenance facility near the barn.  Traveling the road in its condition, along with the deer that cross the road at all hours, at a pace of 10 miles per hour was the fastest, safest speed you could travel on this night. About halfway down the road (headed toward the barn), I started getting a strange feeling I was being watched. (I have had these feelings before, but just played it off in the past as though it was the horses or deer watching me.) Being how is was dark, I was alone (with my 6 year old son), and the barn is in an isolated area, I hurried to get the horse fed. It couldn’t have taken more than 10 minutes to fill his water bucket and give him his grain and hay. I locked the gate and headed back down the road towards the main street. As soon as I came around a curve, I noticed 2 red dots about 5 ½ or 6 feet from the ground in the trees. My first though was it was an opossom sitting on a limb of a tree. I kept my eye on them because I couldn’t fiqure out why its eyes were so red. They were bright, bright red and had a glow to them. As I got closer I realized they were teardrop shaped and way too big to be an oppossom. The closer I got, I could see a silhouette of a being. Thinking it was a person standing there, I tried to see if I could recognize the person wondering why he was in the area so late. The body was very skinny, very dark grey or black in color with a very small pot-belly. It wore no clothing. Its hands didn’t seem to have any fingers, although it had a thumb-like appendage. The harder I stared at its face trying to make out any facial features, the less I could see. The face, although I could see the body perfectly, was very cloudy and continued to blur the harder I tried to see anything. The only movement I observed was the movement of the face/head as I passed it. It made no sound. As I rounded the next corner I stopped my car and put it in reverse, intending on backing up to take another look at what I had seen. I looked at the display clock on my dash and it read 12:30 am. It should have been reading no later than 10:35 or 10:40 pm. I put my car back in drive and left. The next day I was joking with my 14 year old son about what I had seen, never really thinking twice about it. Later that evening when I went to feed my horse he wouldn’t have anything to do with me. He went to the very back of his stall and would not come near me even when I put out his feed. For the next 2 months he acted in the same manner towards me. It wasn’t until the end of April 07 when my insomnia started coming back that I realized I had not had any problems going to bed and staying asleep. I had in fact been getting 9 hours of undisturbed sleep every night for the past 4-4 ½ months. I have no photos, although, I could draw a picture of what I seen that night.",2007-06-12T00:00:00,29.9234,-95.05779999999999

One sphere was stationary, one was moving in a steady circle, and the third was moving diagonally across the sky. The woman stated that she had been watching them as she walked up the street for a couple of blocks. She said she had seen 20 or more at once and they were disappearing up into the sky.

The flying object was of dark color, most likely dark gray or black. Its shape was unknown to me and my mother. It was traveling northwest, originally coming from over the Atlantic Ocean. No lights whatsoever were visible on the object. It basically resembled a huge flat fish (ray); it had large and flat wings (one on each side) with very round and basic edges. As intriguing this object was, it still very much looked like an aircraft with two side wings, a distinctive front end and a back end including a wing. Certainly this object was large, but not incredibly massive – probably a bit larger than a commercial, transatlantic plane. The wings were distinctive from the body which looked like a cylinder. Also the wings were attached about halfway on the body. The strangest part was the motion of this object. It moved upward by rotating on itself at a fairly slow and steady speed (about 5 sec. to rotate on itself). The object never appeared to fly downward and moved up at a slow rate (similar to a small commercial plane) - I and my mother were able to see it for many minutes from the front and back of our house. A fairly quite noise was possibly heard early when we first witnessed the object at low altitude and a certain aura/haze was present at times. Finally, a large cluster of clouds made the object disappear from our vision, but it disappeared steadily and not abruptly. Note that a commercial plane was flying in the opposite direction (Southeast) during the last minute of the sight at a very similar altitude. It could not have been further than 3 miles from it.

It didn't move incredibly slowly, but it wasn't going super-fast, either. I would guess that from horizon to horizon it could've spanned the sky within 3-4 minutes, maybe 5. I could tell that the object/light was very high in altitude and had no flashing lights (as a plane or helicopter would) or have a trail (as a meteor would) but slowly moved across the sky in a straight line. It made no sound I could hear, though I live in the city and street noise might possibly drown out any sound it could have made. My girlfriend was with me, and we stood outside and watched the object until it was out of sight, for approximately 2-3 minutes. The object moved from slightly SW to the NE -- as I watched it, I was facing south, and my job is east of where I live so I was able to try to triangulate a little bit of its direction. When we got into the car and headed east to my job, the object had already left our visibility, and looking for it in the sky over the +/-2 miles to work neither me nor my girlfriend were able to spot it again. I did not, like some other reports of this particular sighting on this date, see said object fly off at a high rate of speed. However, if it did so that would explain why I couldn't see it while driving to work. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Internation Space Station confirmed.

I don’t know if the whole thing was a dream or if it was real but I can assure you that they communicated to me mentally and not verbally, as we do.  My first encounter with the aliens took placed several years ago.  They took me to their galaxy that had 5 suns and several planets, which I was able to see from their spaceship.  Since our galaxy only has one sun, I was astonished to see so many suns in just one galaxy.  I don’t recall ever getting out of the spaceship; the whole trip was just like a “tour” through the universe.  They were green aliens, very short, not with the usual configuration depicted in Roswell, NM.  Their heads were wide, mostly by the cheeks area and they were very nice to me.  My most recent encounter was with just one alien.  This one had pink skin and came-up in a small gray color spaceship.  His head had a light bulb shape and he was skinny.  He told me via mind communication that it was time for me to go with them for good.  Some sort of force started taking me towards his spaceship (I started floating in the air) but then, suddenly, I decided I did not want to go yet, and saw myself back into my home.  The next day, May 7, 2008, I received a call from one of my doctor’s office, in which I was told they found pre-cancerous cells in a yearly routine exam I recently had.  Every year this exam comes-out normal and, all the sudden, right after the encounter I had with the alien, it happened to come-up abnormal.  Now I am going to have to get a biopsy done on June 2nd to check on the stage level of the cancer findings.",2008-06-12T00:00:00,32.88038143913921,-96.96644082044385

This thing was a perfect disc shape. It was a saucer, it had very bright blue lights that outlined the sides, it varied in speed from practically hovering to way too fast for any helicopter to ever catch up, and it even flew on it's side and while changing it's angles. And it was either really big, or really really close. And it just stayed flying around in the same general area for a long time, five or ten minutes. I know helicopters don't do that and if they did, they would have a searchlight looking for something. This thing looked like it was just having fun flying around as if it was joyriding. And if it were a helicopter it would make that continuous droning helicopter sound. I think this thing was actually really close because I did hear it make some noise every now and then, depending on if it was flying towards me or away or if it was flying flat or on its side. And it definitely did not sound like a helicopter. It made this sort of high pitched buzzing sound. Sort of like those toy planes, but a little different. When I first saw it, I was actually walking back to my dorm hall on the UC Irvine campus. Judging by the area where it stayed flying for the ten minutes or so that I saw it, I know I couldn’t have been the only one to have seen it. It was only around 10 o’clock at night and I would guess that it was flying somewhere in the direction of the 405 Freeway or the Irvine Spectrum Mall; somewhere anyone could get a good, unobstructed view of it. But I went up to my room, and the window of my room faces the same area where it had been flying when I had initially seen it outside, and it was still flying around for another few minutes.

At first glimpse I noticed two flourescent orange orbs of light equally distanced from each other which appeared to be hovering.  I grabbed a pair of Binoculars and hoisted my hands on window bars to steady the shaking of my hands.   Now a clear shot I watched as both orbs seemed to be in conjunction with the other, perfect match of each others size... As one orb would appear to get brighter the other would dim then two smaller lights shot from the left orb.  After about ten minutes or so watching these objects I witnessed a smaller row of orange orb-like lights seem to have turned on, above the two bigger orbs, this was all one object I'm sure. These smaller lights seemed to ""twinkle"" as they spun in a sort of carousel motion.

There is nothing but BLM land and forest there.

The time was between 17:30 and 17:40 hours. I had gotten off work at 17:00 and was headed to a family gym close to my home in Fair Oaks, CA. It was getting dark quickly and I could barely see the sun disappearing on the horizon in the west. I was traveling west on Fair Oaks Blvd which is the main street where my gym is located. I could see in the distance that there were unusual bright lights in the sky just a little to the left of my view. The lights appeared to be anywhere between 1500-2000 feet in the sky. The most notable features were that the lights were really bright and the object was motionless. Now I was thinking to myself, this could be helicopter hovering with its search light, but then I realized there was no cone affect or motion of a search light. I’ve seen those enough to not be fooled. This wasn’t a star because this really bright light was too close for observation, but too far to actually see a true form of the object. It wasn’t the moon because the moon is usually in the east and the really bright lights were too small to mistake for the moon. As I approached my gym I thought to myself to park as soon as possible and jump out and get a look at this sighting and to see if anyone else had seen it. At about 200 yards from the parking lot I took my last look at these really bright lights. The lights in the sky are still motionless and still not sure of the form of the object. I pulled into the parking lot and parked. I jumped out of my vehicle and looked up in the sky to see nothing. I looked west, south, east, and north. These lights were high enough that if they had moved in anyone direction I would be able to see for at least a half mile in any direction, but there was nothing, like there was never anything ever there at all. What could move that fast in 15-20 seconds? I’m very puzzled. I didn’t check any news reports or police reports because I’m still not sure. It’s bizarre because I’ve seen planes and helicopters move in the night sky.

I looked up in the sky and saw what I first took to be a comet, but I did not think there were any comets around.  I then decided that it was just a star and distortion from my glasses lenses was causing me to see a tail. Normally if an object is distorted by my lenses I can look dead on at an object and the distortion will clear. In this case however, no matter what direction I looked at the object, the tail remained. I was in a hurry and just decided that because this thing definitely had a tail I guess that I had missed the fact on the news that there was comet visible in the night sky. I then justified this decision by thinking that I remembered hearing on the radio about a comet.  The object looked to me very similar Hale Bopp. I did not study it for more than a few minutes, knew it was out of place, then justified why and went about my business. It had enough impact on me to look for it again, when I went to unplug my Christmas lights, but I could not locate it. I didn’t think much of it until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast To Coast.

What I saw in the sky won't take long to describe....it was what looked like an open rectangle in the sky maybe a mile high. I was looking to the west and determined it was just a little north of Seattle. I had just taken an exit off of I405 and on the overpass bridge heading west I saw it. Plain as seeing a blimp. It was all but imipossible to determine the size of it but it was easy to tell that it was big enough for something to fly through it. My view of this thing didn't last long because the traffic was heavy and I couldn't stop. It was so obvious I thought I would have heard about it on the news that day but there was nothing about it.

Now as a former resident of this town, and someone to have knowelge in geography, the Rockie Mountains are to the East of Craig, and not to the west. Now the writer may have meant hey noticed the lights to the West of the Rockie Mountains, and not to the West of Craig, but I don't know for I wasn't there. I do know when I lived out there I whitnessed UFO's, it was a green streaking glowing light travlening from the North to the south, so I'm not trying to say the individual didn't say anything, but may his directions were wrong. If I wouldn't have seen something with my own eyes there I would say he is crazy, so I hope with this either he re-thinks where he say the lights, or if he saw anything at all. I'm sure visitors do go there, but I believe our friend may have his directions crossed or he saw nothing at all.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted))",2006-12-07T00:00:00,40.6762,-107.8126

Overflight of three white luminescent delta shaped craft in a triangular formation.,Amarillo,TX,2006-09-22T00:40:00,triangle,60 - 90 seconds,"Occurred : 9/22/2006 00:40  (Entered as : 09/22/06 0:40) Reported: 10/31/2006 2:06:51 PM 14:06 Posted: 12/7/2006 Location: Amarillo, TX Shape: Triangle Duration:60 - 90 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/053/S53185.html,"Overflight of three white luminescent delta shaped craft in a triangular formation. The city of Amarillo sits at about 3700' above sea level and if you are in an area where street lighting or other ambient lighting is somewhat blocked, the sky can be fairly dark for a metropolitan area. Such was the location of my sighting; an east-west driveway that is bounded by a seven foot wood gate on the east, my house (roof height of 25' to 40' at its peak) along the south side, my neighbors 6' fence, house and 50' tree on the north side boundary, and the west side bounded by a stand of 30 -45' trees. My house sits in the east to west take-off flight path of our airport which is approx. 10 miles due east. Those planes are normally transiting a bit north of, yet parallel with this driveway. As an avid aviation buff since I was very young (my grandfather had a horse farm right across the highway from the now closed Amarillo Air Base which was a SAC installation), I am always checking the sky. On this particular night at 12:35 AM, I had taken my dogs out one last time for the night and I was standing in the driveway area that is darker than any other area around the north or west side of my house, perusing the sky. For whatever reason, I was looking straight to the east when I noticed three pinpoints of light emerging from the tree line of my neighbors house across the street (this would have been at an angle of about 20 degrees). These three points of light increased in size to the point where I could see that they were each delta shaped and were in a tight triangular formation as well. I was stunned that they were perfectly aligned with my driveway! At about 75 degrees I could see that the back edge of each delta shaped light was blurred. When these objects were directly overhead I would say that they were each about 1 1/2 width of a quarter. The formation remained tight until about 120 degrees (the objects were close to entering the west tree line boundary which would obscure my clear view) when the lights suddenly performed a ""shuffling"" move and regrouped into the same triangular formation. During the entire episode, I would say that each light's luminosity remained constant, only the relative size of the object/light increased and diminished as would be expected. Absolutely no noise whatsoever. One final kicker - as I was trying to figure the speed/altitude of the overflight and looking straight up from the same position - I saw a meteor streak from southeast to northwest and flame out right over my head! (obviou sly at a very high altitude because the streak was the length of my forearm and unobstructed by the roof line). Because of the manner in which the lights first appeared I was thinking that they could be at a fairly low altitude (5000 - 10,000'?), but at the overhead apex I just could not get a ""read"". But I do estimate their speed to be at least 3-5 times faster than an aircraft if they were both at a relative cruising altitude. But I do have to emphasize the point that while this sighting was very exciting, the orientation of their east to west flight path right down the center axis of my driveway was astonishing!",2006-12-07T00:00:00,35.1857520123839,-101.86299179566564

I still couldn't get too close with that lens so I added an extender to the lens making it 400mm.

They reappeared a second time about 15 minutes later in the exact same place.  We walked over the dunes to the beach and saw other strange clusters of lights in different locations throughout the sky that were much smaller or distant. The other lights would pulse sometimes in diagonal patterns or seemingly random clusters.  Some seemed to move or dart around while others seemed stationary. A military jet flew over the area then returned to wherever it came from. The orange lights reappeared a third time after 30 to 40 minutes with a very dramatic simultaneous pulse in two very distinct ""cigar"" shapes comprised of about 6 to 8 lights each.  A seemingly dramatic decrease in the temperature of the onshore breeze (could have been nervous chills) also occurred at roughly the same time.  Just after this final pulse, the activity of the other ""satellite"" lights increased significantly and then pretty much stopped after about ten minutes.  There were a number of people watching on the beach with us, one person actually made a video recording of the event.  He told us that they had witnessed these lights for three nights in a row occurring roughly ten o'clock at night.  They were definitely not running lights on aircraft, weather balloons, flares, optical illusions, fireworks, or anything else that we could think of that could have created these lights.  I personally found the their appearance to be like the phosphorescence of a firefly or jellyfish, and not like the light from a bulb or something burning.

We observed these lights June 24, 26, 27 and 28, 2007, between the hours of 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. (the one night exception we were not outside at night).  The lights didn't appear in precisely the same spot, but were always about the same height (roughly 30-40 degrees above the horizon). They were red (more so earlier in the week) to a reddish-orange (more so later in the week). I would estimate the size to be larger and brighter than Mars; they were large enough that they had appeared to have a round shape to them, but weren't orbs, per se.  The lights appeared in different numbers; there was always at least two, and at least once there was five. The lights would come into view, sometimes one at a time, sometimes almost simultaneously, and move on a horizontal plane (maybe with a very slight downward arc) either in the same direction or in opposite directions before fading out nearly simultaneously after 5-10 seconds. Generally, the lights would appear one at a time or almost in pairs, and move apart from the center, although it wasn't always symmetrical, and they didn't always disappear at the same instant.  The lights appeared often in the same general location, but they would also appear at different spots. Once, the lights appeared in their “usual location,” then reappeared no more than two minutes later quite a distance away (20-30 degrees). We saw the lights more than once each night, probably as many as 5-6 times.  The particular nights we saw these lights, the moon was working its way toward full and there were few clouds, so the sky was quite bright, making it more interesting that these lights showed up so brightly. It was impossible to judge their distance, but it felt like they were distant; the fact that the moon was bright would mean these lights would have to be fairly bright to get through the light pollution.  Seeing as how were at the ocean and in a hotel with dozens of humming air conditioners, there was no sound connected to the sightings.  Our hotel was beachfront, located on Ocean Boulevard more or less across from 27th Avenue South. We also saw the lights as we walked along the beach, and once heard someone near us say something to the effect of “Look at the airplane!”  As for possible explanations of the lights, they were certainly not airplanes. The airport was near our hotel, and we observed a number of planes taking off. But the lights appeared and disappeared randomly, and moved in different directions. We thought they could be signal flares, and since I'm not a nautical type, I'm not sure how such a thing works. However, I would expect signal flares to move up, not slowly horizontally, and not in different directions. Also, I don't know far away you could see signal flares. The color and intensity of the lights would remind you of fireworks viewed at fairly close range, but they didn't wink out quite like fireworks, instead seeming to fade from view. Additionally, they didn't “twinkle” the way a star does; instead, they were steady while they lasted.  As for other incidental notes, there were a number of military fighter jets taking off from the nearby airport each day, but these always took off during the daytime and usually turned inland, so I don't think they were addressing the lights in any way.  As for background, I am an editor/graphics person and my wife a high school teacher. I've never claimed to have seen a UFO, but I was indeed a big fan of the X-Files, so you can make of that what you want.",2007-08-07T00:00:00,33.68315,-78.93953909574468

I am a graphic designer, age 30. The other witness is my girlfriend, a paralegal, age 23. We were driving to our 7:30 dinner reservation, which we were late for, and as I was going along my street I saw a bright star off to my left. I'm always looking out for ufos so I made some comment about this star to my girlfriend, and she replied to stop looking at it and look where I was driving.  At the next intersection I turned left, and now the object was in the sky in front of us (and slightly left of the road). The light had grown and now it was no longer a star, but many blinking lights. Its altitude in the sky was much lower than a plane, maybe between 500 and 1000 feet up. My first thought was ""Damn that thing has lots of lights"" but I actually wrote it off as a plane because my eyesight is poor and I couldn't see any detail. Then a few seconds later my girlfriend (whose eyesight is better than mine) said ""What IS that thing?"" I looked over at it again and I asked her to tell me what she was seeing. She could actually see the solid object and said it was grey and egg shaped, and covered with blinking lights. It was flying about as fast as a plane or a helicopter, but erratically. I could see the blinking lights, which were multicolored (there were at least a dozen lights to my reckoning), but my eyesight was not good enough to discern the shape.  By this time it had flown further to our left. I said ""screw the reservation!"" and I took the next left to follow it. The trees obscured our view temporarily but I drove in the direction that it was in the sky. As soon as we got to a clearer view, the object was nowhere to be seen.

Me and my best friend Steve were sitting in his car waiting to go on a school-organized trip to Quebec. The bus left at 5:00 am so Steve and I decided to stay up and wait to drive to the bus and sleep the whole drive up. We decided to wait on a new road that connected two different subdivisions (Voyager Run and Kingswood). The road was off of a lake and had no streetlights because it was just built. We parked the car near the only source of light, which I believe was a little watershed or hut with one light bulb at the top.  While sitting in the car my friend pointed out a bright white light in what we assumed was a far distance in comparison the trees on the lake. At first my friend thought it was a planet because of the random blinking of the light. After looking at this light for 5 minutes the passenger window become streaky and slightly fogged. After the streaks were formed we both realized this light was moving by keeping our heads completely still and by comparing the close streaks on the window to the light in the distance.  Once we made this realization after about 10 minutes of the movement of the light we noticed a drastic increase in the speed it was moving and could notice that it wasn’t moving sideways anymore but towards us and was getting bigger. After watching this light move closer for 2 minutes, 3 more lights other than the original white flashing light were becoming visible. The other lights were, a very light blue on the left side, a bright red on the opposite side, and an even brighter white/yellow light on the top which would make it a triangle if it weren’t for the other original flashing white light which was flashing slower and in different places making the shape unrecognizable.  At this point the shape was still to far to recognize a flying pattern which was the last thing leaving my friend and I to believe it still might be an airplane or something explainable.  After only another minute or so trying to interpret what this was the distance this thing seemed to travel in a short period of time seemed unbelievable. Once the object seemed to be close enough to be able to hear an engine I rolled my window down. As soon as my window went down I can’t explain the feeling I got instantly; it was a feeling of panic. My friend panicked as well because the object was hovering with a very slight humming sound over the lake infront of us. As the object was getting close it moved in a very slight up and down movement but continued to move in a forward direction. The object wasn’t very high in the sky, maybe about a 10-story building. The way it moved made it hard to tell a shape. I only got about a 5 - 10 second detailed look at it. I am positive that I saw a curve to the shape on one side. The curve seemed to progressively light up with three different colors one at a time then fade them backwards in the same manor. It was identical to the way the equalizers show the bass hits in a song but only horizontal and on one side of the object. The colors that lit up along the side were red, green, and yellow.  My friend instantly started the car in fear when the object was flying in a direction that would pass behind the car. As my friend started the car and put the car in gear the object had just passed behind the car and it instantly changed directions towards the car. The feeling of fear and curiosity that this thing had spotted us was a feeling I could not describe. My heart was beating incredibly fast; I have never felt anything like this. At first the feeling was fear and the feeling of a much greater power or energy in the sky that was capable of anything.  As my friend and I drove out towards the other end of the road that connected the two subdivisions the object would appear out my window one second and then my friends window as we went around every slight turn. Eventually when we reached the main road the object was no longer in sight anywhere.  I know what I saw was something of the unexplainable because of the feeling I got. I described the whole 20-minute encounter as best as I could with as much detail. If anyone has a similar story around the same area or different PLEASEEE let me know. I will never forget this experience that I witnessed just the other week. I am only 18, but my friend and I know that whatever we saw was not explainable. I decided to keep the story to myself the whole time in Quebec because when I tell it its impossible to share the feeling of the experience.

While walking the sky was full of aircraft flying in every direction of the compass, there lights blinking and I was looking for lights that weren’t blinking but remained steady. I was looking for satellites. After about 20 minutes of walking (we left at 8 PM) walking in a westerly direction I spotted a triangular shaped object in the South and it traveled in a Northerly direction. The sky was perfectly clear but the object looked as though it was in a haze or even blurred like the atmosphere does to star’s. It was traveling with purpose and flew straight and true with no deviations. It was almost as if it was not afraid to be seen, or it thought it could not be seen! Anyway all to soon it was gone.

I walked to the rear of my yard to get an unobstructed view as there were 4 large pines in the way. I stood at the fence lining the yard and just stared at it.  It was so bright that when I closed my eyes there was a sun-spot in my vision(like when you stare at the sun). It was rather difficult to focus on for too long and I started to think this may not be a star or planet.  I went into the house and asked my wife to come and look at it. She agreed that it was weird and that it was extremely bright and both of us had a hard time telling if it was moving.  I went inside to my computer and searched for any planets which may be in view that night and the only thing that I found was Mercury (I think) but that was only going to be visible by telescope and only in the SouthWest and Mexico. I went back outside and it was still there but seemed to have moved away towards the NW. I marked it in the sky using some ground landmarks. After standing and watching for about 10 minutes more I decided to go in. I checked a couple more times and it seemed to move farther and farther away each time but clearly still very brilliant.

The bell or parabollic form was a hazy white which seemed to rotate about itself slowly. It seemed to have stripes running from the arch to the base around it.  It rotated its nearly continually, so as to appear as though it was floating about itself. It was of intense brightness without magnification. It seemed 5-10 degrees elevated from the horizon.  It eventually took off to the west and suddently disappeared.  I viewed it a number of diffent ways.  At less magnification it looked like a parabola which was bright and squiggling. From this perspective it was multicolored including a bright blue white, with varous colors inlcuding red continually fluctuating.  As it rotated it also gave the appearance of a cylinder with the globe portion at the end. and with stripes of brighter light running the length of its body which seemed to rotate about it.  The object always appeared translucent or nearly so. although not truly a triangle, it appeared to have an elonated parabollic triange.  It behaves as though it is conducting a survey.  It is out at night regularly.  It was of such intensity that I have eye pain from watching it. I made some drawings of it.

I first I thought it was an illuminated bird as it moved across the sky but as it moved very quickly (approximately 10 times the speed of a jet airliner at cruising altitude)from a south-south west, to west position it became obvious that it was it was not being illuminated from the ground because it never waivered in brightness and appeared to be at a high altitude.  The light was not brilliant more of solid off white illumination.  The light did not blink nor did I see it change color (I am red-green color blind and therefore might not of noticed subtle color changes).  Once it was approaching a due west position I called my wife out to see.  She saw it to and first thought it was a plane but I pointed out the velocity and she agreed that it was moving very fast and could not make out what it could be.  It appeared to very slightly lower in altitude as it moved.  We tracked it from the back yard until my sight line was blocked by my neighbors house.  I then walked quickly to the front yard and saw it in the northwest sky for about 5 more seconds before it again moved out of my sight line by the roofs of houses across the street.  At the point that my sight line was blocked it was only about 15 degrees above the horizon.  I then walked back into my house and back into the back yard.  I then noticed a plane in the southwest sky that was approaching from the south west then changed direction moving north along a very similar path that was taken by the object.  The lights on this plane were a yellowish color and it had a blinking light.  It was moving much slower than the object that had just passed.",2006-05-15T00:00:00,33.54170373692077,-101.90381898355756

It was very very dark, little traffic and the sky was clear with lots of stars. My friend and I decided, out of boredom to watch the sky for shooting stars (meteorites).  We saw an occasional plane or airliner with their blinking lights traveling across the sky.  At one point I was watching one of these ""planes"" (no blinking lights) when all of a sudden it took off like a shooting star . So that got my attention.  But it never went out of sight.  Instead it stopped  ""shooting"" and continued at a regular speed like a plane.  At this point, I called everyone’s attention to it.  Then it shot across the sky again then stopped  and did it again. It was moving in irregular patterns one way then another. We were all just amazed and could not take our eyes off of it, just watching it zig zag around at different speeds.  It seemed like it went on for such a long time. My dad was having a hard time keeping his eyes on the road and on the object too but he didn’t stop, he just slowed down. We were all trying to guess what the heck it could be because we knew it was not a shooting star or a plane. We do have a lot of military Air Force bases down in the Keys but I don’t even think the stealth bomber was in existence or even being tested at that time. I don’t think there was any aircraft at that time that was capable of this kind of movement. We continued to watch it as its movements seemed to take up the whole sky, when suddenly it stopped and just slowly faded out. It looked as if it went straight out into space at a very very high rate of speed until it was just gone from sight. We still talk about it to this day.

I am unsure of the exact date as I was young, but I do clearly remember things from less than one year of age, so I am fairly confident when I say that this sighting occured in the late seventies, probably 1978 or 1979.   I was staying at my grandfather's farm, where I now reside, and playing outside in the late afternoon probably July or August when my step-aunt drove home for the evening from Fargo.  She was excited about something she'd been watching on the drive out and had my grandfather, her mother, herself and I get into my grandfather's car and drive toward the object she'd been watching.  The object had been hovering over the WDAY tower directly east of the town of Amenia, ND since she had spied it on her drive home or longer.  We drove southwest toward it from the farm and then straight west toward it on the Amenia Township road.   I recall that the object was the same vibrant orange color as the low summer sun, as if it were reflecting or glowing that color.  As the four of us drove closer I noticed other vehicles driving toward the sight also.  We must have been a mile or so from the WDAY tower when it suddenly began to move off in a zig-zag pattern and then shot off to the southeast at a higher altitude and incredible speed and immediately disappeared from sight. I can't imagine now why we didn't speak to any of the other people that came to look at this UFO but I would love to find anyone else that saw this spectactle. Years later,(1986??) my grandfather came over to my parent's house one morning as he often did when I still lived there and had another odd story to tell.  He and his wife had decided to sleep in a different room upstairs that they hoped would be a little cooler.  It is the only room upstairs that has west facing windows.  During the night they were awoke to find all the lights on in the house, however when they tried the switches they found they were already off- the light was coming from an outside source.  Grandpa got the shotgun, although he said later he didn't know what he would have shot.  I can't remember how long he said that incident lasted but he had no explanation for it.  It  came and went. Recently, in November of 2006 I was out late at night looking for my Siamese  and checking her usual spots.  One of her favorites is by the far north shelterbelt of the yard, behind some of the outbuildings. I circled around the quonset on this night as I often do when trying to find her, and as I started to return toward the house, I ""felt"" a large flying object glide over the quonset and cross the yard.  The sound was similar to an airplane gliding, power off.  I even ducked.  I could sense it go over me, but there was nothing I could visibly see.  I am familiar with hawks and owls in my yard and this was nothing like that.  I fly airplanes and this is where I come up with the similarity to an airplane gliding, but there was definitely a feeling of this thing going over, as if the air pressure had changed between me and the object.  I often watch airplanes flying over and I know how you can see them long before you hear them at night or even see their flashing strobes or wing tip lights.  This was entirely different.  It was at the altitude of the trees surrounding the yard and stealthy and invisible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2008-02-14T00:00:00,,

I was married to another engineering student at University of Idaho and I had just graduated with degrees in Chemical Engineeering and Chemistry and her in Mining Engineering. I was interested in UFOs and felt most were explainable and I was uncertain about the rest.   We were renting a house from my parents which is on the north side of Coeur d' Alene Lake, four miles east of Coeur d' Alene, Idaho.  We had just eaten dinner and walked out onto the front deck which overlooked the lake.  It was after sunset and still light outside.   We were looking out over the lake when a greenish-white glow appeared under the surface of the water.  An object raised vertically out of the water, water running off, it was oval and difficult to make out the exact outline of the object due to the light it gave off and was about the size of a semi-trailer which is only a rough guess.   The object rose vertically for an estimated several hundred yards to where it was above our horizontal line of site and southwest of us.  The object stopped for a second or two and the next thing we saw was a straight white tapering line of white light going from the last point we saw the object going horizontally out over the northwest horizon as a thread thin white line. It appeared that whatever it was accelerated instantly to a speed that made it appear like a straight white bolt of lightning, only that it tapered to invisibly thin over the horizon.   I personally never talked to anyone about this until three years after the event occurred because I was so shocked by how unreal it was and that my mind had no reference for such an event such as objects raising from a lake vertically and then zipping off horizontally like a lightning bolt.  We heard no sound whatsoever from whatever this was.  I have never even heard of reports like mine from anyone, so it has now been an unsolved puzzle in my mind for over thirty years that has only served to make me wonder what on earth is going on and only fueled my quest for knowledge on the subject of UFOs which, as a scientist/engineer, I take very very seriously and would love to see the human race as a whole get to the bottom of this and with full open cooperation of universities and governments, which unfortunately has not happened and is a disgrace.",2008-02-14T00:00:00,47.700352531645564,-116.78960632911392

This particular light looked very normal in the night sky until it changed course towards me. It was very large and at the same altitude as the passing commercial jets. It had colored lights surging in a circular pattern on what I assume was the perimeter of the craft. It was at least twice the size of the jetliners.It came to a complete stop at about 80 degrees off vertical and at that point I decided to get off the roadway and to the base of a tree as I was a little bit chicken.It stayed in one spot for a good 5 min. I placed my head against the trunk of the tree and kept an eye on the craft to see if it was sitting still or my mind was playing tricks with me.

This was around 1978 or 1979. I had walked home every day since the 2nd grade.  It was between 2:30 and 3pm. I was walking on the sidewalk against the traffic. It was a 4-lane with a median. I was one block from my home when I looked across the street ahead of me and saw a strange small object hovering above that sidewalk about 15-20 feet up. From that point on I did not take my eyes off of it but I did try to see if there was a string on it or if it was being controlled from someone on the ground. This was a residential neighborhood and there was little to no traffic at this time. Or if there was, I do not remember, I was so fixated by this object.  I continued to watch it, walking slowly as it just hovered there.  Suddenly it seemed to ""notice"" me and it made a direct bee-line across the street toward me. As I write this I am getting chills upon chills just recalling this. It didn’t move fast nor slow but just steadily in a very straight line at the same altitude.  Soon it was right over my head maybe 10 feet above me and following me exactly as a continued to walk. I was not afraid but extremely intrigued. I couldn’t imagine what it was! It was a small very colorful disk. It was slightly tilted, with a small cylindrical ""handle"" going through the center.  If I can remember, I believe the handle was red.  It looked kind of like a toy but it baffled me because it was spinning and it was silent and there was nothing attached to it.  I couldn’t understand how it could be suspended up there, and at that time, I was not aware of any remote controls like THIS.  It hovered over me spinning quietly until I reached the end of the block and stepped off into the street, then it immediately went back across the street.  I still continued to watch it, looking back until I got to my house.   AT that point, I felt afraid and went into the house, locked the doors and called my mom at work as a watched out the kitchen windo w trying to spot it.  I didn’t have a good view.  I never saw it again. I was not particularly aware of UFOs. Our family was not into that. So it didn’t occur to me that this could be a UFO.  I drew a picture of it for my mom and dad and my mom wrote down what I said and we kept that.  But I have never forgotten anyway.  From that day on, I always tried to find an explanation for such an object.  I looked at kites and remote controls or whatever I could find to explain it.  I never could.  Then when I saw a toy or colorful kite that reminded me of it, I would feel a sense of panic.  To this day I still have not found a plausible explanation for it.  There were no other witnesses. This is the first time I have reported it.  I am 40 years old.   Watching a UFO special on Discovery Channel this afternoon prompted me to report this finally!   Thank you for your attention to this matter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2008-02-14T00:00:00,24.58480294117647,-81.68395882352942

A friend and I were in submarine school at the time. We were stationed at Submarine base Groton CT. The two of us were scared to death to say anything until now. He is not aware I have submitted this report, but I am confident he saw the same things as I did, as we talked about it both during the event and many times after. The night began after eating chow at the hall. It was not dark yet, we left the base at appx 7:00 pm. Being on foot we walked the road along the river. We soon found a spot on some rocks not far from the base right on the river. We were enjoying good weather as it was clear and warm outside. Nothing appeared to be any differnt than any other night. The sun went down darkness fell upon us. We both had taken up spots on rocks not far apart, laying down relaxing looking up at the sky. It seemed as if it was in an instance three color changing orbs appeared in the sky in a triangle formation. These orbs moved back and forth across the river in formation. They moved with the speed of light going across the river. Doing this manuver, stopping on a dime, all the time maintaining thier formation. I am not sure if thier were three or this was just one object. The whole event duration was only twenty five minutes in length. In the time frame indicated ten differnt movements across the river appearing to be looking for something. The blink of an eye they were gone disappearing in the night sky again with the speed of light. We were scared to death to talk about this or tell anyone. Fearing what might happen or people thinking we were just crazy. I know what power the goverment wields and how they deal with issues like this. Until now I never understood what they were looking for but now it is clear. The Submarine Base just down the road had in port subs. This now I am confident whatever weapons they contained was what they were looking for. News of any objects in the sky that night was not publicized nor did we ever hear of it. It has been many years but I still recall events on that night as it happened yesterday. I think someone should know about this now. It was as real as I am writting this today. I have told the story never publically, only to select friends. The relevance of this event now seems to take on a differnt light. I hope this is of value to anyone reading it.

I had looked out our bedroom window towards the East, and saw an unusual light which appeared to be beyond the Masonic Temple, perhaps over the Potomac River, which we could see from our window about 3 miles away.  It grew in intensity as I watched it as can be seen in the three images. From one of the images it appears it could have been lighting up the foreground, that is, the trees next door, but I the exact position is hard to judge. I don't recall how the sighting ended or much else about it.  I took three pictures of it with my Nikon F2 - I had kept it loaded with film because I had been taking quite a few pictures of my newborn daughter.  My daughter had been born at home in a snow storm, and it snowed heavily that week she was born.  I remember it was a hazy night when this light appeared.  The Masonic Temple was lighted up as can be seen in the pictures.  Recently (2007) I was going through old pictures to digitize and came upon the images again.  If I can figure out how to, I will upload them here.  The sighting caught me at a time when I had a newborn child at home as was not getting all that much sleep, so how it affected me may not be relevant.

After a while, I noticed that the road was narrowing, and I was afraid to follow it any further. I decided to try and turn my car around, and drive back to Cave Junction, Oregon which was about 30 minutes away. As I was backing up the car, it went off of the road, and the rear end of the car was off the road and the car was tottering. I slowly got out, and was trying to figure out how to get my dogs out, which were in their kennel in the back of the car. If I tried to reach them, the car could tumble down the cliff. While I was trying to decide what to do, a big car pulled up, and 4 tall oriental men, with a strange skin tone, ( too orange ) got out of the car. In spite of the 100+ degree heat of the day, they were all wearing black trench coats.  I said Hello, and they did not reply. Without a word, they went to the front of my car, and picked it up, and sat it back in the road, facing the direction back to home.  I do not think that even twice that number of humans could have lifted my car from the front end only and place it on the road. I do not remember how I got past their car, or they passed mine, as they were headed up the fire break road as I was originally as well. The after thought of the encounter left me really scared, and as soon as I was back in town, I rented a hotel room and slept for a couple of days. This experience is also written about in Dongo’s The Alien Tide (pg 16) I apologize for reporting this some 40 years later. Those weird men on the mountain saved our lives, but they still scared me.

I'm now 47 years old and successful in the Exporting of wastepaper to China, India, etc.   When I was twenty years old I lived in Miami on Collins Avenue facing the Atlantic Ocean from the 17th floor of my Grandmother's apartment.  I had the apartment to myself for the entire summer and it was time well spent.  I loved the beach, the girls, etc. I have ALWAYS been a morning person and remain so to this day.  I've never needed an alarm clock and rise most mornings before 5am.  I've never been into alcohol or drugs of any kind.  In fact I love my lucidity and enjoy my conscious life.   I was wide awake that morning and could not wait to step out onto the terrace to look out over the entire Atlantic Ocean and feel the sweet breeze of freedom that was my youth.  I was smart enough to know how young and free I was because I knew one day I would be who I am today and how hard it is to make a living and meet one's responsibilities.  As the Sun was rose to light the morning sky. a speeding craft came from way out in the ocean.   I knew instantly this was something not of our experience.  This triangular object did in fact stop at the shoreline and hovered about 75 feet above my vantage point from the 17th floor terrace.  There were bright lights on each point of the triangle and it just hovered there for what seemed forever.  It hummed just enough that I could hear it over the sound of the waves beneath us.   I was not afraid but felt glued to my fixed position as I gripped the rail of my Grandmother's balcony. What happened next remains forever in my head all these years because the craft turned on its right (my left) and sped off at such tremendous velocity and made a sound like a team of muffled Lions roaring in unison.  There was a faint liquid vapor trail and I could follow the craft with my eyes for the length of the coast until it then ascended into the clouds with a speed I can not comprehend or convey here.  This thing zipped away like nobody's business.  I never forgot it all these years. ! I'm fam iliar with Harrier Jump Jets and even witnessed Israeli fighter pilots doing manuevers over the Negev Desert when I lived in Israel.  I've seen them turn on a dime during arial dogfighting manuevers.  I was even buzzed by Israeli warplanes while working the fields of a Kibbutz and I know what F-18's can do. You don't hear them until they are already gone.   Nothing on this planet can do what I saw that day in 1980.  I've never told anyone except my Mother and my Aunt.   To this day I feel blessed to have witnessed something not from our imaginations but the reality of other life somewhere in the universe.   What a gift.  My best to all.

We were staying at a camp site just outside Heber, AZ. We noticed this object while on a hayride through the forest area. There were several other witnesses at the camp, however I am not familiar with who they are.  The craft was clearly visible for over 25 minutes and stationary. It was the size of your thumb nail at a full arms length. It was as bright as a full moon, and too big and much too bright to have been a star. There was what looked like a bright ring with a darker center.  We observed this object climb in height until it was about the size of a star; it had by then changed to an amber color.  While watching this object I talked to a man who worked at the camp and had him look up at this object. He said he had never seen anything like it in the area in his 15 years of working at the camp.  There was no strange movements or fast accelerations, it was just stationary until it climbed to a distance that we could no longer make it out.  After the hayride stopped I and used my Sony Digital camera to take a couple of still images and video tape the object for about a minute or so.

Each light seemed approximately as big as 10 stars put together. If I took a quarter and stretched my hand toward the lights, I would cover them with the quarter. The lights were hanging in the air for a few seconds, and then with a fraction of a second they jumped over the freeway (approximately one mile) and started rapidly approaching as. As they moved, we saw that they changed colors (I saw one white color changed to red; however, we could not agree the exact colors).  Then, they froze in the air for a few seconds and jumped back where they came from. Then the lights started slowly twisting around one light and formed a triangle that looked like a starched V (if you connect the dots, it would look like a long arch). Then the lights flipped over and started rapidly moving away to the fields. The altitude was so low, that they would hide behind the trees a few times. Finally, the lights faded away. The whole scene lasted for about 40 seconds. The night was clear (we observed lots of stars). There was no sound (except the sounds of highway). It was no hallucination, because we all described the scene in almost the same words (I talked to each family member privately after we came back home).

I noticed 2 blinking, bright star-light objects moving from the western horizon in a straight line toward the east. They were followed by 4 to 6 more similar objects. Then numerous blinking lights appeared traveling or following the lead lights. At one point they appeared to be zigzagging still traveling west to east. The blinking was at about two blinks per second. After they passed 45 degrees overhead they grouped together. Then another group appeared in the western horizon traveling west to east. Meanwhile the first group paused till the second group approached and then they continued on to the west and out of our sight. We estimate from 80 to 100 of the blinking white lights.

At first I thought it was a satellite because that is about how bright it was, but I quickly noticed it was made up of at least three objects in a forward facing V formation and it was traveling many many times faster than any satellite I have ever seen before, yet much slower than any meteorite I have ever seen. It did not leave any kind of streak behind it, or have any kind of tail, it just looked like a formation of stars in a V shape traveling in a straight line at a very high rate of speed.  I do not have an explanation for what I saw. I hope someone may by chance have seen the same thing at the same time as me somewhere in the United States.  It was on a southeast heading.  I am located in central Wyoming.  I honestly believe there were a total of five lights, I said three in the first post because I was trying to describe a V shape.  I am sure these weren't lights on the forward edge of some kind of giant object. There was no blocking out of adjacent stars around the lights. It just looked fast moving stars flying in formation, and I didn't get the sense they were even in earth's atmosphere.  When I was explaining it to my wife we did see some meteors that were streaking from the east to the west.

There is a low to medium level of light pollution, and looking almost straight up under an overhang cuts out most of that.  I was outside about 5 minutes, and I was looking up, as I usually do at night, looking at constellations, and I happened to notice and watch a very high flying airliner flying approximately east to west.  I then noticed an object flying very fast approximately north to south.  It was a dark grayish shape, with a tiny spot of an orangish color that really seemed like a reflection of light versus an active light, and it was almost unnoticeable except for the movement.  I would say it was almost oval-ish.  It first appeared directly overhead, and was flying at a much higher rate of speed than I've seen any aircraft at a visible level.  It was going slow enough to follow it with the naked eye, however.  I first thought it might be a helium ballon due to the characteristics of appearing smaller but moving faster than a plane may.  However, there is no wind during this incident. I have no idea how high or the size of the object, but I would guess possibly 2000 feet up, possibly more, but no where near the height of the airliner.  It traveled in a straight line, jinked to the right similar to a bat would move, about 6-10 degrees, flew about a second on that heading, then jinked back to the left, again in the same instantaneous motion, a smooth, quick motion, while continuing on.  I would say from noticing it almost directly overhead, until I could not see it, lasted about 5-7 seconds.  I shouted at a coworker to look up, but they had just stepped out of hearing range at the time.  I am not taking any medication, do not drink, and have been at work about 6 hours when this happed, so I am fully awake and alert.  I called Charlotte Douglas airport and asked for a controller to ask if they saw anything, they replied the only thing they had was a plane flying around to land at the airport. I know there is no way this thing was a plane.  No flying lights, no blinking lights, the 2 smooth curves it made while flying.  If there was a helicopter that could angle that fast, I might believe that is what I saw, however there were no lights and I don't believe helicopters fly nearly that fast. I spent 10 years in the Air Force and have seen a few planes fly.  Nothing this fast, seemingly lower height, and the turns/curves it made.

I live in suburbs of North Dallas , Texas. I am a State Gaurd for the State of California , an American Red Cross first responder , a 2 year member of the Air Force Auxillery , Cival Air Patrol and my father was a pilot for over 10 years. I am not an expert at aircraft , but am credible to tell you what I witnessed was something unexplainible and very real and not capable of being any current aircraft that any goverment possess. A college friend and myself had gone out for a cigarette after watching a late movie on television. The sky on this night was extremely clear and there were no clouds visible. Constilations and stars on this night were excellent to observe.  At around 5 am in the morning , still dark , both of us caught with our peripheral vision a change in a consilation visible in the North West sky. Two stars had appeared in the sky , at least they had the appeance of being stars. More than this they were moving at slow pace , like that of a satelite . The pair moved as a unit , buts coordination was beyond that of even the most expierianced pilot. They changed direction slightly twice , remaining perfectly in sync with eachother. The light they gave off dimmed slowly over time until finally disapearing. My friends thoughts on the behavior of the lights explores the possibility that these crafts were moving upward and out of our atmosphere causing the dimming effect.  My first reaction was that these were military crafts , with advanced aero - navigational computers or something that would explain the way they manuvered. I continued to observe the sky and the area where we'd witnessed the strange distant lights. Theyre were a lot of meteors also in the sky that night , a naturaly occuring meteor shower resulted my Haley's Comet. I was not expecting what followed as with most UFO sightings that Ive seen on TV programs , or read about in books there is only one sighting.  Five minutes had past since the disapearance of the first two craft. We both suddenly observed a bright flash from just south of the prior mentioned constilation. The flash was as bright as a camera flash light. Immidieatly after the flash another single one of the ""moving stars"" craft was visible moving in a Northern direction for several seconds before fading like the first two. My friend and I now knew that we were observing something very real , and something that needed immiediate looking in to. I told my friend to remain outside and observe the sky for more activity. I went inside to check all local news stations , and national news , in fear that this was a test of the missle defense system or that another national attack had happend causing the presence of these possible advanced military craft. There was nothing relevant on either press outlet. I went back outside only to find my friend just about to call me , and in time to witness a third and forth craft.  The following sighting remains to me the most signifigant in that it dis-proves any of the theories I had that these craft were man-made or modern. This sighting also disturbes me on a deep level.  What we saw was a passanger jet , probably out of DFW International , heading north , with one of these star like craft following it from a higher altitude and several hundred yards behind. It shadowed the airplane for a good minute in a half , maintaing the same distance and matching the speed of the airline. It then accelerated and moved directly over the plane before abruptly vanishing. At the same time as this first craft disapeared a second light appeared from the origional area that the origional craft had been following the plane at. Several hundred yards behind the plane. This sudden appearance of this craft startled me enough , that I actually fell backwards on the ground. The craft was visible for no longer than several seconds buts direction was twoards us as I clearly remember seeing the light tracer caused by the fast moving craft.  These second pair of craft were much closer to the ground than the origional two viewed in the constilation. These two also moved quickly and appeared and vanished abruptly instead of a gradual fade. I felt a strong fear for the safety of the passangers on the plane , and was very uncomfortable with the way these unknown lights interacted as if there interest was with this jet.  Both my friend and I now knew that what we were seeing was unique , and something that we were not supposed to see. Ive seen meteors , shooting stars , satelites , and nearly every kind of signal light on a plane from both sky and ground and can possitivly identify these crafts as none of the mentioned.  The last sighting occured near 07:40 . We had remained outside for over thirty minutes patiently watching the sky and going over what we had seen , trying to make reason out of any of it. Morning had come and the only now visible stars in the sky were two off to the south west , and a very bright (maybe northern star) star to the west. As we turned around from watching the fading of the two stars to the east , and the area of sky where we saw the other crafts , a new pressence startled me. A new , non moving , very bright light was now visible to left of the remaining one star we had noted before. Its size and amount of light it produced was a complete mimic of the single star to its right. It remained for 6-10 minutes , long enough for both of us to begin questioning simply overlooking this light , and begining to accept that it was also a star. Without warning , it ever moving , and completly dismissing it as a fading star , it simply faded inwards , as if it was moving directly away from us at some great unthinkable speed. Within the amount of time taken by a eyelid blinking it had completly gone leaving the morning sky cloudless , single star remaining, and becoming lighter as the sun was now up.  This last star gives me the oversure impression that it was singled in on us and was observing us. It did not move or show any other sign of possible cause , other than its looming pressence above us , and the feeling that we were trapped and being watched by something that we could not explain and thought could be threat.  Whatever these objects were , they were true ""unidentified flying objects"" . As to whether being extraterrestrial in orgin , I can knowingly testify that there is no possibility that these were man-made or navigated by a conventional pilot . This is taking in to account the possibility of classified expierimentals. These things moved , appeared and vanished , and interacted as if altitude , time , and matter simply didnt matter , and that using these crafts could manipulate and contradict even our most basic laws of physics and far supercedes modern aero science potential.  I have accepted that there are no explinations to what I witnissed and that the account that both of us saw will be laughed at , misunderstood , and not believed. I however feel a sense of self , and look at it as being something very special that I was able to witness , and accept a very real unknown that we as Americans or any persons should press be investigated and monitored. My friend , of christian upbringing, found the expieriance to be the most religious , awakening , and realization as to the importance of having witnessed such things , a life changing expieriance as well as both of our single most important moments of our lifes. Being able to witness these crafts and observe , if only shortly , travelers of space , and things capable of seeming to bend reality.  I had no access to a video camera to record the lights for evidence. Also , after much discussion decided not to call the police at the time. Whether a public record or press involvment will be made by myself or friend remain to be decided.

My 9-year-old daughter and I were standing outside waiting for the bus.  We live in a very rural place with much farmland (right at 15 minutes outside of Farmington Missouri (south west)).  Our lot is 5 acres and we have dogs, cats, horses and cows on the surrounding farmland.   It was right at 6:30 am and it was still pretty dark here.  I saw what I thought to be a very bright star in the North East sky.  And it was not twinkling, however it seemed to get larger and larger.  It was very quiet here and we could not hear anything at all.   When I noticed for certain it was getting larger I just figured it was an airliner going southwest towards us.  My daughter and I just watched it for about 2 more minutes and when it started to get closer and closer, I could see how low it was and got scared.  My daughter and I then went under the nearest tree and I tried to hide her under me a bit.  The aircraft was in full view the entire time and it came right over us.  The light on the front was a very large bright white light, just one light in front that we could tell.  The light was too bright to be able to see the topside of the craft.   When it went right over us at about 100 feet, the horses and cows and dogs went crazy and started making loud sounds. The lights on the side were blue and there were 5-8 of these small blue lights on the left and right side (underneath).  The object was triangle in shape and never made a sound.   It did not seem to interfere with the trees at all, though it was right above the tree line (approximately 75-100 feet high).  There was no wind or anything else emitted from the object.  When it passed over it was going rather slow. It seemed to slow down a bit going over the farmland right across from the road.  I could not say how fast; however my daughter and I were able to tell what the underneath looked like.   The color of the craft was mainly gray-scale and was not what you see in movies at all - meaning it was not all flat and perfect.  It had what looked like ridges and mechanical wiring, etc... It was not a shiny object.   After it passed I quickly moved to the right of the tree so I could see the backend of the object and it had red lights on the back end, though I could not say how many lights were on the craft - definitely more than 5 and they were small.   Then the craft just took off very fast on the same heading.  Soon after the animals got quiet and nothing else followed.   Of course I came inside as soon as possible and did not wait to see if there were any to follow, either. I will be honest and say that I did not believe before I saw this in the sky.  I did ask my daughter what she thought that was in the sky, and she said she did not know but thought it was strange because it did not make a sound and the animals did not like it.   I had her explain it to my husband and as she was explaining it, not one detail was different from what I experienced.   I looked up some military aircrafts online to see if perhaps it was on of them.  The closest I could find was the stealth bomber, however this was still quite a bit different from what we saw.  Differences between the stealth and the object we saw were the underside was different, the lights were not the same and no sound came from the object we saw.  They were very similar in shape, however the craft we saw was a perfect triangle from underneath. I would like you to catalog this, if you need to for your data and record collection; a return call is not necessary but if you need more information feel free to contact me.  I wish to remain anonymous due to my profession.   Thank you.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,37.7721,-90.3672

SD UFO SIGHTINGS 10-22-07  On 10-22-07 I was traveling south from Sioux Falls on interstate 29 when around 8:30 pm on a clear night the stars were starting to show up I noticed a bright organgish round light to the west over the horizon thinking it was a plane heading for Sioux Falls, because I could see the two planets. When I looked over again it was gone just some faint stars in the sky were the light was. Then I looked over again to make sure it was not a star, when a moment later I saw in the dark sky a light go from nothing to bright then another light came on in a line with the first only a little ways away, only to have the first light dim out as a third light came online a little ways away from the second light, as it got brighter the second light went out. As with the fourth light however they were not moving. Kind of looked like big sparks between them. Then no lights for a few minutes. Next I turned west onto old Hwy 44, now 280th St. after traveling west for a couple of minutes I was pondering at what I just saw thinking this is no plane, planet, or star. It happened again only this time it was more west southwest this time. When it happened again I called my wife who was bringing the kids home from their football game in Sioux Falls, I asked where she was and if she saw the strange lights to the west she said no, so I told her and the kids to look half way (2:00 o’clock position) up the windshield and look west, I said they come and go and to just watch the sky and hung up. About four miles from Hwy 19 I saw them doing the same thing again but now one was farther north by itself. Moments later the phone rang and it was my wife and kids and they said they saw the lights to the west. I drove west for 26 miles and turned south on 449th Ave. for two miles and pulled over the time was 8:53 pm again the lights came on but not in a row one light up a little to the south and as that one faded out, one light up north a few miles from it. They would take turns going on and off at 9:00 pm a plane came from the southwest at a high altitude moving northeast. At 9:14 pm was the last time I saw the lights. At 9:23 pm I saw four navigation lights in an echelon formation spread a few miles apart come from the west at a high rate of speed when they arrived at the vicinity of the lights they stayed in formation and turned northeast to Sioux falls were our F-16 fighter base is located. After they turned northeast I saw two-twin engine jet fighters come from the southwest (Omaha?) they flew the area for a few minutes and left, also some came from the south (Sioux City?) All these planes were on the same altitude and intercept as the strange lights. My wife had stopped in Hurley and talked to a man who was standing on 283rd St. watching the lights, he had also been watching them from the interstate. My wife got home about the time the fighters showed up.  She could hear them and see them.",2007-11-28T00:00:00,,

It was bright orange and it dropping what looked like flares? There was a second smaller orange light kinda below it moving up and down. I stopped and called my sister to have her go outside to see if she could see them from Stephan, where we live. She said she didn’t see anything. We didn’t see them anymore and started back home again. Then we were about two miles from home and again we seen one bright orange light then it spilt into two with one below the other, moving up and down. We got home and I walked down our road alittle to see past the campus High School building and south in the sky was five bright orangr lights. Four were in a straight line and one just below the left of the formation. I ran back to the house and got my kids in the van and we were going to go drive to get a better look at them. We made it just off our gravel road and we seen the one orange light again drooping what looked like flares. My daughter was filming it on out cell phone. We waited for about 30min and nothing. We were so excited leaving our house my sister ran over our dog, bummer. There are several residents in the area that seen the same lights. I even e-mailed it to Keloland our news station, no responds. Then on the 24th in Chamberlain, SD the  Keloland weather camera caught this burning light crossing the sky to the east, and a School bus had to stop and check it out. They said on the news that it was burning space debris.I know what I saw was not burning space debris or anything like it . What I saw was stationary and moving up and down. Then maybe later in this week out in Crow Creek district they found some crop circle that some hunters found. I seen a picture that a co-worker took..

I glanced off over his shoulder and noticed a glowing yellow orange oval shaped light in the night sky. This object was self luminesent. It looked like a beacon or hazard light on the top of a radio tower at first. but it wasn't blinking. I told myself thats what it  must be, even though I had lived here for years and knew there wasn't a tower over there. ""They must have built one"", I thought. It wasn't alarming looking or anything. I ignored it for awhile really. I just kept talking and glanced at it during breaks in conversation. It didn't move at all, nor did it change its hue. It actually looked like someones yellow porch lightblub from a great distance accept it was higher than the trees. I think it was miles away really, but it was obvious. After awhile, I had had enough and couldn't figure it out. I interupted my friend in mid sentence and pointed to the object. I asked him what he thought it was. He said he didn't know and laughingly started to tell me about how he and some friends had seen what they thought was a UFO one time. It was then that i glanced back at the light and it was was doing the weirdest thing. It looked like it was shooting sparks out of itself. They were coming from the top left corner  of the light from what I could tell. It looked kind of like a golden firework spray, but didn't fade out. It just hung there next to the object. It is very hard to explain, but it looked like the sparks were dripping. I got very excited and pointed again. This time my friend paid more attention and said ""it must be a meteor or something..."". I don't agree, as the object had been there, unmoving, for at least 10 minutes by this time.  Nothing was different about it's appeatance other than now it was dripping golden sparks in an arc out of it's top. Neither on of us (both college educated)could figure out what it might be. I looked at him and made a comment about it being a UFO. He'a  big born again Christian and started in on me about how we Christians weren't supposed to believe in UFO's. His face was saying something different though. He couldn't figure it out either. We looked back over one last time and it was gone. We kept talking about it and laughed about it being weird. About 5 minutes later it reappeared to our south and looked like it was tree top tall going over houses down the street. It dissapeared from our sight a minute later. The object made no sound at all.

It kept on falling and falling and came closer;we thought it would crash at the city across Tyne river called Gateshead.  All of a sudden it freezes;my girlfriend and I froze too.The ""object"" then started moving horizontally and all of a sudden it dissapeared.  What made me think that this was not a plane were two facts: 1) the plane was glowing like a fireball;no green or red lights spotted as in commercial jets 2) no sound of engines;surely the pilots would have tried to pick it up while it was in free fall. 3) I live near the airport and planes here in newcastle do not take off after midnight. 4)The fact that it completely stopped in the air for 1 second.   It was dark so as you can understand something glowing liek a fireball in the sky could make it easier to track such an object but difficult to tell its shape or form.After so many days we kept telling friends of what we saw and most of them are iffy on the subject but firmly believe us.

I was inspired to finally report about what I saw 23 years ago by the recent interest spurred by the Stevenville, Texas sighting.  I have probably told this to approximately 10 to 15 people in all these years because as any other person that has seen a UFO can tell you “people think you are crazy”. This sighting happened in September or October of 1985. I was a teacher for a trade school for Austin Community Collage and a local union in Austin Texas.  I let out class around 9:00 PM on a Thursday night.  My route home took me down South Lamar to Brodie Lane.  This area of Austin was mostly farm land back then.  As I turned left onto Brodie, I saw an object in the sky moving over the farm house on my right.  I stopped and got out of my truck to get a better look.  There were a few other cars going by and I tried to get them to stop and see but they just kept going by.  It was approximately 150 yards from me and 200 feet off the ground.  It looked like both wings of a jet connected in the middle, boomerang or V shaped,  but there was no fuselage.  I later learned it was called chevron. On the front there were 6 extremely bright white lights, two close together on each side of the center and  single lights towards the tips.  Behind it where fuselage should be, was a hazy, foggy, reddish-pink glow.  It was moving steadily only about 5 miles per hour, silently except for a 3 or 4 second blast of what sounded like high pressure air release every 30 seconds.  I watched it for around 20 minutes  as it flew north-northwest directly over Barton Creek Mall. I called Bergstram, the closest Air Force base at that time, to report the sighting.  For the next few days I went back and forth with phone calls with different people and then they gave me the brush off.  They did, however, tell me they had no aircraft flying that night.  It feels good to report this after all these years.  This is the first time I have written down this experience.  I hope it will jog someone else’s memory that was in the area and serious investigation continues. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The night was moderately clear, with enough light pollution to limit stars to the top two thirds of the sky.

My drawing is also pointing the wrong way - please rotate the figure one quarter turn counterclockwise.  The ""v"" portion pointed westwards.  It was moving soundlessly and in a smooth manner similar to that of a satellite, although slightly faster. It was about a half to a full degree in size from one end to the other, or a bit larger than the full moon when viewed normally.  I had reasonably powerful binoculars on hand (strong enough to view the major moons of Jupiter easily) and through these the line resolved into individual circles or disks, flying very closely together and never altering formation in the slightest.  There were about 15 of them all told - about 4 on the ""short"" end, three on each side of the ""v"" and about another 7 or 8 on the ""long"" end.  They were not attached to each other, but were closely spaced enough to appear a glowing line from the ground. They were white in the center, fading to a fuzzy, blue white on the edges.

We actually stop the 18-wheeler in the middle of U.S. 93 and got out to look at this thing. As this object is ""floating"" over us, with no sound or effort, I am looking at my partner's eyes to make sure he is seeing the same thing that I am. This craft is moving about 400-500 feet above our heads, in the dark we can see that it is a rectangle, but moving wide end first. The narrow end was towards the rear. Two red lights on the front edges, blue to green lights on the rears edges that blocked out star light in the background. We estimated to be about 300 feet across to 600 feet long. It didn't make a soung as it cruised by at about 20-40 miles per hour. It disapeared over the eastern mountains of Nevada, heading towards Salt Lake/salt flats.

In the same direction these lights moved much faster and were over the range within 1-2 minutes.

I want to express how difficult this is for me to talk about.  I have told family members and a few choice friends.  I was on my way home from my ex inlaws home on chiefnoonday road in middleville.  My ex husband and I stopped at the corner of chiefnoonday and yankee springs road.  (Please know that this is several years ago).  We both noticed a saucer shaped object huvering above the tree tops.  There were almost head light looking lights (2) that went from shinning straight ahead to focusing directly on us.  We just watched in disbelief, that it could be a spacecraft of anykind.  I remember rolling my car window down to listen for any noise.  There wasn't any sound. My exhusband and I watched it cross over Yankee Springs rd.  diagonally.  I was on the passengers side next to the stop sign on Chiefnoonday headed towards Hastings.  It had colored lights on the bottom, green I believe. I was at that point almost hanging my head out of our car to get a better look.  It moved very slowly then almost as fast as lightning dissappeared from sight.  We thought for a moment that perhaps the quick flashes of light we had seen on the drivers side of the road on our way to the corner could of been the same thing. We didn't live far from that corner and as soon as we got home we checked the time just for kicks to see if we had been gone longer then we should have.  We were fine.  I do remember calling my ex mother in law and asking her if there was anything happening on her scanner.  (She always had it on back then).  She said nothing was being said about anything related to what we had seen. I had pretty muched dismissed the happening until My mother in law called the next weekend.  She and a line of cars wer at the same corner of my sighting and she experienced the same craft I had.  She however hung her head out the window and started shouted to it ""beam me up, there is no intellegent life  here!"".  My sister in law at that time was a young teenager and started crying in fear.  My mother in law was dissappointed no one stopped and pulled over to talk about the craft that was there. She called us right away in excitement over the experience. No one else that I am aware of ever came forward and spoke about the events that we experienced.  I guess that is why I never really brought it up before.  I  did ask a family member at that time who had some millitary knowledge  if the was a huver craft that made  no noise?  I was told he was aware of huver crafts but they all made some sort of noise.  In my experience I heard nothing.  I always tease my middle daughter that because she has an odd body part she is my alien daughter.  (I am just joking of course).  She was just a tiny newborn at the time and was in the car durring the experience. I think its odd that she has recently moved to Texas this year.  I cant wait to tease her again. Maybe I make a joke of it to keep my sanity.  Maybe it was a government test of something. I dont think I'll ever know.  Its just something that happened that I wanted to share almost 19 years later, that seems like it just happened yesterday. I wish I could be more accurate about dates and times.  I also wish I knew if the other lights that had flashed by prior were related to what I experienced?  I would love to know if anyone else in the Gun Lake area at that time ever came forward with an experience simular to my mother in laws or myself? Thank you for letting me share.

I stumbled on your web site tonight, January 9 2008, and noticed that you accept UFO sighting reports. I've told many people about my sighting, which was several years ago, but never reported it to an organization that collects UFO reports.  And since I don't spend much time reading or researching UFO reports that other's have written, I'm not sure if what I saw is common or not or relevant to your collection of reports. I thought it might be helpful however to document my sighting so that other people can compare it with what they have seen.  Let me say however that I didn't believe in UFOs until my experience. Frankly I find ""UFO people"" at bit odd and I've always distrusted them- still do. To this day, I believe most people are lying about seeing UFOs. It's as if they want to believe in them. Now that I've seen a UFO, I have no choice but to believe that there is something to this phenomenon which can't be explained.  The day was October 31 (1991?) . It was a warm sunny day in the mountains in an area a few miles West of Boulder Colorado near Sugarloaf Mountain. I was standing on a path which I had been on hundreds of times before. There are a few houses around and the area has a lot of people during the Summer months. In October, traffic drops considerably. On this day, I was alone for several hours.  While standing on the path, I looked Northeast toward  a thicket of pine trees about a thousand feet away and slightly higher than my elevation. I noticed a round reflection of light moving around on the limbs of the trees as if someone was using a round mirror to reflect sunlight (about a yard in diameter). It had a very pale yellowish orange glow much like reflected sunlight on a surface and I could see the trees through it. At first I thought it was from a mirror on a moving car which was reflecting light in the trees. I looked for a car under the reflection but there wasn't one so I looked back up at the light.  What struck me was the way that the reflection was moving so smoothly through the trees. Light, dancing off of a mirror from a moving car, would have a jerky motion but this did not. Normally a light reflection would change in size when it hits a tree that is closer than one in the distance but this was not the case either. A piece of tumble weed, blown up from a dirt devil, would have snagged in the thick trees. There was no dust or pieces of debris with it. On that day, the air was completely still.  I realized a few seconds later that it was not a reflection because it moved higher in the sky above the trees and there was nothing behind for it to reflect off of except blue sky. It remained translucent against the sky but a little less bright. While it circled above the tree tops a second one came up from behind the trees and followed it. The original one dropped back into the trees and the second one followed. It was as if they were playing with each other. Almost like a game of tag. At times they would chase each other in the sky and then they would drop into trees and maneuver smoothly through them. This went on for about 30 seconds and they would take turns chasing each other.  One of them darted from low in the trees and shot up back into the sky  behind the trees and out of view. The other one followed. After about 10 seconds, one of them rose up from behind the trees, flew around in a circular pattern and slowly descended to the ground at the base of a tree. It remained there motionless. The other one never returned.  I looked around hoping to find someone who saw what I had just witnessed but there was no one. I decided to hike over to the tree and check it out. I don't know why I wasn't frightened except that I suppose it was just too fascinating. I made a point to keep my eyes fixed on it as much as possible as I hiked nearer to it's location. There were times when I had to look down to check my footing. The closer I got to it the dimmer it became. I'm guessing that I was within 500 feet when the glow became so faint  that I couldn't see it anymore and I couldn't spot the exact location where I thought it landed. It was private property so I didn't go all the way into the trees. When I returned to the area of the path where I first sighted the object (about 5 minutes later) the object was no longer visible under the tree.  Anyway, that's it. It's not a very exciting story  and most people find it kind of boring. I can tell you however that it's exciting to me and I'll never forget that day and how it changed my view of things.  I have some additional observations about this incident which I haven't included but may have some scientific relevance if anyone is interested. Someone can contact me from the NUFORC if they like. I realize it was a long time ago but I'm interested if other's have seen the same thing and what they or you think it is.",2008-01-21T00:00:00,40.024403601895735,-105.26873952606635

This event occured late-spring/early summer of 1991.  I was about 11 years old and playing at my grandparents farm.  The sky I recall being perfect blue; not a single cloud in the sky.  Noise was at a minimum, save for the sounds of my own play.  There may have been intermittant automobile sounds before OR after the incident, but not during the 10-15 seconds the sighting occured.  This 100-acre farm is right beside a major roadway AND railsystem.  On the other side of the country ""block"" (approx. 1 mile north) lies I-94, the major Chicago-Detroit road system.  As I was playing, I saw a glint in between leaves to the north.  I remember pausing, then looking back up.  I saw another ""metallic"" glint, but due to the leaves I could not make any shape nor size out.  There was no sound.  As I ran out from underneath the tree's canopy, I remember being scared for a second thinking that, as low as it was, it might be an airplane...but without a sound.  When I emerged, I saw it.  Talking with my dad later that day about it to determine height/distance (remembering I was 11 years of age or so) we decided it must have been about 100-150 feet north of me; there is a cornfield that runs 100 feet north with a woods on the northern edge.  The object was somewhere above either corn field or just beyond and above the woods.  The object was moving very slowly.  I would have to say no more than 15mph or so judging the distance it moved west to east (approx. 150 feet in 10 seconds).  I remember thinking I should hear a ""hum"" as I had been an avid viewer of the TV program ""Sightings""; however, there was no sound or ""vibration"" whatsoever.  The ""metallic glint"" I first observed came from the top and bottom edges of this pie-shaped craft.  I could tell the edges were round, as in the center (which was the majority of the ""face"" of the side of the craft presented to me) had around 5 different colored ""panels"" standing vertically.  As a kid, it reminded me of the Lifesavers candy wrapper; each ""panel"" or window stood vertically, top and bottom of each panel meeting the metallic top and bottom of the craft.  Each panel was one solid color (I only recall three colors now; red, green, and purple).  The craft was not very high; being yound and unable to judge I cannot guess, but a separate ""incident"" I will relate in just a moment may allow you to judge the height.  However, it kept moving westward at an even pace, moving perfectly straight (not changing altitude or bearing).  Then, as if on a sudden, it shot off in another direction and altitude!  It headed about forty-five degrees to the north (roughly North East) AND UP in altitude at about the same angle.  This object, which appeared so low to the ground, was out of sight completely within 5 seconds.  Maybe less.  I stood there...obviously stunned...for only a few seconds.  I cannot remember which I experienced next first, but I heard a helicopter just about the same time it too emerged!  This came from the west, heading east (same ""flight plan"" as the craft).  It was at about the same height as the craft but travelling faster (""pre-spacejump"" I should say).  It was so low, in fact, that I could clearly see the spaces in between the letters on the helicopter: US ARMY After joining the National Guard a few years later, I was able to identify the helicopter. One UH-60 ""Blackhawk"".  It should also be noted that, about 30-miles due west, is a Michigan Air National Guard base that I would presume this came from.  Now I know the crew had to see it; it would have been right in front of them.  I would also be surprised if no one else had seen this.  To reiterate: The day was clear.  The craft travelled between TWO major roadways.  The top and bottom caused such a glint that I noticed it while playing BETWEEN the leaves of a rather large tree.  The sides of the craft were quite beautiful, actually; each a separate distinct color.  It should have been noticed out of the corner of anyone's eye.

After we dropped off my car we traveled together and saw the same glowing orange and white fireballs about 25-30 miles south of the original sighting.  Since then, I've seen hovering orange orbs on several occassions the most startling being a sighting in Tioga County, PA in a remote area near my family's cabin.  The orange orb just appeared as I was leaving my cousin's house across the valley and just sat there stationery for about a minute until it simply dissipated. I've seen military-style flares before and shooting stars and this was neither. Around this time I was experiencing a number of paranormal experiences including ET dreams and visitations.

I took the dogs outside and noticed the back of a brownish shape slowly passing south behind the 2 story apartment building next to me. I imagine it was a triangle. The back was more or less straight across and tapered forward. It was gliding silenly across the sky. I saw no lights and dropped everything and  ran 25 feet into the street to see more but it was gone. Then drove the car south but could not find it. The building is low so it seemed to be maybe the altitude that a helicopter flys in the city. I have never seen anything like it or any where close to the shape and color before. An amazing experience. I will pursue my quest to identify it.,2006-10-30T00:00:00,26.600205714285714,-80.12513920634922

I was driving at the speed of 45 mph the weather was clear and sunny with one or two very small low clouds in the sky; temperature was approx. 70 degrees. As I was heading east towards the Garden State Parkway what caught my attention was a very bright shimmering light it was far away in the sky and I would say it would be approx. 10:00 angle. I did not hear any sound, I can describe it as a long cigar shaped elongated and it appeared to be hovering. The object was definitely a solid I didn’t see anything else on the object except for it was a bright shimmering light. I stared at it for approx. 7 seconds then I blinked my eye and it was gone, I have no idea what direction it took or if it had a direction, there was no trail. I surveyed the sky for the object and it was not seen again. “It was a very clear day” On Lacey Rd the road is a two lane road East to West with low trees very much of an open area. I called my husband at that moment to tell him what I have seen. I would have thought that I would seen it an again or even an object if it was a plane or a blimp but it was not seen again. Now I can tell you that Robert J. Miller Air Park runway is directly across from was I saw the object far east possibly near the Garden State Parkway. I understand that planes airlines reflect the sun light but not like this. This shimmered while I was driving then disappeared. I would like to add that I could not explain the sighting I’m just saying it was definitely strange nothing like I saw before. Where we live we have airlines flying over us to Newark Liberty which I would say the flight pattern and I see airlines all day and yes they reflect the sunlight but not for 7 sec’s while I was driving and the plane would fly at the least 200 mph or more I would like to know if any one saw something strange also in this area.",2006-10-30T00:00:00,39.8398,-74.1901

I went to my horse barn to check on a sick horse at 9:00pm and noticed a large circle of lights very low in the sky.

To the best of my knowledge,the whole configuration was about one-half the size of a football field and consisted of four lights rotating in a circle or slightly oval pattern. They were spaced evenly apart and would rotate once and then all go into the center and touch, and very quickly go out again and rotate. This pattern was repeated over and over during the whole veiwing. I would estimate the constant speed of the circles to be about 40mph or faster. Two of my neighbors also witnessed the event. It was very overcast at the time. There was no noise or sound from the lights. I am located about 7 miles from Denver International Airport. I did call them this monring to see if anything showed on radar. They were going to check. I also called the police about 9:50pm last night. The lights suddenly disappeared, and I did not see how the object left the area, as I had gone into the house to get the phone. I stepped back outside and it was gone, approximately at 10:00pm, Sept. 21, 2006. It seemed interested in my movements, as the lights were rotating, but the whole configuration stayed in the same spot while I was working with my horse,for about 30 minutes, near a very well-lit barn.

Looking up and focusing closely, I realized it was actually three steady non-strobing white lights in a narrow triangular arrangement and seemed to be a single object seen from an angle. The sky was clear and cloudless with a multitude of visible stars. Two airplanes with normal blinking lights could be seen traveling south at different normal altitudes in the distant south-west sky. The unusual white light was moving three to four times faster than a conventional aircraft and it was its unusual speed which first caught my attention. The light then suddenly accelerated moving twice as fast in an upward arc in an ""S"" shaped manoeuvre as it shifted direction towards the east and south, nearly directly above my head and it headed over the ocean, then it looped again, reversed direction and accelerated towards the south-west, climbing in the sky until it vanished from sight. The entire sighting probably lasted less than two minutes as it traveled from north to south, then east, then towards the south-west, although the extraordinary nature of the event made it seem much longer in duration. It was not a conventional aircraft or a meteor or bolide. It was unlike anything I have ever seen before and I pay attention to the sky. The velocity of its acceleration, its silence, and the graceful ease with which it moved combined with its bizarre trajectory across the sky brought me to immediate full attention and I felt utterly amazed. After it vanished I spent several minutes studying the visible sky above the barrier island where I live, then I went in my house and, very excited, I phoned a friend advising him to go outside and look around. I then grabbed binoculars, went back outdoors and spent several minutes scanning ! the warm , clear, windless sky. The unusual light had vanished and there were no airplanes to be seen either. My friend called back and reported that he had seen nothing unusual from his wooded area 20 miles north of me.

I ran and got my wife and daughters and video camera  but the battery was dead. We watched them fly over in formation then a couple started overtaking the others.They looked just like the view of looking down on a gear cog. They had an orange glow and it was hazey at the edge. They were flying at approx 500 to 1000ft high and made no sound.We all ran to the back of the house and watched them fly into the Western horizon. Standing there bewildered as to what we had just witnessed I noticed another one coming from where the others had come from and was on the same course. I went inside to quickly get my binoculars and managed to get a closer look. It was just like an orange flying gear cog, I could not believe my eyes! 4 of us witnessed the event and have been watching the local news all day to see if anyone has reported anything. I have been interested in astronomy since I was a child and currently possess binoculars and a powerful telescope. I know the difference between planes and helicopters even flying at night, in fact we saw a couple of aircraft a few mins later and they were totally different and had flashing strobes.We are a very level headed family and I didn't even believe in UFO's but I'm convinced now!",2007-06-12T00:00:00,,
