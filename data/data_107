I believe it was Sunday, October 18th.   I was driving south on Ten Mile road between Meridian and Kuna, Idaho.   It was early evening and the sun was to the west.  I observed a spherical object in the sky moving west to east.  It looked like a big shiny silver ball.  It caught my attention because the sun was reflecting off the surface and I could see the curvature of the object but no tail or wings.  It looked like a silver ping pong ball.  I don’t think it was a Mylar balloon because it moved smoothly east with no deviation or bobbing.  It was quite high in the sky and my rough guess is that it would have been about 25 to 30 feet in diameter.     I slowed my vehicle and watched it move steadily across the sky.  I found a place to pull over and after parking my vehicle, I tried to find it again and it was gone.  The sky was clear, no clouds and no trees or other obstructions.  It should have been there because it wasn’t moving very fast.  It was just gone!   The total length of my observation was probably 45 seconds to a minute.

We're very familiar with the area and we both noticed a large glowing orange light moving slowly across the sky across the Ohio River.  (No flickering, no additional blinking aircraft lights, etc)  The light was moving in a west to east direction parallel to the Ohio River.   I wasn't going to mention it to my wife, until she yelled out ""What the hell is that light moving?""  At this point we were both very aware that something was strange was in the sky and paying attention to it as much as possible. As we left the stop light and headed west into downtown, we noticed there were now two of the same large lights next to each other.  One noticeably moving and one stationary above the bluffs on the Ohio side of the river. As we passed by a building to another opening there were then 3 lights, all stationary in a triangle formation. We passed by another building in downtown and there were the 3 lights in a triangle formation, and now 4 additional lights of the same brightness and hue in a separate rectangle formation. (I am sending reproductions and diagrams to the email to demonstrate as best as I can remember the lay out of all lights)  We turned to enter the Simon Kenton Bridge to cross the river into Ohio and all the lights were completely gone from the sky with no trace. My wife and I were blown away by what we saw, honestly. When we got to our friends house we had to have the  ""We've been friends for a long time, so you have to believe what I'm about to tell you..."" speech. We've done research off an on since we saw the lights that night, finally finding this website.  Once we saw there were similar sightings in the Ohio-Tucky area, with multiple balls of orange light in the sky, we knew we needed to report it to here as well.

On October 28, 2015, between 8 and 9-pm CDT, it was dark and I was returning from a 45-minute walk. I went through the Lake Highlands Baptist Church parking lot, at the intersection of Northcliff Drive and Parkhurst Drive. This Church is about 1-mile northeast of White Rock Lake in northeast Dallas, Texas. Directly to my southwest, about 20-degrees above the horizon, were about twelve orange lights, forming about six distinct pairs. The lights were each uniformly as bright as a full Venus, but were pure orange in color. No FAA aircraft navigation colors were visible, specifically white, red and green. The lights appeared to be over the Fair Park area, at about 5,000-feet in altitude and 5-miles distance. The span inside each pair was comparable to a 737, from wingtip to wingtip. Each two lights appeared to be mated, but I could not see any solid object between the lights. None of the pairs seemed attached with a different pair, as they slowly moved around independently. Each pair was separate of the other pairs and they appeared to be at various staggered distances. I only saw a flat-on view of these things from their northeast side, and do not know the other side. Another witness 71975 saw the lights from another angle and could give triangulation. A jetliner was directly behind the lights to the southwest at about 10,000-feet altitude and 10-miles away. This aircraft apparently left D-FW Airport and was traveling in a southeast direction behind the lights. The night was clear and the lights were steady for 5-minutes, so they were not natural phenomena. They were much too large, bright, high and stable to be Chinese lanterns. These were illegally hovering near a Love Field flight path, five miles south of the runway, for five minutes without proper navigation colors; therefore, they were not man-made objects. These orange lights should have been easily seen by Love Field aircraft and traffic control and recorded. The pairs each slowly faded out one by one after about five minutes.",2015-11-06T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

For the last couple of weeks my girlfriend and I have been followed by several different crafts, including a large triangle craft which I have seen up close with geometric patterns with red and white lights on the wings. It all started when I noticed these star like objects at night over my house that would move sporadically, almost as if they would glide, increasing their movement as night progressed.  Whenever i tried recording it through my phone all that would show up is a flickering light that flashed red and white, moving all over the screen.  I observed these lights almost every night for the past month until we started being followed. The night before the following started, in the early hours of the morning I had the urge to look out of my bedroom window only to see that the star/object in sky moving left to right and in circles with tremendous speed. For the next three nights I noticed some sort of orange orb at night, which seemed to hover a little bit above tree level. Its moved in a stop and go motion as if it was chugging along.  It would appear over my house as soon as I got home work. On the third night, I was at a traffic light getting off a ramp from 495 south heading to my brother's house in Falls Church (which is several miles away from my parents house), this orb appeared from the clouds in the distance and kept getting closer to my direction, at that point I was clearly able to recognize that it was the same thing I had seen the last two previous nights.  This time at a higher altitude.  When the light turned green and I started to drive I saw the orb picked up its speed and seemed to be keeping up with me until it disappeared into the clouds only to reappear again when I got out of the car. Later that night at my brothers I was smoking a cigarette outside with my friend and staring at sky   , as I was explaining to him what I saw earlier that evening, we saw a bright orange light in the distance that caught our attention.  We watched as it was moving slightly in our direction, at this point we could not clearly make out the object.  About a minute later we! lost sight as it went behind a couple of trees only to appear a couple seconds later heading in our direction, now we were able to clearly see that it was some sort of triangular craft of substantial size that seemed to fly extremely low and slow right over my brother's neighborhood.  It was moving so slow and close that my friend and I were able to make out geometrical patterns that were lit up in the middle of the craft. At which point i pulled out my phone and ran after it to record it as it was passing by. As I ran the craft appeared to pick up speed, and quickly descended even lower until we lost sight of it behind some townhouses.  I was able to capture it on my phone as it was speeding away.  When I checked the footage I saw that it had picked up a lot of static when I focused the camera on the craft.  All you could hear is a distinct low pitch humming, barely audible if you were indoors which I found incredibley odd considering the sheer size of the craft.  Two other different crafts that were more difficult to see, proceeded to fly in the exact same flight path and descended very quickly as if they were going to hit the ground.  All of them with distinct red and white flashing lights.  When I drove to go pick up my girlfriend I saw that these crafts were following me at a distance.  At this point I became very concerned and pointed them out to my girl as we drove back to my place.  Even she wa! s able to tell that the movement of these objects were different then that of a plane.  These crafts seemed to be able to hover and ascend straight up without moving forward. Since then I have noticed these crafts as well as other odd flickering lights that move wherever I go, flying/hovering around the general location, and seems to increase everyday.  My girlfriend and I decided not to tell anybody for fear that they would think we are crazy or on drugs.  Tonight my girl and I saw more of these things in the sky then we ever have.  Bright flickering lights that somewhat resembles a star from a distance that will disappear and reappear in different locations. On top of that a number of odd things have been happening to my girlfriend and I including: seeing things at the corner of our eyes like a light or something that passed by very quickly, sensations that someone is in our bedroom with us, getting headaches/pressure at random times, odd noises and thumps and electronics malfunction more often than usual. Forgive me for writing this much but we have felt unsettled for the last couple of weeks and do not know what to do.  I have not been able to sleep well for fear of what can happen to us and I can hear these crafts flying over my house all times of the night.  I also tried calling the hotline on the first night it occurred but was told ""they generally don't believe people that say they they are being followed"" and was told to write  a report, which was quite upsetting considering the nature of this website.",2015-11-06T00:00:00,38.9474631840796,-77.21196832504145

I saw two distinct white round objects about 30 degrees above the horizon in the NNW part ofthe sky.  They were of the same light intensity and size.  They moved for about two seconds almost parallel to the horizon in a ENE direction.  One object moved in a somewhat skewed trajectory from the trajectory of the other.  They were about the size in diameter 10 times the size of the average distant star.  Their speed was about 10 times that of a big plane you would see going overhead.

I reported a sighting a few months ago and have basically been seeing the same things off and on for awhile.  My previous one was the ""rather not say"" when asked what town.  Reason being I come from a very for lack of a better term ""traditional minded"" area and I don't want to be known that I have been seeing lights lately.  Since that first report I have been noticing the same styled balls of light on occassion going through a certain field by my house and dropping so low to the ground I thought a few times the lights would actually land.  They would hover there and then abruptly shoot quickly up and fly away. That's the back story to tonight.  Again like the last report, I went out to have a cigarette and saw two gigantic lights one slightly above the other.  At this point admittingly I suspected it be a show again and watched.  They moved in a jittery fashion in zigzags up and down, ""U"" shapes, and diamond shapes.  Also they would move straight up and down.   The bottom one was more active.  They would get brighter and larger, then dim to almost nothing.  The movements of the two didn't seem to have a pattern together.  After awhile I looked to my side and at first it looked like a ton of smaller lights were slowly gliding through the sky as well, but I noticed the moon also looked like it might be moving in the same direction and decided it was just an effect of fast moving clouds passing through. This made me wonder if that could be the case with the big lights so I turned to their direction again and looked at all the stars there, the stars in that direction didn't seem to be nearly as effected with the cloud movement and I also realized their effect made stars look like they only went in one specific direction regardless.  Not up, down, zigzag etc.  That also made me wonder if the clouds might have something to do with the dimming and brightening, but I noticed they would brighten and dim when there were no clouds and in fact tended to get very bright when a cloud passed them and could still be seen moving about, then as before would stop, then move again.  They would change from white, yellow, blue, green and red, but mostly just white and blue.  After about 20 minutes I went inside because it was to cold to stay out.  I would at this point like to know what it is I'm seeing the past few months.  I do know there is an air force base nearby, and they may be some sort of weird new plane?

It remained there for some time as my son and I talked and tried to figure out what it could possibly be.  Then it shrunk down to a spot, like the one we had seen originally, and then disappeared.

It was flying no mor! e than 100 feet, if that, over the tree lines on the southern side of Route 119, heading west. ... The object was heading from the northeastern sky towards the southwestern sky just before sunset. The sun was shining on it from our left, in the southwest, as we looked due west. ... It came from out of nowhere! It made no sounds, at all. It was internally illuminated, colored a very bright white in the center. All around the perimeter of the object, it was surrounded by a fine bright metallic blue band of bright light. It was oval-shaped, but not perfectly oval-shaped from our vantage point. Also, it was moving VERY FAST !! It left no vapor trails or exhaust fumes behind it. It cast no shadow on the ground. It made no normal aviation type sounds that a jet, or an aeroplane, or a air liner, or a small propellor plane, or a weather helicopter, or a military chopper might make. Nothing! No sounds! It zipped across the sky, coming from, virtually, out of nowhere! The whole perception of it, for all three of us, only lasted between two and ! three se conds, at the most, but that was enough to get a very good look at it.  Also, it appeared to be DESCENDING, as if it intended to LAND somewhere off to the southwest in a farm field in one of the western farms that run along both sides of Route 119 on the west side of Highways 495. ... It was RIGHT ABOVE the tree line! ... We all thought it was going to CRASH, and we were expecting to hear a LOUD BANG, and possibly see flames and smoke. ... But just then, something REALLY WEIRD happened that NONE of us have ever seen before (and I have seen a UFO now, after this, for the THIRD time in my life): instead of the bright, silent, wicked fast, descending, oval-shaped, and internally illuminated object CRASHING to the ground over and past the trees nearby the new, Littleton Police Station, the object, amazingly, SPLIT APART into THREE separate flying round, white, oval lights with a blue tint around the perimeter, and IN FORMATION, these three objects all continued flying / zipping /! floating / gliding / piercing west through the sky over the tree line by Route 119, and then TOTALLY DISAPPEARED from our sight! ... GONE! ... Into thin air! ... Did they LAND? ... Did they CRASH? ... Did they CHANGE DIRECTION on a dime? ... Did they hover even CLOSER to the ground? ... Did they zip off to the South or to the NORTH behind the trees and beyond our sight SO FAST that we could not see them change direction? ... Or, did they ZOOM UP and OUT of our lower atmosphere instantly and so fast that the human eye cannot detect the exit path of their motion?! ... We do not know! ... But, we do know this: we all saw it at the same time. We saw it appear from, apparently, out of NOWHERE. ... We saw it split into THREE separate ovals or spheres. ... Lastly, we saw it then totally DISAPPEAR beyond the tree line without a trace! ... It was real! ... Did anyone else SEE that? …",2015-11-06T00:00:00,42.5384,-71.4853

When outside with my daughter to walk the dog at about 6:15, we happened to be looking up at the constellations when my daughter noticed a upside down W shaped object coming towards us.  This object was noticeable due to the rows of lights outlining the craft, forming an upside down W-shape. This object was about a football field across and 300 ft in the sky above flying from the northwest towards the southeast.  The craft’s lights were slightly dimmer than the stars in the sky, yet still very noticeable.  The craft, though very low to the ground, was silent as it flew over our heads.  As it passed over our heads, the left side of the object moved in towards itself, making the upside-down W shape fold in on itself, allowing it to turn more towards the southeast.  After this it disappeared out of sight. We believed this to be the last of the sighting and turned to go inside to draw a picture of the craft at about 6:17 when we noticed more activity towards the northeast.  This time the objects were on the horizon and they looked entirely different.  At first I thought they were 5 intensely bright meteorites due to the burning tales which they emitted.  But we noticed they were lined in a vertically slanted row and not moving, so they were definitely not meteorites.  After about 5 seconds, the fireball-like objects suddenly moved into a circle.   One of the lights on the left moved more towards the west, while the other lights began to come together at the center of the circle, lowered beyond sight due to the trees and homes blocking the view, falling out of our sight.

Immediately, someone took a picture of it, and it became the first color picture printed on page one of “The Daily Oklahoman.”  The flights continued for months.  From the beginning, word on the street was it was a flight technology being tested by the local air force base, Tinker Field.  The Air Force denied it, and said they didn’t see it visually or on radar, and that they knew nothing.  Most of the people in town witnessed these flights. People were excited at first.  After the first few days, with no official confirmation and in that it caused no trouble and no one could do anything about it, people went from indifference to ignoring it.  My family lived north of the city at Danforth and Western Ave., and I thought I was too far away to see it. But, my brother and I did see it, up close, Saturday, July 17, 1968, shortly after 9 p.m..  We rode a motorcycle to Ramblewood Hills at Santa Fe and Waterloo and parked.  It was a very clear night, just after sunset.  We noticed an unconventional aircraft two or three miles to the north, brightly lit but not flashing, moving back and forth and making no sound. Without saying anything we hopped on the bike and started it, and after moving a few feet, the disk was right next to us.  It was a few hundred feet in altitude and appeared to be over 100 feet in diameter, a classic, black, elliptical disk with no visible seams or rivets.  The wide, circular light bar was divided into three segments colored red, blue and yellow.  The segments looked like big light-emitting diodes, something we knew about but that weren’t available on the market. We went west one mile on Waterloo, and the disk flew along with us, much to our surprise and horror. We turned south on Western, and it made the turn with us.  Despite the fact we were very frightened, it was a wonderful thing to see.  It flew beautifully, tipping from side to side, soaring, giving us a very good look, and completely silent. I thought that if I never saw one of these up close again, this would always be the most beautiful thing I ever saw.  I wished I had a motion picture camera, but alas.  By then, we were three miles from our house, and it seemed like 50.  We parked in the driveway, and the disk hovered in the field north of the house over an old hedge apple tree, about 200 feet to the north. It was clear the vehicle was using a gigantic value of electricity.  I became aware that the enormous negative energy holding it aloft struck the ground and fanned out.  Some was hitting me, and I knew that it was killing the tree, and that later I would witness the dried trunk and branches collapse. I couldn’t imagine why I thought that, but I was very certain of it.  The disk did not fly away.  A white haze energy field about four inches thick enveloped the disk, and it disappeared without a sound, as we both shouted, “wow.”  It was about 9:15 p.m. After the second day, the fronds on the tree turned brown, and by the third day, it was clear the tree was dead. It never again showed signs of life. I was 14. I graduated from high school, then college.  When I visited the house, I went out to see the tree many times, certain the moment had come.  It didn’t collapse, but I remained certain I would see it. Ten years passed.  The last time I checked, I saw it collapse. It was dramatic, and sounded like many large panes of glass shattering and clinking into a million pieces.  What is the chance I would see something so fleeting that happens in just a couple seconds, and why was I so sure I would see it?  It ranks among the few strangest things that have happened to me. For years I thought it must be an alien technology because we don’t teach that kind of physics at the graduate level, and we don’t.  But, I grew up in the era of the antigravity project, and I knew in the back of my mind it might be and probably was earth technology.  Certainly, that’s what people who worked at Tinker said. I began drinking within a couple weeks, and drank heavily for 14 years to drown my sorrow, then gave up drinking. What was it?  I applied everything I’ve seen and been able to learn.  I concluded it was one of ours, utilizing Tesla’s antigravity electromagnetic drive developed by the enormously expensive, stolen antigravity project.  See:  http://sayit-sayit-sayit.blogspot.com/2013/09/something-big-kept-secret-antigravity.html When the disk vanished, it went to hidden space, which means what we saw was an actual, whole-universe transportation vehicle, capable of speeds far exceeding light speed and able to traverse time. I remember this as if it happened today.  It was my only close look at an antigravity vehicle, and since then I’ve never doubted the reality of antigravity or free extraction electricity.   We’ve been able to do all this since 1958, and those who stole the technical data keep humanity living in the dark ages.",,35.66189285714286,-97.47531375661374

I'm not sure of the exact date or time, since I was in Marine boot camp, and we weren't allowed watches.  While on night patrol our whole platoon was told to get down (hand signals of course).  We were in a open field around 200 yards in circumference, the sky was clear.   While laying in the grass for about 15 minutes I started looking in the sky.  This is when I noticed a solid red light.  My first assumption was a satellite, since I had seen a few before until it jetted across the sky and stopped on a dime.  When I say jetted it was faster than anything I've ever seen and the distance it traveled in the second it moved was incredible.  The distance was about from Adhara star to the Procyon star for distance purposes only.   After sitting there for about 2 to 3 minutes it moved again about the same distance in a different direction.  After that I thought I was seeing things so I tapped my buddy next to me and pointed to the sky and whispered ""see that red light?&quo! t; He acknowledged and I told him to watch it.  About a minute later it moved again but a shorter distance this time.  My buddies eyes were wide open in disbelief with a WTF whisper coming out of his mouth.  As we watched the light moved a few more times, distances and speed that nothing from this Earth could accomplish.  The last time it stopped it seemed to be right over us and then took off straight into the sky and disappeared.  A few minutes after it was gone we were told to get up and continue our patrol.  When we got back to camp me and my buddy talked about it and both concluded that it had to be a ufo.  I've only told a few people about this for fear they wouldn't believe.  Ever since that day I can honestly say I do believe we are not alone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2016-02-19T00:00:00,,

But as I got to the bottom of the Devil's Tail, there were two more lights.  From the clear night sky, it became clear to me this was not flares I was seeing. The object was silent.  No sound at all it was judging from the highest point of the bluffs just over 300 feet above elaphant rock.  As i had been hiking this area the morning before.  I parked in the middle of the road.

The light was bright enough to hurt my eyes. It did this in bursts of five.  From my view point it seemed like it was scanning the ground.  I was terrified by this point.  Thus got back in my car.

Then it emitted a bluish swell in front of it.  The craft shot forward through the swell the swell opened then vanished with a bright flash.

They told me then to keep it quiet and that it was nothing. ...

We were waiting in the pick-up zone and it’s about between 8 and 9pm.  We were looking out east towards what was then called Viejas Amphitheater and we saw two (2) blue lights off in the distance.  We can tell they were pretty far away from us and if I had to guess how far apart from each other they were I’d say three (3) miles. At first I thought they might have just been military helicopters because we are a big military city and have military aircraft in the skies all day every day.  But then they started to alternate between one flashing and then the other kind of like two (2) buoys on the water. One is dark while the other is lit.  Then suddenly both flashed rapidly and went dark and all the crickets got quiet.  A few seconds after, the clouds lit up and flashed twice like lightning behind a cloud layer in the same spot.

While standing on Wilson Ave. and Snyder on the boarder of Campbell and Struthers, Ohio, witnesses observed 2 triangular shaped objects in the northwest sky.  Witness B was the first to notice them and advised the other two witnesses.  All looked to the northwestern sky to see 2 seemingly equilateral triangular-shaped objects with lights at each angle.  The lights appeared to be an unwavering bright lime-green, with one light forward and the other two in the rear.   Due to the limited amount of stars in the night sky, witnesses were unable to determine at this time if the objects were solid or not.  The 2 triangular objects were traveling at a very low speed from northeast to southwest.  The two objects were also traveling very close together.  At this time the 2 objects had crossed over the Wilson Ave. reference point when witnesses observed a single, lime-green in color, orb-like object following the same flight path, but seemingly lower than the other two.  At this time t! he two triangular shaped objects further crossed the Mahoning River reference point, and began to spread out.  The lead tip light stayed slightly ahead while the two rear lights moved up and further apart, causing an almost straight-line appearance.  The lone orb-light object still trailed in the same flight path and slow speed. 	As the object flew farther away, witnesses retrieved a pair of binoculars to view the objects.  All that could be observed were the lime-green lights, no structure or other characteristics.  The objects were observed in the same almost straight-line pattern until they traveled so far that they could not be viewed with the binoculars.  Witnesses attempted to obtain pictures and video with their cell phone cameras, however due to the objects altitude and distance from the witnesses, the lower focal power of the cameras could not pick up the objects.  Due to the single object being of the same characteristics of the lights that created the triangular shape then broke apart, all witnesses believe that there were seven object in total. All witnesses agreed that they had never seen aerial crafts with these characteristics before.  All three witnesses have extensive law enforcement careers and all three are military veterans with extensive service time.  One witness is a current MUFON Field Investigator.   It is also to be noted that the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport/Vienna Airbase (1453 Youngstown Kingsville Rd Vienna, OH 4447) is approximately 14 miles north of the sighting.  This region is also a very busy travel route for commercial and military planes arriving and departing at Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport/Vienna Airbase and the Pittsburgh International Airport.

I thought maybe our Air Force base was doing some new kind of craft experiment or they were weather balloons.  The only different thing was that at the end, I believe I could see tiny lights around the spheres, very tiny, almost like diamonds or little stars, but they were moving, too. I emailed neighbors to see if anyone else saw what I did and one couple replied that they did. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

"7 dark masses slowly fly past low above the trees, moving N to S following the South Yadkin River.",Cooleemee,NC,2016-02-05T20:00:00,unknown,4 minutes,"Occurred : 2/5/2016 20:00  (Entered as : 02/05/16 20:00) Reported: 2/14/2016 12:35:30 PM 12:35 Posted: 2/19/2016 Location: Cooleemee, NC Shape: Unknown Duration:4 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/125/S125852.html,"7 dark masses slowly fly past low above the trees, moving north to south following the South Yadkin River. 	On the night of February 05, 2016, at 8 pm in Cooleemee, NC, my wife and I stepped out of our house to walk the dog.  I was looking due west into the night sky when I noticed a dark mass moving slowly from north to south appeared to be following the South Yadkin river, I estimated that the object was no more that 100 feet off the tree tops and a half a mile away.  The object was very large but I was unable to discern a shape, my first thought was that it was a C-17 cargo plane.  I did not hear any engine noise and assumed that it would catch up as jet aircraft tend to be seen first then heard.  I stepped further up closer toward the road in my front yard to continue to walk the dog, when I saw another object traveling in the same direction at the same altitude and the same speed with no apparent engine noise.  I was still not able to determine the shape of the object but noticed that it had a single steady red light that was approximately 3 times bigger than a star.  In all there were 7 objects that we counted that passed us, all at the same altitude moving in the same direction at the same speed with no engine noise.  However, there were 2 objects that were different, the fourth object had in addition to the steady red light, had a white light, towards the front of he object, shining directly down below the object and the fifth object had just the red light as the others did but had two slime green colored lights that were illuminated what appeared to be the upper aft section of the object.  I have spent the last 18 years working in Army Aviation Maintenance in the Avionics/Electrical section and immediately assumed that they were formation lights, so my initial impression was that they were military aircraft despite the lack of seeing an Anti Collision light illuminate on any of the objects.  As my wife and I stood there and watched them continue moving south, then south easterly,  I witnessed the last objects red light move thru the trees and disappear and during the entire sighting my wife and I never heard any engine noise.

I walked outside on my deck to adjust an outdoor FM antenna.  After adjusting it I looked up to check the direction it was facing and noticed the sky had cleared up and there were several stars visible and at that moment I saw a group of white lights in formation flying almost directly overhead from the East to the West.  The size of the lights were approx. half the size of a dime held at arm's length.  The formation did not vary whatsoever and the speed was similar to the landing approach speed of a commercial aircraft.  The sighting lasted 3-5 seconds and then disappeared in an instant.  The visual quality of the lights had an artificial character to them and there was no sound whatsoever. I live within sight of Navel Station Everett where the aircraft carrier Nimitz is home based, though it is currently out of port.  The lights appeared to fly directly over the navy base.   I also live near Paine Field which is used by Boeing to test planes.  The Boeing facility builds the 747 in what is known as the worlds largest building in terms of cubic feet of interior space.  It can hold several 747 aircraft at a time.  This was my first Unidentified Flying Object sighting.

I watched them just disappear… almost like you’d see a satellite in the sky, but these 3 stayed together.    I tried to “de-bunk” what I saw by looking at the placement of the planets and stars at this particular time that night and there was nothing that would have been in my view at that particular time that would have formed this triangle, let alone the movement.

I saw the most amazing thing this morning sometime between 3:30-4:30 am.  I work as a security guard on the back side of big mountain in Va.  I was driving making rounds this morning when I saw several airplanes in the area.   The sky was clear and beautiful and i'm pretty sure that I could even see Jupiter just to the left of the brightest star in the sky which we call the north star but I know is incorrect.  I then noticed more airplanes in the area and that two of the planes were flying really close together.   Approximately 5-8 minutes later I saw what looked like a small star slowly moving in the sky.  I continued watching and even backed my car up about 30 yards to make sure I wasn't mistaken.  The thing was slow moving.  I waited about five minutes and drove on down the road to watch it some more.  In front of my eyes it just disappeared.   I immediately saw two planes headed in the direction of the thing.  I then turned around and was headed back to my post when I saw a shooting star out the drivers side window.   Maybe two seconds later the shooting star came back and up toward space.   I became excited because I knew without a doubt that I had just witnessed something that could move faster than anything I have ever heard of!   I continued on to my post in amazement and waited for my relief to show up.   I then left work just a little after 5 am and was on the same road when the thing that looked like a small glowing star appeared in the sky again.  This time in a totally different place. Within seconds my amazement went to total fear.  This thing took across the sky and suddenly stoped again. 3 seconds later, the thing took off again went straight and then up and into space I guess! I came straight home and woke my wife and kids up because I was scared.   I have always kept an open mind when it comes to the possibility of other life out there somewhere but I have never believed the stuff I have seen or heard about UFO sightings! Maybe this was just something we have now but I'm afraid it's not.   There were at least 5 to 6 airplanes in this area during this sighting.   All I can say is it was bright and maybe oval.  It was white and that is all!  I could see no other color.   Witnessing this has really opened my eyes.

I looked up from my computer to look at the window that is above the kitchen sink facing towards the street and I saw a bunch of yellow lights.  I was curious at first, then I saw the outline of a saucer.  The object was moving slowly right, soon it would be out of my vision due to the window ending.   I scrambled to my feet to try to get a picture of it via my iPad, but it had moved on, trees blocking the shot.  I sat back down to tell those I know about it before it happened once more, about half an hour later.  I managed to get a picture in which it looked like a tiny blip, the neighbors' porch light taking the attention of the picture however, as the neighbors' lamp itself looked like a ball of light.  I told my mother about what I saw and she got up and opened the front door to look, and she said that she saw an outline of something over Lake Michigan.  I went back to what I was doing, until it happened again today, 2/11/16.   As of this moment, it has only happened once, and it was around the general time of the first sighting.  I was unable to get a good picture again, but I'm waiting for it to come by again like it did on the 7th. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Gentlemen: I have no time for joking or lying as I am 74 years old now. And I have to say this before I go to my grave.  So people will find out what happened in 1947.  I don’t remember what month it was but it was like maybe in the spring. When I was a young  boy in 1947. I remember me and another boy sitting next to a wire fence outside, next to the street.  It was a clear night sky and we could see the stars that night. When he suddenly said, “The stars are moving, look up.“ I looked up and saw that the stars were not moving as he had said. What I saw, was a real bright fire ball moving from one star to another and stay there in that star. And then he said, “Look, there is another one moving.""  There were more fire balls moving to other stars in different directions as well, but not crisscrossing  and it only took less than a minute for the fire balls to reach other stars.  We observed this happening for about ten minutes.   Now, you tell me how far it is from one star to another, probably millions of miles, I would guess, I will leave that up to the experts. Now I have seen many people report ufo’s in the sky, but in space, and in 1947?  Were there any rockets traveling that far then?  Then I thought to myself, “Well tomorrow we will find out more about this, when people looking up with their telescopes will report what they saw that night.“  But nothing happened.  I never saw any reports like that and nothing on the radio either. I have been trying to tell this story for a long time, but who will believe me?  And also, I have never known where to report it, till now. I hope people will believe me and pass this story along to other people who might wonder what is up there and possibly coming to earth as ufo’s.  To me, this a hell of a story, just because of the travel time the fire balls took to reach other stars. Thanks for listening!

Myself and my two roommates were sitting on our front porch, when I saw what i thought was a star at first.  It started swaying back and forth from side to side slowly.  As it got closer to the ground it quit swaying, and my roommates noticed what ever it was flying directly towards us from straight ahead of us but up in the sky.  As it got close enough for us to hear the flying craft, we could hear a high pitch turbine engine sound radiating from the craft that came to a complete stop above my neighbors house in the middle of the night.  My roommates and I all stood and I asked if they saw that thing too.  They said yes.   The craft was obviously as interested in us as we were of it.  I looked around at my other neighbors houses to see if anybody was coming out to see what this loud noise was coming from this craft now hovering motionless above my neighbors house.  Nobody came out.  We all three started walking to our driveway and out to the street.  As we did that ,th! e craft became silent and I could not hear any noise.  We all three kept our eyes glued to the mysterious craft that just floated down from the dark sky.  As we walked towards the street , the craft came towards us but parallel so that we didn't end up directly underneath it when we met in the middle of the street.  The craft then hovered silently about 15 feet above us and ten feet away so weren't directly underneath it.  We all three staired at the hovering craft for what seems like a long time and I felt tired, but only about 13 min passed.  All three of us seemed to be in a trance like state staring at the craft as it started to float silently away from us down our street at the same altitude it was checking us out at.  Whoever was piloting the craft that was about half as big as my neighbors house, that it first hovered over, was just as curious about us as we were about this craft.  We watched it float away down our street after what felt like hours, but almost no time had! passed.  The craft made it about 3/4 of the way down the street and then made a degree of a turn over 90° smooth fluidly and effortlessly back towards where it originally flew down from up with all the stars.  It flew as effortlessly and slow going back up that it did coming down.  Except it flew in more of a straight pattern going back up.  When it was to small to distinguish the craft from a star I blinked and looked around my street ,sighing when I realized nobody was watching us.  Then I noticed my roommates were still in a trance staring at the sky in the middle of our street at 2:30 in the morning.  Then I said hey guys let's get out of the street before someone thinks we're crazy or something.  The craft did not have bright lights emanating from the bottom, but it did have some lights flashing colors in the fusilage area that sat in the middle of the saucer craft.  I have never seen or experienced this kind of thing before or after in my entire life.  As the craft was flying away slowly like it didn't have a care in the world, I thought to myself how insignificant we really are and those things can do what they want and we probly can't stop them.  When then craft was observing us close I could have hit it with a rock it was so close.  The air had a strange smell also while it was close. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Lauderdale Beach I was at Fort Lauderdale Beach with four of my friends, around 11 P.M., on February 12, 2016.  In the sky there was a lot of bright stars and what we thought was a planet.  This “planet” gave off a light light that was shining so bright the surface of the ocean lit up.  There also seemed to be a large amount of incoming planes from over the horizon, which were also reflecting light off the water.  (Airplanes do not have lights that bright.) More “planes” kept coming and they kept getting lower. 	We soon realized that these were ships morphing into and disguising as our crafts. We could see it happening.  All of the lights began coming closer and brighter.  I saw the light that looked like a planet come from high in the sky to low and it slowly moved towards us.  Once it got close, it looked like a huge military ship, but it was translucent.  It gave off both blueish and redish glows.  Within the huge ship were several small light beings that seemed to control the ship.  They got so close that the ship was coming onto the sand.  We receded back to the parking lot and it kept coming closer. It remained hovering stationary for about 15-20 minutes. 	This being was within 10 feet of us.  We didn’t know what to do and we were all trying to process what we were seeing.  I was really worked up and excited. When I left, I felt like the beings had contacted me telepathically (but I can’t speak for the others).  I didn’t hear a voice, but it was like my brain received a message.  I knew that the thoughts I had about the way they felt came right from them. They told me they had the power to do ANYTHING and they are invincible.  They are light beings making contact with us because we attracted them to us.  They came in peace and I left with feelings of euphoria.",2016-02-19T00:00:00,26.136914681280647,-80.21914075569657

I then noticed one of the bright stars was moving in a straight line from the southwest toward the northeast.  I assumed it must be the space station or a very bright satellite, as it continued in the sky directly overhead and for several minutes remained visible never deviating from it’s course until it finally disappeared to the northeast.   I have a program that identifies satellites and other objects in the night sky so I went in and got on the computer to identify what it was I had just seen.

Looking just over my left shoulder as I scanned the mostly clear sky, I suddenly witnessed a very unusual object streak by just over the treetops (an altitude of only about 50 - 60 ft.)  It was traveling in straight level line at about the speed of a fast moving bird (40 mph?) while throwing off a trail of sparks.  It was in my view for only about 2 or 3 seconds and disappeared over the houses and trees.  The object itself was not visible, only electric sparks emanating from a thin line probably about a foot or so long. There was no smoke, odor or sound. It looked very much like a 4th of July sparkler shooting through the air like a missile or an arrow, very similar in size, shape and intensity.  Another comparison would be to the tracers they shoot off with fireworks.  The difference was in the trajectory.  This thing moved like it was under its own power and headed somewhere with a purpose.  It wasn’t ascending, descending, or decelerating as one would expect if it was a bottle rocket or some other kind of model rocket or firework and it didn’t explode with a bang.  Also, if it was something like that, I can’t understand how someone could be in a position to direct it along such a horizontal line of flight. Another explanation would be some highly unusual atmospheric effect, but even with sparks flying, it wasn’t high voltage lighting.  It was a calm breezy evening with clear skies except for a few puffy clouds here and there, no charged feeling like we get when thunderstorms roll through.  There were no power lines or street light wires anywhere nearby.    As I continued home, I had that feeling of static electricity running up my back and the hairs of my neck standing on end.

The larger light was hanging just over the treetops in this photo and it is where we saw it each time, except for the first time when it was directly over my daughters rental home.   All of the info has been posted on this site and there also is a report that was posted as having happened in 2001, but it was in 2010.",2015-11-19T00:00:00,37.6357,-79.0982

This morning at around 5:25 a.m., I went outside to my front yard to walk my little dog.  As I walked out from my porch, I looked up at the sky as there was a clear spot with huge stars.  I looked over to the East to look at the Moon, when one of the stars in that cluster to the west caught my eye, it started moving, silently.   I quickly looked back and was astounded to see that one of the huge stars on the perimeter of the little formation started moving north slowly, and deliberately, across the sky.  It was not twinkling or changing colors, just a huge ball of light that looked exactly like a star. I stood there in wonder and continued to watch it.  After a few minutes it got closer to what looked like a tiny star and they twinkled at each other as the big one passed the little one.  This was just astounding!  I continued to watch the big star travel across the sky until it disappeared behind a large, fluffy cloud. I wanted to go inside and get my husband, but I knew if I turned away it would be gone. I have seen UFO's before, and one time in 2009 we had a shared family sighting of a large triangle craft in Fort Lauderdale, but I have never reported anything before.   I also had a strange experience about a month ago while working in Texas, I woke up with a strange triangle mark made of lines on my hand.  I do have a very clear picture of this mark. I would love to talk to an investigator, as I have a lot of contact with UFO's and other paranormal experiences.

The object was, according to me about 4 football fields long, and maybe .75 football fields tall. I was driving and when I saw it, I said to my partner, ""Did you see that?""  And my partner replied, ""No, what did you see?""  at that time, like I said I was on the I-17 and someone was passing on my left side, I noticed in their vehicle that the driver was reacting the same way I was.  The drive was pointing and interacting to the passenger.  I then pointed to them and said to my passenger, ""Look, they saw it, their pointing to where the object was.""  On all the ufo shows I've seen, I haven't seen any that showed one as huge as the one I saw.   Because of this sight, I do believe in dimension.  Because I did not see the object zip away.  It just vanished and for an object that huge that was the only thing it could do.  Have you ever looked at a video and put it in slow motion, you will see the regular house hold lights dimming and illuminating at a rate (60 HZ).

I was round his house, it was the suburbs of Northwest Greater London.  At night, these two UFO things appear in the sky and all the neighbours come outside to have a look.  Two of these bright, oddly shaped things just hovering very still in the sky.  Then all of a sudden they start moving in circles before eventually shooting off out of view very quickly. It was removed from online media and newspapers very quickly and I even heard that the local houses were visited by authorities discouraging people from discussing it online etc. Although I can't vouch for that last part as I wasn't there.

She must have watched it for 10 minutes, until it was gliding directly over the top of our house . That's when she ran through the house from the back door to the front,  seeing me sitting on the couch watching the news, she yelled to follow her out the front door.  So when I stepped out onto the front porch, I immediately seen the craft floating over our house in a SW to NE direction . We watched it for approximately 10 minutes until it was out of sight.  I estimate it was 300 yards down each side in a triangle shape with 4 sharp red lights marking its size.  I would say 3500 feet in the sky, 5 minutes after it passed a passenger plane flew by for a landing at the Nashville airport which is 25 miles away to give me a reference; the jet was a little higher , say 5000-5500 ft  . The ufo was totally silent, and stayed on its path.  I have experienced missing time , congealed blood in the ear, reddish toothpick things under both mine and my wive's toenails in the past.  When I told a UFO investigator about this, he said it was no accident that the craft went over our house the way it did. Neither of us experienced missing time during that event at all, but it does give you the creeps when you think that you have no control at all over your own body, but someone else does.

The back of my house faces approximately south.  Due east and approximately one mile from my home is the Niagara falls airbase and international airport.  So it's not unusual to see a large commercial passenger plane at a low altitude on a landing run over my back yard, heading due east.  In perspective to its height, if I  where to hold my hands up and follow on both ends of the plane it looked to be about two feet long.   As it approached directly over head I noticed another object  approaching from a slight southeast direction, and they appeared to pass one another, the second object to the southern side of the passenger plane, from my perspective they looked to be equal in size, only this new object was a little blurry or hazy, as if it was actually much higher and the haze was a result of the gases in the higher atmosphere which means this t! hing was either much larger than the plane or, if it was gases, magnified by them.  The sound of the landing plane was clearly audible and the sound stayed with the movement of the plane, it was definitely low enough that the sound of it's turbines didn't trail behind it.  But, as this other object passed the plane, I followed it until it passed over the corner of my home on it's north, slightly northwest trajectory.  I observed it was moving a little bit faster than the descending speed of the plane, it had absolutely no wings or protrusions, in made absolutely no sound and it was lined with maybe 4 to 7 lights that appeared to be pulsating very brightly in shades of red and green, but because it appeared to by in a haze, almost like peering through a wave of heat that rises off of black top, any detail other than the lights and outline where not distinguishable. I can only speculate what this was but I have two theories.  One is that it was hazy because of its height and is ! actually enormous or not quite so large and amplified by the magnifyin g properties of gases. Second the blurry affects are from a malfunctioning cloaking apparatus, and the lack of sound or wings or afterburner means it may have been an antigravity vehicle. These are not my pictures or video, but for reference purposes I have included them.  The object in the video looks like it's actually reflecting light, the lights on what I saw where consistent. This is what I saw only more hazy and larger.

Photo M 5/20, obtained 6 seconds after the series of photos was triggered, reveals a clear photo of a UFO.  Neither UFO is seen in photo number 6, recorded approximately 1 second later.

Bright multi-color flashing orb saw in the sky making slow and fast maneuvers from left-right horizontal too vertical maneuvers easily.,Florence,AL,2015-11-04T22:15:00,light,>30 minutes,"Occurred : 11/4/2015 22:15  (Entered as : 11/04/2015 22:15) Reported: 11/7/2015 10:47:02 AM 10:47 Posted: 11/19/2015 Location: Florence, AL Shape: Light Duration:>30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/123/S123540.html,"Bright multi-color flashing orb saw in the sky making slow and fast maneuvers from left-right horizontal too vertical maneuvers easily. The first sighting was approximately two months prior to the sighting I am posting about now from this last Wednesday (11-4-15) at exactly 2:50 a.m.  I am a Private Investigator my late twenties and work crazy long hours so needless to say I was asleep on the couch when my Fiancée woke me up in a frightened state saying that she just observed something unexplainable in the sky upon walking outside to have a smoke.  I immediately walked outside and much to my surprise there it was.  Distance, size and altitude were obviously impossible to determine due to it being far up in the sky.  However, I can say with certainty that it was large and was at a far distance from my position in the field behind my residence.  This object was absolutely silent and the only observable features about it was that it was a bright glowing white orb (I refer to it as an Orb because it appeared this way from the constant bright light.  I don’t  know if it was a craft or what) with what a! ppeared to be flashing lights of blue red green and yellow (however this was just observation by the naked eye and could have been a larger or a smaller spectrum of colors).  It is hard to say if the changing “flash’s” of different colors was from a spinning movement around the center of it was flashing from the center like a strobe.   I want to point out that while this specific experience I am speaking about is from me and my Fiancée’s first experience from two months prior, both experience’s had the exact same type movements that I am about to describe.  The main difference is that the first sighting was at approximately 2:50 a.m. and the most recent sighting was at 10:15 p.m. and BOTH SIGHTINGS HAPPENED IN THE SAME LOCATION IN THE SKY.  It helped me out that I had the same two tall trees in my field to use as landmarks while looking up in the sky and allowed us to be able to tell that the objects maneuvers were actually being done and that it was just a trick to our eyes.  The object’s maneuvers are what really took us by surprise in th! at it changed in speed at random while going from a hovering position to suddenly darting to the left or right.  Also it made circular flying motions as well as moving from a stationary hover to the left then suddenly making nearly a 90° turn and going vertical.  All of these types of maneuvers were observed many times and at multiple patterns  (Such as darting to the right then shooting straight up all while never changing speed, or while flying in one direction suddenly maneuvering into making an almost perfect circle in the sky)  I do not feel that this was a standard aircraft of any kind as it showed no lighting like any citizen passenger or military aircraft I have ever observed. It also did not appear to be moving farther away from our position or so much closer either as its size should have decreased or increased as it flew away or flew closer to us.  All of the patterns and sudden changes in speed were observed in a relatively local area in the sky for a very long period of time.  At the end of the sighting on the first night, we observed the orb as it ended up flying down out of the local area where it had seemed to hang around and appeared at this point to start flying away from us towards the horizon.  However while it was still easily observable in the atmosphere, it seemed to us as if it almost blinked out of existence.  The most recent sighting we never witnessed when or how it departed due to both of us having to call it a night and go to bed due to having to be up early for work the next morning.  While observing this anomaly on both nights, I first grabbed the first thing with a camera which was my Galaxy S5 with a 16 mp high definition camera in it.  While I know that this isn’t super great camera wise, I thought just maybe since this orb is illuminated so well it would pick it up. However, I was wrong.  So I can to one of my gear bags I have for my job and just grabbed the first handheld camcorder I could find and it was my Samsung camcorder ! which isn’t anything fancy just a 32x zoom but usually has don! e me alr ight even in most low light scenarios.  And again seeing how illuminated this object was I thought surely it would pick it up at least somewhat.  But no.  I am just hoping that someone else could have observed this event near me. I do want to put out that being the I live in the very northwest part of AL, this object easily in my opinion was hovering and doing these crazy maneuvers over the state of TN or MS.  I know MS has an Air Force Base however the only one that comes to mind right off is a bit south of where this orb would have been flying over. So anyone who can help me out here explaining this please don’t hesitate to contact me.",2015-11-19T00:00:00,34.8469594117647,-87.69097411764706

On November 6th, 2015, from 5:00 to 6:10 PM, I was on a Southwest flight from Manchester Airport in NH to Baltimore Washington International Airport.  The plane’s cruising altitude was 34,000 feet.  The sky was clear and stars were visible but far below there was a blanket of clouds with some breaks through which I could see cities.  I saw dozens of red pulsating objects far below the plane, perhaps three miles below.  At any one time I could see five to ten ufos over a wide area.  They seemed to be at about the same altitude and were almost all traveling in a line in a north/northeasterly direction above the low cloud cover.  This continued for about forty minutes of the flight.  The objects were red and pulsating but some flashed a bright white before going back to pulsating red.  Some blinked off at times but came back on. Some of the objects seemed to stay in place while others traveled by.  A couple of times it seemed as it there was going to be a joining or collision of two or three of the objects.  My cell phone was in the bin overhead because I had taken a front row seat and didn’t think to keep it out so instead I focused on watching the objects.  I am guessing that these objects were at least a mile or maybe two miles to the east of the plane and maybe three miles below.  It is hard for me to estimate this.  From my perspective they appeared to be about the same size, about an eighth of an inch in diameter as I held my fingers up to the window.  They were all spherical shaped. As the plane was descending I saw one very bright white light in the distance.  This was not like the other objects.  At first it was about a half dollar size as I held my fingers up to my window but it was distant at that point. It was not pulsating at all, it was just a steady bright white light.  It was not far below the plane like the other objects but was flying straight towards us at about the same altitude as our plane.  I could not make out any shape because of the brightness of the light.  As the light continued to get closer to the plane, I asked the woman sitting next to me to look out the window.  She saw it, too.  I made a comment that no plane should be traveling directly toward us.  There were no blinking lights that planes have on their wings; it was just a very bright light.  I think it was about two minutes that I watched this light.  Then the plane swerved to the right suddenly, about a 45 degree turn toward the west. The plane banked slightly to make this turn and I lost sight of the object for a short time.  Then the plane leveled off and I saw it off and moving behind the left wing. I think it was closer than half a football field.  It continued past the wing and I lost sight of it for good when it disappeared from my view behind the tail section.  The plane continued descending through the dense cloud layer and touched down within five to ten minutes of that last sighting.  When we broke through the clouds/fog, we were so close to the runway, maybe a hundred feet off the ground.  The fog was so low and dense that nothing was visible in the sky from the ground.   I’m still trying to make sense of what I saw.  I wanted to ask the pilot, copilot, and FAA inspector, all of who had to see what I was seeing but I didn’t.  It would have meant holding up everyone on the plane and I didn’t think I would be given any information anyway.   I am hoping that one of the three pilots on board will look for this or another report for that Southwest flight on November 6th, 2015, and maybe file their own reports.",2015-11-19T00:00:00,,

This object was reported by another pilot from another airline on the frequency in use. The object appeared to remain stationary for 2-3 minutes, surrounded in blue haze.  The surrounding stars were clear.  There were no high level clouds.  The object then moved  in a southerly direction, appearing to accelerate before turning onto an easterly direction.  As it came close to overhead our position, the object momentarily increased in light intensity, then disappeared from view. I reported the sighting on a pirep (pilot report) frequency.  I got a response from a southbound airliner, at the Fukuoka/Incheon airspace boundary who saw the same object on an easterly track.  He reported that it was his second sighting. I estimate the altitude of this object to be in excess of 60,000ft.  The sky was dark, approximately 1 hr or so after evening civil twighlight.  There were no high level clouds the night sky, and the intensity of the light was the same as what you would see when Venus is in its lower levels on the horizon. The only possible explanation I have is that it was the ISS, but according to NASA website, its track should have been further to the west of our location, at that time. Do you have someone who can confirm the exact position of ISS at the given time?  Do you have any idea what we may have seen?  I am happy to provide further details, but would rather investigate sensible explanations before making a false claim. Look forward to hearing your thoughts.

The craft was larger than an airplane, had a defined shape to the nose and leading edges  of the narrow straight shape. The altitude was hard to determine (but an educated guess is between 3,000' and 5.000') due to the nature of the semi cloaked image. The speed at which this object was moving was very quick at approx. 25 MPH in a motionless, windless sky! The direction was from the Gulf of Mexico or NW of my position and moved in a straight line towards the SE or the Everglades and South of Miami. The object showed no lights or propulsion system but did glide silently and with a clear determined direction. I am a trained observer and have viewed several AF or Navy aircraft operating in our area over the Gulf waters. I have reported these sightings to Mufon and to Filer's Files and have matched perfectly other sightings with testimony and photos with other observers at different times up to 2 years apart. There seems to be Ion thruster types, plasma powered types Vasimr rocket types and cloaking exercises with short contrails during the last minutes of the sunset over the water here. Reports year after year of similar reports are ignored by Mufon. It is apparent that the Black Budget folks operate over SW Florida all of the time.

((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD)) I was driving down N. Chrisman Road toward the Tracy Defense Depot a little after 6 p.m. on Nov. 7. I saw three white lights in the night sky configured in a triangle.  They looked like an airplane.  There were other lights from airplanes in the sky, except there was a powerful cone of light shooting down toward the ground from these three lights. I thought maybe I was watching a police or military helicopter searching for something on the ground. Inside the cone of light were blue and green beams that looked like maybe they were from a powerful spotlight.  The beams were tracking the three lights and I couldn't tell if the beams were from spotlights on the ground or being beamed down from the lights. I could see lights from what looked like an airliner in front of the three lights and I thought maybe the airliner was towing some kind of device with a powerful spotlight on it. Except the three lights kept going higher and higher in the sky as the airliner flew! west toward the Bay Area. I pulled over in the dirt on W. Schulte Road before the depot. The sky was glowing green where I had first seen the three lights over the depot, except the three lights were high in the distance now headed up and to the west. They now looked like a single star like the other stars in the sky, except a faint cone of light was shooting down from it almost looking like a comet. My phone couldn't get a picture and the lights were fading higher and higher. The green glow in the clouds was still there to the south over Tracy. I tried to keep my eyes on the lights as I entered town but they disappeared in the sky behind the city lights. First time in my life I have ever seen anything like it.

At 10pm last night, 2/18/16, I observed two points of light jumping around a small portion of the sky.  A red light at 2:00 o'clock and a white light at 8 o'clock if we use the clock face illustration.  When I first focused my binoculars on them they immediately exchanged positions -the red went to the 8 o'clock position and the white to the 2:00 position.  Then they began do jump back and forth like for 30 to 45 seconds.  I could not tell if the moved between the intervening spaces or if they disappeared and re-appeared.  It was happening too fast to adjust my eyesight.  At one point the white light seemed to the circle the clock face.  I had to look away after 45 sec or so because it was straining my eyes.  I couldn't track one light without it becoming the other, but they seemed to return those same clock positions, and pause for a second or two.  This was the ultimate in watching erratic lights in the sky.  I don't know what the point of this activity would be, other than to attract attention and ""show off"".  I looked away again and looked back and the red light seemed to be lower in the sky, and the white light was higher, as if the clock face moved 15 degrees higher in the sky.  I went back and forth to the window for about twenty minutes and the 2 lights were still there, but ""dancing"" more slowly at the end.  I stopped watching before they disappeared.  Up to last night I had only witnessed white lights like this--the color red was new to my skywatching.  I had the ""feeling"" I would see something in the sky last night when at around 6pm,  I looked outside and saw it was a clear sky.

The sky was already dark as sunset in Los Angeles was at 4:55pm.  I happened to look to the west when I saw a bright white light. The object was approximately 50 degrees above the southwest horizon.   Emanating from the point of white light was an area of illumination resembling a cone, with the tip of the cone at the light and the bottom part of the cone shining to the east toward me.  The cone of diffuse light was approximately 10 degrees in length.  This cone shaped area of illumination seemed to consist of light reflecting off air particles, similar to the way a flashlight shows a shaft of light when shined into a dusty sky.   There was no noise associated with the light.  The object and its cone-shaped shaft of light remained stationary for a minute or two.  Then the object moved to the north very slowly until it was due west of me.  Behind the white light (extending south of the light) appeared an area of blue glow approximately 10 degrees in diameter.  The area of blue glow was diffuse and somewhat oval shaped, like a diffuse cloud.  The blue glow was pronounced at first, but slowly began to grow dim.  At this point the white cone-shaped shaft of light that had been emanating from the white point of light had disappeared.  The white point of light grew dim but still traveled northward very slowly.   The diffuse, dim blue “cloud” remained for approximately 10 minutes and then gradually faded.   The white point of light also faded away as it traveled slowly in a northward direction.  This may have been a rocket launch from Vandenberg Air Force base north of Los Angeles.  However, I am not sure and so decided to issue this report.  I have witnessed a few Vandenberg rocket launches from Los Angeles in the past.   This object, whatever it was, looked nothing like those previous launches. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD))",2015-11-19T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

He told us of the procedures he took contacting Naval base, which in turn investigated the incident with U.S. military particularly the Air Force, also including the Capital.  He said the report back was that it was no military or commercial plane of any country.  The Captain also noted that our ship had it on radar.  He told us where it was in the sky in relation to the ship and that it appeared as a very large red light.  We all observed it.

We watched  two large grey and beige disk or spherical objects fly across the sky from southeast to northwest.  They had no markings or lights and left no contrails.  Their color seemed to shift from beige or khaki to battleship grey when they neared and flew through the clouds.   They must've been very large, because they appeared to be about the size of my outstretched index fingernail from a distance of several miles and at an altitude about midway among the distant large cumulus clouds which they flew through.  They flew at a constant speed, in a tandem formation with the lower one slightly ahead.  They never varied their speed or direction.   I think they must've been travelling at around the speed of a commerical jet airliner because they covered the distance from southeast of Vacaville in Solano County to near Mt.

We also seen planes and helicopters flying by at that moment so we know it was NOT a plane or helicopter.  This was like no object I have ever seen in my entire life.

PD)) Driving on I-5 South, south west of Chico CA two of us observed what at first looked like a helicopter facing east shining a spot beam across the sky (not pointing down). There was a very distinct blue cylinder of light emanating from a bright white light which had crisp lines as if it was perfectly uniform in width, it extended a few degrees of azimuth across the sky. Additionally there was a smaller but much wider cone of whitish light emanating in the same direction. However this object was way too high to be a helicopter. The helicopter comparison would seem logical if the object was 100 or 1000 times closer.  We stared at this object for what felt like a few minutes discussing what it could be. During this time it became obvious that is not a helicopter and not static as it seemed. Then we noticed the object was moving west and the white light in the shape of a cone moved with it, the blue light column was still there pointing east (not at the ground). At this point it looked like the bright spot of light was the rear of the object and the cone seemed to be the effect as the object moved, kind of like a wake. This conical wake was impossibly big though.  As we drove the object moved an extremely long distance West or WSW. The crisp cylinder of blue light appeared to smear and slowly fade over a few more minutes. During this time we could see the cone of light remain while the bright light of the object continued west. As it moved, narrower cones were created. While we were still looking at the blue light cylinder (now smeared, no more distinct lines) we commented how it was blue. I traced the object west and we saw two pickup trucks pulled over on the side of the road liking in the same direction as the event with their phones out.  Eventually you could trace the object until it was extremely far away. At this point a fainter cone of light was behind it and looked to pointing up.  To better clarify, the blue cylinder looked like a very bright light until it dissipated 5 minutes after it showed up, the conical ""light"" seemed to not really be light. A good analogy would be that space craft reentry vehicle having a large cone of disturbance behind it, however it would have been impossibly large as the object was so far away.

((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.

As the light moved across the sky left to right, all of a sudden, and very quickly, a large white bright tail in the shape of a fan formed.  The fan shape was in a horizontal position and not vertical as one might see from a rocket.  The fan dissipated rather quickly as the object continued across the sky in a northerly direction. As the fan dissipated, there was a distinct blue/green color that remained in the sky for quite a while as the object continued in the apparent northerly direction.  Then as the object was almost directly west from my location it appeared to lose intensity as if it was going away from me.  I rushed into the house and grabbed my binoculars to see if I could get a better view as it was growing dimmer.  As I focused on the object, it appeared to be a circular shape with no real defining marks, and steel g! ray in color.  The color may have been affected by the haze around the object and that it was starting to get dimmer.  However, it did appear to be alternating in brightness intensity that was discernable through the binoculars.  The light continued to dim, again as if it was moving away from my location, and within 20/30 seconds the circular shape was no longer visible.  The barely visible light then had “light tails” above and below the object, not behind, until it was no longer visible.  The entire “show” lasted until about 6:20, and there was only one object as far as I could determine.   However, the blue/green color in the sky noted above lasted for another 10 minutes or so, and didn’t seem to move from the location where I first noticed it.  Our house is in the flight path of planes landing at the Orange County Airport, and there were also several helicopters in the sky at the time.  I’m sure some of them had to see this as well.

But I feel the need to put it out there. Either late July or early August 1980 just outside of Nevada City, California.  I’m 15 years old and at summer camp.  I’ve recently been sick and due to this fact I’m stuck at the camp with the other campers who were sick as the rest of the camp heads out for overnight horseback riding, water skiing and other activities. So there are 6 or 7 people there.  I don’t remember the exact number, due to time and a real desire to forget that night completely.  Snow Mountain Camp is a rich kid camp in the Sierra foothills just northwest of Nevada City.  The camp itself is well spread out with 6 cabins a pool two arenas for horseback riding a barn and dining hall and two houses 1 that the counselors use when on break and the other that the camp owners live in. I was occupying one of the lower cabins that was situated in a gully on the other side of a hill from the house were the counselors were.  I was the oldest boy in the cabin and we were doing typical camp stuff, ghost stories from a Steven King collection.  Lights out was at either 10:30 or 11:00 and we continued reading for another 30 minutes or so with flashlight after lights out. It was soon after we stopped reading that the event happen.  I call it an event because I can’t think of any other way to describe it.  I had put my flashlight up because I was ready to sleep, when the cabin was enveloped with what I later described as white noise.  It was debilitating and we were all screaming at the top of our lungs.  I remember visions of mathematical equations and that another of the boys said he saw musical notes and that another said he saw something resembling hieroglyphs.  This went on for around 30 seconds then silence and the cabin was filled with the most vile smell I’ve ever smelled.  We stood there for a moment or two when one of the other boys pointed at my flashlight which I had placed in the center of the room out with the beam facing up and it was on. At this point we all freak and run up the gully down the hill to the house where the counselors were.  We tell them our story and one starts to ignore us when the other takes my pulse.  Now we’ve been with them for a good ten minutes and my heart is still racing.  After checking a couple more they decide to come back and investigate. We get back to the cabin and there is a faint trace of the smell and my flashlight is still there still on almost dead now but still on.  We tell them that there is no way we are staying in that cabin and ask to move up to the cabin by where the 3 girls who were still there were.  We were likely safety in numbers. They let us and I don’t think we slept at all that night. But it was morning at the dining hall that things got weird.  1 of the girls who was up the hill from our cabin asked us if we saw it.  And we were like saw what?  And she described an object that resembled an old bowler hat that hovered over the area of our cabin for close to 30 minutes.  I almost vomited and the other boys turned ghost white and didn’t want to talk about it.  We begged her to tell us that it was a bad prank that the counselors had put her up to it, and she said she didn’t know what we were talking about. I am very aware of time because of that day.  What we experienced lasted maybe 30 seconds yet she said she saw it for close to 30 minutes. I know that something happened that day and I want to know if anyone else had had a similar experience and who do I talk to too get answers.

This beam looked similar to a helicopter's search light, but was more narrow and did not reach the ground. A larger “dot” was above a smaller one and it was a glowing white. The smaller dot below it, was slightly to the left (east) of the larger one, and was blinking. My husband saw it as glowing red and I saw it as white. There was a beam of light between them that looked like either the upper dot was sending the beam to the lower one, or visa versa. We began to comment on what we had seen and then noticed that the beam was gone (we did not see it disappear) and that the lower, smaller dot was moving away, slowly, to the east.

Around 7.30 pm on a warm, clear summer night in the late 1980s in a narrow street of small, Edwardian terraced houses in Harrow Road, Barking, Essex, England, I saw something very unusual.  Barking is just to the east of London.  This road is in a working class area with small two storey houses. My wife and I were seeing some friends off and were standing outside the house. The roads in the area are fairly narrow, approx 50 feet from the front of one house to the front of the house opposite.  Each house has a small front garden with a path about 10 ft long with a gate onto a pavement (sidewalk) about 6 ft wide. I was at the gate, facing the house and my wife and friends were facing the other way, and we were chatting to our friends.  As we did so there was strange hissing noise. I looked up and a glowing, bluey green sphere about 3-4 ft in diameter came over the roof of the house next door. It was a little higher than the chimneys.  I had a very clear view and there was no distinguishing marks, just sheer colour.  It was definitely not a balloon.  It glowed and the noise it made seemed electrical. it moved across the road, fairly quickly. It was a bit of a comedy moment because as I pointed to where it was my wife and friends turned to see it, but it had moved.  I followed it with my eyes as it sped over the road and went over the rooftops opposite.  As the others turned around it had just disappeared over the roofs. They did hear it, however.  I ran across to the other side of the road and down a side street to see where it had gone but it was out of sight. I think this was more likely to be some kind of unusual electrical phenomenon than a craft of any kind, although it was a ""UFO"".  The report on Coast to Coast of a similar thing being seen by a factory seemed identical.

I was awoken by my then partner (a staunch sceptic).  He was in a state and frantically gesturing for me to go outside and saying, ""You need to come outside and tell me what ((words deleted)) this is.""   I followed him out into our front yard and he pointed up above the opposing neighbour's home and asked me, ""What ((words deleted)) is that?""  In the sky, heading in an upward, vertical position was a perfect sphere about the size of a ping pong ball (perspective wise).   It was a pale, pastel luminous orange but in the 'centre' of the sphere was a pale blue movement, much like the movement inside a novelty electrostatic lamp. only it was a single bolt of 'electricity' which snaked upward and had small 'offshoots'.  At no time was the 'electricity' outside of the sphere.  The 'electricity' was slow moving and certainly beautiful to watch, but all the while the sphere was moving upward.  At no time did either of us hear anything.  It was completely silent. The sphere was approximately  one metre above (perspective wise) my opposing neighbour's one story home with tiled peaked roof, but my partner stated that when he went outside he saw it rising above the house, as if it was right behind it.  It was very difficult to judge distance, but we felt it was only three or four kilometres away. When my partner first saw it he said it was the size of a truck tyre, but later stated that he came and got me within a few seconds of first sighting it, and given that when I was watching it it was only reducing in size marginally I think it may have been quite a bit smaller than a truck tyre when he first sighted it. Over a period of approximately thirty minutes it continued to reduce in size, until the 'electricity' was no longer visible and eventually until the orange sphere resembled a white light.  It is very hard to determine how high in the sky it was at this point, however, it seemed to appear as though it was hitting the stratosphere and indeed as soon as it did so, it shot very rapidly in a western direction.   At this point it was becoming very small, but with a strained eye was still visible a good five minutes later, until it simply became too small to see anymore. I made an anonymous report to an Australian UFO hotline soon after the sighting, as theories in guarded conversations with family were that it could have been a gas ball, or a weather balloon, however, the hotline attendee seemed to discount both of those theories quite confidently.   I would be interested to see if there have been any other reports of a similar sighting, as I have never read about or heard of anyone reporting one, especially with the 'electricity'.   It may be that similar sightings of orange spheres were already too high in the atmosphere to see the blue 'electricity'.

My son originally spotted the object. My wife got a couple of good photos. The object appeared to e emit a cone-shaped plume of white illuminated material. There also appeared to be a lingering green beam of light behind the object. The green beam appeared to be about as wide as the full moon and very straight and consistent in its pale green color. The green beam persisted for several minutes and appeared to stretch toward the horizon behind the object. The white plume appeared to be illuminated and appeared to grow as the object proceeded toward the west/northwest in a straight line. After watching the objects and plume for more about a minute the plume suddenly cut off and the object continued to move ahead in a straight line. The plume expanded behind the object and appeared to be approximately 5+ degrees in width. One other witness and I continued to watch the object move toward the western horizon. After approximately 4 minutes the object appeared to brighten and become stationary. As we continued to watch, the object appeared to change directions, turning about 90 degrees to the left heading toward the southwest. iPhone photos will be submitted via email. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S.

In the sky to the south west we saw this amazingly white light shining down towards the earth from a ball of white light in the sky. It was traveling at jet aircraft speeds towards the north. The white light shining down went out from the point of light at an angle towards the ground and it expanded out in a very distinct come shape that had very clear edges to it. In the center of the cone of white light was a green stripe of light that glowed like radium and nearly the same color. The point of light emitted no sound and was traveling upwards from the earth. The cone of light itself began to come apart like a fog. The point of light was going higher and higher and made a turn to the west northwest.

While out in the backyard stargazing with a friend a very bright single light was seen approaching from the east at low altitude (approximately 2,000 feet ).  At first was thought to be an aircraft with its landing lights on.  This would be normal as it was passing over the local airport to the NE and operating under, well under, the flight path of air traffic departing or approaching MSP International Airport.  Proper procedure would be to have the landing lights on in this scenario. We had a pair of 125x astronomy binoculars and a pair of 12x24 zoom binoculars with us at the time this event was unfolding.  I trained the 12x24 power binoculars on the object and began to relay what I was observing to my partner.  I was expecting to hear and see an aircraft come into view with a jet or prop sound, navigation lights and have the landing light dim as the object passed just a mile or less to the north of our location.  None of this occurred.  I must emphasize that this light was very bright, and I feel safe in saying if it were any brighter it could have been very difficult to look at through the optics I was using. As the bright light passed over us at about 60 degrees azimuth North it made not a sound.  It never dimmed or changed in appearance.  There were no strobing lights or red and green navigation lights.  No structure was visible associated with the light but clearly and logically it must have been attached to something.  It briefly passed through the branches of a tree and continued on a steady constant speed and course to the East.  This is when things became even more baffling.  As it reached a point a mile or so East of us it stopped, grew in intensity, changed to a small dim rusty red colored dot, lost altitude in a straight downward decent, stopped, turned white again grew again in intensity turned again to a small rusty red dot and simply disappeared.  I was relaying all of this description to my partner as it was happening.  It left us baffled looking for an explanation as to what we had seen. As it turned out the event was not over.  We spotted another bright light coming from the same direction as the first light/object.  This light appeared different from the first and as I focused my binoculars on it I could clearly see three sets of lights.  Two bright outboard lights and one dimmer middle light.  It was clearly an aircraft and the sound of twin turbo props were audible.  This aircraft behaived exactly as expected: sound, strobes, red and green navigation lights.  Even the structure of the aircraft was visible.  The lights changed as expected when it passed.  Its flight path was the direction and altitude of the previous object.  It even passed through the tree branches very close to the same spot.  As this aircraft reached the approximate location where the first object had disappeared it made one and a quarter tight orbits and took on a Northern heading. I checked the landing light pattern of the second aircraft and found only one possible match.  A Canadian built Dehaviland Dash 8.  These are operated in this area by Air Canada, the US Air Force and the Office of Homeland Security.  The latter two using them as survalence aircraft.  I can in no way confirm who was operating either craft but can state with a high degree of certainty the second aircraft type.  Clearly the second craft was in trail of the first object either through purpose or as a coincidence. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It is so dark there that we can see planes, shooting stars, satellites, etc.  I was watching this area above a tree in our backyard because it was basically the same area I saw the shooting star a bit earlier.  As I was looking up I saw a big round light in the sky.  I noticed it because it was bright, and bigger than anything we see in the night sky.  It was in the sky north and slightly west from Copperopolis, in the distant sky. I was trying to figure out what it was, and I noticed it wasn't moving.  It looked as if it was a car headlight in the sky.  If you took a dime and held it at arm’s length it would have been about half as big as the dime.  It was much larger than a star, satellite, plane or shooting star, and brighter. I looked away for a second and then looked back and it was gone.  I looked thru the branches of the tree thinking maybe it had gone behind the tree, but I didn't see anything.  As I continued to look, now with my wife's help, all of the sudden in the same place it appeared again.  It was there for a several seconds and then it disappeared again.  It was as if someone turned a light switch on, paused, and then off. All of the sudden it came back on again.  It seemed to be in the same location. It was definitely in the sky, well up in the sky.  Then we saw a much smaller, dimmer light go on and off in the same location a couple times, and then the big light again.  My wife said it looked kind of like it had a short fat tail, not like a shooting star tail or trail, but I did not notice that. We continued to watch for it and saw it again a little higher in the sky than where we saw it before.  It disappeared once more and appeared again a little bit further south from where it was. That was the last we saw of it.  The whole thing lasted over 4-5 minutes before it disappeared. This by far did not match anything I have ever seen before.  It was much bigger, much brighter, did not have a specific path and stayed in a certain spot before moving.  When it did move it wasn't in a straight line.  It wasn't a helicopter, there was no noise, no flashing lights in any color like a plane or helicopter.  I can honestly say I could not identify it.",2016-01-05T00:00:00,37.9454,-120.66830000000002

I took the picture because the sky looked so ominous and strange that day.  But, upon later reflection of the photo I took that day, I noticed a small collection of lights in the background in the sky with a green tint.  Naturally, I zoomed in to get a better look only to find a classic ""UFO"" shape -- a circle formation made out of lights. Strangely, I was carpooling with a friend that day and she also took a picture of the dark-clouded sky.  We took pictures at the exact same time as marked by the date and time on our phones, but her photo does not capture the UFO.  I actually have two pictures taken at the same hour:minute.  One is a little more blurry because a car was driving in the distance, but, both of my photo's capture the unidentified object pretty clearly. Personally, I've never been one to believe in UFO's, though, I believe there is most definitely ""life"" outside of Earth.  For all I know, UFO's could be the government screwing with us.  I don't really know.  What I am certain of is that I didn't notice the object at the time the picture was taken -- I was too distracted by the sky.  Additionally, I didn't go back and look at the pictures I took until a month later when I noticed something tiny in the background.  To clear any misconceptions - I don't own photoshop or know how to use photoshop.  I'm sure there is enough technology out there to check and see if anything was added to a photo.  If such technology were to be used on my two photos of the object, it would appear they have not been tampered with in any way. Hope this report helps some UFO tracker out there!",2016-01-05T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

This particular shot was taken above the dunes and grassy area, facing south toward the inlet.  The photo was taken at approximately 3:00pm on a sunny and clear day.

The orb seemed to be traveling away from me, toward the east, at a distance of several miles from my position, approximately 20 degrees above the horizon. It traveled at the same rate a speed a satellite would.  This sighting lasted only about 30 seconds.  Later that night, after being dropped off by friends with whom we carpooled to the Christmas party, my girlfriend and I got into our car and headed north on Route 12, heading toward the city of Keene.  At the junction of Route 12 and Flat Roof Mill Road I noticed a bright orange orb hanging in the sky to the left of our position.  I pulled over to get a better look.  My girlfriend could not see the object from the passenger's side, so I pulled her over toward me until she could see it.  The orb was traveling south at a distance of perhaps a mile from our position, at an estimated altitude of 1,500-2,000 feet.  Estimated speed was 25-30 mph.  Looking at it through binoculars I could see that the orb had an aura about it, with a bright orange center. I was convinced at that point that what I was looking at was a Chinese lantern.  I put down the binoculars and continued to observe it as it made a slow change of direction, away from us, heading now west.   The turn continued until now th! e object was traveling north, and nearly at twice the distance at which we first observed it.  The maneuver lasted about one minute. It was now heading north, against the prevailing breeze.  After watching it travel for another minute or so, it vanished abruptly. Were it not for the fact that the object changed direction, I would not be reporting this sighting, nor the one from earlier that evening.  Having myself investigated independently the UFO phenomenon for over 30 years on two continents, I've become a bit of a skeptic, and am convinced that a great number of sightings are the result of misidentification.  The meteorological conditions that evening were clear, with a light north-south breeze. This is the third time I've observed orange orbs transiting the sky in this region: the first time was two years ago, at approximately 3am.  This orb moved faster, at an estimated speed of 80-100 mph, at an estimated altitude of 5,000 feet, traveling east to west, at a distance of approximately five miles from my vantage point.  Said observation was from inside my home, through a window facing north.  The intensity of the light remained constant throughout the period it was visible, with no other lights visible, until it disappeared in the distance. Let me be clear that I have observed on many occasions aircraft on approach to Manchester Airport, something which at first glance sometimes resembles these orbs (as the aircraft travels directly toward the observer it can lend the illusion that it is a stationary luminous object), and am acutely aware of how common it is for people to mistakenly report these as UFOs.  I also monitor air traffic via an application on my smartphone, which provides accurate aircraft ID and flight information, with the exception of military aircraft.",2016-01-05T00:00:00,42.96937341772152,-72.27995189873418

I stopped my vehicle to investigate as to what I thought I saw. I pulled up against a grassy areas with the background of trees and beyond that apartment complexes.

They seemed to form a straight line, train-like, flying directly above me about 75 feet up and seemed to be falling down in altitude toward me as well.

((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD)) I just turned on to the street on which our house is located.  Maplewood St  Poway CA is a street that basically runs in a northeast to southwest direction  and intersects with twin peaks.  I was driving east on twin Peaks and turned right heading southwest on Maplewood.  I noted a object streaking in a south to north direction through the sky maybe 30 Deg above the horizon leaving a trail that appeared to be 6-12 inches long, as compared to 2-3 fist lengths at arms length.  The leading sphere was orange in color.  My initial thoughts were a meteor as the object was not really changing elevation.  As I was pulling into my driveway a time span from my first sighting, maybe 30 seconds the tail began to dissipate in length to no visible tail.  At this point I had gotten out of my vehicle and was walking up to the front door.  As I approached the door I yelled for my wife to come check it out as it was changing color from a burnt orange to white and had stopped ! tracking south to north and became stationary.  The sphere became extremely bright white and hovered at a constant location with minor oscillations.  This transition from moving object to stopped object changing color from orange to bright white was maybe 45 seconds.  At this point my wife came outside and I showed her the object.  The object then appeared to move in a westerly direction from stationary on a slightly upward trajectory but maybe only a 5 deg increase.  It appeared to be moving away and the sphere began to decrease in diameter.  There was a bright blue halo trailing the object which became oblong.  Over a period of another 45-90 seconds the object continued to receded from our position.  However the bluish contrail remained for a additional 5-30 seconds . For some background I am a mechanical engineer.  I worked at CCAFS in FL for a period of one year working for General Dynamics on the Atlas program.  I have witnessed more that 6 night launches of vehicle ranging from Delta, Titan, Atlas II & Atlas V and STS.  I have seen launches in dead night and near sunset and sunrise. The brilliant white light which trailed away from our view location was unlike any propulsion system glow I have ever witnessed.  The color and shape of the plume was unlike any chemical rocket plume. Additionally the brilliant white color was brighter and very consistent in color density.  Again unlike any view I have ever witnessed in the launch industry. What was out of place? 1. Transitioning from south to north travel at a constant horizon height to stopped.  Tail to no tail and change of color. 2. Color of sphere or propulsion. 3. Unlike any medium to large chemical rocket launch I have ever witnessed. No small missile launched off a military vessel displays this brilliant white propulsion system.  I have witnessed launches from VAFB of Atlas, Peacekeeper and Delta from this same location on Maplewood over the years.  What can I say I worked in the rocket industry so it was a pleasure to watch night launches especially if they occurred shortly after sunset as you would get good reflection of the vehicle and exhaust. There is no way this was a military launch.",2015-11-19T00:00:00,32.97723982300885,-117.02342477876107

When it passed that building it left a green colored cloud and the UFO stopped to light up the green “cloud”.  It projected a very strong light horizontally (approx. 30 feet long). It then started it again moving diagonally in the sky with its light on and left in the sky. The green cloud just stayed there even when I was leaving 5 minutes later.

I would explain it as if a light switch had been turned on and then off in the sky.  The shape was a perfect circle.   I witnessed it from my vehicle, windows down.  My two children were with me but did not see it, as it only appeared for a brief moment.  We were pulling out of the Sanford Municipal Cemetery on 46A facing north - the object was in the northeastern sky.  The sky was grey overcast yet clear with mild temperature. It was  distinct.   My immediate thought was that the sight was strange, - I had never seen something like that in the sky, but then I dismissed the lights as having been either a firework or blown transformer.  I mentioned to my 9-yr-old son that I saw the lights and he asked me if it looked like a ""ferris wheel"" - which is exactly what it reminded me of - but it didn't have ""spokes&qu! ot; in the center, just the perfect dots of light.  He said he had read about ferris wheel UFO's - I dismissed his statement.  I am submitting this report today (approx 2wks later) because I have yet to figure out what I saw.

As the four of them passed overhead, the second to the vanguard diminished in brightness and in doing so began emitting a redder light until finally it disappeared.   I then noticed more movement to the North and observed a fifth apparently catching up because of it's slightly higher rate of speed.

December 19th, 2015. I went to bed as I usually do at just after 11:00pm. Because of a medical issue I get up often through the night.  It was at this point the date is technically now December 20th, 2015 3:00 a.m.  My staircase stops at the front door and out that door window I have seen the same night sky for a very long time now.  But this time there was an extra light out the door window pointing to the North West. I live in the country there are not lost of extra lights, we have very active night life of coyotes, deer, and many other animals.  This light I noticed was very bright, at first I thought maybe it was a planet but this object grew in brightness, grew extremely bright. But it was motionless and as I watch it a plane very far off blinking red light so I assume it was a plane far in the sky.  This other object was still motionless but what seemed to be too low in the sky to be a star also this was normally a blank space in the clear night sky.  There should not have been an object there and has not every night since.  I went back to bed after watching this object for about ten minutes.  Again the time is now approximately, December 20th, 2015 3:10 a.m.  I pass a stove clock on my night trip to the bathroom so I see the time each time I get up. I again got up as I do this time it was just after 4:00 a.m. December 20th, 2015 and I took notice that the object was gone not out the front door window North West.  This time I took a quick shower as I itch often so bad I need to shower just to be able to relieve the itching, it is all part of a recovery from a bone marrow transplant.  I got out and checked the time so I knew how long before my wife would be waking; it would be Sunday Morning December 20th, 2015 when we got up and the sun was up.  So again it is almost 4:30 a.m. December 20th, 2015, I have to the South East a wall of windows and looked out to see is there was any snow falling?  No, still too warm, very unseasonably warm for the North where I am.  It is at this time I notice that object from the front door window is now out my South East Window, this is not the direction the stars or moon moves in as they travel the night sky, so this right off tells me there is something different about this object. I call to my wife upstairs to come down and take a look.  This object is so bright and motionless and again too low in the sky from the horizon perspective to be a planet or star and it is far brighter than all the other stars.  And now each night I look for this object, if it were something regularly in the night sky I expect I should see it but, I have not.  It was there it was very big and bright, to me it looked the size about what looked like a ¼ of the size of the moon which was not yet out as the full moon is still to come for this month.  Compared to other objects in the night sky this was huge and bright and did not move while I watched it.  I watched it for about 15 minutes this second time and it just got very bright then would get very dim, once it did seem to just go out but then came back on, this was a very white light in that is seemed to appear to be so white I could see other colors of the spectrum in it like neon green, yellow, very lite blue.  Today is December! 24th, 2015 and still no sign of it in the sky, I wonder was this my very first sighting?  I can-not explain what it was and it did not seem to belong there.

I stopped and took a photo with my cell phone before I continued. About 4 hours later I looked at the photo again and it was then that I noticed a very white object in the background of the photo.  With the limited enlargement capacity of the instrument I noticed a craft.   I immediately realized that this was no object of known origin.  It looks like it was moving at an angle of about 35 degrees with a radiation towards the front and the back.  It also seems that the craft was emitting a strange glow. I am sure that if this photo could be enhanced more secrets might be known!",2016-01-05T00:00:00,,

I was speaking to her while she sat facing the east in a SUV and kept seeing flashes of light which she claimed she did not notice.  Believing it must be someone fooling with us, we ignored my curiosity.   However within a few minutes after seeing the flashes of light, I noticed a bright object which came from the West, from California in a star burst pattern.  If you can imagine looking directly at a firework bursting before you, that is what it looked like.  The color was golden to white.  It was so large it was startling.   Being as we are so nervous about terrorists, I almost thought it was a missile, but as it neared and I shouted at her to get out of the SUV and look up at the sky it began to resemble some type of long comet or meteor soaring very close to earth on a bit of a east southeastern direction.  Or as the ! crow flies, towards Phoenix.  It remained visible until it left our horizon line or about two minutes or less.  Once she left and went home about four minutes later I heard a loud boom from the direction which it flew.  Since we both sighted flying orange red orbs over Bullhead City, Arizona, just a few months ago.  It is interesting that so many things abound in the skies around here.  I am certain it was a meteor or some space debris but it is interesting that no one is local is saying anything about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.

Due to its slow speed, I assume it could not have been a meteor.

The fireball appeared over the coast range of mountains to the northeast at an elevation of about 25 degrees.   It proceeded on a level trajectory for a very long minute and a half or so to the SSE. It did not dim or brighten until the end of the ionization track at which point the somewhat fuzzy ion track appeared to break up and spray out a little as it dimmed and went out.  This ion source did not leave a trail of any kind, it burned through the sky and was gone.  Other fireball meteors I have seen have left ion trails and sometimes smoke trails.  This one didn't.

Just based on the brightness of the light and the fact that it was sitting stationary in the sky,  I immediately pulled out my phone and started filming.   I then watched for the next 12 or 13 minutes as this thing blew my mind.  It appeared to be square, or diamond in shape.  It changed from green to red then back to green in no real pattern.  It did not make a sound.   It traveled from one side of the city to the entire other in under 10 seconds.  It dropped so low that it was out of my sight for a few minutes, then rose as if someone had a string attached to it and yanked it upward.  I would say 1,000 feet to 10,000 feet in under 3 seconds.   As it got close enough to me to really make it out I could tell the body of it was black, there were four huge perfect circle lights on the bottom, two red and two green, but at times there would be either no green or no red.  I also saw a flashing white or maybe even amber colored light on the back?  Maybe front?  I am basing the size on a passenger jet which flew through the same vicinity as the craft moments after it disappeared which I also caught on video and I would say that it was half to 3/4 the size of the airplane which was a full size jet plane.  It also appeared to be traveling 15 to 20 times faster than that plane which was descending to land and much much higher.  This happened in Rochester NY and I witnessed it from the suburb Greece, NY.  It was mostly south of my location, but at times traveled far enough north east (in under 10 seconds mind you) that I had to turn my whole body and face Irondequoit, NY, which is east of Greece, to keep recording it.   I stopped a passing car and asked the young lady to look up and tell me what she sees so I know i'm not going crazy and she watched it for about 5 seconds, said oh my God that's a ufo!  I said thank u for confirming and she promptly pulled away as if she was nervous.  The craft made a lot of erratic movements.  Stopping on a dime, zig zag patterns at times, shifting as if on an axis.  At one point it started heading right at me and had me nervous enough to start walking back towards the apartment building for safety.  It was acting as if it were investigating or searching for something.   Truly a life altering experience for me, felt absolutely nothing like a drone which is the infamous explanation i'm getting for this.  I own a drone.  I know what they can do.  I know there's a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and uses for them.  This was not that.   Oh and I don't know if this relevant or not but I experienced a really bad headache about an hour after the event which would not go away to the point that I had to take tylenol for it.  I NEVER EVER have headaches that lead me to have to medicate.  Cannot remember one time in life.

At first I thought it was a navigational light on an aircraft.  I live under the direct flight path of aircraft flying to and from Pittsburgh International, Washington-Dulles, and several other major airports in the area.  But I have never seen aircraft lights move like this light did. This light although very bright and small moved from right to left, left to right, up and down, from side to side and corner to corner.  It did not change speed or slow down to make these sudden movements. I thought I was seeing things, so I yelled to my wife to come out onto the front porch.  She asked what I needed and I told her about the light.  I showed her where to look to see the light and she confirmed what I had seen. She then called my three sons to come onto the porch and look at the light.  Two of my sons and my eleven year old grand –daughter then came outside on the front porch.  They also confirmed the light and its odd movement.  We all agreed it was no aircraft that we knew of. I worked for ((deleted--aviation company)) for almost thirty years after serving a tour of duty with the ((deleted--aviation/military)).  I have traveled around the world and have flown in all types of aircraft from a Cessna 150, an F4-Phanton to Boeing 747, and never have been in, or flown in any aircraft that moved like this light did.  My third son also served a tour with the ((military)) air wing but he would not comment on what he saw. We did notice one thing strange about the light and its movements though.  We live near a 500,000 and I am told a 750,000 volt power line that run side by side near our home.  From where we were located and where the light seemed to be, it appeared to be moving above these power lines. I have waited to check on these lights again, but the weather has not been cooperative and every evening since seeing this light the sky has been overcast.  I will continue to look for the light when I get a chance. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2016-01-05T00:00:00,39.3585,-79.9984

I kept watching it and then it started to move toward me and it wasn't moving very fast at first and then it 'zipped' forward and then came to a complete halt.  It hovered for a second or so then 'zipped' back from where it came and did some slow hovering movement, kind of like it was looking for something and then it when over the horizon and I could no longer see it.

((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.

At first I figured it was a plane enroute for approach, especially since I am so close to an airport, but then after looking at the light for a bit, it seemed to be far too bright to be a landing light and not to mention the direction it was coming from is not a typical approach. I am a pilot and can verify this for certain.  So any way, the light lit up, and although the skies were clear, a bright light enclosed by a cone shaped ""canopy"" was displayed.  I have never seen anything like this before - it was almost beautiful.  I am not conspiracy theorist, but I do have a solid scientific type of background, and can honestly say I was blown away by this since I've never seen anything like it before! the best way to describe the light would be similar to a movie of when a suspect is being in! terrogated by detectives in a smoky room with only a table lamp.  The light emitting from the lamp is basically similar to what I saw on a larger scale.  I was so fascinated by it, I immediately called my wife and asked her to look outside.  She didn't see the lights on, however the strangest thing she did see is that the ""clouds"" or smoke I originally saw was somehow still radiating like a bluish color even after the light diminished for several minutes.  It almost appeared as if the moon was behind the clouds, but just on a very smaller scale.  Any way, I went back home and kept on looking at the sky about half an hour later to see if I would see something again, and the skies were as clear as water; no clouds smoke or anything.  It was extremely strange, and I have never done anything of this nature as far as reporting it - but I couldn't help myself!!!

On a clear moonless night, a friend and I were out driving around when we decided to pull off of the road and watch the stars.  We pulled onto a very large flat area near Belen, NM called Tierra Grande, which is a vast treeless flat plain that then sharply rises up to 10,000 ft.+ to the Manzano Mountains.  As we were sitting there, we noticed a very large, bright white light, flying up and down the side of the mountain.  We could see the light almost touch the ground and then back up again.  At first we thought it was a helicopter, but the speed of the object and the fact that I had hiked the area many times and knew there was not room for a helicopter down in the canyons and foothills of JFK Park.  We could make out the outline of pine trees as the large orb flew quickly over the park.  After about 5 min. of this, the light disappeared and we waited for it to return, I suggested that my friend flash his headlights three times.  Immediately, and I mean instantly, 15 to 20 orbs lit up exactly at the same time all over the mountain side.  As I know the area very well, I know that the terrain is extremely steep, and there is no way these light s could have been campers or hikers, no trails, no campgrounds.  The lights were scattered down the mountain side for about 3-4 mile stretch and after flashing the lights on the car, they all came on instantly, simultaneously.  Eventually, all of the lights when off, one by one after about 10 min..  I called the police to see if anyone else had see the lights and they laughed and said ""Um, no""  We never saw any of the lights again.",2016-02-11T00:00:00,34.5967,-106.672

At 19:35 this evening, I was standing in my front yard looking up at the few clouds that remain, after a mostly cloudy day.  I commented to my wife, who was seated on the porch, that the skies had cleared up nicely when I noticed an object in the night sky which was moving at a good pace and blocking out stars as it moved from the northwest to the southeast.  The object appeared as a dull grey mass against the night sky, and is of indeterminate shape due to the lack of light.  I would estimate the size of the object to be roughly the equivalent of holding a dime at arm's length, possibly smaller.  There were no lights visible on the object.  The only reason that I even saw it was because stars were being blocked out as it traveled.  There was no sound at all, and it was almost directly overhead, as opposed to being off at an angle to me.  I commented on it to my wife, but, she was not able to see it, as there is a streetlight directly across from our house, and she! was facing into the light, while I had my back to it.  Upon turning around to track its course, I, too, lost it in the light pollution from the streetlight and neighboring houses whose porch lights are on.  I would estimate that the total time that I saw it is around ten seconds, before turning and losing sight of it due to the lights at ground level. Not being able to estimate its altitude, it would be impossible to estimate its speed, however, it was moving along at a pretty good clip. We live within a couple of miles of Lake Michigan, and it is not uncommon for people to share stories of seeing strange things in the night sky in the area.

We just told friends and family who all looked at us with scepticism.  After watching a UFO special where the reports on objects seen were very similar I decided to write a report. We are Australians.  (My husband and I and a close friend.)  We were traveling by RV from Oregon to Las Vegas in October 2008.  On the day in question, we were driving from Mono Lake to Vegas and cut across to Highway 95.  On the way to 95 we blew a tyre which had to be changed.  This delayed us so by the time we got to highway 95 it was getting dark.  We stopped for gas then continued south. The map showed a large military base to the east of the highway.  I joked with the others saying 'wouldn't it be fun if we saw a UFO around here?'.  In all our USA travels over 20 years, we'd never seen a UFO before.  We laughed about it and kept going south.  It had become completely dark and I estimate it was around 7 or 8pm. My husband was driving the A class RV (bus style front with huge windscreen).  We were going fairly slow enjoying the drive - normal amount of traffic.  I was in navigator seat and our friend was behind on the couch.  My husband who is quite observant, was looking out the window and at the stars as we drove.  It was a clear night and stars were clearly visible. A few minutes later he slowed right down.  He was looking up through the windscreen and said 'the stars have all disappeared.  Do you see that above us?'.  I looked up and our friend looked out the side window.  We all saw that the stars were no longer visible.  We pulled over to the side of the road and stopped.  By this time we could see that there was a large black object over the top of the RV that was blocking the stars.  We were all saying, 'What is that?' to each other. As soon as we stopped, our friend opened the door and we all got out of the RV. We then looked up and got a better idea what was above us.  It was a large, gun metal black triangular craft. It was moving very slowly, almost hovering over us.  It was huge - we estimated about the size of a football field.  We could only make out how big it was by the far corners as they had small blinking lights.  The lights are what made my husband think the craft was man made rather then extra-terrestrial. Also there was absolutely no noise coming from the craft.  No engine noise at all. Our friend went around to the back of our RV and climbed the ladder to stand on top of the RV to get a closer look.  It was really low - perhaps only 30 feet up.  It was over us for a few minutes then it kept drifting slowly east and gradually got faster.  Then, it got instant speed (like something you'd see on Star Trek's warp drive) and instantly flew out and over the horizon. In the distance were some hills (where the military base was marked on the map).  Once the craft disappeared we could see flashes of light coming from behind the hills kind of like lightning or weapon explosions.  These continued for a while. As we were discussing what we'd seen, three other objects started flying around.  Marked by three red lights, the three objects flew in formation together.  They moved in angular motion - angles, up and down, round, back and forward and zig zag.  They didn't fly like any normal craft you would recognise.  Again, they didn't seem to make any sound but they were further away than the first ship had been.  Really all we could see of them were three bright red lights - each light a separate object.  We watched them for about half an hour amazed at what we were seeing.  Eventually they seemed to leave the area.  As time was moving on we got back into the RV and took off slowly down the road still watching the sky. A short while later the three craft / red lights reappeared.  We stopped again, got out and watched them.  They did the same kind of manouvers as the first time. All in all, they disappeared and came back again about 4 times in total.  This all took place over the space of about 2.5 hours and over a distance of less than ten miles (that we travelled).  Then, the last time we saw the three lights/synchronized craft) they seemed to drop regular red coloured flares which went to the ground.  They then left the area.  A few minutes later two regular military jet aircraft flew over the area and into the distance over the hills.  Then nothing further happened. Amazed we eventually got going again and drove the rest of the way to Vegas, getting in around 11pm.  We sat up most of the night discussing and dissecting everything we'd seen just to make sure none of us were crazy!  We ended up assuming they were some kind of craft owned by the military but they were certainly nothing like anything we'd ever seen.  My husband worked in the Australian defense department in Canberra for years and had seen classified aircraft over the years but nothing like this.  Our friend who was with us is a computer/electric vehicle expert but still had never seen anything like these craft or the way they operated. I was surprised that nobody else stopped on the highway or seemed to see them.  I guess most people are busy and in their little world unlike us who were moving slow and observant whilst on our holiday.  So I hope you find this report of interest.  I've tried to explain it all as logically as I could.   P.S.--We had no video camera with us.  Our friend tried to take photos of the black craft but being black on a black sky in the dark, none came out so we have no photographic evidence.  Even though this happened a few years ago now, it's very fresh in all our minds.   It was an incredible experience.",2016-02-11T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

May be a storage bin but why would there be only one in the area.,2016-02-11T00:00:00,30.6791,-102.7875

The object was visible before its first movement, and remained stationary for 5 seconds . The  object  then projected a beam about one half its diameter that extend out about 5 degrees.  It then moved to the end of the Beam.  It remained stationary for about 2 seconds.  It then displayed another beam approximately 5 degrees and then vanished.  I went in the house to get my night-vision camcorder.  After returning from the house with the camcorder, nothing was in the sky.  I was out several times to check on my imaging setup and never noticed anymore activity.  The imaging session lasted for about 3 hours. It is important to note that I have been imaging objects in the sky for over 10 years.  Objects such as the  moon, galaxies,  Comets, star cluster, ISS, planes, jets  and nebulas.  I am familiar with what a satellite looks like, as well as a meteorite or comet. This was not a Chinese lantern, comet, flare, meteorite etc. PS: The object was moving upto the right  at about 15 degrees and the beam it projected was very linear unlike an arching/tapering trail of a comet or meteorite.  The beam was also consistent in width; it did not taper.",2016-02-11T00:00:00,,

I noticed lighted orbs “dancing”  in the sky.  I went outside to observe them more clearly.  Here is what I saw:  Two orbs moved across the sky.  They were heading towards each other then, once they intersected, they both headed back in the reverse direction.  Soon there were three orbs, then 4, then 5, then 6.  Again, the orbs would head in the same direction, intersect, then reverse direction (or “bounce”).  The number of orbs visible at any one time varied from 2-6.  The orbs stayed in almost continuous motion.  However, at times the orbs seemed to stop and hover in a loose pattern for a moment, only to resume the “bounce” activity.  I did not notice any distinct shapes formed by the orbs.  The only clear cut pattern was the “bounce” activity that remained consistent.  There was no noise in my area before, during or after the sighting.  I shot still and video photography with my I-Phone.  I managed to capture images of the activity as described above.

I found this very strange that the object would set for months then leave while I was watching. Thank you would like to talk with someone.",2016-02-11T00:00:00,,

It was spring and a thunderstorm was waning.  The time was just after sunset and the electricity had gone off.  On a portable radio we heard that a tornado has been sited to the south of our location.  The rain had stopped and we decided to watch for any evidence of the tornado and proceeded to the roof as it offered our best vantage.  The cloud cover was clearing and moving west to east and the sky was dark and clear.  Without electricity we remained on the roof long after the weather settled.  We were just observing the sky as we often did when possible.  Nothing much was happening until I observed a light, much like Telstar I had observed as a child, moving across the sky coming from the north.  It was heading in a southerly direction at a steady pace when it made a ninety degree turn to the east in an abrupt and continuous movement.  It maintained an easterly course until no longer visible to the naked eye.  A few minutes had passed and I spotted the lig! ht again this time heading east to west along the same general path as earlier.  Again it made a ninety degree turn this time to the north.  Again the maneuver was steady, abrupt and continuous.  Hoping it would return we continued to watch the sky.  After a few minutes, I observed the object coming from the north and heading south and again it changed direction in a ninety degree movement heading east.  I tried to point out its location to my partner but it was so dark you literally could not see your hand in front of your face.  It continued east until I lost sight of it.  I waited for the object to return but it never did.  After about thirty minutes we finally climbed down from the roof and called it a night.  I can’t explain what I witnessed but I can’t imagine it was anything naturally occurring.  It seemed to have purpose and the ability to carry out difficult if not impossible maneuvers.  Although this occurred over forty years ago I can recall it as if it were yesterday. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was mowing grass in my back yard when I observed an object about 1 quarter mile away swinging back and further in the air.  There is a small lake in that area and it appeared to be directly over it.  I thought it was someone flying a large kite at first so I didn't think much of it and kept mowing the grass.   I made several more passes around the back yard when I noticed it was much closer and over the top's of the trees by the lake.  If it was a kite it would have been tangled in the trees at that point. I began to think it was a small plastic kids' swimming pool that the wind had picked up and it was swaying back and forth in the air....but there was no wind that day.  I took several more passes around the yard on the tractor when I noticed it was much closer now and was past the trees heading straight in my direction.  I stopped the tractor and got off and tried to make sense of what I was seeing.  I was trying to guess if it maybe an ultra lite but it was swinging 30 feet side to side so it could'nt have been that.  I realized at that point that it must be a UFO and ran inside the house to find our camera.  I searched all over the house for the camera but could not find it.  I went back outside and the object was about 300 feet from the house at this point. I ran to the neighbors houses on both sides on mine to try to get a witness but they were all at work.  I went back into the house and got the binoculars my wife watches birds with and got a good look at the craft.  I observed it fly directly over my next door neighbors house which is only 25 feet from my house and it was only about 40 to 50 feet in the air.  It did not make any noise at all and I got a real good look at it with the binoculars since I was only 50 feet away from it.  It was dull silver in color, about 30 feet from tip to tip and about 20 feet from nose to tail.  It was about 4-5 feet thick and had a black cockpit bubble on top like where a pilot would sit.  I did not see any seams in the metal or any writing on it.  After it past ! me I cou ld see the back of the craft which was concave and had what looked to be black slats where the propulsion system would be.  After it past me it tipped up to a 45 degree angle and started heading up and started going faster.  I watched it for another 1 minute as it stated speeding away.  I was watching it with the binoculars so it must have gone at least 40-50 miles in 1 minute before I coundn't see it any more.  When I first observed the craft above the lake to the time it got to above my neighbors' house took 10-14 minutes so it was moving forward at less speed that I could have casually walked the same distance. I have never seen anything before or after this time that I would classify as a UFO.  I was a Military Policeman in the Army for 9 years and also worked for a company after I got out of the military which made top secret parts for the military such as the stealth fighter and bomber and I know my aircraft.

It was slowly moving west when the third object, also a burnt orange appeared.  It made a triangle formation, but a very long triangle, before form a line.   The object in back started to slowly fade out over the course of maybe 10 to 15 seconds before disappearing.  Soon after, the object in front did the same thing, thus leaving only the one in the middle. after about a minute, it too did the same.   Myself and my brother quickly ran home and told our mother.  She thought it was a joke, but soon realized we were serious.  She was on the phone with my sister and my father.   I went back out onto the street and looked around, seeing the fourth object.  This was unlike the first three.  It was much larger, maybe even three times the size of the other three.  It was also a very pale blue and white hue, almost completely white.  It just sat in the sky, maybe about 1000 to 1500 feet up.   I ran inside and told my brother and mother, who each ran outside with me. It was gone. We looked for a while afterwords, but saw nothing.   About an hour and a half later, still very perplexed by the event, I took out one of my dogs to use the bathroom again.  I was just down the street when my dog, who doesn't ever make any mean gesture towards anything, started growling and barking at nothing.  I turned around to go home, as I was kind of, not scared, but not excited either.  I just wanted to be home.   When I got inside, my mom said I had been gone a while.  It had felt only five minutes had passed, but they said it was about 30 minutes.   Since then I've been having strange dreams, and dreams i can only barely remember.  I've also fallen ill in the past few days.  Without getting into details, it feels as though pure evil is exiting my bowels every two hours, as well as very painful gas in my gut.   Was i abducted?  This I cannot answer, for I cannot be certain.  I promise that all that i have told you all today is 100% true and honest.   Sadly, I have no video or photos of the event.  For this I damn myself for having left my phone inside. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, to ensure that the report was a serious-minded account of a real event.  The witness claimed that the report is accurate, and that he will attempt to have his brother submit a supplementary report.  We await the second report.  PD))",2016-01-05T00:00:00,,

The fire was out down to embers, and the moon and the street lights in front of the house were the brightest light sources in the area.   We saw(4) lights at maybe 5*-10* west of due south.  The lights were pumpkin orange and brighter than the handful of stars visible facing south at the time.  They were as bright or maybe slightly dimmer than the north star (opposite direction in the sky so a true visual comparison was not possible.  However, I did look briefly behind me to use it as a general basis for comparison).   The lights appeared out of no where and appeared to move independently for the first minute we saw them.  They all shifted position both vertically and horizontally 2 or 3 times rather quickly.   They then adjusted position relative to each other and formed a perfect square in the sky.  It maintained this for about 3-5 minutes.  Then one light (upper right ! of the square) disappeared suddenly like turning off a light.  With the two left lights maintaining position, the lower right moved out and up, the three forming an equilateral triangle pointing west. It maintained this formation for 5-7 minutes or so.  Just floating there.  During this time, a commercial flight crossed between us and the lights while traveling west to east.  From our view point it passed directly between us and the lower left light blocking it out completely in passing with the light reappearing in it's location after passing.  The plane's lights were on and was likely either circling or on final approach to Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW).  The plane was visibly brighter (about 2 times), and much lower in the sky, with both solid and flashing lights on.  The lower left light looked like it descended suddenly out of sight.  The lower right light appeared to travel due west and out of sight.  Neither of these had a trail of any kind, just a qu! ick moving point of light.  The upper light appeared to remain! in plac e but just got fainter and fainter over about 30 seconds and faded out once the other two had gone.

This continued for several minutes in a trail formation.  The objects were moving relative to each other, but primarily south to north.

Not even my dog who was sleeping on the bed would wake up.  Just like a vacuum, I watched the fog get sucked out of my bedroom door (which was open).  I was extremely scared but chose to run to my front door.   There was a slight buzzing noise coming from outside (sorry I'm getting goosebumps real bad just thinking about this).  I opened the door and looked up.  Not 50 feet above the ground was a blueish chrome disk sitting almost motionless in the air.  This was at night and it's weird how I was able to see the distinct blueish chrome color of the disk.  There was a slight wobble to it also.  I felt like something was staring at me.  The disk was about 30 feet around and had a small ""base"" on top of it.  There were no lights or markings on it.  It sat there for about! a minute or two (I think but it's almost like I had been staring at it for 15 minutes) and the buzzing noise stopped.   There was a pop that came from it (there go the goosebumps again) like a balloon popping and it slowly lifted straight into the air.  When it got about I'd say 100 or so feet up it faded out of sight into nothingness.   I ran back into my house to check on my 2 year old son and he was fine.   I was able to wake my wife up and asked if she had seen anything.  She got teary eyed and without saying anything went immediately back to sleep.  My dog almost looked sad and went back to sleep as well.   This by far is the weirdest and unnerving thing I have ever witnessed in my life.  I'm am scared s**tless since last night.

On Wednesday February 10th, at 5:15am, I was on my way to the gym before work.  I had just turned out of the driveway and outside my driver-side window I caught a glimpse of a large flying object.  It was literally just above the tree line!  I clearly saw the charcoal colored underside of the wide chevron-shaped wingspan against the night sky.  There were red lights at the tip of each wing and a white light at the front center.  It was too dark to discern the shape of the fuselage, however I assumed that it was a jet.  I was taken aback as to how low it was flying, and how unusually slowly it was traveling. It crossed overhead and was not easily seen on my heavily wooded street.  For a brief second I thought about taking a photo, but my phone was in my purse behind the seat.  I figured it would be too late and too dark by the time I got to it. I continued to drive 1 mile out of my neighborhood, and more than 2 minutes passed when I came to the clearing on Hillcrest Road at the exit 40 overpass for Route 78.  At that point I was very surprised to see it again!  It was straight ahead in the near distance, traveling slowly in a north-easterly direction just over the tree line toward Berkeley Heights. At the time I thought it was really odd, and since then continue to leave the house as the same exact time to hopefully see it again!  Now that 2 weeks have passed, I am realizing that I will likely never have the opportunity again.  Now I am sorry that I didn’t pay closer attention when it happened!

My sister and I were driving west on the back road from Wallaceburg to Walpole Island.  I all of a sudden noticed a white shape up high in the clear, blue sky, no clouds.  There are some trees but this was way up high beyond the tree line.  It was traveling downward. What's really weird is that it looked just like what they are calling a missile from yesterday, except it was travelling straight downward.  I can get my sister to submit her description as well. I pointed at it and my sister seen it.  We watched it and I said ""Do you see a plane or what is in the front?  Do you see that aura around it?"" I could not see the plane but a sort of vague white shape was in the front of what looked like white chemtrails. I drove slow so we could watch it.  It was moving straight downwards to earth but didn't really seem to be travelling very much, didn't move much, moved very slowly, despite the chemtrail behind it. Weird that it was directionally going straight downwards to earth. I looked away very briefly to watch the road and it seemed suddenly farther away. I kept watching it and it continued it same downward movement. I had to stop at a stop sign and the object disappeared in that few seconds. We could not find it in the bright, cloudless sky anywhere. The object and it's very short chemtrail were gone. To me, it looked just like what was seen on video the day before, no plane visible at all, some whitish thing up front with a white loop of chemtrail with a short tail of chemtrail behind it.  I didn't see that video until just now and it reminded me of what we watched today so I figured I would send in this description.  It did not look as dramatically huge.  It was quite a bit smaller than the video I seen of that ""missile"". There are a lot of chemtrails around here.  Sometimes you can see a plane in front and sometimes not - hidden, camouflaged, and/or with an aura and then sometimes they disappear right in front of you. After this object disappeared and within the next minute, my sister spotted a chemtrail plane coming from a different direction in the sky.

There was a plane as well flying above and a bit further in the distance from this object.  I could see the noticeable flashing lights of the plane and could clearly make out that it was a plane, therefore this object was even more odd and off looking.   A few seconds after looking at the bright object or light, it moved in a straight line fast, passing the plane then stopping again. I thought to myself did I really see that?

Usually they are civilian aircraft or medical aircraft, but this time it was a Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter that seemed to be following something(I could not visibly see anything but it was much to low to be just flying by).  There were no markings, just a grayish black chopper with a mounted gun clearly visible as the chopper was no more than 300-500 feet off the ground.  Which is quite low for the Heli's in this area, and this is not the first sign of a military presence in the area.  I have also seen a Boeing Ch-47 Chinook flying by, this one flying much higher then the AH-64 I saw today.",,31.869177391304348,-102.36950956521738

I was walking up my driveway whilst taking up the trash barrels with my friend and we witnessed an extremely bright ball of light suddenly flying southwest over my home in Salem.  We both stopped dead in our tracks and I scrambled for my cellphone to take video.   Typically if I see a plane or a satellite, I don't bother even looking for more than a moment as they are very common in my area.  However once what i thought to be a satellite at first slowed down then stopped I had to take a closer look.  Just as i began recording the video the object starting moving as if it never stopped.   There were several small aircraft in the night sky and they're were on their normal flight paths.  It was clear and there were many stars.  Just as the main object started to fade in the distance the object which was just a brilliant white ball of light disappeared over methuen ma just a few miles in the distance but not before a smaller and less luminous object appeared directly above me and my friend.   This object flew quickly over head and was heading south of Salem.  I've seen simular objects before mostly satellites, however these objects were not characteristic of a satellite or high altitude aircraft.  I've been an observer for 18 years and wouldn't report anything that i felt was typical.   After the second object appeared it faded off into the distance.  I checked this site to see if anyone else had any sightings in New Hampshire and they did.  Not exactly  the same as what i saw but ufos have a funny way of changing their appearance.  So their sighting may or may not be related to mine.  Here is a link to the video taken that evening.  I hope it helps: https://youtu.be/g_eCM9OErdo ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the video, and it shows a white speck of light, moving around the Moon, in the night sky.

The date given for my report corresponds to another report in your database, from Warren, Michigan, for a sighted object matching the description of what I saw.  I was too young at the time to keep track of dates, but it occurred during the height of summer in either 1969 or 1970.  I’d guess it was later at night, though, maybe 9pm, when it was still quite light enough outside to see things clearly. The object travelled west to east, slowly and silently, directly over my family’s house in Farmington, Michigan.  From below, it was circular, gray, with a flashing white light running around in a circle on its underbelly.  I only saw it for a few seconds, and I didn’t think to ascertain its diameter, but in my memory I have always seen it as on the scale of the width of the house, say 40-50 feet.  As low as it was, I was astounded that I could hear nothing from it. I saw it from my open bedroom window, looking up directly underneath it.  I ran to the living room, begging my parents to look out the front and see the flying saucer.  Their response was along the lines of:  ""Pshaw, get to bed.”   I went back to the bedroom, but stayed up to listen to the flying saucer sighting story on the 11pm news.  There was no such story.  I went through the newspaper the next day, with the proverbial fine-toothed comb, looking for a report.  Nothing.  I thought the neighborhood would be abuzz with talk of the flyover.  I never heard a peep.  I could not understand how something so extraordinary could go completely unnoticed, except by me. And now also by your report-filer from Warren.

While driving SE on Orient Drive, SE of Orient, OR, I saw a stationary, vertical object off to my right, which was illuminated by the setting sun.  The object was about 10 or 15 degrees above the horizon.  Its height was nearly the same visual size as the visual diameter of the moon (~0.5 degrees).   I continued driving for some distance along Orient Drive watching the object and looking for a place to park.  I turned onto SE 312th and parked near Hwy 26.  I watched the object, which was SW of my position, for several minutes.   The better view that I now had showed the object to have the appearance of a vertical cylinder.  It was drifting extremely slowly to the south and began to separate into two cylinders one above the other, each with the proportions of a soup can.  The upper cylinder began leading the lower as they moved southward, but they never completely separated.   After watching the object for several minutes, I decided to drive through Boring, OR, to try to get a closer look.  I kept looking at it, as I drove, but then I lost sight of it before reaching Boring and never saw it again.  I returned to my prior vantage point, but it was gone. Since the object was in my view for the better part of a mile or more, it had to have been at least three or four miles distant and, given that distance, I would estimate the diameter of the cylinders to be 30 feet or more--perhaps much more. I cannot venture a good guess as to what the object was.  I have seen large tethered balloons used to call attention to sales, grand openings, etc.  But unlike tethered balloons this object was moving, albeit slowly, and I saw no other indication of such an event taking place.

It was a clear blue sky, and I wrote it off as someone releasing a balloon after a birthday party, or something like that.  However, the object was interesting to look at, and so I kept staring.  I had no obstructions to my vision. Five seconds after I saw the object, a blue light started to grow, about twice or three times as big as a planet or large star in the night sky.  The balloon shape was growing smaller as the light was getting brighter.  The blue light got brightest two seconds after the light began to glow, and then the light started to grow smaller and less intense, as if attached to an object that was traveling away from me, and two seconds later, it was gone.

These seem to be some type of military craft of unknown type. At 7:37 PM central time, my brother and I were walking on the north side of Edison elementary school when we noticed 3 very bright (as bright as Venus or ISS going overhead) red/orange lights to the south.  They were low in the southern sky and maybe 20 degrees above the horizon and heading due north when we spotted them.  The craft were widely spaced and were not in any type of obvious formation.  They were spaced miles apart and the middle one was in front of the others from our vantage point. The evening sky was clear with very good visibility.  Temp was 44F wind was SW at 9mph.  Stars were clearly visible.  The atmosphere was stable. As they move closer it became clear.  The lights were extremely bright.  Much, much brighter then B-52s at night.  Minot Air Force Base is 13 miles due north and home to 28 B-52Hs.  I've watched the bombers fly at night with all their lights on while doing pattern work.  These aircraft were not BUFFs.   To us, they were at an unknown altitude,  But, if I were to guess base on how soon the sound reached us as they passed overhead I would say about 10,000 feet.  There was a soft turbofan engine noise (almost like it was muffled).  The engine noise was distinctly different from a B-52.   They moved much slower than passenger jets overflying Minot at cruising altitude.  I'm guessing these vehicles were doing 200 knots.  The orange lights numbered a dozen or more on the bottom of the craft.  The pattern of the lights were spread out across the width of the wing or body and made it appear to have a very wide wing.   It also had one extremely bright search light that was also orange.  It was rather washed out or dull and was beaming its light ahead of the vehicle.  The individual lights on the bottom appeared to be rectangular.  They all were steady in brightness and did not dim or strobe.  We were able to watch 2 of the craft as they headed north.  They went directly to the M.A.F.B. and then turned east without losing altitude.  One of them headed back towards Minot and I was able to look at it thru binoculars.  I still could not make out a planform.   I did recognize a red rotating beacon towards the aft end and more orange lights possible on top.  It was still brightly lit with the search light on.  Then, the craft turned to the east again and dimmed all of its lights including the red beacon and disappeared.   It was now 8:03 pm.

While sitting on my sofa watching the Golden State Warriors game against the Thunder, saw a dull orange circular object appear through the window in the southeast.  Walked outside to see what it was and this orange orb was slowly moving in a generally southeasterly direction.  It had a brighter portion which was about 10% of the total size of the object and that part was slowly rotating in an irregular pattern around and through the object.  Grabbed my binoculars out of the car and was able to see clearly that that brighter orange glow rotating continued and in trying to identify it the only thing that it was remotely like was a large balloon with a gondola slung underneath it.  In this case though, the gondola was on fire as it was significantly brighter than the rest of the object.  But the way this brighter portion was moving was not predictable and did not have an obvious pattern or rhythm to it.  The dimmer portion of the orb looked to have a semblance of a grid-like appearance, but when the brighter portion of the glow moved across the face of it, the grid was no longer visible due to the greater intensity of the light. After about four minutes of relatively slow and consistently paced movement from my right to left, it appeared to turn south and head toward San Francisco roughly.  It moved away at a regular pace for several seconds and then appeared to speed up significantly until it became too small to view and then disappeared.  The speed of this last part seemed unlike anything that I've seen before, as though the physics I am aware of were no longer operating on this object.  The disappearance from view in the last ten seconds essentially happened too fast to be explained by any previous experience I've had.  There was no sound involved at all. This is the first time that I have ever seen, much less reported, anything like this.  Until I did a Google search on 'orange object in the night sky over Petaluma tonight,' I was unaware of websites like this.  I'm a totally sane person and this was in no way imagined.

It seemed to be lite from within and had the appearance of parchment paper lite from behind by a very bright light.  This object was large (small plane size) this was not a Chinese lantern as it was traveling way to fast and I have seen lanterns many times in the past.  The way the object traveled was very smooth and straight. it was traveling about twice the speed of a small plane.  There was no sound to the object and it seemed to blink out, or turn off after it went over the building in front of me.  The object left no tail/trail as it went by me.",2016-02-11T00:00:00,,

To give some background on our sky-watching experience, my 14-year-old son and I have spent a great deal of time watching satellites in the evenings.  Over the last five years, we have spent 1-2 hours lying on a blanket in our back yard having contests to see who can spot the most satellites.  We have done this on a total of at least 50 separate occasions.  I am also registered on the Heavens-Above web site.  I have taken printouts of satellite and rocket passes outside with us and waited for the passes to occur.  We have watched rockets tumble, which look like a blinking satellite as the sun reflects off the different surfaces of the rocket.  We have watched Iridium Flare and International Space Station passes as well.  To summarize, my son and I know what we are looking at.  We understand the difference between an aircraft and a satellite passing overhead.  Well, at least that’s what we thought, until the evening of February 6th, 2016. We were skiing at Blue Knob Ski Resort, located approximately 6 miles west of Claysburg, PA, at an altitude of 3120 ft.  The sun set shortly after 17:30.   At approximately 19:00, we were on the Route 66 ski lift traveling slowly in a southwesterly direction.  I was sitting on the left and my son was sitting on the right.  The sky was completely clear and dark.  With unlimited visibility, I commented on how beautiful the night sky was because of the lack of light pollution compared to where we live, which allowed us to see many more stars than we would normally see. Just as we were passing over the Upper Extrovert ski trail, my son said “Oh my God!  Look at those two satellites traveling together, side by side” as he pointed in a southeasterly direction.  I looked in the southeasterly direction to where my son was pointing, near the constellation Orion.  At approximately 80 degrees from the horizion, I immediately saw what looked like two satellites with a brightness magnitude of approximately -1 traveling in a northerly direction.  The distance of the two objects from us seemed to be the same as a typical communication satellite just outside of the Earth’s atmosphere.  The brightness magnitude of the two objects remained constant throughout this entire observation.    There were no audible sounds from the two objects whatsoever.  The two objects were separated by about 10 degrees and traveling approximately two to three times the velocity of a normal satellite.  The distance between the two objects was decreasing and after approximately 4 seconds, I was expecting the two objects to pass over each other.  Instead, the two objects remained closely together and continued to travel in a northerly direction for another three to four seconds.  The two objects, very smoothly, in approximately two seconds, decelerated to a stop.  It was very clear that they came to a stop because the large number of stars surrounding the two objects gave us a good point of reference.   After approximately one second of both objects hovering still, they smoothly and slowly reversed direction and traveled a short distance of approximately 1-2 degrees in a southerly direction for approximately three to four seconds.  Both objects slowly and smoothly came to a stop and hovered for approximately two seconds and simultaneously rotated so that the object on the west exchanged positions with the object on the east.   Both objects, very smoothly, began to accelerate in a northerly direction at a rate of acceleration that took both my son and! myself by surprise.  It only took approximately two seconds for both objects to accelerate to a velocity of two to three times that of a typical communications satellite.   We continued to watch both objects travel in a northerly direction for approximately ten seconds as the distance between the two objects increased to approximately 10-15 degrees. At this point, as we continued to slowly travel in a southwesterly direction on the ski lift, the bright metal halide lights from the Mid-Way Station drop off point coupled with the increasing distance of the two objects from us prevented us from continuing our observation of the objects. As this observation was occurring, my son and I were verbalizing our observation to each other as we started to realize that what we were witnessing was something we have never seen before.  We were cursing and yelling to each other as we described what we were seeing.  I said things such as “What the heck?!” as my son shouted, “Oh, my God!  They stopped!”  I shouted “Oh my God!  They’re going backwards!”.  These type of statements mixed with a few choice curse words were uttered throughout the entire observation. As we passed the Mid-Way drop off station, my son and I were in shock as we sat in stunned silence for an unknown amount of time.  Now that we were in a fully illuminated area, I turned to my son and he turned to me.  We locked eyes for a few seconds.  My son broke the silence with “What was that?”  I returned “I don’t know.” We continued to the top of the mountain in stunned silence. We made one more trip down the mountain and decided that we would call it a day since neither of us could concentrate on skiing.",2016-02-11T00:00:00,40.2839,-78.5062

I just had my very first, truly authentic UFO sighting today at 5:52 am.  I awoke for no particular reason this morning and was staring out the large bay window that dominates my bedroom and faces the Southwest.  Had been starring out this window for a few minutes, wondering why I had to wake up so early on my day off, when two relatively bright, white lights steadily appeared in the upper portion of the window.  There is a thick transom board that forms the upper sill for the bay windows below and is the base for the triangular window that is the top of the bay window group. The lights appeared from behind this board, up into the large, clear portion of the triangular window, slowly moving upward and to the right for a short period.  At first, I thought it must be a pair of light aircraft, but it was weird that they would track so steadily with each other and move so slow.  I really didn't think too much of it, I had seen similar things in the past that weren't too far out of the realm of normality, but when the lights seemingly halted, and rapidly shot upwards to tiny points of light (probably about a second to a second and a half) in a very gentle quarter twist motion), I was pretty sure I was not watching a pair of Cessna aircraft. The twin points of light glittered for about two seconds before one on the left just winked out and the one on the right shot across the window in a Northernly direction in about a quarter of a second,  After waiting a few minutes, keeping my eyes on that patch of sky to see if anything else manifested itself, I turned on the table lamp and noted the time of 5:52 am and got out my iPhone and verified the direction the window faced as South West. The lights were blue/white, steady (no-pulsing), tracked very steady and were unspectacular except for their astounding speed and precise action across the sky.",2016-02-11T00:00:00,38.4348,-77.9866

The temperature had dropped down to 71 degrees and the wind was blowing east by southeast 10mph (you can hear it in the footage).  As my girlfriend and I were turning towards our car she stopped and pointed. I turned and looked to find four lights hovering past or behind the Estrella Mountains level with the mountain tops, in front of the visible cloud streaks to the southwest.  They were reddish, amber, gold color.   At first, I thought they were typical airline traffic approaching due east to land at Sky Harbor International Airport.  But these lights hovered—almost flickering—maintaining their position.  We could not determine if they were balls of fire, or that the space between us and the objects seemed to flicker because of the atmospheric particles between us and the lights.   Then, to the left, a reverse C crescent formation of seven lights a! ppeared roughly two minutes later.  Then, a single light appeared below the crescent—that is when my girlfriend began recording.

The lights initially appeared in two groups, one group of 11 and one group of 2. We stood at the same vantage point the morning after our sighting and verified that there were no distant mountains in the view nor other possible reasons for lights to appear at that location.  We have lived at this location for close to two years, and have never seen a similar grouping of lights.

I was traveling home to Oatman from Kingman on my motorcycle.  I had been at Chillin on Beal Street.  A local classic car event.  I remember leaving early, as my battery in my motorcycle was weak and I wanted to get through the Black Mountains mountains before dark. I turned onto the Oatman Rd (Historic Route 66) in Golden Valley. I had 20 miles to go to reach Oatman and the sun was falling.  Riding due west I would be riding directly into the sun.  Golden Vally is rather expansive area between the Black mountains to the west, the Hualapai mountains to the S East and Cerbats to N East.  While on my motorcycle I have habit of always scanning the area I ride.  Looking from side to side, especially for animals that may be near the road. I was approximately 3-4 miles along that 12 mile stretch before reaching the mountains when looking to my left something caught my peripheral vision to look up. There, I saw what I could best describe as a metallic looking, semi-cylindrical object.  My best description would be it was shaped like an airstream trailer, cylindrical with rounded ends.  The underside appeared flat and was dark (shadowed) the upper shining as the sun was bright and there were no clouds in the sky.   The craft seemed to be rising or hovering.  It's hard to discern the exact height or size, but if you extend your arm and hand fully, it would be about as wide as two fingers.   It had no wings or appendages, and if it made a sound, I could not hear it, as I was riding and could only hear wind and exhaust note from my bike.  I will say with certainty it was not a balloon or dirigible.   I stared at it for a short time trying to register in my mind what I was seeing, at which time I turned my head to correct my steering as I was drifting into oncoming lane.  I then looked back up to view it again and it was gone.  I pulled to the side of the road and scanned the sky in all directions with a view of 20 miles or more in all directions and could not see it.

After observing many lighted phenomenon in the area for over half a year, I witnessed a triangular shaped craft at very close distance.  I was looking to the North over a field at my friend's property at 101st. St. N and Rock Rd. outside of Valley Center, Kansas, when I observed a very bright light at low altitude that appeared to be very close.   After several minutes of observation, I decided to pursue the stationary star-like object.  I headed N on Rock Road from 101st. st N and estimated the object to be around the intersection of 125th st. and N. Rock road, slightly to the East.  As I headed North  the light dimmed and faded away.  As I approached the intersection of 125th. st and Rock road I slowed down, looked to the East, briefly drove E on 125th street looking for the object and listening for any strange sounds.  Nothing was seen or heard so after a few minutes I started driving home.   As I approached 101st street headed S. on Rock Road  the object reappeared so brightly that I had to squint due to the reflection in my rearview mirror.  I immediately pulled a hand bake 180 and headed straight N. back to exactly where I was searching a few minutes before.   The object stayed lit up although the ""high beams"" turned off as I approached.  There on the North East corner of 125th and Rock rd. about 100 yards out and 1000 ft. or so up was a levitating triangular craft.  As I stood with my car running, one foot out the door, the other inside the car still I stood with the engine running not sure if I should be fleeing or running up in curiosity to get a closer look.   The craft was very silent, although it made a slight jet-like noise.  It was a very low altitude but it sounded like a jet at high altitude very faintly passing by in the distance. It had three points of thrust, one on each point of the triangle.  It had white lights on the leading front edges, red and green lights on the tips of the wings.  The craft was so silent that the! person who's field it was hovering over had no clue as he was! working in his garage even closer to the craft than I was and didn't even notice.   I was on the fence pole about alerting him but I was not sure how much a person in the country would like a stranger walking up in the dark pointing out strange objects hovering over his property!  After observing it levitating at low altitude for two to three minutes it tipped its nose down gently and started lumbering S. as this was the direction the ""front"" was pointed.  I started pursuing the craft at around 60mph, it was moving slightly faster that I was at around 65 mph.  As we headed S. on Rock Rd. from 125th N it crossed directly over the street twice, once on a mostly S. course and slightly to the W, an again closer to 101st. st headed S and slightly E.  It was due to these crossings that I could get a good sense of how big the craft was, it was definitely wider than the road I was on.  I estimate it was at least the width of a 4 lane highway.  As I approached 101st. st. N on a southbound! course the craft veered to the SE.  I pursued the craft as fast as I safely could as I was on washboarded out old country roads and trying to pay attention to two things at once. Like I said I was able to go about 60, the craft was moving slightly faster.  As we crossed 101st. n headed S. on Rock Rd. and it headed to the SE, I saw another ball of light on a NW course approaching.  This was coming from the SE on abut a straight NW heading.  As the two crafts became closer I realized they were traveling on the same approximate low altitude.   Finally when they were very near each other they both simultaneously flashed the ""high beams"" for a split second and continued on their headings.  It was about this time that I stopped pursuing the crafts as they were moving too fast to keep up with.  This event occurred after observing the lighted phenomenon for several months in the area starting in Nov of 2014.  Many locals in Valley Center have been calling it ""drone testing.""  Upon further investigation into this theory it was revealed that the only drones that fly in Kansas fly out of Manhattan at Fort Riley, they are small drones, they don't levitate, they are the ""predator"" drones.  Wichita is the aircraft capital of the world.  It would seem if this is some sort of clandestine government craft the last place they would want to test it is in an area with a population extremely knowledgable in aircraft.  The craft I observed completely disappeared, lights, noise, gone and then reappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Friday Nov. 6 around 6:30 pm my husband and myself were in a car in Rancho Cucomonga Ca. As we approached an intersection, I saw this large object in the night sky.  I should say what I saw was three fairly large lights in an elongated triangle shape (with small slow flashing red light below the bottom white light).  I kept looking to see what it was ??? as hard as I looked I could not see any structure!!!  When we crossed the intersection I rolled down my window (non-drivers side and same side of road it was on) going from west to east...as I looked over it had seemed to stop moving and I could hear a low humming sound(not loud tho)  It was very big at least one story high, but I think even bigger.  You could not see any structure content and you could not see through it. Genesis, Evolution, and Aliens  The Baha'i Faith, claiming to be God's most recent message to humanity, is not just another in a series.  It represents the culmination of a six-thousand year cycle of Prophets, and the transition into a new universal cycle.  While the religion is now in its infancy, taking a broad view of where it falls in history provides a humbling experience to any believer, while an even broader view of the universe stirs up an unparalleled sense of awe.  As traditional religion devolves into an irrational superstition, and a strictly materialistic ideology begins to dominate society, the Baha'i Faith teaches the harmony of science and religion. True religion and science must agree, because the truth is one.  Genesis ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."" (Gen 1:1) A key to understanding the books of Moses is what Baha'is call progresive revelation: that religious truth is relative to the time of revelation. The people of the time of Moses were obsessed with spiritism and idol worship, with the spiritual and intellectual capacity of today's children. `Abdu'l-Baha said, ""Moses established laws and ordinances; these gave life to the people of Israel, and led them to the highest possible degree of civilization at that period."" (Some Answered Questions, p. 14) In this context the stories of Genesis - and other creation myths - are interpreted as spiritual allegories, in a way that outwardly satisfied people's curiosity of history, while inwardly describing spiritual truths that uplifted society. The common understanding at the time was of the world as an island continent on a flat disc with infinite water, surrounded by a dome with stars embedded in its surface. A modern understanding of how the world developed was not only impossible but unnecessary at the time. The account of Genesis had the advantage of conveying the essential spiritual truths about humanity's development with broad symbolism, and avoided the detail that was beyond the capacity to understand. `Abdu'l-Baha said, ""Moses taught that the world was brought into existence in the six days of creation. This is an allegory, a symbolic form of the ancient truth that the world evolved gradually... We thus have a progressive process of creation, and not a one-time happening. Moses' days of creation represent time spans of millions of years."" (Science and Religion, p. 90) As humanity has progressed with a new capacity to understand its environment, the Baha'i teachings reveal new truths about the world. Baha'u'llah teaches that the physical universe is without beginning or end, and confirms the scientists who claim that the earth developed over millions and billions of years. Yet similar to Moses, Baha'u'llah's teachings focus on the spiritual development of society and the control of one's lower nature.  On the nature of creation and existence, `Abdu'l-Baha says, ""If we could imagine a time when no beings existed, this imagination would be the denial of the Divinity of God. Moreover, absolute non-existence cannot become existence. If the beings were absolutely non-existent, existence would not have come into being."" Accordingly, the story of Adam and Eve contains ""divine mysteries and universal meanings, and it is capable of marvelous explanations,"" but is simply a symbol, and cannot be reasonably imagined as a historical account.  Evolution  On the origin of humans, Baha'u'llah similarly confirms biological development of humans over millions of years in different forms. He also taught that the human species was always distinct from the animal kingdom in potentiality.  Some of the most striking and direct comments on evolution come from `Abdu'l-Baha, where he says that man's existence on the earth has developed over a long time. He says, ""Between man and the ape, however, there is one link missing, and to the present time scientists have not been able to discover it... ""The philosophers of the Orient in reply to those of the western world say: Let us suppose that the human anatomy was primordially different from its present form, that it was gradually transformed from one stage to another until it attained its present likeness, that at one time it was similar to a fish, later an invertebrate and finally human. This anatomical evolution or progression does not alter or affect the statement that the development of man was always human in type and biological in progression. For the human embryo when examined microscopically is at first a mere germ or worm. Gradually as it develops it shows certain divisions; rudiments of hands and feet appear--that is to say, an upper and a lower part are distinguishable. Afterward it undergoes certain distinct changes until it reaches its actual human form and is born into this world. But at all times, even when the embryo resembled a worm, it was human in potentiality and character, not animal. The for! ms assumed by the human embryo in its successive changes do not prove that it is animal in its essential character. Throughout this progression there has been a transference of type, a conservation of species or kind. Realizing this we may acknowledge the fact that at one time man was an inmate of the sea, at another period an invertebrate, then a vertebrate and finally a human being standing erect... Therefore, in the protoplasm, man is man. Conservation of species demands it. ""The lost link of Darwinian theory is itself a proof that man is not an animal. How is it possible to have all the links present and that important link absent? Its absence is an indication that man has never been an animal. It will never be found."" (Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 358-359) This statement was delivered in a speech in 1912. These ideas brought harmony to the diverging forces of science and religion at the time.  Soul  The rational soul, according to Baha'u'llah, gives humans an intelligence that makes discoveries and penetrates the reality of things. Animals and humans share the same physical powers, but an animal cannot evolve the intellectual powers of humans, who have the freewill to overcome the animalistic nature of the body.  One evidence of this power is contemplation and reflection, as described by `Abdu'l-Baha, ""It is clear that when man is thinking, it is as though he were consulting with some other person. With whom is he consulting? It is evident that it is another reality or one aside from this body with whom he enters into consultation when he thinks, 'Shall I do this work or not?' 'What will be the result of my doing this?' ... And then that reality in man communicates its opinion to him concerning the point at issue. Therefore that reality in man is clearly and obviously other than his body, an ego with which man enters into consultation and whose opinion man seeks."" (Foundations of World Unity, p. 109) Origins of Life  Humans developed on earth over millions of years, alongside plants and animals. A question then arises: how did it all get here? After all, the story of Genesis came to satisfy the most fundamental controversy. Even with a childish understanding of the world around them, the nomadic followers of Moses could see that they came from their parents, who came from their grandparents, etc. The story of Adam explained the first seed of life, by a literal account six thousand years ago. This question is where the worlds of science and religion collide.  Most scientific theories about the origins of life propose a spontaneous creation of simple molecules in high levels of energy. Another theory proposes that the seeds of life came to earth on meteorites. In other words, the potential for life is either inherent in the planet, or the seeds of life are so prevalent that they permeate the universe, the latter theory appropriately called panspermia. Either way, the implications are incredibly profound. This situation still lacks an impulse to the universe, which, according to Baha'u'llah, is a mystery that can never be fully comprehended. `Abdu'l-Baha elaborates on the idea of creation, ""No Divinity can be conceived as separate from creation, for otherwise it would be like imagining an empire without a people... So, likewise, if we say there was a time when God had no creation or created beings, a time when there were no recipients of His bounties and that His names and attributes had not been manifested, this would be equivalent to a complete denial of Divinity, for it would mean that Divinity is accidental. To explain it still more clearly, if we think that fifty thousand years ago or one hundred thousand years ago there was no creation, that there were then no worlds, no human beings, no animals, this thought of ours would mean that previous to that period there was no Divinity... It is, therefore, evident that inasmuch as the reality of Divinity is without a beginning, creation is also without a beginning. This is as clear as the sun. When we contemplate this vast machinery of omnipresent power, perceive this illimitable space and its innumerable w! orlds, it will become evident to us that the lifetime of this infinite creation is more than six thousand years."" (Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 470) As well as a timeless creation, the universe is also described as having no end.  Aliens  The issue of extraterrestrial life is inextricably bound up with the subject of creation and evolution. Baha'u'llah made a dramatic statement about life in the universe, ""The learned men, that have fixed at several thousand years the life of this earth, have failed, throughout the long period of their observation, to consider either the number or the age of the other planets. Consider, moreover, the manifold divergencies that have resulted from the theories propounded by these men. Know thou that every fixed star hath its own planets, and every planet its own creatures, whose number no man can compute."" (Gleanings, p. 163) It was over a century after Baha'u'llah's writing this that science confirmed the nebular hypothesis, which states that the formation of planets is a natural part of star formation. As previously described, if life on earth developed inherently or externally, it is a logical conclusion that the same potential for life exists everywhere in the universe. Clearly, though, life as we understand it could not survive to the same extent on Jupiter, with clouds of ammonia. `Abdu'l-Baha taught that life develops on other planets according to the environment, ""The earth has its inhabitants, the water and the air contain many living beings and all the elements have their nature spirits, then how is it possible to conceive that these stupendous stellar bodies are not inhabited? Verily, they are peopled, but let it be known that the dwllers accord with the elements of their respective spheres. These living beings do not have states of consciousness like unto those who live on the surface of this globe: the power of adaptation and environment moulds their bodies and states of consciousness, just as our bodies and minds are suited to our planet. For example, we have birds that live in the air, those that live on the earth and those that live in the sea... The components of the sun differ from those of this earth, for there are certain light and life-giving elements radiating from the sun. Exactly the same elements may exist in two bodies, but in varying quantities. For instance, there is fire and air in water, but the allotted me! asure is small in proportion. They have discovered that there is a great quantity of radium in the sun; the same element is found on the earth, but in a much smaller degree. Beings who inhabit those distant luminous bodies are attuned to the elements that have gone into their composition of their respective spheres."" (Divine Philosophy, pp. 114-115) The nature of extraterrestrial life remains elusive, but it's clear that there are creatures in the universe that have similar intellectual powers and spiritual perception that humans have on earth. Given the infinite time span of the universe, it's obvious that other planets have gone through a similar process of evolution with Manifestations of God guiding them through various stages of unity until a universal cycle culminates in a planet-wide unity, which is the transition to a new era, a new universal spiritual cycle of the planet. Other planets have progressed past that cycle into further cycles that are beyond the dimmest comprehension of humans at this time.  The Adamic cycle began about six thousand years ago, and its supreme Manifestation is Baha'u'llah. The Baha'i cycle will span half a million years, and Manifestations of God will appear about every thousand years during that time.

I ended up watching it for a while as it moved slowly, bits of dull light trailing off from the main light going the other way it was moving.  It stayed moving in the same area then would slowly go back to being next to the first star area then move slowly again and spin and circle but the extra lights would only come off he main one when it was going in circles. The main dull light though would get dulled but kind of spark-glow, I don't know the words to describe it. When it would unglow I thought it was going behind a dark cloud but there are no clouds but I also don't know why the moon isn't out on this side of the house tonight as it's super low lately so there's no clouds,  Turns out after what feels like forever, it's actually a really hard to focus on black moth like thing with a light at the point, but I selected triangle (for shape of craft) cause it's kind of like that but had the build of being bigger than I should of seen and it was terrifipying to realise and the shape was only visible occasionally and it was bigger than the main light entirely.  Not boomerang shape, like the ones I tried to look for online to help with this.  I'd say a moth but the type of body that is furry and it's just sat on your curtain chilling but almost letting its wings hang. Like a guitar pick too. The bottom end was actually the lights trailing off and not disappearing but just being at the bottom. I went inside and talked to housemate briefly who asked why I'd been outside so long, they said I'd been there about half an hour, I thought it was only cigarette length (they usually burn out after 5minutes), ran upstairs, switched off my lights and went under the curtains and watched the light thing for more. Probably unrelated but I stopped because the police turned up with torches and started shining them into the field from the car park and then into my face and I got really angry and showed my face at not wanting light pollution and by the time they left I couldn't see the huge cloud-light-glow anymore. I first went out around 18:15 cause I'd just come home from work. I put 1-3 for witnesses because there were two community support officers. I live near an army camp which is one of the biggest in the country and is also particularly famous for its tank museum (cannot be differentiated between several in the country so this is OK to list) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I slowed the car as we approached, to almost a full stop and found that we were directly under the glowing area of the object.  I looked carefully at this and can describe it as looking through a distorted lense.   There was a lot going on in terms of changing colors and shapes however I believe I observed an appendage or a mast of some sort that appeared to be generating the mist or distortion that was shrouding the remainder of the object.  This was very weird and very strange and distance perception seemed to be distorted.   I disengaged my eyes from the object, pulled onto Cherrywood Dr. and my son and I exited the car to get a better look however the object was gone.  My wife expressed concern that a man on the sidewalk was staring at us so we got back in the car, turned it around, turned right back onto Textile Rd. and continued eastbound.   Shortly after turning back onto Textile we again acquired the object this time further to our east moving north and crossing over Textile road.  As we got closer the object changed direction and begain moving in a northeasterly direction darting from side to side as it moved along.  The object simply then vanished.

He pointed out what he was looking at and said two of these identical objects had flown over already.  The lights were inside (sic.  outside?) the house, and he was sitting closest to the window, so the objects were visible beyond the reflections in the glass at night.

There were a total of four objects that were observed outside, with a fairly large space in between.  All objects were flying in single file.   During this time I grabbed my cell phone off the table we were sitting at and started recording.  The objects made no sound as approaching or departing our field of view.  Each object emitted a white flickering light.  As the last of the objects was coming into view, we all ran inside through to the front of the house to see what they were doing on the other side; all the while recording.   The objects appeared to fan out in the distance and disappear from view.  We approximate that the altitude of the objects is around 500 feet up and they may have been automobile sized objects, but was hard to discern as only light from the object was observed. There were no vehicle traffic sounds drowning out any sound that may have been coming from the objects.

This event took place back in the late 70's…'77-'78 would be best guess.   First off i am not a witness i decided to put it out there after i had a talk with my father at dinner one evening and asked if he remembered if these things happened.  He said wow i cant believe you remembered that.  Basically it invovled my aunt, uncle and my cousins total of 6 in their family.  It took place on a friday evening probably 9 to 10 pm it was dark out no moon in the sky they lived on a farm outside of Xenia, Ohio.  My family would visit alot on the weekends and in the evenings they would have a fire out cook outs, etc..  Well that night they was all outside when this thing came in and lit up the night like it was daylight and crashed into the huge Oak tree that sat out by the lane that leads to the road.  The farm sits way off the road maybe 500 yards or so.  They all freaked out and ran inside house. They first thought the soviets launched nukes and WW3 had started.  After awhile wh! en nothing else happened my uncle with a flash lite went outside to investigate.  He noticed a smell in the air and really dense fog bank coming from the area of the oak tree.  He walked closer and started to hear a sound which he likened to bacon frying in a skillet.  Which turned out to be the tree sap being boiled which also explained the smell in the air.  He tried to find the tree in the fog bank to makesure it wasn't  on fire when he first saw the lights that were pulsing around the edge of the sauser like a heart beat.  I remember him saying it was 12 to 20 ft in diameter and circular.  He ran back inside the house and called the cops which i am guessing would have been the greene county sheriffs dept.  While waiting on the cops to show up they were looking out the front windows and thought they saw little tiny people moving around in the fog.  I do remember my uncle saying he saw the tiny beings along with my aunt.  When the cops showed up my uncle took the officer to where ! he also saw the lights up in the tree.  The cop said i have no ! idea wha t this is.  They went to his car and he radioed dispatch to call the AFB in Fairborn, Ohio, which is about 20 miles to the west. The dispatch was told by someone at Wright Patterson to order the officer to makesure everyone stays inside the house along with him until they arrive. Once the airforce showed up they arrived in a personnel van, a car which was similar to the cops car but military police and atleast 1 double axle flatbed Truck with a cranelift mounted right behind the cab. He said the ariforce people walked around the area carrying boxes which turned out to be radiation detecters. After awhile an airforce person came insdie and told them that it was ball lightning that hit the tree and that there was a significant amount of radiation in the area and that it was not safe for them to stay. They was told they would be put up in a motel in fairborn for the night and then brought back after 5pm the next day. So thats when my aunt called my parents to make sure they could ! just stay with us in Enon,Ohio. They was dressed in jumpsuits because of the radiation and driven to my house in Enon. My parents told us kids that our cousins were stayin the night. I just remember as a child at around 8 or 9 years old the 2 Airforce vehicles that pulled into our driveway. The Personnel van with alot of windows and the MP car I want to think the van was maybe a dodge and i also remember the color of it was a flat blue with Airforce insig on the doors. This comes from what i remember sitting around the dinning room table and listening to my uncle ranting and raving about what they saw. I remember him telling my dad that this was not ball lightning and he knows it was a ufo and the airforce was recoving it. The next day my dad and him went back after 5pm just them. My dad said the yard was trashed from the trucks around the tree. The tree was still standing  but was dead and he said they saw little tiny boot prints in the field next to the tree and also mili! tary boot prints like they was chasing or rounding them up.  My! aunt wa s so freaked out by the tiny people she wouldnt return until sunday and i bet they ended up moving to fairborn within a few months after the event.  I know this probably sounds totally to good to be true but this is what i remember.  I do not have a tight family i haven't talked to my aunt in probably 2 decades now. My uncle passed away probably in the early 90's.  Well thats it I wonder if someone that really investigates these sorts of things like mufon ect. could find out if there was anything that might have happened in that area and time period..

It was then that I saw something just silently hauling ass in a near perfect westward direction. At first I thought it must be a third bird but I also noticed it was lighter in color and seemed to be moving incredibly fast and like I mentioned in a perfect line westward.

I've been in the military and it did not resemble any fighter jet mannerisms! at all.

There was no chemtrail or exhaust if you will.  This had to all of it take less than a minute of actual viewing of the craft. Like I stated it was hauling ass and so perfectly straight.  That stood out to me a lot for some reason.  The craft also was a light grey/silver in color it seemed and I also recall that it had that metallic sheen to it somewhat reflecting the sun light to some small degree and it was doing so correctly in relation to the sun's current position in the sky.  It actually took longer for the facts of what I saw to finally click than the event itself lasted lol.  It was incredible plain sight clear day..  I only wish I had grabbed my phone camera but it was so so fast the moment would have been lost trying to fumble! with the phone and zooming in etc.  It's memory was so vivid and intense that I just had to find out if anyone else saw it and I've never thought of reporting one let alone seeing one.

I was driving down a part of route 1 when I looked out the window and noticed some lights in the near distance in the sky.  There were two bright bluish-white lights on either side of the object, and then a flashing white light in the middle/front.  For a minute, I figured it had to be a plane - the two lights on either side and the flashing light looked almost exactly like how a plane would look flying at night, and I thought I could make out the shape of the two wings on either side.  But something was still really strange about it. 	As I kept driving, I noticed the object seemed too close to the ground to be a plane.  York is only a town over from an airport, so it's not abnormal to see planes that aren't very high in the sky because they're taking off or landing.  But this object was WAY lower in the sky than any plane I've seen, so that really had me questioning whether it was actually a plane. Then, as I got even closer, I realized that if this thing was a plane, how could I have been getting so close to it. If this thing really was a plane, it would have been gone long before I could have even questioned whether it was a plane.  But I kept getting closer and closer to it. That's when I started thinking maybe it was some tower with lights (also not an uncommon thing to see, but not something I had ever seen on this road before). 	When I finally caught up to it, I kept looking straight up at it and I thought it was a tower of some sort for sure. It didn't look like it was moving, so I thought ""case closed"".... Until it started matching my speed.  This is when I really started to freak out a little. Towers obviously don't move, but I have NEVER in my life seen a plane FLOAT and then go as slow as a car.  I also noticed that it had very similar plane-like features such as what looked like wings, but it also looked somewhat like it had multiple edges to it. What really got to me was the fact that I felt like it was almost following me.  It was moving almost exactly at the same speed as me and going in the same direction.  Then, I finally made a turn onto another road, and then I freaked out even more because the object started going in the same direction as me again!

When I finally got out of my car at my destination, I noticed a lot of dogs were barking and making noise, which only amplified the strange feeling.  	This experience was really strange and scary.

Today at 6pm [sunset] from Hermosa Beach Pier I saw an object over Palos Verdes peninsula. This object was brightly lit with a solid  green light that then turned into a solid red light. It was headed east [off the ocean] within 45 second it cross the Palos Verdes peninsula [20 miles]. It then landed bottom of the Palos Verdes hill. The Lights- Typically all FAA aircraft have blinking light[s] of some sort not solid bright light. also, The distance from me was approximately 10 miles and these lights were quite large. I'm down in Hermosa Beach often and it is very common to see helicopters overhead. This object's lights were larger that helicopter lights. Speed- The object traveled approximately 20 miles within 45 second then came to abrupt stop to then drop down straight down.  Although it didn't seem high off the ground it was just about parallel with the top of Palos Verdes which has a elevation of 1457ft.  It could have been easily flying at an elevation of 1300ft. where it landed close to sea level so it easily dropped over 1000ft within 4-6 seconds it landed on the edge of Palos Verdes/Redondo/Torrance area. The object could have been a drone or some known aircraft but the lights was seem to big and it's precision and speed made me skeptical.

I first noticed the two orange spheres (one above the other) on the far west side of the airport when I was driving past the exit before airport rd. airport road on the north side of 22 is where the airport (west side)Lehigh - Northampton Airport Authority / 3311 Airport Road/Allentown, PA, 18109 /1-800-FLY-LVIA and the state trooper barracks m (east side) is located.  Trooper Address: 2930 Airport Rd, Bethlehem, PA 18017 Trooper Phone:(610) 861-2026. At a distance, when I first noticed them, they didn't catch my attention as anything out of the ordinary.  I used to live in an apartment complex behind me a ways and I saw air traffic all the time. But as I got closer I realized these two things had no body to them, also as a side note there was zero air traffic going on before, during, or after the event.  The best I could see them because of trees getting in the way, they were encircling the airport complex from the west side over the south side and hangar area to where I was on the southeast side right above the corner of the complex near the clover leaf ramps. This is the only part I'm going to go out on a limb with because at the moment I pulled off on the side of the road on the exiting ramp, the two objects which had been moving quickly had now nearly stopped. the bottom object just before this.. sorry I should mention they had been in a uniform position together up to this point one above the other.. the bottom object had broken away from the top one and was moving about just a little bit, going out and coming back into this formation.  As they had slowed way down to almost now hovering a good football field height above the ground and almost the same distance away from me at about a 2'o clock from my windshield, out of the corner of my eye to the north, right side of me through my passenger window, the state barracks m helicopter was lighting up and taking off of the pad.  I ""think"" these two objects with their slow down were responding to helicopter churning up and leaving the ground.  Of course, maybe. This is when I quickly unbuckled, shifted to the passenger seat, had my hand on the iPhone which was all wired up to the truck to listen to music.  By the time I had sat down and was looking out of the window these two objects had broke formation and were next to each other by perhaps 3 times the distance from one another as they were in the original formation. They were now on the north side of the field well past race street.  That's a distance of about a mile roughly in the 3 seconds it took me to switch seats and regain visual on them.  They then disappeared into the cloud bank. At the same time the helicopter was just banking in their direction and heading in that direction. After the banking,  the helicopter shut off all lights including any flashers.  They had no flashers even when they ""went after"" these things into the low cloud bank. I watched for a little while longer but I'm on a time crunch with my delivery and had to go. So two things before I finish..  One, the orange spheres were beautiful. the orange was like looking into a ball of sodium light.. but also, not like looking into a street sodium light..  The color was the same, except it had that alive/electric look to it that perhaps looking into the center of a lit sparkler would have.  They also had a red plasma/lightning rippling effect over the balls..  That's why it was twinkling when I saw them at distances.  There were other people that were not only pulled over like the two cars at the top shoulder of the ramp.. but the right lane of airport rd. heading north before the airport/barracks light had completely stopped under them.  I don't know why else these people would be stopped in either places. Like all of my experiences with this phenomenon, another one for the books.   Thank you Mr. Davenport for all you do.. remember, there are a lot of us out there that depend on you for what you do.  I believe this is one of the most important issues in our society. It's a huge shame so little of us are paying attention to it.  I promise to report everything I see from now on.  This job in the middle of the night gives me a huge chance to catch these things.  I should really invest in a fish eye go pro!!",2016-02-11T00:00:00,40.60203012295082,-75.50084323770493

I took the dog out for a walk around 8:00 p.m.  I stopped to check on my neighbor.  He said that he was watching a UFO.  I could see it as well.  It was an extremely large light that appeared well above the skyline near the Mahoning County border.  He said that he could see windows around the bottom of the craft.  He pointed out a second craft that I could see as well.  Both crafts looked to be the size of a football field.  My neighbor and I agreed upon size. We discussed that we had both noticed these two craft hovering in our area for several weeks.  My neighbor said that he had informed the police and a local business over who were also watching the craft.  They left due to the frigid temperatures.  That was a few days ago.  This evening was warm, so we were able to watch it for a great length of time.  The flight pastern would just float and hover.  My neighbor said that it would nightly make a large circle around Carson Salt Springs Road. I tried to take several photos using my cell phone.  However, my cell phone suddenly died as if the battery was dead.  I tried to turn to it on, and I saw that the battery was in the red.  I ran back to my place to plug the phone in and it came on as showing that the battery was nearly fully charged.  I ran back and tried it again and it died.  My neighbor said that the same thing happened to him.  He went into his place to retrieve his camera. I called a family member to inform them of the sighting.  I eventually went home.  However, the two objects remained in the sky when I left.  My neighbor left to get a police officer from a neighboring town.",2016-02-26T00:00:00,,

As I was Walking back form my garage to the house, I noticed a strange cloud formation east of the house, at first I thought it was a con trail, but as I looked at it I realized it was some other formation, it did not look like any cloud formation I had ever seen; it was several miles long and narrow like a contrail, but there was no variation in the optical density it looked more like it had been painted white in a north, south orientation. As I studied this formation I noticed a faint circular light approaching the north end from the east, it got increasingly brighter until my first thoughts it was the day time moon then I realized it was moving to quickly for the moon as it touched the north end of the cloud it looked like the daytime moon in shape, size and intensity. I started fumbling for my cell phone then realized the orb was changing in color and appearance so I just watched transformation which happened in seconds I was not able to get a photo.  The final stage: concentric wavy rings started to form and the colors went from bright light to yellow and reds then appeared to implode with a flash. The orb was gone along with the cloud there was some remnants of the cloud left on the south end which I got a photo.
