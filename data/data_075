The entire parameter ((sic. Perimeter)) of the craft was outlined in bright white lights.   It was hanging low in the sky and was immobile.  One flashing white light was pointed towards WPAFB and was blinking on and off.  I could not detect the color of the craft as it was dark outside.  It almost looked like it was black or invisible but could detect an outline; like black against a black sky.  The circular craft had a half circle bubble on top of the circular base and that also had lights around the parameter.   I pulled off on the Harshman road exit and pulled my car into the Riverside police station for a better look.  It was hovering right over the overpass very low to the road.  I rolled down my window and could not detect any noise.  I was surprised that no one else was pulling over to view this strange craft as it was so low to the road and very out of the ordinary.   It was about five minutes since I drove upon the craft and pulled over that the craft very slowly descended into the base area until I could not see it anymore.  I relayed these events to my friend and she posted this to her facebook page asking if anyone else saw this.  Two other people wrote back stating they saw the same thing around the same time.  Not sure if this was some prototype from the air force base or if this was something else. Did not see any other airplanes or other crafts around the craft. I will say that twenty years ago when I was ten years of age, I saw an identical looking craft above my old house that was located ten miles from the sighting previously stated.  It was around the same time at night.  It had the same blinking white light that flashed into my bedroom blinking on and off for ten or fifteen minutes.  The blinking light made rectangle shapes on my bedroom walls.  I brushed it off as car lights until I noticed the blinking lights weren't stopping.   I looked out the window and saw the same circular craft with lights around the parameter (sic.  Perimeter) hovering very low to the ground not making any noise.  It frightened me and I ran and told my parents.  Of course, it was gone by the time they came to investigate.

At first I thought they were just stars that were closer to earth then the others - that's why it looked like they were flickering, or maybe even a couple of air crafts - but then they started to move slowly to the west.  It looked like they were floating in the air, just moving next to each other in one straight line.  They're white lights suddenly changed to red, and there was about a 3 seconds gap between each flicker of each object.

Passing only what looked like a couple of kilometers, 2 more hovering object appeared.   The 3 objects just kept hovering up in the sky without any movement at all, and kept flickering.

Four friends and I were using ambient light night vision goggles on the beach of Anastasia park in St. Augustine, FL on Saturday January 28th at 11:00 pm.  I was gazing into the stars when something moving extremely fast, crossed my vision. I wouldn’t have thought much of it however, the objects were only visible though my night vision goggles and appeared closer than any of the other stars I was observing. The next thing I noticed was the shape that these lights where arranged. The 1st object had 5 lights arranged in the shape of an elongated triangle.  This object flew at approximately 80 deg angle over our heads so I was able to get a direct view of the bottom.  The other object was in the same shape but flying at a further angle. It had to be flying at about 45 deg over our heads, which skewed the shape into a staggered linear arrangement of the same lights.  They were in my line of vision for approximately 3 seconds before they disappear from view. They were flying in the north bound direction and came from the south .I had just enough time to pass the goggles to a friend who caught the tail end of their flight and agreed it was not like any of the other stars in the sky. Both objects were in front of the other stars because the shape around the lights blocked out the other stars it was flying in front of. Meaning the outline the 5 lights made on the 1st object was a dense shape and the lights were not flying separately, they were apart of a whole shape.   Five minutes after spotting these objects and getting the other four friends to point their goggles to the sky another single light (the same size/type of the lights on the other two objects) followed in the same direction and speed as the previous sighting.  It couldn’t have been a satellite because they revolve around our equator with a flight path more like east to west.

After chasing it and loosing it, we return to near our home where we found it again hovering nearby as if it was waiting for us. We chased it again and it did the same thing and towards the same direction; towards Boston.  After finally giving up again, it was coming along side us, backing straight up (the long end of the triangle rather than the point)and waiting to see if we would continue again until it decided to move off after seeing we had lost interest.

At first sighting I was not sure of its movement and suspected based on its color that the object might be the planet mars, as I was unsure of its exact coordinates tonight.   At second sighting it had moved slightly more to the south and I figured it was definitely a planet, though I still observed both what seemed to be an up and down bobbing motion and a change between red and white lights that seemed to imply a rotational motion. My third sighting I observed the object for the longest period of time, since it had now gone far to the northwestern quarter of the sky and both the bobbing and the phasing of colors was far more apparent. I could only see the lights still and with little other info, I could  not ascertain the size or shape or distance of the object.  Eventually, after bobbing like what seemed to be lower and closer, it stayed white and became a more stable and less bright point of light. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of a celestial body.

On Monday, March 12, 2012 he was diving east to my house for late night work on some of his project deadlines.   He told me that he saw some very bright points of light low in the eastern sky at approximately 8 PM PST.  Upon arrival we both went outside the house looked in the sky and located Mars and the planet Venus high in the Western sky but I did not see anything unusual. On Wednesday, March 14, 2012, the same thing happened but this time we both went upstairs in my bedroom that has a large window facing directly east.  This time I did observe at least 3 points of light at different and varying brightness from approximately 8PM to 8:30PM.  My observation was as follows:  (1)The objects were orange I and varied in brightness from brighter than Venus to the brightness of Mars.  There was no change in color, but the objects could suddenly vanish and reappear in a different place and could vary in brightness.  Most of the time they were about 15 – 20 degrees above the horizon (about one half of the angular height of Mars.)   (2) Since I used 5x50mm binoculars I could observe only one object at a time.  Because of trees and houses across the street there was limited areas that allowed for view much below 10 degrees above the horizon.  I will report only the movement of one bright object because the others had similar motion. (3) At times the object would stay totally still in one place for as long as 5 minutes and then would move.  I could tell that because it was either close to a given branch of a tree or the roof of the house across the street.  The movement was usually to the left or right and less often vertically (up or down).   The speed varied in reference to fixed, nearby object.  It would move (sometimes accelerated) then stop or even disappear.  At times there was only one object visible at other times at least three.  I repeat again, these were more or less points of light whose size could not be estimated and therefore the distance could be millions of miles from the earth.  If that were the case then the speed at which they moved would be extremely fast. In the early '60’s I was a navigator for USAF.  In that period we depended on celestial navigation and I was intimately familiar with all of the bright stars (by name) and position of the planets at different seasons.  Later I acquired advanced degree in physics and worked for USAF as a research scientist, engineer and on various code name space programs such as GPS.  I can truly say that this observation was most interesting and strange.  I cannot call these objects UFO’s because the objects could be well outside the earth atmosphere where we normally do not use the term ""fly.""

I had walked to the side of my home and was looking up at the sky while my dog was busy.  I was looking into the North West sky.  I was looking at what I believe was Jupiter and Venus.  The moon was in a last quarter phase so there was adequate moon light pollution.  As I switched my gaze to the West I saw what I thought was a very large white bird flying across the sky.  If anyone has ever seen the beauty of white birds flying in the moonlight then you would probably know what I am describing.  As I focused on this thing I quickly saw it was not a bird (I am getting teary and shivery thinking about it).  The UFO was triangle shaped and was travelling with one point of the triangle leading the direction of flight.  There were three small steady red, somewhat dim lights.  One light was in each corner of the UFO.  There was a distinct hull of some sort.  The closest thing I can compare the body t! o is one of those triangle break down reflectors large trucks carry.  It seemed as though the center portion of the triangle was either missing or very black.  It was like a triangle in a triangle.  There was no sound that I could hear.  The altitude was hard to tell.  The UFO blocked out light from the stars as it passed overhead.  The UFO took about 10 seconds to cross the night sky.  I do not know if it disappeared or because the lights on it were so dim I lost it in the light pollution over Minneapolis.  I also do not know if it just appeared when I first saw it or if it was moving into the moonlight where I could see it.  I am a middle aged mechanical engineer and a intermediate star gazer.  I am not excited easily.  As I watching this I was shivering, hairs on my neck were up and I wanted to cry.  When I think about this my eyes water.  I do not know if I am scared or excited because I have never felt this way when reflecting on an event.  Nothing I have ever seen has! made me feel this way.  I have seen other things in the sky b! ut this takes the cake.  I immediately drew it on paper once I was back in the house.  I showed my wife.  She was concerned.  She has never seen me act this way before.  I am so drawn to this I feel I need to write this.  I believed from a young age in UFO's.  I am very scientific and enjoy advanced Physics.

December 9, 2011. I was sitting on my sofa watching TV, I noticed a very bright red light in the sky.  Bright enough that it distracted me from the movie.  There is a tree line across the street and the light seemed to come up from behind them.  The light was gaining altitude very slowly and the red light was pulsing.  I did not hear any noise or sounds.  There is a helicopter pad about 1-2 miles from my house.  I am very familiar with the sounds and lights as they often do night flights.  This red pulsing light immediately got my attention because it was much brighter than any of the lights I have seen from the helicopters over the past 10 years and because I have only seen much smaller white lights on the helicopters. The red pulsing light was much brighter and much larger even though it was not directly above my house.  When I saw it it seemed to move towards my house and then changed directions and moved in a north western direction. It moved quickly away and the light dimmed and went out.  I resumed watching TV and about 2 minutes later saw it again and in the same exact pattern, first moving up or gaining altitude as it moved towards my house and then away.  My son and I went outside and heard no noise at all. It was 11:30 pm and very quiet outside. When the light just went out suddenly we waited a few seconds and then returned inside.

I noticed it was a very clear night, and saw what I thought to be Jupiter, simply because it was the most prominent object in the sky.  I glanced at it for a second or two, then proceeded to my car. As I finished replacing the floor mats in my car and locking it up, I then proceeded to walk back towards the house, once again looking up in the sky in a east-southeasterly direction.  I noticed that the object that I assumed to be Jupiter, was now moving in a westerly direction at a speed similar to commercial aircraft. However, the main reason I believe this was a UFO, was because the light was much more prominent than any aircraft lights, and there were no marker lights on the wings (red and blue commonly seen).  There was also absolutely no sound. I tracked the object for about two minutes until our trees got in the way. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I went out, with another of my neighbour, to her place and we found her in a shocked position.  She asked us to see up and we saw 2 oddly shaped things flying in the sky.  They looked like a box but their shape did not match that of a typical box i.e. cube or cuboid.   Another thing we noticed was a circular disc of white colour vertically around that orange coloured box.  Any seperate features like doors or windows were not visible.  Both these box-like planes moved, infact rotated on its circular ring (like a ball), at a constant speed of about 300kmph.  We could guess their speed because of an aeroplane which was about to land at the Chandigarh airport, and these things passed from right in front of that plane.  Distance between them and the airplane at the nearest point would definitely had been less than a thousand feet.  They were at equal height with that plane and produced no noise at all.   Their size was more or less equal to that plane (height more than the plane but lesser in length).  Their flying path was north-south while airplane's path was east-west.

I wouldn't have given it a second look until I noticed a sharp blue color radiating from the light source.  My wife and I then stood outside our home and observed the object which constantly changed from red to bright blue, and briefly to white.  It seemed to move slowly around in a small circle for several turns before moving a short distance across the sky and repeating the process.  We continued to observe the object until it went below the tree line in the distance.  There was no sound, and normal air traffic was visible in the area which made it easier for us to quickly determine that it wasn't a plane.  As I stated before, its ability to fade from vibrant red to blue is what made this object stand out to me.  I could tell it was at a relatively  high altitude due to the fact that it would become briefly obscured by a nearby cloud.  I have ! never observed an object moving through the sky in such a manner, and clearly have no idea what we saw.

(I am a ten year navy veteran who worked on an aircraft carrier and flight line.)   I quickly got up to and rushed to the window and I observed a large array of lights in the sky flying right over our house heading northeast moving rather quickly.  The array of lights appeared to be about ¼ to ½ mile or more in length at about ½ to ¾ mile from the ground.  I initially saw a long row of white flashing light, in an inverted ""Chevron"" pattern; I couldn’t initially count how many lights because I was looking out a window with a screen on it.  But the flashing lights had no distinct flashing pattern to them but they did have with intermittent red/orange being trailed by two other white lights from behind that were not flashing at all. But, what was weird was that as each of the larger white lights flashed there came sparkling white lights all around that specific light that resembled light sparkling from a sparkler.  But I could not discern a distinct shape from my vantage point. During this time my wife ask me if I could hear the noise it was making and it was at this point I noticed a faint, low, dull, continual roaring sound.  My wife and I quickly ran to our back yard sliding door to get a better look at this thing or things.  By the time we reached and opened the back door I could faintly hear the sound which was growing fainter and it was at this time I observed the array of lights and it was at this point I could see five distinct larger lights with this barrage of sparkling lights all around them. My wife reported that what she saw was five distinct lights surrounded by these strange sparkling lights but she claims that these lights in a ""Chevron"" pattern were not flying as to be pointing to the horizon, as a squadron of jets would fly, but the point of the chevron was pointing to the ground as they fly over her!  This seemed weird to me.   We observed that all the lights were moving at the same rate of speed and because it was a dark night we could not tell if it was a single aircraft or multiple aircraft.

NOTE:  The ""orange light"" looks just like the one on your homepage from the Rense Radio show (NJ sighting). Man spots UFO in Monroe, CT.  October 11, 2011  The newsroom recieved the following account from a reader who said he spotted a UFO in Monroe, Connecticut:  Witnessed (along with a stranger who’d parked her car in front of my driveway to jump out of the car and witness it as well) the event described below over the sky of Monroe tonight and can discern no viable explanation. When:  Tuesday, 10/11 @ appx 9:00 PM EST  Where:  Fan Hill Road, Monroe, CT outside (from WSW sky below treeline to NE sky directly overhead)    Duration:  approximately 5 minutes from first sighting the lights til they passed, reverting the sky back to darkness    Event:  7-10 red/orange lights of undulating brightness (like fire) appx 1/16 to 1/8 diameter of a full moon and brightness equivalent to Venus or a low-flying plane light. All lights sat motionless in sky in a formation pattern roughly a rectangle or triangle--or a pattern with even spacing among all lights that just hung in the sky, covering a large portion of the sky overhead.   Then entire formation began moving as one object (from a complete stop in the sky) generally NE in direction before all lights went dark nearly simultaneously. Planes were overhead after the event and their plane engines could be heard  but during event lights in question generated no sound whatsoever.  Complete Silence.  Initially suspected these to be meteor shower but they were below the cloud cover and quite a bit larger than any meteor I’ve ever seen and no trail left as they moved. After initial formation moved and disappeared, an additional 4-6 lights came, single file and well spaced, across the sky from the WSW one after another towards where the first formation had disappeared and each proceeded to disappear as it reached that general destination.  All were the same size as the others.   After flying  After that the sky was dark and clouds could be seen with patches of sky/stars showing thru and plane in the far distance, which could be heard, but no residual evidence of the lights. Again, it was completely silent during this light formation motion. Absence of any sound and a combination of stationary lights coupled with movement makes a plane/fireworks/meteor explanation questionable.  Same as for ball lightning, swamp gas ignition, etc. all of which I’ve seen before and this did not match any of them. Note: On after sighting report to local police:  Monroe police said the lights were caused by rice paper candles lit by kids behind a local church.  The children lit candles under rice paper bags.  When ignited, the bags flew into the sky.)    Note: I (the woman cited above) took photos w/ my cell phone be I do not seemed to have captured the ""orange light ball.""

I have an interest in astronomy and am always watching the skies.   On Wed. night, Oct. 12 around 8 PM, I was at a beachfront house in Ocean Isle Beach, NC facing East observing the full moon and lightning flashes far out to sea.  I began a 20 minute Video recording with my Sony SR11 AVCHD camera to record the distant lightning which according to a weather website was over a hundred miles out to sea.  During my recording, I captured about a dozen total orange glowing stationary lights similar to lights I observed on three separate nights last June while at the same beach.   In June, the lights would stay on for up to 30 seconds and sometimes rotate around each other.  This time, they would light up for only a few seconds before fading out.  The orange lights appear as white on the video due to camera low light limitations.   Note that Myrtle Beach, SC, is just south of Ocean Isle and I have read multiple reports of orange glowing lights recently from that more populated tourist area. My video is aimed  East looking down the beach.  Among the recognizable items are a neighbor’s  white stairs to the beach, A lighted bouy about a mile away, a flashing beacon to the left which I think is Brunswick Co airport about 20 miles away.  Old Baldy lighthouse on Bald Head Island is visible flashing to the right which is about 25 miles away.  In the sky the full moon is a somewhat fuzzy large orb and the planet Jupiter is constantly visible to the lower left of the moon. There are 5 separate times from the video beginning that had one or more lights appear and fade out. They are at the 2:52, 4:12, 12:33, 18:50, and 19:20 marks.

Then, before I turned to leave, I saw lights flashing in the sky going in an approximately S-SW direction.  The lights were very small, so I figured it was high in the air, because it didn't look that far away by land.  The lights were red, white, and blue, with the white lights showing up more frequently.  They were in a random order, the colored lights never being in the same location.  I could not see a craft of any sort attached to the lights at first.   Then I noticed a circle that the lights were attached to on one end following the lights.  It was the same color of the sky (a dark, almost grey-blue, as it was almost dusk).  It moved steadily across the sky until it left my view.

A party of approximately 10 people were enjoying an evening at a cabin on the east side of nearby Cedar Lake, approximately 3 miles east of Annandale, MN.  We were launching small fireworks from the dock, facing West.  There were very few clouds at the time. Someone called our attention to a pair of lights approximately 3 miles West by Southwest over the vicinity of Annandale.  At first, the objects appeared to be landing lights of approaching aircraft.  However, the objects were orange in color, had no other lighting (no markers or strobes), appeared about 400ft apart, held an elevation of approximately 2000ft, and did not seem to move.  The object to the south appeared about 100ft lower than its companion, at an approximate elevation of 1900ft. Minutes later, both objects began slowly moving South.  Both objects maintained their brilliance as they moved, suggesting that their light was shining in all directions.  (An airplane's landing light should have dimmed slightly if it changed direction.)   At this point, I decided to film what I could of the event using my Google G1 cell phone camera.  Unfortunately, the camera requires ample light to work correctly, and the objects were too distant against the night sky. The southern object traveled somewhat faster than its companion, a distance of about 1000ft, then stopped and hovered again, partially obscured by a cloud.  Then, it slowly sank in elevation about 50ft, then seemed to disappear instantly. The northern object traveled South about 1000ft towards its companion, maintaining altitude, never changing course or speed.  It became obscured behind the same cloud as its companion.  It did not re-appear from the other side of the cloud. The resulting footage shows approximately 5 seconds of the northern object, but it appears only a few pixels wide.  The audio contains brief commentary by myself and one other eyewitness during the event. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrkNoOL7dgE",2011-08-21T00:00:00,45.2603,-94.1308

Very quick. On Saturday, August 13th, 2011, I was outside on my balcony with my roommate, facing east, at around 9:30 PM.  She saw an object in the sky to our left (north) and asked me if it was a bag blowing by above us.  I looked, and at first it seemed like a helicopter without any lights and no blades.  I realized it was not a bag or balloon, but I understood her confusion because the object seemed to change shape.  There was no sound - none.  A very, very light rain was falling and we both agree that we could see rain glinting off the side of the object. The object seemed black or dark - matte black, except for an occasional glint of rain on the side.  There was a full moon that night, which was visible on and off through the clouds.  The object seemed to have what I can only describe as a rudder, because I don't know what else to call it.  We saw that when the object passed by the moon, but the rudder wasn't always on top because the object seemed to rotate or tumble.  I can't describe the shape because it seemed to change shape.  It had weird edges that we could sort of see in the outline of the moon, and the object was moving pretty fast.  It moved in a straight path - northwest to southeast.  I guess it must have been pretty close for us to notice it was wet.  It never changed course and maintained the same altitude, and we lost sight of it traveling southeast. I am certain it wasn't a plastic bag or a balloon.  Though it seemed to change shape, it seemed solid and it was not undulating like a bag or ascending and bobbing like a balloon.  The rudder-thing may have been rotating in an opposite direction of the body, clockwise v. counter clockwise.  I have seen strange orbs before, certainly in this part of IL, and I know my neighbors have seen them too - there are some videos on YouTube.  But I have never seen anything like that black object.  That was totally new to me, and I'd love to get a look at it again.  I am terrible at guessing distance but I know this object was below the clouds that evening.  It did not seem large and it happened quickly - I could only guess that it was bigger than a breadbox but much smaller than a commercial jet.  If I had to guess the path, facing due east, the object emerged at 8:30 and moved out of sight at approximately 2:30. I think the object was moving pretty fast and the whole thing might have lasted less than 30 seconds.  As I mentioned, I've noticed orbs before so I remained clam as I watched this thing and took brief notes after, and reported them to MUFON.  I would like to know if there is a way to find out if this was a conventional aircraft (flight data?), or what it might have been.  Did anyone else see it?  I live between O'Hare and Midway, and I feel comfortable knowing the difference between commercial aircraft, helicopters, blimps and small airplanes compared to the weird black thing I saw with my roommate. There was a helicopter in the sky to our right when we saw the object, which is very normal - there is a flight path to O'Hare over my neighborhood.  It is not unusual to see several helicopters at the same time in this area.  We also saw a commercial jet come from (approximately) the same place but well behind the object, by miles. I have a neighbor in Forest Park who posts videos on YouTube by the name of ""Guttergawker"".  I have never met him personally, but he has quite a few vids of orbs and things.  I recently came across his vids when I went on-line Sunday morning, to try and find something similar to what I saw on 8/13/11.  He has a sort of s-shaped, boomerang, tumbling black object recorded on a different day.  I don't think it is exactly what I saw, but the tumbling motion is comparable to what I saw.  I have been noticing some unusual lights in our sky lately.  I wonder why.  I don't think they're all satellites.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,41.8683,-87.8205

Three of the lights were in a triangular shape.  They did not blink and were bright red.  The other three were also bright red and did not blink, but they were in the shape of a large, very open V.  They appeared to hoover over RR Donnelly’s.  Huge!   We got back in the car so we could get closer.  As I drove we lost sight of the lights because of the line of trees along the railroad tracks.  Once our view was clear again there was only one red light and it quickly disappeared.  They didn’t seem to speed away as much as just disappear.  There were storm/rain clouds to the east and I thought maybe they had moved into the clouds and I could no longer see them. We went home and I called the non-emergency police number and told the woman what I saw and asked her if anyone else had called in concerning red lights in the sky.  She said No. There was, what appeared to be, an airplane flying from east to west in the very same area as the red lights.  I say airplane only because it did have blinking lights.

The full moon was to my back, and I was facing a clear sky with stars. I glanced up and saw a large brightly lit ball traveling across the sky from south to north (slightly southwest to northeast).  At first it had a bright white center that was encased in a red/orange-red outer flame-like rim.  It emitted  a beam of white light both upward and downward in the shape of a paper cup so that it kind of looked like a bow tie tipped on its side.  The downward beam of light was only half as strong as the upward one.  The sides of the beam did not dissipate as would be expected, but had crisp, slightly angled lines.  The top and bottom of the beam did fade as you would expect. I got the attention of the other guests and pointed at the sky. The beams of light turned off simultaneously as if you would flick a switch, and the center became red/orange-red/ pinkish red.  The fiery ball continued to travel across the sky at a steady rate.  It did not change in size, direction, or altitude. It did not emit any sound. It was about 10 degrees off from being completely overhead, and it did not appear to be as high as an airplane. (We have a large airport a few miles from here and we are used to seeing planes coming in for a landing and taking off.)   It was about the diameter of a pencil eraser held at arms length.  Someone in the group thought that it must be a hot air balloon, but I didn’t see a basket below it or a balloon above it when the beams of light were shining. Also, the fiery ball appeared to be larger than a hot air balloon flame.  The overall diameter of the ball did not change, although the intensity of the “flame” varied. (ex. When it got bright! er, it did not appear to get larger.) We observed it for approximately 1-2 min.

Out on the horizon we could see faint orange flashes as more of the lights appeared and started advancing towards us before once again stopping and forming a crude “X” shape for about another 3 minutes.  These shapes soon vanished also but this time one remained. More lights and flashes were observed and another pattern was formed.  All the lights but one vanished.  This light remained stationary for about 5 minutes before disappearing.  There were aircraft in the air at the time but these lights were not anything remotely like a jet plane or helicopter.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,41.3863,-80.8614

There were four of us talking and as I talked to two of my family members standing in front of me I said,” what the heck is that- that doesn’t belong there?”   I saw a bright object that looked about four times the brightness of Jupiter.   It just seemed to appear between the people I was talking with I do not know if it approached further away from when I first noticed it.  The night was fair but clear enough to see the stars of Sagittarius and Scorpio.   The object looked all very brilliant bright white the shape could have been somewhat round but it didn’t look exactly round but very difficult to see exact shape.   Object made no sound, it was a very smooth like movement the way a satellite might move but it was much lower than a sate! llite –the object looked a little lower than An tares which you could see above and to the right of the object which moved from the Southwest near Sagittarius and came towards us over head moving Northeast through far right of Cassiopeia and on eastward till it disappeared the way an airplane would.    I had to run to the side of the building after it went over –my room was on the end of the motel.  There were no other lights visible and no beam or glow protruding from the bright white object.     Now the president was on Marta’s vineyard that weekend so perhaps it was an unusual new aircraft.  Been an armature astronomer for many years,  know what the planets look like where they are and how they move along the ecliptic etc. this was a craft of some sort moving the opposite way the planets move across the sky - the magnitude about  - 4 and largest overhead about 38 – 40 seconds of arc.   It moved about the speed of a slow airplane but nothing else was airplane like.   Let me ! know if anyone else saw this.

This caught me off gaurd because though there is an airport close by, I've never seen any aircraft come from that direction, at least being this low to the ground. continuing down Military road in Tonawanda,NY,  I could see it was coming in my direction and by the time I got to about 400 yards away from the underpass for the I-90 it was passing almost directly over top of my car at I would guess a couple hundred feet and at a speed of around 20-30mph. this object had 3 lights on the belly of the craft  equally spaced out and blinking lights on what at first I thought were wings of a plane but as it passed over I realized it wasn't.  I could see the far side due to lights in a parking lot for the highway department.and what I thought was a wing actually sort of looked like the arms that come off the side of a shrimp boat but I cannot be 100% sure on that due to it being more dark than light out. So,  I arrive at work to punch in at exactly 6am, go back outside to park my car and I can still see it heading towards the lockport area, not the other direction which is where the airport is. and that is when I could see a very bright light turn on, on the right side of it if ur looking at it from the rear. the light turned off then back on and stayed on. it's wasn't a beam of light though. at that point I then watched it until I couldn't see it anymore.

The brightly lit objects were flickering and the colour was changing from orange to red in frequent random flickers.There was absolutely no sound from these crafts(can't be only 'flying lights' for sure)I stay at Domlur, but these UFOs were coming from the Old Airport direction. They were at a distance of 200 meters above the ground.I stay at the 3rd floor, so they appeared even closer.I could say they were moving fast enough to cover the Domlur sky from the right to the left within 1 minute..I called up my wife and asked her to get the camera fast.I took the snaps,which were getting blurred or leaving streaks/trails as it happens when you shoot a moving light with a hand held camera, without a tripod.  So, I took a video as well with my canon automatic.Zoomed 16X to get a closer look, but the lights went far away..  Suddenly my wife pointed out,saying two more are coming.this time I took more videos.  Same uniform speed, coordinated acceleration, and the flickering of lights.  These were followed by another one, and then when I was giving up hope, again two of them appeared, and travelled across the sky.  The airport and the airforce bases are near, so these could be some experimental aircrafts also.

They were quite a bit bigger than the stars, moving around mostly slowly.  One flew faster in a semi-circle around the other, then up and down.  There was no noise, and they gave her a terrified feeling.  I am not sure how long it lasted, because after a min. or so, she was too scared to watch anymore.

On three separate occasions since June 9th, I have seen strange orange lights blink on and off and sometimes maneuver in various patterns. I am an FAA licensed pilot that flies regularly and I am always watching the skies since I also love astronomy.  I have read multiple other reports lately from nearby Myrtle Beach, SC, and Holden Beach, NC of similar orange lights appearing. Let me describe my 3 recent sightings:  6-9-11: I saw at least 4 stationary orange lights blink on and off a few miles out over the ocean around 8 PM.  When I saw the first one , which was due South at about 25 degrees elevation, my first thought was it was  plane switching on its landing light as it was nearing Ocean isle airport.  The light was only on for about 10 seconds and then went out.  Over the next 15-30n minutes, I saw the same thing repeated at least 3 more times in different spots in the same vicinity over the ocean. 6-28-11: This was the most interesting sighting, which was also witnessed by my 15 year old daughter and 13 year old son.  Around 9 PM , my daughter comes inside the house to say she thinks she saw a UFO.  When I go out, I see an orange light near the spot of the one on June 16th and we watch it until it fades out.  For the next hour between periodic orange lights appearing, we also see faint twinkling lights similar to aircraft strobe lights  which randomly twinkle in different spots in the southern sky over the ocean.  They looked similar to aircraft strobes that you can  see on various high altitude aircraft traffic  5 to 10 miles away that are  visible on any clear night.  But these lights were so jumping around so much in the distance, that I was not one aircraft on a set course.  The last sighting that night, was of two orange lights slowing rotating around each other before fading out.  The motion of the two lights resembled what you would see if  a small aircraft was banking its wings at night, except of course both lights were orange instead of one red and one green.  Those two then faded out completely  6-30-11: While sitting outside alone around 9 PM, I am watching the sky over the ocean,  but don't see anything until I glance behind me to the North toward Ocean Isle airport ( which is only a mile away).  Just in an area where you would see an airplane on downwind leg to the airport, I watch a steady orange light cruising over the airport , no sound, for about 15 seconds before fading out completely.  That was the only sighting that night.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,33.9259,-78.4498

The object had a very noticeable red light and an occasional aqua light glimmering off one side. I retrieved my 8x30 Leupold optics which worked amazing.  As the object got closer it became almost transparent.  I would compare it to the look of a jelly fish, Translucent with a notable shape and appearance. I then noticed another object approach from under the first object.  It was the exact same in appearance.  The initial object casted a light which seemed to draw the second object toward it . There was an obvious line separating the two close objects.  This is when a black circle appeared (had a very perfect shape with a light outline) and went back and forth between the two objects.  I would say the black circle was 1/3 the size of the two object together. This went on for only a minute, then the two original objects where one.  I watched this entire event transpiring in amazement.  The now one large circle began to glow.  When it came close enough I was able to see into the shape.  It was almost like veins running throughout the inside.  There were light red and aqua flashes he whole time, some times more intense than others.  I would describe this like a lighting storm contained inside this sphere. This is when the object seemed to pick a path and started moving away and moving upward at a constant but slow pace.  I watched the object until 6am.  When my binoculars were not powerful enough to see detail in simply looked like a flickering yellow star. This was truly an unexplained sighting.

Definitely.So, i stare at it for about a couple minutes because the funny thing about this was that the airplane was not coming straight across like 99% of all planes do around my house.  So, this time the light was traveling vertically not horizontal and that's when i placed a strong concern of what this craft is. So, once i see the light coming above the trees where i can get a better look of what this is, i start to notice that this was not an airplane. As it began to raise velocity over the trees where i could see it better, it looked nothing like a airplane, it looked like a prymaid-like craft that had four likes under it one was red, another, was yellow, and another was white.I new this wasn't a plane because pla! nes don't directly travel through the sky. It didn't shoot up in the sky like normal UFO craft's do because at this time it was late, so no one would have noticed it.  But its a pyrmaid- like craft and it had four lights and it started to travel pretty fast through to the sky.  But the weirdest thing beyond this was that there were three stars in the sky and they were aligned. And as the craft is traveling up, the aligned stars begin to shift to the left of the sky, and its the best way i can describe it. Because the craft was moving at a fast but steady pace, definitely faster than a normal plane or jet fighter or whatever you call it. Fortunately, prior to my evidence, our town doesn't have a jet fighter air crafts. Just nearby airplane cruising areas. But this was amazing, I've never seen anything like this, because i know it had to be something else other than any aircraft that we posess here on this earth.

He said give it about 15 min and I'll go outside to see.  It was still there, so he went outside and seen lights, he said it was very slow moving but couldn't see what it was.  I kept looking outside I can still see the lights, and it's been over 2 hours so I know it's not a plane, and the lights are going in a circle.   I was really scared and just watching it.

Then I looked up and see two bright objects that were going really fast towards each other.  I told my sister ""they're about to collide!"" She then looks out and sees them about to collide too. Then right before they hit they turned really fast and started spinning around each other.  We turned East on County Road 42 and pulled the car over at 6:01 eastern standard time and called my mom to report it. We looked out the window as I was talking to my mom and they fly apart and they started to hover. When they were hovering they looked like big bright stars or big balls of light, as if you were looking at a planet (smaller than the moon but bigger than a star and really bright). We sat there for about a minute before pulling away but we were still watching them hover. We watched them for about 5 minutes more before we pulled over again.  We then got out of the car and took some pictures on my sister's phone.  We then got some pizza for dinner and went home. We then went inside and told our parents.  We went back outside and looked into the sky. We showed our parents where we thought there was one UFO still there, we couldn't find the other one. After eating and talking about it, my mom said we could go out to the airport and see if anything has been reported.   So we get back into the car and drive back on 15 going north and turn east onto county road 42 again following the same path as before.  We showed her where we pulled over and then drove on to the airport nearby.  The airport was closed so we went to where the sheriff's dept had been but there was no one to talk to there either.

I noticed that it was much brighter than earlier because the moon was visible in the NE sky (the cloud cover had mostly cleared).  As I was looking northward to see how much the cloud cover had cleared, I noticed a bright orangish light become visible over/between some houses to the NNW of mine.  The light was intensely orange, but not like a flare or roman candle, roughly roundish in shape, and initially was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length (roughly a quarter-inch in diameter).  It initially attracted my attention because it was much brighter than the usual planes and helicopters that fly overhead, and because of the odd color which was unlike the usual air traffic. The light appeared to arc upwards and towards me before moving parallel eastward above two houses across the street, then gained altitude and disappeared to the north.  It was visible for approximately two minutes, moving at a slow, steady pace.  As the light moved eastward, it became more yellow-orange in color (though orange was still the primary color) and seemed to strobe slightly or perhaps flicker like flame. When I first saw the light, I watched it for 20-30 seconds before backing up on my deck to the door and yelling for my wife to come see it too.   She arrived promptly and was able to view it for approximately 45 seconds.  We went back in at 8:04pm after spending roughly 60 seconds after it disappeared watching to see if anything else became visible. After thinking about it overnight, I suppose the object could have been a Chinese lantern.  The light never looked like flame and seemed a lot brighter than that relative to its distance, but I suppose it could have been a glow inside a paper orb.  The apparent direction (SouthEast, East, then North) could have been an illusion and the actual direction more of a straight eastward arc with the light burning brightly at first (thus larger), then lessening (thus seeming to move northwards).  However, if so the launch was pretty much a failure (the lantern would have risen in one neighborhood and burned out in another a mile or so apart).",2011-12-12T00:00:00,38.7843,-94.5457

They would also move around the mountain in a triangular shape then turn all one color.  Orange and red and white where what they would use.

It was July 3rd, starting to get dark, I was outside hoping to see some fireworks from my yard. I saw what I thought was a plane approaching from the east.  I thought I saw a flashing light but realized quickly the whole light was glowing brighter and it was sure not a flashing light like on a little plane... like I am used to seeing. (I am in the pathway of midway airport so very familiar with smaller as well as commercial planes going by.)  I ran inside, dumped my purse, grabbed my camera and managed to take a shaky video.  I was trying to watch it while taking the video.  I did pretty good I thought, I got something.  All I could make out was that it was a bright white to yellow light that pulsed brighter every few seconds and the edges were more orange or red.   This was not a plane.  There was no sound. it seemed to almost drift by and I would have to guess on the height and size because it was getting dark... but a wild estimation I would say it could have been as small as a beach ball or as large as a car, height was higher than the lowest planes I've seen go by, but not very high.  Well the coolest thing happened within a minute!!!!   ANOTHER one came over my yard and followed if not the same exact pathway, pretty darn close to it.  They both came from the east, went over my yard at a slight southwest angle and then I lost sight of them as they went over the trees.  That helps me determine height because if much higher I would have been able to see them further.  Both glowing lights lasted about a minute from the moment I saw them to the moment I lost sight of them.   I am sending my videos taken 2 minutes apart!  Side note:  I did see the Tinley Park Red Ufo lights back about 6 or 7 years ago when thousands of people saw them forming a triangular pattern... so this is the second time I have seen curious lights in the area.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,41.570927272727275,-87.7941956937799

The object appeared as a yellowish redish light and once appeared just stayed in position for 10-15 minutes.   People starting commenting on the strange light drawing more attention to it.  The object neither got closer or further away it just stayed there on the horizon. We had roughly 10 people in our group, but there where well over 100 people there to watch the fireworks (I didn't ask everyone, but I assume most saw the strange object)   We where there together sitting on the beach facing South West, the object was roughly 35-45 degree's in the air and was about half the size of a full moon.    A full range of thoughts and emotions began through the group questioning the origin and exact nature of the object when the fireworks started.  I would turn my head and watch the fireworks, then turn and look at the fireball (I was half afraid that it was a comet heading straight to my location).   I would watch fireworks, then glance back and forth then, the next time I look, the object had disappeared.

As the fireworks were falling there were some orange balls, similar to the ball-like sparks from fireworks that disintegrate in a few seconds, except they moved horizontally across the sky from the north to the south.   We were on the west side of the lake and they were directly overhead moving toward the fireworks and then past them.  There were 3 of them spaced evenly apart and they followed the same horizontal path across the lake but never fell.  (They were about 30 seconds apart.)  We then moved to the south side of the lake to a parking lot to watch the rest.  Again 3 more of these orange objects moved across the sky at the same height, following what looked to be the same path as the first 3 we saw, spaced evenly apart, but this time about 10 seconds apart.  Now they were west of where we were standing.   A few minutes later there were 2 more, again about 10 seconds apart, following the same horizontal path as the other ones did. At first we thought they could be small airplanes or helicopters because of the height at which they were moving, but the more we watched we were convinced they weren’t because they had only an orange glow that in no way flashed.   Because of the noise from the fireworks we could not tell if these objects were making any sound. We have never seen anything like this before.  A few other people, who came near the end, saw the last ones and also wondered what they were.  My husband is the manager of an office beverage service and I am an elementary school teacher.

Bright white trapezoidal objects viewed ascending into clouds over Gulf of Mexico off of Anna Maria Island,Bradenton Beach,FL,2011-07-03T22:10:00,other,45 mins.,"Occurred : 7/3/2011 22:10  (Entered as : 07/03/2011 22:10) Reported: 7/15/2011 6:24:14 PM 18:24 Posted: 7/17/2011 Location: Bradenton Beach, FL Shape: Other Duration:45 mins.",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82492.html,"Bright white trapezoidal objects viewed ascending into clouds over Gulf of Mexico off of Anna Maria Island On the night of July 3rd, 2011, between the hours of 22:00 and 23:00 Eastern Standard Time, a group of us witnessed a very unusual sighting off of Anna Maria Island, on the west coast of Florida.   After fireworks had been launched off the pier around 17:00, there were six of us in a group hanging out on the second floor walkway of our condominium which looks out over the beach and Gulf of Mexico.  There were also two men who were renting a condominium on the first floor who were also outdoors.   Sometime after 22:00, we saw two or three objects take off south of Anna Maria Island, going from east to west, and rising into the sky at a climb rate similar to a small airplane, i.e., approximately 15 to 20 degree incline and moving around 100 to 130 knots.  The interesting thing about the objects was that they had no navigation lights (no red or green wingtip lights or navigational beacons), but instead emitted a steady glow that I would describe as either white, or white with some golden color.  The objects were trapezoidal in shape, with the top sides being longer than the bottom sides, and looked to be about the size of the full moon when they were at their closest point.  They glowed steadily, and moved at what appeared to be a constant rate of speed.   One of the people in the group used to be a pilot, and mentioned that there is a website where you can track aircraft movements.  I remembered that flightaware.com does just that, so I proceeded to look at aircraft movements out of the Sarasota/Bradenton airport for that day.  The last flight had taken off at approximately 8:15 PM, at least two hours before this sighting, and I distinctly remember the aircraft flying overhead, as it was a Boeing 717.  No further flights were recorded after that time, which would indicate to me that the objects were definitely not aircraft coming from that airport, which is the only nearby airport.   When we observed the first group of objects in the sky! , I yelled out ""what the heck is that?""   At that point the two gentlemen that were down below immediately ran upstairs, and said that they saw the exact same thing that we saw.  We discussed what we had seen for approximately 10 min., and then sign another group of objects following the exact same path as the previous objects appeared.  I watched as they climbed to the cloud base, and disappeared into the clouds, just as the previous ones had. I assumed that the objects were very close, within a couple of miles or so, because the base of the cloud looked very low and hung just offshore, as there were thunderstorms in the area within the hour . One of the gentlemen also said that he believed the objects had to be very low, as he saw their reflection in the water.  The objects emitted no detectable noise whatsoever, which was one of the features that were so unusual about them.   During the sighting of the second group of objects, I ran into the condo and got my binoculars.  Although I was only able to lock onto one for about a second and a half, there appeared to be a very distinct thin line surrounding the trapezoid, but not touching it, in the shape of a hot-air balloon.   I immediately handed the binoculars to one of the other gentlemen from downstairs, so that he could see with his own eyes what I was seeing.  He stated that he saw the exact same thing I did. I would normally speculate that the objects were some kind of luminaries, but the fact that the flame or light was fully contained within a trapezoidal shape, along with the speed at which the objects were traveling, makes me believe that there's no such possibility that they were luminaries.   I am at a loss to explain what we saw, but I’m assuming that hundreds of people had to have seen the same thing, as it was a weekend and people had recently been outdoors just a few hours ago to watch the fireworks, and so surely many would have lingered on the beach, or outside on balconies as we had.   I found no writings in the newspaper about the strange lights, and have no clues as to what could be their source.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,27.47785,-82.6935

We had just finished dinner and went to our cabin which had a balcony on the starboard side of the ship on deck 9.  I went out onto the balcony to have a smoke and it was pretty stormy.  Couldn't see any other objects except the sea and the misty dark sky.  All of a sudden a well defined pill shaped object with a dull glow went in a perfectly straight line from the front of the ship to the back.  When it reached the back it took a sudden turn downward and I thought it was going to go into the sea but instead it curved around the back of the ship.  This only took less than 10 seconds from start to finish. Because it turned I estimate that it was only about 100 yards away and approximately 150 feet off the water.  I couldn't believe what I saw and debated whether or not I should report it.  I stayed out on the balcony for about twenty more minutes hoping it would return but it never did.  I told my wife but did not report it to the ships crew because I thought they would think I was some kind of a nut.  I currently live in Las Vegas just 90 miles from Area 51 and I have never seen anything like this before.  I want to be clear that it didn't look metallic.  It was closer to being some kind of dull light or energy but shaped like a pill with crisp edges.  The next night I saw 2 more cruise ships headed back to New York City.  They were lit up all over which led me to believe that the object I described didn't actually emit any light on its own but was iluminated by the lights on our own cruise ship and was just a dark object.

At the time I had a pathfinder with a sun roof that was open.  The hangers and runways were to my left (East).  This is the vicinity that I saw the light in. I have grown up my entire life around the air force base and have been familiar with all kinds of craft, and the lights and how they look at night.  I have lived south of the base, East, North, and West.  I'm familiar with the flight paths.  I was also married to someone in the military.  It would be difficult for me confuse what I saw with any known military air craft.   It had not been dark too long when I saw it. It was sometime around 6 or 7.  My son was in the car but was only around three yrs old.   I looked up toward my Left/East and saw a glowing light.  It was an orange color but almost a white orange, not really a darker orange.  It wasn't a small light that you would confuse with some smaller lights on aircraft.  All I could make of it was that it was a larger, unmistakable light.  I've seen probably 3 or 4 shooting stars as well.  This object would almost resemble a shooting star except that it had no tail at all, it was larger, it was more orange, and it moved MUCH more slowly.  It was so unlike any aircraft or aircraft lights that I didn't even consider it to be this even though it was seen on base.  I immediately thought it was a shooting start, but an instant reaction was.. .I can't see how that could possible be a shooting star either...I've never in my life seen one that slow, without a tail or streak. I thought maybe it was a flare but even flares move faster than that so there is no way.  I'm really not sure what it could have been but it certainly struck me odd enough that I KNEW it was strange and nothing I could reason.  I was surprised  I literally stopped my car in the road and watched it move southwest at an angle through my sun roof. This is the first I've mentioned it in any way.....I never said anything because there wasn't a second witness and figured people would call me crazy.  There was no audible sound.

I was photographing a sun halo over Denmark in Odense city back in October 9th 2009 at 1.37 pm. Around 1.30 pm. I looked out my window in a westerly direction, looked up to the left and saw a halo around the sun. Since it was first time I had the opportunity to photograph a sun halo with my new bought camera, I hurried down to our back yard, put the camera on tripod and took 8 pictures with short intervals.  I was alone and didn´t see anything while I was photographing. I was quickly blinded by the sun and my photosession was quickly settled.  A faintly luminous object, that easily could fell in with the background, had in any case been difficult to discern. It was only later when I looked through the images, that I discovered this unidentified flying object, which only appeared on one of the images.  In the picture, the object appears more cylindrical than cigar-shaped, with distinct curves at each end. The rise in the middle seems to be a kind of flash of light. For me it seems to be a real physical object in 3D.

I have included three photos of the object, one the original uploaded size of the entire photo and two pics that have been cropped to show the UFO and the silo/trees in relation with one another.  Thank you.  The photo was taken looking towards the northeast. I'm guessing it was between 30 and 45 degrees(??) off of the horizon. It moved in a straight fly pattern, no wavering, with no engine noise and no blinking lights that I could see. It simply looked like a gray/metallic Frisbee.  I was standing outside my front door admiring the beautiful rising moon when I noticed this object moving slowly in a descending pattern from the northeast.  I ran inside and quickly grabbed my camera and had time to take just this one phot before the object disappeared behind the silo/tree area of the photograph. That's about all there is to my sighting.  Thank you. From my Facebook entries:  ""I snapped a picture of a UFO last night at around 8:31 p.m. at my residence in the countryside in Dixon, IL. I saw what looked like a gray/silver colored frisbee slowly moving in a decending pattern towards the silo/tree area at the mid-lower left side of the photo. I initially went outside of my front door to look at the cool moon rising and noticed this object moving slowly.  It had taken me a few seconds to register what it was I was looking at and then I ran inside, got my camera and quickly snapped this photo.  I am amazed and excitied that the picture turned out as clear as it did as I was in a hurry to get a pic before it disappeared behind the silo/tree area of the photo.  The object is the gray ""line"" to the upper right of the silo and directly above the trees in the picture.  I am wondering did anyone else see this object last night?  Use your Zoom features to blow up the photo. I zoomed to about 200% and it started to become pixilated. A cool photo nevertheless..:)       ""I watched it disappear behind the silo/trees area in the picture.  It definitely moved as one solid object...no vapor trail or meteor streak, etc.""       ""Hello everybody! I understand the photo doesn't quite show exactly what I saw the other night, but it's important for me to note that the object moved in a descending pattern as one object...it looked like a slow moving frisbee..lol..  If you... can enlarge to 400% or as high as you can go without the pic becoming too pixilated, you might see it's a solid object, not a vapor trail or jet stream trail, and I have had people tell me it looks like there are sources of light on the object when they enlarged the pic.""",2011-08-21T00:00:00,41.8157,-89.4818

Passenger sights what seems to be a antenna tower with multiple (red, white, blue, green) colored lights high in the distance.  Passenger realizes the source of lights has no tower beneath it. Driver agrees and stops vehicle.  Both occupants of the vehicle realize they are observing a flying vehicle that is directly above the Project Rowhouse community art complex in 3rd Ward Houston.  This realization means the vehicle was at least 90 stories above the art complex.  The driver stops near the intersection (Elgin/Dowling) and observe what appears to be a UFO with the body of a large plane but is thicker and has many uniformed multi colored lights around it. Some lights blink others are static.  The vehicle is also static/ hovering the buildings in 3rd ward. The vehicles surface can be seen due to its flashing lights as dark grey or green/ a muted color. The! re is what appears to be a very long rod, stick or antenna aimed upwards from the center of the UFO. This too has multi colored lights blinking and what the driver and passenger possibly first saw. The UFO also seems to have short wings much like an airplane but shorter/stub like. The bottom of the craft was dark and not visibly detailed.  The UFO did make a humming sound similar to a portable fan running on high speed. The UFO then started moving slowly north while the driver and passenger slowly made a u-turn and pulled out a Cannon 45D camera.  Upon making a turn onto Dowling the site of the UFO was temporarily blinded.  The driver and passenger lost complete sight of the UFO at this point in time. The UFO could not have been a standard plane flying so low and also hovering dangerously over the 3rd Ward community.  The UFO was flying in a very dark and cloudy evening and may have been taking advantage of these clouds to cloak itself. The previous night and those evenings aft! erwards showed clear skies. No photos were taken by passenger ! or drive r because the UFO disappeared within the seconds the car turned on Elgin/Dowling Street.   There where approx. 5 other cars passing by in a predominately quiet intersection.  A young man ridding a bike was approached by the driver and passenger of the car but he recounted no encounter at all. The Passenger also understood that NASA has a headquarters in Houston and that there are military bases in the area.

I was in the middle of the city, walking east, when I glanced north and saw the objects moving from the northwest (seemingly coming from over the Pacific Ocean), and moving to the east (or slightly southeast).  I could not see their full passage through the sky, as part of it was blocked by neighborhood buildings (they were not extremely far above the horizon, and my view of them could be obstructed by three-story building across the street from where I was). The objects were not making any sound that was audible from where I was walking. Relative to a star or planet in the night sky, the objects were about the same size or slightly bigger than the planet Jupiter.  They twinkled slightly, as stars do, and did not emit a pattern of blinks.  The air was steady (no wind) and the sky was clear. As the objects moved inland, they gradually faded into the distance until no longer visible.  They moved at about the speed of a commercial jet through the sky, if not slightly faster.  They did not leave trails, and were distinct objects, moving from left to right, rather than vertically or at an angle, as shooting stars or space debris passing through the Earth’s atmosphere. I did not notice a distinct formation in which they were moving, except that they were all moving in the same direction and disappeared in approximately the same area.  They were not traveling in a line, but were rather staggered in elevation, and moving at the same pace. I pointed the last one I saw out to someone else who was outdoors at the time. I went out twice later in the evening, and did not see similar objects again.

((woman's name deleted)) my wife was sitting in the front enjoying the warm weather and talking on the phone with a friend.  It was a very clear night with no clouds in the sky. I came outside sat down and looked up and saw a fire ball in the sky over the tree line, traveling in a slightly northeast direction coming from the Gulf.  The craft at first site looked like a meteor or an asteroid, or something of the sort.  This thing was huge, and headed towards our direction, then I saw the other one appear, not as close that came into view rising above the tree line.  The images and video provided give no justice to what we originally saw because it was the tail end after the account and fly by. I was stunned, shocked and frozen in awe. While frozen I started to think this is no meteor or asteroid, I also thought could this be a plane on fire going to crash. I decided to rush in and get Sam my daughter out of the shower, because I was very uncertain what I saw and worried. I scrambled to find my video camera, could not find it and grabbed my digital camera instead. Once I got back outside they were already over the house and at a much higher altitude. I started snapping pictures of it with my digital camera.  ((daughter's name deleted)), my daughter started videotaping with her camera on video mode.  The images look like dots, sorry best I could do. ((name deleted again)) my wife, has a very good account as they flew over when I was inside scrambling for my camera, she was outside the whole time.  My best guess, the size of the object was at least 5000 square feet round, there were two of them and they were silent, and made no noise whatsoever.  The objects were round, burning fire in the middle and glowing orange red around the parameter circling the burning center.  These objects were very bright. I will personally never doubt anyone who claims they saw something. Unfortunately, by the time I got my camera they were already over the house at a much higher altitude. Also, I was smoking, so you can see this in some of the pictures. Had I not been in such shock I would have not hesitated so long to grab something to record the incident sooner. ((wife's)) Account  Jan 21st 2012 around 7:11 pm at night I saw something in the sky that was not any aircraft, like a helicopter, airplane, jet etc.  It had glowing fire in the middle and reddish orange colored lights surrounding the object.  The lights were circular and the whole thing glowed like an asteroid you see in the movies.  The objects were big and there were two objects in the sky.  Through the whole incident I was completely stunned and seemed to be emotionless. The first one came above the tree line across the street above my neighbor’s house then a second one followed.  They were flying low when they appeared then flew over our house.  As the object flew over I saw the fire in the middle and orange redish colored lights that seemed to be rotating while looking at them directly above me. As soon they passed over they speed up and started ascending much higher.  The craft looked like fire in the sky.

Though I do not denounce the fact that there is more than a good chance for intelligent life outside our solar system.  However, I cannot say either way if this was not of this world or if it was some Government aircraft testing.   Below is my account of what I saw tonight: As I was driving home headed east bound towards Elmira, NY, I noticed a very bright light out on the horizon that seemed to be flickering at about 30 degrees away from the horizon.   At first I didn’t think much of it, but as I was driving past Sayre, NY, I noticed it was still in the sky, only slightly brighter and unmoving.  My next thought was that it was Jupiter.   Wrong, again Jupiter (supposedly the brightest “Light” in the sky besides the Moon) is slightly higher and off to my left a little more.   Anyway, I continued watching this light while driving down the highway all the way to Elmira and through the city.   The light had become lower in the sky, though dimmer.  I lost sight of it when I arrived to my home in Elmira.  This was extremely weird and I am very interested to see if anyone else has seen this.

He was whimpering but it was different than let me out normal sounds.  I tried to let him outside but he wouldn't go so I went out to have a cigarette. I looked up at the sky and there were 4 figures other than stars.  What got my attention was they were all together just sitting there. The colors were very distinctive.  The colors were red, yellowish and green I think.  I don't recall anything other than all four were hovering and the lights were sparkling.  These things move so fast I can't tell if the lights were going around the saucer or just flashing quickly. I watched for about 2 minutes and one went quickly off to the right in a white streak a bolt of lightening then it was gone.

Perhaps it is a specialised military helicopter that is to be used by the military"".  Then a few seconds later we both noticed that the colors of the lights were also quite odd to belong to a helicopter. Within 20-30 seconds after we noticed the colours of the lights on the 'helicopter' was strange, it flew almost directly over us. Instead of being a helicopter, it was just a ball of light.  It made no sounds and the size of the light was getting bigger and smaller (pulsing?).  It was as fast as a helicopter or small plane, and about as big as an auto.

I’ll start out by saying that my son and I were taking a late afternoon walk on a Dennis beach along Cape Cod Bay, on the north side of the mid-Cape area.  As we were appreciating colors of the western sky, we saw nothing unusual, and no clouds of any kind—the sky was crystal clear.  We left the beach before the sun set and soon I was on the highway heading west toward the setting sun.  As soon as I got on the highway, I noticed an unusual thing in the sky.  This was around 4:50 p.m., maybe 4:55.  It could have been a cloud, but 10 minutes before there was nothing of the sort in the sky when we were on the beach.  It was located to the left of the setting sun and a bit higher in the sky but low enough so that the trees along the side of the highway prevented me from seeing it most of the time.  But I got a good look at it on several occasions.  It was the only thing in the sky except for the sun.  It was shaped like a “V” but the arms were puffy and the “V” ! was not upright but tilted over so that the hinge of the arms was on the left side of the thing.  The puffiness of it made me wonder if it was a cloud, but there was something unusual about it.  It was about a quarter of an inch at arms length.  The color was unusual in my opinion because it was intensely white, not opaque.  I was thinking that it should be reflecting some of the golden/orange sunlight, but there was no hint of any other color other than the intense white.  This is subjective, but it seemed to be so white that I thought it was glowing of its own accord.  I lost track of it for several minutes while on the highway due to the trees and trying to drive safely.  I got off the highway and headed south toward Hyannis, trying to catch a glimpse of it but I couldn’t see it for 2 or 3 minutes.  Still heading south, I saw it again as I came to a place where the trees were thin along the right side of the road and it opened up into the flat expanse of the airport fiel! d.  This was maybe 7 minutes after I first caught sight of it.! It sti ll was “V” shaped but now the hinge was on the bottom (like a V) and the arms seemed closer together and thing seemed to have turned so that the right arm was behind the left, closing up the empty space between the arms.  The sun had set and the sky was glowing, but the “cloud” still seemed white but dimmer, not as intensely white as it had been a couple of minutes previously.  Clouds morph and this could very well have been something like that, but it was unusual, appearing rather suddenly and so intensely white.  I lost track of it as it was obscured by the buildings and trees of Hyannis.

There I was told that about an hour earlier that my two friends had seen a glowing orange circular object that ""was semi-fast,"" with no noise at all.  I quickly put it off as either some sort of meteor or asteroid that had flown through our atmosphere.  They assured me that it was nothing they had seen before and was too big to be either of those. Skip to around 11:30pm, I was driving away from their house and saw a bright orange glowing ball in the sky that I first identified as a fire work in the air that had not yet exploded.  After a few seconds I realized that it was not firework and it was heading my way.   As I stayed parked in my car I watched as this orange circle flew over.  It was really bright, was about the size comparable to a quarter or half dollar, made absolutely no noise, and seemed to be at the same distance from earth an airplane would fly at.  Even though this UFO was really bright I felt like I could see some sort of outline around it but could not make out the shape. The flight pattern was relatively straight, and according to my friend’s story was traveling the same exact direction the first time they watched it.  The speed was relatively fast for the distance it was away, but seemed a lot slower than what a airplane would travel.  By the time I had called them and had driven back to their house the object had become smaller and disappeared out of site.  I did get a hold of my friends in time for them to actually see the object to confirm that it was the same. I did some research to see if it was one of the so called ""Chinese lanterns,"" but it was way too bright and large for it to be one of these.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,,

On January 31st, 2012, at 3:30 pm I decided to go from my home to clear my mind at a large park about two miles away from my home (very peaceful place).  I was at Rose Mofford Park located at 9833 N. 25th Ave. Phoenix, AZ (on 25th avenue just north of dunlap). This park generally has many people playing sports in the afternoon and some people having lunch or relaxing during the day.  At that time of the day I had walked buy two full soccer games involving preteens and kids.  I decided since I wanted peace and sunlight that I would avoid the soccer fields and go on the way to the running track area, which I did.  I proceeded to lay down on the grass on the outside of the track on it's west side.  It was completely cloudless that day which is very typical of Phoenix.  I was affixed at looking into the sky as I did when I was a child... like looking at the clouds and guessing what they might resemble.  That was my state of mind at the time. I soon noticed a small dot in the sky that could have not bee a plane by any stretch of the imagination. I looked a little deeper and thought it couldn't be a bird... no bird would ever fly so high alone that it was nothing more than a tiny black dot (size of a pin head or smaller).  I chose to ignore that dot and decided to gaze at the whole sky rather just out of relaxation.  I widened my gaze and the whole viewable sky  and immediately came across something out of place... a formation of 6 semi transparent or muted color orbs forming a slightly unorganized cross system.  One orb was a darker gray color and was bigger than the others, this orb was off center (top left of the cross intersection).  This system of orbs moved slowly across the sky (as if quietly cruising) as one unchanging group.  None of the orbs moved independently of the others.  They moved as one system. In between the orbs it appeared just as the rest of the sky or completely transparent. I was baffled, but not surprised or skeptical to see this.  This is the second time I've seen a truly unmistakable alien craft or UFO in the sky and don't regularly go looking for them at all.  Even my choice to go to the park to clear my mind in the middle of the day like that was absolutely out of character (been at leased a whole year since I did that type of thing). To debunk any skeptics, yes I was here when Phoenix lights occurred but was not an eye witness in any way. For the record, that event doesn't & didn't cross my mind during this sighting.  That event was never fresh in my mind since I had no personal attachment to / experience with it.  With that said, the Phoenix Lights event has no bearing on my current experience.  I was not looking for this sort of thing,... it just happened!   My belief system as for Phoenix Lights is this: I believed it was true and happened physically as well as that it was a real space craft driven by either our govt or other intelligent species from within our galaxy.  As said before, I actually was not an eye witness of the Phoenix lights, but from all videos and said descriptions of the sighting from eye witnesses, this UFO that I saw had / was using what appeared to be the same type of cloaking technology where I could see the normal sky in between  the orbs.  Also, this UFO appeared much higher in the sky and didn't form a chevron like the Phoenix Lights one did. In a nutshell, I 100% without a doubt know I saw an alien or possibly top secret government craft that was cloaked and peacefully traveling over West Phoenix that day on Junuary 31st, 2012 at 3:30pm in the afternoon.  Hopefully others might have seen it as well and can confirm it with me.",2012-02-03T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

These lights crossed our field of view very fast in various directions.  They looked similar to aircraft strobes that you can  see on various high altitude aircraft traffic 5 to 10 miles away that are  visible on any clear night.  But these lights were so jumping around so fast in the distance, that it could not be one aircraft on a set course.   The last sighting that night, was of two orange! lights very low over the water, slowing rotating around each other before fading out.  I would estimate the distance of the lights at 2 miles.  The motion of the two lights resembled what you would see if  a small aircraft was banking its wings at night, except of course both lights were orange instead of one red and one green.

On the evening of July 1 2011, 3 others and I were witness to an unknown craft flying overhead. It was a clear, warm evening close to 8:30pm EST with only a slight breeze from the Northwest.  There were few clouds in the sky and the cloud deck appeared to be several thousand feet for those that were present.   We had just arrived at my mother’s home on Silver Lake in Kinderhook, Michigan, (South of Coldwater Michigan) and gotten our stuff unpacked.  We were sitting outside of her garage watching my dog wandering around the yard, staring at the lake and just enjoying the beauty of the evening and being there. Out of the west/southwest, I noticed a red light appear above the tree line, moving toward our location.  That area has several smaller airports that many aeronautical enthusiasts frequent. It is common to see ‘things’ flying about.  Given the topography of the area, it is generally easy to identify those enthusiasts and their machines quickly.  This was not one of those things. The light held a steady brilliant red glow as it approached the lake.  About the time it reached the opposite shore line moving towards us, I began pointing and saying my son’s name to gain his attention.  He looked where I was pointing and said ‘what is that?’ As he said that, the other two witnesses also looked at where I was pointing.  It was moving about the speed of an ultra light aircraft as it came across the lake.  Initially my son declared it a plane. In my view, as others got a ‘fix’ on it and began looking intently, the red light went out.  The craft continued across the lake towards us in darkness. It was initially the traditional ‘saucer’ shape round with a small dome.  The size was roughly the size of a four-seated Cessna aircraft common in the area.  The coloring was completely ink black. It passed overhead less than 300 yards away and about 1,000 feet above the ground, without sound. The harder I tried to look at it, the less I could see detail.  Almost simultaneously, we all verbally declared that this was not a plane.  This is where we all in our own ways began saying the ‘oh my god what is that’ and ‘that’s not a plane’ things to each other as it passed overhead. I began asking for a camera or my binoculars.  The cameras were still in our bags in our rooms, but my binoculars were right in the garage.  My fiancée ran into the garage behind us and grabbed them for me.  The rest of us never took our eyes off it. There is a large farmer’s field across the street from my mother’s house, and during the time it took my fiancée to get those for me, the object had only just crossed the length of the field, heading north, northwest.  I trained my binoculars on it (10x50 power) and was able to follow it with them until it passed below the tree line.  As I watched the object, I tried to discern details such as wings, or edges to it.  It appeared to alter shape slightly, as a loosely filled balloon would in a breeze. This was no balloon though.  What continues to stand out in my mind is the blackness.  No edges or details were visible at all within the boundaries of the objects outline.  It was just blackness.  It was kind of like watching a round black hole float across the sky, with its edges slightly blurred and its outline wobbling. As I watched it approach the tops of the trees in the distance, the object made a subtle shift up and to its right, and then dove downward and left at a 45-degree angle.  It disappeared behind the treetops and I could not locate it after that. It was not until several stunned moments afterwards, that I realized it had not made a sound. I mentioned that, and everyone was again stunned and in agreement in realizing that it in fact did not make a sound.  Considering how close it was to us, there was no way we could not have heard even the smallest of engines.  It is very quiet and calm out there and you can hear even just birds from a long distance off. This made absolutely no sound whatsoever. My mother has lived there for many years now, and I have seen all types of aircraft and balloons launched from local airports. This was none of those things.  It was far too light outside and too clear, for us to mistake it for anything else at that distance.  Normal aircraft flying overhead at that altitude are very visible and audible to the point of almost being able to read their call signs with the naked eye and tell how many cylinders the aircraft is running on.  It was also traveling across the mild breeze at about a 45-degree angle, and I feel confident in ruling out a free-floating balloon based on that alone.   We do not know what we seen, but we all seen something truly amazing.",2011-07-06T00:00:00,,

It appeared to be flying lower than an airplane or a helicopter, and was moving very slowly.  It seemed to come from the direction of Eastwood and was moving through Sedwick Farms.  At first, I did not hear any noise at all, but there was a significant breeze.  Then, as it approached my house through the trees, i could hear it.  It made a very quiet roar, much softer than that of an airplane.  The light it was emitting was so bright, that I could not distinguish if it was one light or several clumped together.  It passed over, and everything is quiet again.  I am a scientist and a skeptic, and I have never seen anything like this.

It was almost as if you were looking through a smudge on a window, moving at a rate of speed that was indescribable.

Thank you. While sitting on my front porch in Carterville and talking on the phone to a friend I noticed an unusual object moving slowly through the sky in between Carterville and Carthage Missouri.  I mentioned it to my friend I was speaking with in a sort of nonchalant type of way and continued my conversation.  I observed it for about 5 minutes before my suspicions were raised due to the size, shape, and lighting of the object.  My interest was sparked, so I told my friend I would call back once I got on the road.  I got in my car and drove  to the edge of town, then north on I 71 highway.  Aside from the thirty or so seconds of driving down my street to enter the highway, I maintained visual contact with the object for the full duration of its appearance. I exited the highway at the Brooklyn exit and parked my vehicle on the edge of the overpass.  The object appeared to have a lower altitude than regular air traffic.  It moved in a slow manner and did not have a predictable trajectory.  The object itself was dark and was the shape of an equilateral triangle.  There were three stationary lights visible to me, all white with a yellow hue to them.  I attempted to call my friend to tell him what I was seeing, but my cell phone experienced problems establishing a signal.  The phone is an LG G2x phone, less than two months old.  It hadn't malfunctioned prior, nor has it done so since.  I have never completely lost signal on this phone.  There was no signal.  Yet there are several towers in the area and I can usually maintain 3G and 4G coverage.  I did not attempt to capture video or photo footage of the object because the quality would have been so poor as to offer no significant gain and would most likely do nothing but draw spec! ulation.  The object did not seem to be moving at all for the final few minutes of my observation.  At the end, the lights went out and the dark outline of the object could be seen moving and an increased pace in a northwesterly direction.  The speed appeared to be faster than commercial air traffic.  If it did travel faster than the sound barrier I couldn't hear the signature sound. I spent four years in the United States Navy, stationed overseas the entire time, first in the Middle East, then in Southwest Asia.  I was exposed to a wide array of civilian and military aircraft.  Helicopters,  Commercial and private jets, fighter jets, etc...  This object displayed no characteristics of flight that any of these aircraft did.  There are only two types of helicopters in my area.  Emergency Medical Service helicopters from the hospital located in Joplin, and an occasional National Guard (UH-72A).  They make a noise when they fly and do not hover at that altitude without search lights.  They also have running lights and are not triangular in shape.  There are no nighttime hot air balloons in the area, and even if there were, they are not triangular in shape and are incapable of rapid acceleration.

On July the 4th, my wife and I were sitting on our porch which is upstairs in an apartment complex in Fairview Tn.  The time was between 9:30 and 10:00 pm.  Our porch faces east towards south Nashville.   We were watching a few fireworks when we noticed a large red light rising straight upward from the general direction of Nashville.  It never entered my mind that it was a firework as the light rose slowly for several seconds, possibly a minute.  I told my wife that it was a plane and that it only appeared to be going straight up.   The light seemed to get smaller as it rose which seemed strange to me because I thought ""the airplane"" was coming toward us.  When the light was at about 75 degrees it sped up dramatically and headed south.  In a matter of about 5 or 6 seconds it disappeared behind the trees, about two thirds of the way from the horizon.   It is difficult to describe the exact movement of this object, but one thing is sure to me.  This object was flying at least 20 times faster than anything that I have ever seen.    We never heard a noise.   At one point it seemed to my wife that the object was not round but triangular with rounded edges.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,35.9807,-87.13159999999999

I mentioned it to my friend I was speaking with in a sort of nonchalant type of way and continued my conversation.  I observed it for about 5 minutes before my suspicions were raised due to the size, shape, and lighting of the object.  My interest was sparked, so I told my friend I would call back once I got on the road.  I got in my car and drove  to the edge of town, then north on I 71 highway.  Aside from the thirty or so seconds of driving down my street to enter the highway, I maintained visual contact with the object for the full duration of its appearance. I exited the highway at the Brooklyn exit and parked my vehicle on the edge of the overpass.  The object appeared to have a lower altitude than regular air traffic.  It moved in a slow manner and did not have a predictable trajectory.  The object itself was dark and was the shape of an equilateral triangle.  There were three stationary lights visible to me, all white with a yellow hue to them.  I attempted to call my friend to tell him what I was seeing, but my cell phone experienced problems establishing a signal.  The phone is an LG G2x phone, less than two months old.  It hadn't malfunctioned prior, nor has it done so since.  I have never completely lost signal on this phone.  There was no signal.  Yet there are several towers in the area and I can usually maintain 3G and 4G coverage.  I did not attempt to capture video or photo footage of the object because the quality would have been so poor as to offer no significant gain and would most likely do nothing but draw spec! ulation.  The object did not seem to be moving at all for the final few minutes of my observation.  At the end, the lights went out and the dark outline of the object could be seen moving and an increased pace in a northwesterly direction.  The speed appeared to be faster than commercial air traffic.  If it did travel faster than the sound barrier I couldn't hear the signature sound. I spent four years in the United States Navy, stationed overseas the entire time, first in the Middle East, then in Southwest Asia.  I was exposed to a wide array of civilian and military aircraft.  Helicopters,  Commercial and private jets, fighter jets, etc...  This object displayed no characteristics of flight that any of these aircraft did.  There are only two types of helicopters in my area.  Emergency Medical Service helicopters from the hospital located in Joplin, and an occasional National Guard (UH-72A).  They make a noise when they fly and do not hover at that altitude without search lights.  They also have running lights and are not triangular in shape.  There are no nighttime hot air balloons in the area, and even if there were, they are not triangular in shape and are incapable of rapid acceleration.  After the deduction process I went through I can only conclude that the object was either an unknown military aircraft, or something which remains unknown.

I stopped on the walkway to see what kind of plane it was, and saw a jet, a military F-15 or something (small 1 or 2 man plane), flying loudly from right to left.  It had probably just taken off from Hickam AFB.  It flew out of sight, and I looked at the sky to see if there were any more, though I didn’t hear any. Then I saw something kind of sparkling and thought it was another one, only this time much higher in the sky. I watched it and could see that there were two seemingly identical but separate objects, flying together in exact and tight formation, both bright shiny silvery and thin triangular/arrowhead shaped, and flying very fast and very high in tight, eccentric circular movements. I first thought they might be two birds flying together, but they were so high up and so large that they would have had to be giant pterodactyls or some other mythical giant silver birds. No, they were definitely not birds. I watched them for about two minutes and they could not have been military jets, as no aircraft I had ever seen or heard of could perform such maneuvers at those heights and speeds. I kind of waved my hands in front of my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things and was sure that I wasn't hallucinating or delusional. I  was, however, a bit startled. I had not been drinking or taking drugs. I went back into the house, as I had forgotten to take an item with me. When I returned to the walkway, they were gone or out of sight.

Not in the direction of our planets rotation, but rather racing back n forth, turning on 90 degree n less angle turns. Also swaying back n forth. The movement from here on the ground would travel to what appears up to be about 1"" to 1-1/2"" before turning or curving back around in a different direction. That doesn't sound like much distance but if you consider that these objects are in our atmosphere, a star moving 1-1/2"" in the sky must be a pretty good distance of travel. And the speed that they travel this distance must be great as well. They seem to be in patterns and holding there positions for the most part and have been there a while now.... As crazy as it sounds and appeared to me myself, I had to get some other person/s to see this as well to insure i wasn't seeing things. So I had my kids come out as well as a few of their friends to see these objects as well.. The did in fact see t! hem and noticed there movements just as I was... I myself do not the equipment or resources to film these objects, but believe someone should try to document them with a high powered telescopic/camera.

The wind was blowing and this orb never moved, which led me to think this was something else entirely.  It was silent.

It then appeared to be coming closer toward me, would hover there for a few minutes and then retreat back to where it originally was.  It did this several times.

We arrived at approximately 1830 PST.  After eating and gaming for about 2 ½ hours, I went into the hot tub with my friend & his wife.  It was a very clear and beautiful night, plenty of stars and a bright moon.   Given the location of our homes against the nearby Los Angeles National Forest mountain range (6 – 8 blocks to the foothills), we are usually treated with superb visibility, allowing us to see satellites, the Space Station, Shuttle, etc, on a regular basis. Their hot tub is circular, about 6 ft across and I was oriented at the 5:30 o’clock position, facing north (or about 345 degrees).  My friend was at the 11 o’clock position (facing south), and his wife was situated in-between us (2 or 3 o’clock) and facing due west.  We are all in our 40’s, married for 15 – 20 years, and been friends since the mid 1980’s / early 90’s.   There were no exterior lights in the yard, as the moon gave a constant soft light. About 30 minutes after we entered hot tub, and while I was scanning the sky for items, I noticed a light in the western sky, approximately 10-20k ft high, moving towards us in a due east flight path relative to our stationary position.  The light was not travelling in the typical approach or departure pattern for the nearby ONT, BUR or LAX airports.  The light appeared to be moving rather slowly, coming directly towards us.  It was a dark yellow or light orange color, with only the light visible.  There was no discernable airframe, external nav lights, no noise – only a light.  It was a constant light, no changes in its intensity, direction or color. I commented to my friends that there is something we don’t normally see, meaning it was not apparently a plane (with the normal navigation lights, sounds and profile), and not a satellite (it was far too low, a medium brightness and noticeably larger than other satellites and space station lights we’ve seen).  All three of us looked at the light coming towards us for perhaps 1-2 minutes, with his wife asking if planes didn’t have special colored lighting to distinguish them?  I confirmed that since the object was moving towards us, there should be a red light on the right-hand side, and perhaps other lights (strobe lights, landing lights, take-off lights, anti-smack light, etc).  None of these were distinguishable. While we watched and speculated, the light began to slow down, and then completely stop in midair.  I picked up my flip phone camera, and attempted to get some video.  I took (2) 30 second clips of the stationary light, though the resolution quality was quite low (essentially worthless). We of course sat stunned and stared in some genuine disbelief.  There was no sound of any rotor blades (we get them around our house ALL THE TIME for a variety of reasons, so we all know typical helicopter movements, sounds, etc.  As we watched the light it moved slowly & slightly to the south (our left as we were still facing due west).  After perhaps 30-40 seconds, it then returned to its original stopping point for perhaps another 10 seconds.  Then it slowly started back the same way it came.  The light did not turn direction away from us, it merely moved in reverse away from us. As we watched in silence, a small series of lights came out of the bottom of the larger light.  To me, it initially looked like a flare dropping straight down from the craft, but it did not burn with any consistency.  It alternated between mildly bright, to barely visible, back to mildly bright, then nearly disappearing, before becoming mildly bright once again.  By the 3rd time it got bright, the trajectory of the dropping light changed, and it headed due northwest and quickly disappeared.  It did not move off for miles before disappearing, it was gone with 3-5 seconds after changing direction.  All the while, the main light continued back on its westward path, going behind some trees and disappeared from our view. None of us could explain what we saw, and none of us have ever seen anything remotely similar to this. To be truthful, my friend had 4-5 shots of whisky since about 5 PM that evening (he’s about 250 lbs), so there wasn’t much impact by 21:30 PST, as his consumption was in a measured pace relative to his tolerance and size.  His wife had just returned from taking the girls to “Booing” some of their Jr. High friend’s houses.  She was still working on her first mixed drink of the evening at the time.  I had 3 shots of 75 proof whiskey during the previous 3 hours, and was for all intensive purposes – still completely coherent and alert. Of course when my wife called to see when I’d be coming home, I was so excited to tell her about what we witnessed that the phone slipped out of my wet hands, and straight to the bottom of the hot tub…before it unceremoniously powered off.  Though I’ve tried several methods to dry and revive the phone, nothing has worked yet. My friend and his wife have lived at this location for nearly 10 years, and he is fairly familiar with local traffic patterns.  He has an App on his Android phone that allows us to quickly pin-point stars, constellations, space debris or even rocket launches from Vandenberg AFB.  He and I have attended several air shows @ Apple Valley and Edwards AFB.  His background is in the high-end automotive field, and he is one of the top specialists in his field in the world.  His wife is a part-time real estate agent, and full time mother to their only daughter.  My background includes a BS degree in management, with a minor in Computer Management Information Systems, a Master’s of Science in Organizational Management and a nearly complete BS degree in Criminal Justice. Additionally I have 13 years studying (numerous technical certifications) and working in military & commercial aerospace operations and manufacturing (all in the avionics realm) from 1982 to 1997.  My hands-on technical training, support and management experience includes a wide variety of light, single & twin engine general aviation craft, military helicopters (UH-1N, AH-1J), attack aircraft (A-4M), observation planes (OV-10 B) and medium to large jet aircraft (MD-80, MD-90, MD-95 and MD-11). I have been to dozens of air shows, was trained at / stationed at military airfield facilities including NAS Memphis, MCAS El Toro, MCAS Tustin, MCAS Yuma and MCAS Pendleton for over 3 ½ years during my tour of service.  My civilian experience includes 6 months working at the El Monte and Fullerton airports and 7 ½ years with a major manufacturer at the Long Beach airport. Currently I’m an NCO in the state reserves and have split 50% of my duty time for 2011 between the airfield at Los Alamitos and my normal drill station.  I’ve written an article for Air Safety Weekly (in 2006), and had one of my comments to the editor published in Aviation Weekly (April 1998).  Finally I was interviewed by Swiss Public Radio in 1999 after the Swissair Flight 111 MD-11 crash in Canada in 1998.  Suffice to say I have a passing knowledge of the aerospace community… &#61514;  There are only 3 explanations I have for what we witnessed.  It was (A) a lighter than air vehicle of some kind, (B) a helicopter, or (C) a tilt-rotor aircraft.  Options B & C do not seem plausible, given the amount of noise a hovering aircraft would make.  If my altitude guess was correct, then option B is out the door, as few helicopters will operate in the 15-20k altitude range without pilot & crew oxygen, especially in the heavily regulated LAX TCA zone, and close to the climb-out area for jets departing ONT. We are hoping your team might be able to shed some more light on this situation!",2011-10-25T00:00:00,34.134330379746835,-117.85110759493669

On August 14, 2011 at approximately 11:18 P.M., my wife and I were walking our dog, Chance, down Ishnala Rd.   As we walked, something in the sky caught our eye, it was an orangish / Reddish/Firey object coming over the tree line to our left which was a slightly North-West direction. This object came over the tree line at a plane like speed heading  slightly South-East .  It slowed down to a complete stop in the sky and started to flicker and fade away.  As that one was fading, a second one started to come over the tree line following the same flight pattern and movements precisely, stopping at the same point the first one we spotted (by that time the first one was gone) and started the same faze, flickering then fading.  This continued at least two to three more times for a total of at least four or five times, then stopped. As we were watching, there was a third person driving down Ishnala Rd at a slow speed.  As he approach he stopped and was in awe as my wife and I were at seeing this.  We both tried to figure out what these objects could possibly be and can not come up with a earthly reasonable response.

Scary, unexplained noise on video I have 2 young children, one is 3 and the other is a newborn so when we want a cigarette we step outside.  I proceeded to go outside and smoke around 3 a.m. on August 15th in the rural area of Wellington which is about 45 minutes from Cleveland. It's pretty dark in this area so looking at the stars is what we like to do considering the good view.   As I looked up, I saw what appeared to be a star. This star however very quickly exhibited some erratic movement. It would move left slow then shoot really fast then stop.  It would shoot right angles and stop and go.  Very clearly not the movement of a star hopping or any planes or anything.   When I grabbed my girlfriend to watch, she also observed the erratic movements of our star. It would move crazy directions and very fast at some points; as fast as a shooting star.  After we observed it for a few minutes and were pointing, it almost reacted to our shock and our pointing..almost as if it were showing off. Now it wou! ld make all the sense in the universe to me that if you wanted to just stay in the night sky, your ship could look like a star.  And if we have satellites that can listen in, why couldn't this ""star"" have been aware of us?  On to the best (and craziest) part of the night. About 30 minutes later, I decided to try and film it with our camcorder. It's a little dated; you can know this because it still uses tapes.  The UFO we observed however did NOT show up on the camcorder. I thought I had failed but when I walked to my car to get something, behind our apartment building (out of sight of my original position), there was a VERY bright star-like object also showing some erratic yet very thought out movements.  This object was way brighter than the north star, almost as bright as a plane, in the SW sky.  This object I DID capture on film for over 30 minutes with a stationary camcorder. It moved in all different directions; not following a traditional orbit or flightpath of anything rational that can fly. I got to zoom in on it and it was a rainbow of colors but very clearly shows the object itself was circling..showing like a stationary propulsion system. I have 30 minutes of video with the camcord! er sitting in place perfectly still and you can observe what the object looks like, and it's movement in and out of the shot. Also fast-forwarding and rewinding CLEARLY shows the objects random movements. Also, every shot I got has a portion of the awning of our apartment building in it so you can see that the camera is still and the crazy movement of the object. At one point zoomed in, it looks to be powered bya central electrical turbine which the rest of the visible ship spinning clockwise to stay in flight.  The UFO itself doesnt spin just its surface does and from far away it resembled an electric eye or a blue and sometimes purple ""death star"" if you will. I've wanted my whole life to see something like this and even though I was uneasy the whole time, I remained skeptical until the end of my film.  I heard what sounded like a group of women moaning a ghostly sound in unison; it was the most scary and creepy thing I've ever heard in my life.  I caught it on camera so oth! er people can hear it but it sounded like nothing I've ever heard and contains no explaination that I could even begin to think of.  I felt a chill to my core after hearing this and I know whoever watches the tape will too. It was also loud like nothing I've heard before it was as if it were behind the treeline it felt so close. The stationary camcorder records its obviously erratic yet intelligent movement, it captures the look and design of the ship, and it captures the most horrifying sound I have EVER heard in my 23 years of existance.  I would rather know I was going to be tortured than to feel how I did when I heard that sound; it sounded like something straight out of the movies; like it could've been straight out of the movie Signs when they hear it through the baby moniter.   If scientists dissect this tape, I feel that this could be the holy grail of videos for ufologists..the smoking gun. I will not give this tape up unless I know that the video will be taken seriously.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,41.1609,-82.2085

It is very hard to put into words but the best I can do is say that normal lights shine light but these seemed to glow more brightly than anything I’ve ever seen glow, or maybe a better way to put it would be to say that they radiated colored energy.  Which sounds crazy even to me when I was the one who saw it, but that is truly the only way I can find to describe it.  I asked my husband if he saw it as well. He simply stated yes. I asked what it was, and almost at the same moment he started to say it was an airplane it moved slowly to the left and the lights changed to an equally bright green.  I asked him again “that’s an airplane? Really?” he agreed that it was not an airplane. We continued to watch as it floated slowly to the left and then sped up and changed to blue lights and flew upwards.  Then stop moving in more than a slight hovering like instability for approximately a minuet maybe two then repeated the flight pattern and color changing again then slowed again to the hover like movement now with only the red lights blinking at random and inconsistent intervals. I couldn’t gauge the distance of the object but it was visible over the tree tops near my home. It was triangular in shape with multiple intensely bright lights that changed colors. And from where we were standing it looked as though it could be rather large in size. We watched this pattern of flying and changing color for 10-15 min at somewhere between 1-2 am. I then decided to go out into the front yard to see if I could get a better look at it and also to see if there was anyone else that was seeing the same thing.  There were some individuals outside but I could not see it from the front of my home due to tree and houses blocking the area I had seen it. When I returned into the back yard to watch it further, my husband had come back inside and informed me it was gone. My husband took over 24 hours to allow himself to accept that this thing was not something that could be explained easily and the same night he finally admitted that it was an Unidentifiable flying something or another, (he refuses to say UFO because he thinks it will make him sound like a nut case) informed me the next evening that he had seen another object flying extremely fast across the sky, I however was not home that evening to confirm or deny his sighting, although he is not a believer in any other worldly things or the possibility of them so I am inclined to trust his admittance to seeing something he doesn’t believe in.  I am someone who believes that anything is possible and that it is ignorant and egotistical of us to believe that in the vast unending universe, we are the only beings or living things.

I know what i saw because i grew up learning aeronautical information from my uncle who was an engineer for boeing for 40+ years and have always been an aircraft enthusiast. i watched it untill it was out of site. We live on the highest central hill in the area.  The brilliance of the light did not flicker or change in any way, it was steady untill out of my site.  there was trail. no color changes. no landing. no sound. no aura. no haze.  i didn't grab the camera because i didn't know how long it would last! .",2011-08-21T00:00:00,43.37392718446602,-124.14838155339805

I was lying in bed next to my girlfriend and next to an east facing window at roughly 11:10pm EST 01/22/12, Downtown Cincinnati when I saw a flash of light from the left corner of my eyes.  I turned my head, looking southeast out the window and noticed a round orange/red globe/orb-like object floating along without sound traveling northwest toward my condo.  My girlfriend and I were astonished by its ability to drift, sometimes moving up or down unlike that of a helicopter or private jet! The object was coasting at a pretty good clip.  At this point I climbed higher into the window to get a better less inhibited view through the glass as opposed to through glass and outer screen. At that moment we noticed another object just like the first following a short distance behind approx ½ mi. Then came another and another.  Those that followed totaling 5 or 6 more were performing maneuvers unlike the first three and more peculiar.  My girlfriend again pointed out two more circling each other to our southeast while those behind them were hovering very close to the tops of the city skyscrapers around the corner of Seventh and Vine and then finally nearing the ground hovering straight down at roughly Race and 9th St. Downtown Cincinnati.  The one that initially appeared to land on a building top came slowly down at that junction and out of sight once again. I proceeded to film those closest to the downtown buildings rather than following those who were in a straight path out of sight north and west of my home.  The angle from my vantage point to the objects’ was somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees from the ground.  They were straight up halfway across the 8 or 9 Cincinnati City Blocks from east to west on a map. The remaining 2 objects exploring the downtown building tops eventually in just under a minute began to make their way due north up the I71 corridor and out of site.  The objects’ diameter appeared to be a car’s length maybe slightly longer.  I estimated by the size of the object that appeared to land on the building in relation to the size of the rooftop.  We were not sure what to do exactly however with a little research we found the NUFORC.

When a commercial plane on approach to DFW came into my view with its landing lights on, I was able to compare the two objects.  I was able to compare the light temperatures which were clearly different.   The size of the orange glow was much larger than that of the planes landing light. Although the orange object appeared closer to my location ! than that of the plane.  I was able to make out the directional green and red lights, in addition, the flashing strobe on top of the commercial plane in the distance.  The orange object did not have any additional lighting.  I also noticed that the orange fireball shape was moving away from my direction and away from the direction of DFW.  In addition, the orange fireball object appeared to be at a higher altitude than the plane. Once it was in the NW quadrant from my location the orange glow went out.

But the lights were too bright to have been flashlights at the apparent distance, so I wondered if they could be 5 camp fires.  Then I noticed the lights were moving slowly.  When the top one went above the top of the mountains, I realized they were flying.  The group was moving west or slightly south west.  It was dark, the sun having set around 6:30 or so.

I stopped my car facing west in the middle of the street.  Opened the door my body facing and looking directly south because I saw an orange spherical object brightly lit from the center spinning horizontally in the clear night sky.   Where I stood, I saw three more objects @ a further distance from me directly to my east was the Seattle space needle in the clear night sky.  The other three lit spheres were hanging there in the skyline two to the north of the needle one to the south all positioned without movement in a offset triangle.  The spherical orb coming from southeast traveling west to meet the other three.   On this night the moon was very full and close.  The moon  directly to my east still and about level with my ear and very large, basketball size.  The orange sphere which flew over me was at least the size of a baseball, to my sight and perception it seemed to be flying low.  Straight, horizontal and @ a moderate speed spanning the city in a minute or so to reach its destination.   There were aircraft, planes in the distance, tiny specks in comparison also helicopters dropped in on the far three aggressively and with there bright lights just before the orbs of light disappeared.  The sphere which I saw most closely seemed to be revolving as it passed.  There was an energy similar to fire coming from the very center and shining so brightly that it lit the otherwise planet looking object.   It did not seem to move like anything made by man. it was silent.  It was beautiful.  It seemed to be made of a rock matter like the moon looks, only a bright energy beamed from the center, a nucleus which propelled it.  I contacted my best friend by phone and she was in south lake union.  I alerted her to it and she and another got out of the car looked up in time to catch the same experience as my self.

The light moved from one side of the sky to the other in less than 20 seconds, a very great speed as I am sure you will agree.

The object was almost as bright (vivid?) as the Sun looks in the sky, and about 25% as large as the Sun looks in the sky, so quite easy to see.   The shape of the light:  Ellipse.  The light did leave behind a condensation track, so the light must have been hot.

When I got home that evening, myself and my freind who also saw this light used the internet to understand and research what we had seen.  Strangely, no websites, not even websites that measured meteoroid activity over Scandinavia had information on what we saw.  There was nothing on these websites yesterday, and nothing today.

A friend and I were sitting outside on his porch listening to music at around 10:00 PM.  After awhile my eyes drifted up towards and sky and I started to star gaze.  Some time after I started to star gaze, I became fixed on a certain star that seemed to keep holding my attention.  It was noticeably brighter than most other stars that were visible that night, and have a very characteristic amber color to it.  However, after studying it a bit longer, it appeared to be much closer in terms of distance than the other stars that were visible. After maybe another ten minutes of studying this star, it started to move at a very slow and steady pace.  I started to think maybe it was just aircraft, although it was much, much too high to be an commercial airliner.  This lead me to believe it could have just been a satellite.  Yet, those thoughts were soon pushed out of my mind completely. About 2-3 minutes after it initially started to cruise, the object stopped, and then started to go back to the space where it came from.  It continued to move back and forth in this manner for 3-4 minutes.  At this point I was certain it wasn't an aircraft or a satellite.  I kept looking at the object, thinking maybe my eyes were just playing tricks on me from staring at one place for so long. I looked away for a minute or two to rest my eyes, then looked back up towards the object.  After staying stationary for a few more moments, it started to move again, but this time in multiple different directions.  It would go forward, back, side-to-side, etc., all while coming to complete stops multiple times and then continuing to move about (almost as if inertia had no effect on it).  This continued for about ten minutes, and during this time I was able to point it out to my friend who also confirmed that he could see the object moving.  I'd like to note that while it was moving, a faint trail of light followed behind it, resembling a sort of little tail at the end of the object. By this time, it was after 11:00 PM.  The object remained stationary for quite some time after it had done all that moving about (but stayed in the same general area the whole time).  I kept my eye on it, waiting for it to make its next move.  After staying in place for about 15 minutes, the object moved again, this time moving in an arc pattern that was EXTREMELY noticeable.  Seeing it move this way made it certain that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  After this, it continued its previous moving patterns from the beginning, which I continued to observe until approx. 11:50 PM.  At that time I drove home, the object still being there when I left.  Unfortunately, the area this occurred at is not visible from where I live, so once I left my friend's house, I was only left to wonder how long it stayed there. I feel it's important to note that I felt very, ""otherworldly,"" when I was observing this object. While this sounds a bit cliché, I definitely felt something when looking at it.  Some sort of connection possibly, that I could feel that this object was not of this world.  Then again, I could have just been awestruck. I plan to keep an eye on the night skies more often, though.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,33.7584,-118.3163

My wife and I were sitting in our rear yard between 22:30 and 23:00 hours, enjoying the cool summer night air.  We have several motion detection lights around the yard which had activated, thus flooding the yard with light.  My wife had a long busy day and stated that she was going to retire to bed.  Since it was such a clear and starry night, I urged her to remain still for a bit, and let the motion detector lights shut off; so that we could get a good look at the stars before we retired for the night. After a short time with the lights off and as we gazed at the stars in a northeasterly direction my wife noticed the big dipper off to our left.  I turned my head left to the northwest to look towards the dipper and just as I was turning back towards the northeastern sky; I observed two circular objects the size of a dime, in relation to the sky, with a faint orange glow silently flying or floating across the night sky.  They were coming from a northwesterly direction and heading east towards the Long Island Sound.  The objects were in close and perfect unison, approximately an inch apart in the night sky and at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  The orange glow was brighter on the forward sides of the circles and lightened up towards the rear or left sides of the circles.  My observation lasted about 8 to 10 seconds before they passed behind a large tree and were then out of sight. I turned to my wife and asked if she had seen the objects and she replied ""yes"".  I then asked her what she thought they were.  She was quite spooked, shrugged her shoulders and questioned, ""A helicopter?""  I replied, ""Did you hear any noise"", and she hesitantly replied, ""no"". Upon discussing this occurrence, I asked my wife why she replied that it was a helicopter and she stated, "" Because I've never seen anything else fly so low in the sky before.""    Neither of us, my wife 61 years old and I 58 have ever in our lives seen anything like this, we both concluded that we had just observed a UFO.

At first, I thought it was a satellite or something, so I didn’t think much about it, except that it looked rather large.  But, as I kept looking at it, I noticed that it started to spark orange, as if it were on fire. It looked like an airplane had caught on fire and was crashing. I hit my boyfriend on the shoulder to get his attention and told him to look, pointing at the object.  He wasn’t all that focused because of his headache, so he didn’t look and just leaned back into the seat again.  I kept my eyes focused on the object the entire time. Suddenly, it started going back up into the sky, and I saw not only orange lights now, but green as well.  I hit my boyfriend again, and told him to look, but by the time he did look, a line of trees had covered the object. I came home and explained it to my mom and dad, but they said they had no idea what it was.",2012-02-03T00:00:00,31.0901,-95.0795

Between 7:50 pm and 8:10 pm on the night of Feb 1st 2012, I witnessed UFO in Austin, TX. Physical appearance:  A bright green fireball with a long bright green tail.    The fireball was much bigger than any star but smaller than the moon.  The tail was almost as bright – and just as green – as the fireball.  There was no trail. Length of time:  I witnessed it for five or ten seconds.  Long enough to realize it wasn’t a flare or fireworks because it never dissipated.  Eventually, it went beyond the horizon (tall trees about a block away).  I did not see it decrease in brightness. Trajectory:  I was facing north.  The fireball was heading northeast.  It seemed to be moving downward at a small angle, from my perspective about 25 degrees.  It appeared to be moving away from me, so it’s hard to tell if it was actually falling towards the earth.  Basically, I saw it move across the northern sky until it disappeared beyond the treetops. Location:  I was at an outdoor seating area of a food trailer park on the 2200 block of East Cesar Chavez Street in Austin, TX.  About a mile and a half east of downtown and about four miles northwest of the airport. About a minute after I witnessed this, a low-flying helicopter zoomed overhead, from the direction of the airport, going in the exact direction I witnessed the fireball.  This might be a coincidence because I was relatively close to the airport.  I’m confident of the time because I was on the phone when I saw it, and the time given above is from the call history.  There were about eight other people eating in this area, (along with some kitchen workers in the various food trailers) and two performing musicians.  Nobody else saw the fireball as they were all watching the musicians or working. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor, we suspect.  Video suggests a meteor to us.

UFO sighting in Oklahoma  2, 2011, Cleora, OK Grand Lake of the Cherokees. At approximately 11:00 P.M. on July 2nd, my family and I witnessed 3 UFO’s.  We were sitting on my outside deck visiting when 2 bright orange lights rose up above the tree line.  We were looking toward the SE.   Without knowing for sure the objects sizes I am not sure of the taking off point or altitude at hover.  My best guess is that they were 3 meters or so in circumference which from my estimation could have placed them in the lake.   Anyway, they rose to maybe 500 to a 1000 feet  and hovered.  Then one of the object took a path away from us toward the SE while the other took a NW path over our heads.  The object was very visible while it went over head and what had appeared only bright and orange took more of a stubby cylinder shape with rotating red lights on the bottom of it.  We tried to film it with my wife’s phone but we where not successful.   As it continued its path we were briefly obstructed by a tree but then again spotted the object on its same coarse.  The object then accelerated out of sight in less than a second.  This entire encounter lasted about 3 minutes.   We had just started talking about how we did not believe what we just saw when another single object rose up from the same point as the other two objects and took the same path to the NW over our heads again.   I have always been curious about the unknown but now I am a believer.  What my family and I witnessed was not from this world.   I would love some more information on any similar objects people have seen.   Oh I almost forgot,  these objects had absolutely no sound.  Wow this was just incredible.

The time, as I recall now, must have been a little after 9 pm (2100 hrs).  There was still a little light in the western sky, but our deck faces east, and already our neighbors were lighting their fireworks.   Approximately 9:20 or so, I looked into the southeast sky and saw a ‘fireball,’ for lack of a better description, ""moving slowly"", traveling east to west.  I didn’t mention it to the others, at that moment, because I had lost sight of it behind a large tree in our backyard, and wasn’t sure that it was not a plane, or just another firework.   I would say it was flying about 2-3000 feet or so (hard to determine).  About 5-10 minutes later, another (or the same) ‘fireball’ appeared almost on the exact path or trajectory moving again, east to west.  This time, my son, 23, saw it and pointed it out to all of us, and exclaimed, ""What is that?  Is it a UFO?""   I told him I didn’t know but that this was the second time I saw it.   I ran in to get the camera but it had traveled out of sight.  I did see it 2 more times, this time following it from the front porch into the western sky where it just became a small dot.   I’m surprised no one in our town or neighbors mentioned this sighting.  I haven’t yet had time to download the pictures or video I took into my computer.  The times the ‘fireballs’ were spotted were apx 9:20, 9:35, and 9:45.   It was a light colored magenta, not brilliant, but certainly not an airplane indicator light that flashes in a constant rhythmic pattern, more like a flame on a stove or burner unit.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,39.01482293577982,-94.28685825688073

Each picture was taken 30 seconds apart.   With those settings, any objects like airplanes, fireworks, an even helicopters would show a trail.  Even the stars, if you zoom in, would show a small trail due to the earth rotation during 10 seconds of exposure. The flying objects in the photos were pretty steady in their positions, except that they seem to appear and dissapear without leaving a trail.  Notice the change from photos number 5 and 6, where quite a few objects appeared from the twighlight zone. These objects were not visible with the naked eye.  They showed up in my pictures due to the high sensitivity of the camera and the long exposure.  The last three photos are just enlargerments of the first 3 (the originals).

My dad was a pilot and we watched planes from the time I was very young.  As the object was passing to the west of us, I walked out to the road to get a better view as it moved southwest, thinking we would see blinking lights of an aircraft as it passed us, as many times the blinking lights are not viewable until they pass by at a different vantage point.  There were no blinking lights from the three vantage points as it passed.  There was some smoke in the air, so we also assumed that the smoke may have had an effect on the light we were seeing.   The illuminated object remained the same size at all vantage points, about 2 times larger than the bright light of a lowflying aircraft.  The light emanating had a shimmery effect. The color was a bright orange red but! again the object had a different shimmery effect, as if there was motion in the light, not clear cut points of light.  The other witness described the object as ""flying up"" into the atmosphere.   The light seemed to fade away as it moved southwest, though it seemed to be much closer to us, lower altitude than the other aircraft that were also in the sky at the time.  The other aircraft in the sky were easily viewable, along with their blinking lights, not an orange/red color and seemed to be at higher altitudes than the unknown object.   We were very perplexed because the object was just not the norm and even though it was the 4th of july and their was a bit of smoke in the air, it didn't add up...given us comparing the unknown object with other known objects visable at the same time.

Both of them were no more than 1500 feet above the ground.  I would have heard them way before they passed over me because of how slow they were going. They were both an Air Force gray with black highlights.  Once I lost sight of them, I saw the cigar shaped one come out from behind the trees.  It couldn’t have been more than a quarter of a mile away from where I was standing.  It was moving slightly slower than what the other two craft were moving. It had lights all along the bottom of it and some on the side of direction of flight. It was mostly blue with white highlights, and was trailing a bluish white mist.  Again with how slow the 3 craft had been moving I should have been able to hear the engines running. After witnessing this event I called one of my co-workers, who I knew would be awake at this time of night, he happened to be outside smoking as well. I began to tell him what I had seen and about 10 seconds after he heard my description, he saw them too.  Only this time there were four “U” shaped craft, along with the cigar shaped craft.  There was another co-worker with him that night. He witnessed the now 5 aircraft as well. I have been in the military for 10 years in the aviation community.  I know that at certain distances I should be able to hear their engines. I could have easily dismissed the 2 “U” shaped craft as UAV’s, but I, and my co-workers, did not after seeing the cigar shaped UFO.  I have been in military aviation my entire career, I can tell the difference between aircraft just by how they sound, from quite a ways away.

We watched it travel closer towards us for about a minute staring in amazement, disbelief and even a little fear that it may be an asteroid or bomb. We watched it get closer and brighter for about 30 seconds, moving further east then remain quite stationary for about 3 seconds when it was at its brightest before vanishing into the eastern night sky at a rapid but steady gliding speed for about 6 seconds until it totally disappeared.  It seemed to have come into our atmosphere from space, descend and then leave a different direction. I noticed an orbiting satellite and airplanes in flight and compared how different the light and motion of travel was in every way just to rule out things from our planet that travel regularly.  We had cancelled out everything and both believed we had encountered an UFO. I was convinced within 5 seconds that it could possibly be an UFO because of a prior experience.

It seemed that these orang orbs were connected to a much larger object due to the way they maneuvered. It appeared that the large triangular object was hovering and rotating in the same location, and then very slowly moved behind a tall building, which was in the line of sight of the witness, and disappeared.

It was late at night out in the country where there are no other lights in the sky, except starlight.  We went outside to have a cigarette.  As we were talking we noticed to the south of use four pulsing lights in the sky.  Two of the craft seem to try to get our attention by doing semicircles with one another, well it worked. The crafts stayed in the same position for several minutes.  These crafts moved at amazing speeds as they widened their gap between one another to for a straight line across the night sky.  After a few minutes the craft to our far left took off sideways heading southeast as the second one appeared to head out of the Earth’s atmosphere, and the other two disappeared downwards below the tree line, so we did not get to see them again. Shortly after they were all out of view there was the sound of a high flying jet.  This I know because my job in the military was working with military aircrafts.  There were not lights for this craft and the direction of its sound could not be determined, and it was not the sound of a civilian jet.  I have heard this sound before.  I could only speculate that it was stealth in nature. I would have not thought anything about it, but for its timing after the foreign craft left.  The jet made may passes over the area before it could not be heard again.  The funny thing is that in that area there is normally civilian air traffic; however, there was none. There is one other thing to add.  The night before, around the same time, I was getting up to use the restroom and have a cigarette like I normally do.  I tried to sit up out of bed, but there seemed to be a force that would not allow me to.  There was chatter all around me.  I tried to look left and right, but could not seem to focus on any given direction. Then it appeared I was no longer in my bed, but hovering in the doorway to my room.  Another force pulled me forward.  It made me feel uneasy.  I could feel whatever was controlling me felt my unrest.  I was suspended in the doorway for an unknown period of time.  The next second I was on my bed on my back looking up at the ceiling. The ceiling started to glow a bluish white light, or that there may have been a light behind it.  Right above me was a symbol of a blue cross inside of a rectangle that was pressing itself through the ceiling as though it was a type of branding tool. The last thing I remember was my alarm going off at seven thirty in the morning, and I was no longer on my back, but on my stomach faced down on my pillow. I do not know what this experience was about, and nothing like this has ever happened to me, but I have known all my life that I was not alone, and that I was meant for something.  I hope this helps figure out what is going on. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As my ex-girlfriend was driving me home from work that night after picking me up from work at one we started to drive home. About most of the way back to her house just inside of Adams county she asked me what was that in the sky.  I immediately looked up and saw this bright light at first I thought it was moving very very fast across the night sky, however it then seemed to change direction and appeared like it was either falling or crashing.  BY bright I mean it looked like it was on the horizon but was almost ¾ the size of the moon.  The other witness seems to think that the top part when it was crashing also changed colors from green to red to white.  Instead of crashing though it appeared to just disappear.  It was a inch or two in our line of sight between where it just went off above the tree line.  No fading, landing, or going into the tree line just stopped and went out before the it hit the tree line (might have paused or floated before disappearing it all happened so fast). Around the next couple of turns in the highway just outside of her house their where at least 8 orangeish to bluish lights just floating over the direction of Campoint Il.  I myself have been coming over and leaving her house for over four years and never saw these lights before.  These where much smaller and more spherical shaped than the other thing we saw.  When I asked if she knew what these lights where she said she never saw the pinkish/bluish lights before and immediately noted that they where higher up than the radio tower lights which some where next to or possibly floating over. Also when noticing the first UFO of Unidentified Crashing Object the lights on the Bright and dim lights on the car started to flicker on and off while the regular lights kind of did a reboot type thing where they went off and came right back on like nothing ever happened.  This all took place on Highway 9 between Adams and Pike county on a fairly dark night for the moon being so bright (the moon did seem rather close and large though too).  We for the most part where looking at it driving going downhill and to the west of the first object and to the east of the other objects.

My girlfriend and I were in our suburban backyard, just southeast of Buffalo, NY.  We just moved into the home one month ago. We previously lived in a country setting and never have I seen anything like what occurred on 8/16/2011. We were talking with our neighbor in our backyard and I noticed what looked like an orange-red fireball in the southwestern sky. It was moving slowly and without sound, it appeared several thousand feet in the sky, it was moving from the southwest towards the east. I asked my neighbor what it looked like, he said it looked kind of weird.  My girlfriend saw it as well, she didn't know what it was. I commented that it did not look like any aircraft I have ever seen, nor was it shaped like an airplane, it also appeared to change shape and alter it's direction slightly up, then down, like it was bouncing or unstable, the movement was very quick.  It also appeared that the color started to get brighter, then diminish, but not blinking. I guess you could describe it as looking like something on fire with erratic, non-linear movements.  I would like to mention I was in the U.S. Army, my specialty or MOS was air-defense artillery.  I was trained to recognize many, many types of military and civilian aircraft that were friendly and enemy.  I spent years training for war and recognizing aircraft by the WEFT method, which meant wings, engine, fuselage and tail. I have been witness to many types of flares dropped from F-16's and other aircraft doing evasive maneuvers.  This did not appear to be a flare or anything I have ever seen.  My neighbor commented that it looked like a Chinese Lantern, but it was way too high up in the sky and too large to be something like that.  Anyway, the fireball moved  out of sight behind a huge cottonwood tree that was in our other neighbor's yard to our south. I waited for it to reappear on the other side of the tree but it did not.  The duration of our ability to see this object was approx! imately one to two minutes.  I walked into the street to try to! find it again but could not. It just disappeared.  I would like to mention there are not any military airfields close-by or in that vicinity of the sky.  The closest one is in Niagara Falls, about twenty-five to thirty minutes north of Buffalo.  That airfield houses large transport aircraft, which I could easily recognize in the sky.  Anyway, this ""Fireball"" was surely strange and without any sound.

On Tuesday evening, (August 16, 2011) I was preparing to go for my nightly walk.  After lacing my tennis shoes and listening to ( my girlfriend ) ((name deleted)) speak, I noticed the oven clock registered 8:05 and I patted my thigh for my camera/phone which I did not have this time but grabbed my walking stick and proceeded through the garage anyway.Leaving the driveway and turning slightly right onto Cliffside Road, I became aware of the tapping cadence of my stick and pondered leaving it behind but did not. Turning slightly right atop the 50 yard incline of Cliffside, now on South Drive, I heard children playing and spotted them above the church as I walked toward bustling Fort Henry Drive.  I couldn't help but wonder why children would play on such a dangerously steep driveway slope.   As I reached Fort Henry Drive i waited on traffic recanting the irony of ((name deleted)) not tolerating crossing the street for a ""quiet"" walk.  Tap, tap my stick rings my advance up the steep drive between RHA and the Seventh Day Church drives.  Coming to my usual flat rock,facing South, I habitually stand both feet together while staring down into the craggy boulders beneath, craning to see any life scurrying about.   As I look up the tree at about 10-12 feet  I am aware of the slight dusk- breeze and the sudden break in traffic noise. Suddenly, I am staring straight at an elongated shiny ""craft"" resembling a two-piece telescope,with two distinctly different colors of metal, patchwork assembled like bricks, with opposing flat panels mid section about an eighth the width of total craft length.  The schock of its silence, ghostily speeding near mach 1 was mezmerising, I stepped back, leaned on my walking stick as the object glinted on the left mid side, then right mid side before glinting out about 3 inches above the mountain peak behind Wal-Mart.  I was coherent enough to judge the objects scale as 6-8 times the diameter of the Sun, level, and wondered if 20 tractor-trailers! could fill its mass.I stared at nothingness for another 30-40! seconds before traffic noise pulled me toward home, completely avoiding my normal walk route.  My walk this night, a bit unusual, I could not wait to draw out what I'd just witnessed.  There were no clouds, no planes, and no rationale for what just happened to me. Once inside the kitchen I shakily fumbled for paper and pen and hurriedly scratched out a sketch,told ((name deleted)) i saw a UFO over Wal_mart, and logged on to NASA ISS Live Orbit Feed just as the ISS was about to cross over Africa.

The next day I was interviewing for a new job and took the time to log this report.  The folowing day, Thursday I reenacted my walk sequence gathering more accurate details, called the t.v., newspaper and local radio stations asking about other sightings- nothing but laughter.

We saw it very clearly.A few minutes later we saw 2 jets fly near the UFO as if they were checking it out also.  My girlfriend said to take a picture of it,so I got my camera and did.  She also took a picture of the UFO with her camera.  Then I decided to flash my large flashlight at the UFO.It stayed in the same place and moved only a few degrees horizontally to our right.  We observed the UFO for over an hour between the hours of 11:00pm and 12:00am.

It was no closer than 350 feet but may have been much further.  It was also strange that when I first saw what I thought was a shooting star I was looking for what I thought was a second shooting star as if I expected it before it appeared again in its spectacular yet surrealism.  It also was not defined like a shooting star but more glowing like but unmistakable and bright it is appearance but very soft on the eyes.  It also looked like a mix between an electrical spark, a shooting star and an orb or what I would best describe as glowing white light.  I always thought a UFO would be more clearly defined as a light that looked like a large star with more linear movements.  This was more difficult to define or to relatively grasp.  Its movements were also graceful yet complex. I have no idea how to explain.",2012-01-24T00:00:00,29.87903129973475,-81.36659177718833

It was July 1977 in Scotland around 9 pm and I was coming home from a nights fishing with my Dad and his friend.  I was 18 years old at the time.   As the three of us approached the town roads, we stopped to talk.  My Dad was in deep conversation with his friend and I was looking across the horizon.  We were at an elevated position to the neighbouring town, giving an excellent view toward the horizon. It was an overcast night with heavy grey cloud, warm and dull, but still bright and clear enough to see for many miles, as we were in summer and the days were long.  All at once I could not comprehend what I was looking at.  There was a giant orange object slowly rising from the distant horizon up toward the sky.  The distance from us was about four miles and I know this because the horizon was the border of the neighbouring town which is four miles from where we were. The object was like an orange ball at the centre with hundreds of long thin orange spikes protruding from the centre outwards to form a circular shape.  To the bottom right of the object was an identical object, except it was only a quarter the size of the big one.  Both objects floated slowly and shimmered while floating up into the heavy grey clouds until they were no longer visible.  The size of the larger object would easily have been a mile in diameter. During the sighting I asked my Dad and his friend to look at these strange objects.  Both men looked to where I was pointing and turned to me and said, ""Where are they, we can’t see anything.""  This was rather frustrating for me so I asked them to look again. There was no way they could have missed the objects, especially the giant one.  Once again they looked right in the direction and said they could see nothing.  My Dad was rather angry at me for interrupting his conversation.  I found the whole experience really strange.  I never touched drugs or alcohol and I was not hallucinating. These two strange events lasted about a minute and a half.  The very clear large orange objects and the really strange fact that my Dad and his friend could not see them have always baffled me.  I had never seen those objects before and have never seen them since.  This sighting got me interested in the UFO phenomena.  I have seen several UFO’s since, because I observe the sky and practice a little amateur astronomy. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two excellent written reports from the same source.

I asked to speak to the control tower and to my surprise they put me through. I asked the control tower if there was anything in that area of the sky at the time of my observation and they said (after asking me some relivent questions to where I was and posistion etc) that there was nothing in that airspace at that specific time.

I was walking home from work on the evening of February 8, 2012.  About a block away from my apartment I looked towards the sky straight above.  I also looked to the right and noticed that the stars were extra vivid and crisp on this night.  I looked farther ahead of me and saw two abnormal bright-like stars. I assumed that they were planets but I have never seen two so close together.  Then, again, I look to the right of me and up above I notice a very huge circular red light.  Also accompanying the red light were smaller white-amber-ish lights on each side of the bigger red light.  The sequence of the blinking lights were unfamiliar to me and extremely close to the ground; hovering, in movement. I do not exactly remember how long each blink measured but knew immediately they were unfamiliar.  At this point I was in shock.  I was less than a block away from my home and instead of going straight home I followed in the direction of the red light.  It seemed as ! though the entire craft was a red sphere as it drew away. I turned a left on the street before my block and realized that not only did these lights look foreign but also they were headed in the wrong direction.  Had they been lights from an airplane, the craft should have been traveling more East towards the airport.  Instead the craft was traveling SE. It definitely could not have been an airplane because it was too low to the ground and I heard no sound from where I stood. Through my vision the craft could have been traveling at a speed of maybe 40 MPH…?  I did not get a good look at the shape of this particular craft because as I followed it, it traveled further away flying over tall houses and apartment buildings which blinded my sight. The duration of the craft siting was about a minute long.  	After that I walked towards my apartment. It took less than two minutes to get to my front porch. I immediately sat down and just stared into the night sky. Not one minute had passed when I saw another red light coming towards my direction from the NW. It traveled over Lake Mendota toward my apartment building. I cleared my eyes completely amazed. This craft also had a sequence of odd blinking lights not like the sequence of lights you see on planes or helicopters. The lights also had short awkward pauses and then would resume to the blinking pattern. These lights were also very close to the ground. As the craft got closer I could kind of make out a shape. It was quite dark but my best educated guess would be that the craft had a shape of a triangle prism. The craft also looked like it had a disk-like base and the lights were blinking on the front of the base. As the craft traveled over the apartment building next to mine, I noticed that the underside of the base of the cra! ft looked like half of a sphere. I could not make out any color of the craft due to the time of the evening. Interesting to say, the craft traveled SE just like the first had. I was much closer to this craft than the first but I would assume the speed of travel was 50 MPH.",2012-02-10T00:00:00,43.066514168714164,-89.38736175266175

I'm typing this right after this happened, so it's fresh in my mind.    I was having trouble going to sleep, so I decided to go outside around 3am and do some stargazing.  I saw some meteors, aircraft, and a few satellites pass over.  Nothing really out of the ordinary.   Then at exactly 3:50am (I did a time check right after this), I saw these two bright, white lights moving away from me to the southeast.  They weren't blinking.   The southern most one was slightly ahead of the other one.  They were moving about the speed of an aircraft, but these were too far apart to be lights on one airplane, but still very close together in the sky.  I don't think it was two lights on one big object because they both seemed to move independently of each other.  I also heard no aircraft noise at the time.   They were both brighter than a satellite usually is.  I've seen ISS fly over before and they were about that bright, but the one trailing behind the other one suddenly got even brighter, like someone moved a dimmer switch up.  It got brighter for about 5-10 seconds, pulsing slightly, and then they both started to get dimmer and then they disappeared behind some trees.  That was the last I saw of them.   I thought it could be satellites, but I've never seen two satellites move so closely together and go the same exact direction before.  They were clearly going the exact same way, at the exact same speed.   It didn't look like any lights on airplanes I've seen before.  I don't think they were jets, unless it was something that flies really high up with no ordinary blinking lights and something that I couldn't hear.

Went outside to smoke, noticed a bright orange light in the sky moving southeast to northwest.  Assumed it was a firework of some sort because people are shooting them off already in town.  After about 30 seconds or so, it had not dimmed at all and was still progressing at a medium rate of speed, it seemed to grow even brighter. Called wife and daughter out to look 'hurry hurry!'  Took eyes off of it for maybe 10 seconds.  Wife and daughter arrived in time to see it continue it's travel across the sky, heading away from us towards Jackson, Missouri.  Finally 'went out' all at once, but could still see the bottom edge of what ever it was lit by the city lights. Object was a bright deep orange and looked very bright, like a flare, until it's light seemed to extinguish, but something was still there.  Was a circular light, bright enough to obscure any other detail of the object until it went out.  Did not 'sputter' out like flares typically do. I am positive it was not a normal firework, far too long being lit up.  Potentially an orange flare, not red but deep and bright orange attached to something that was able to float along but there was virtually no breeze.  In fact there was absolutely no discernible breeze noted as such because of the temperature and the air conditioning currently on the fritz. My wife and I both in our late 30s, professionals.(I.T. Network Specialist and Medical Coder)  I am a 7 year veteran of the Air Force, familiar with various aircraft (worked on C-130s) and avionics.  It was NOT an airplane or chopper.  Was close enough to our location to have heard some sort of engine noise. Heard no noise. Seemed like it was fairly close and not very large.  Possibly 2000-3000 feet above city.  About half a thumbs width when it was at it's closest point, growing smaller as it moved away.  Was not moving fast enough or at the correct angle to be a falling star.  Hard to tell it's actual size and distance because there was no good points of comparison, but 'seemed' to be small and fairly close, traveling directly over the town. Left no 'trail' or burning bits, was solid until going out.  Had a slight delay in going out, like the decay of stadium lights turned off.  Did not flicker, just quickly faded. Also possible that the light was directional and was turned away from our vantage point.  That might also fit the manner in which it went out. Was certainly out of the ordinary.  Daughter described it as 'spooky.' Noticed no other effects, like power outage or upset dogs or anything of that nature.  Also do not yet know if anyone else saw it, will try to find any other witnesses via local paper website.  Did not call police or anything, they likely have their hands full enough tonight and it did not seem to pose any threat at all. Afterwards feel like a goober by not grabbing a camera, but a cell phone video of an orange light isn't going to help anything. I have reported in the past other sightings, been several years ago and also investigated another local sighting by a police officer in Cape Girardeau in 2000, speaking briefly with Peter on Jeff Rense's show.  First thing I have seen in years and it was rather striking.  I would not be adverse to passing any info along to any other local researchers, but there's not much else to say except perhaps to be a 'one more' to the sighting.  I am sure others saw it, given the outdoor activity going on (you could hear fireworks going on all around) but if someone else says anything publicly is another matter.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,37.329545631067965,-89.58465145631068

I grabbed my 10x binoculars and noted an object that with binoculars presented itself as a tightly grouped circular cluster of orange lights moving in a line from South to North at an altitude slightly lower than one might expect a jet airliner to travel in a flightpath.  The object slowed to a stop and hovered for about 20 seconds, then from a stationary position, the cluster of lights arced slightly upward, slowly dimmed and went out as if it were moving away from the coast. While the the first object hovered and dimmed, a second object of approximately the same size (or very slightly larger) appeared and traveled in a similar path to the first object, at approximately the same altitute.  The second object was roughtly identical to the first, except it moved more slowly, then stopped and lingered for about 20 seconds as it slowly dimmed and arced slightly upward, dimming out as it moved higher and away from the coast. The objects were not fireworks, since they both moved South to North/Northeast well off the coast in a path parallel to the coastline and at a uniform altitude parallel to the horizon until they arced upward.  The sky had no visible clouds, but there was a uniform atmospheric haze, which might account for the fact that each of these two objects had a flickering effect.

As I tried to focus my eyes to try to tell what it was, I could tell that it was a shiny metallic object with the red light emanating out an angle from the center and up around the sides.  I couldn't see the exact shape of the craft but it was oblong, so it could have been cigar shaped or a dic. It was almost as if it knew I was watching it because it started making small zigzags,,, then it stopped dead still.   After a few seconds it move a short distance 90 degrees left and stopped again.  It then appeared to move away  (up) probably about 500ft then stopped.  From this position it would dart left to right as if it was letting me know what it was every few seconds.  A couple times it made zigzag and cork screw maneuvers within a small location returning to that spot.  Its speed during this entire time was fairly constant.  From my point of view I would guess that it held position and did the maneuvers  within  a 500 ft area around it. After about 5 minutes I decided to get my camera from the house but when I came back out it was gone.",2012-02-03T00:00:00,40.6391,-83.59809999999999

The time was approximately 10 PM and we were watching the skies for local fireworks.  We were traveling West bound on Rt. 22, just past the Airport Rd exit when I noticed this unusual light low in the sky.  It was red in color, appeared to be still, and was not blinking.   With the airport close by, I thought at first it may be an incoming craft on approach.  As we approached the Lehigh Valley Mall though, we could see this was not the case.  The light was actually hovering low in the sky to the left of us on 22.  For reference, it was almost directly across from the Lehigh Valley Mall on the other side of 22.   As we took the MacArthur Rd exit we had actually past the light and we could no longer see it to our left.  We could then conclude it was indeed hovering (or stationary) and that it was close to our proximity.   Curious with what we had both seen, I drove into the Lehigh Valley Mall area and parked in the Southern area of the complex between Bravo and Macy’s.  The red light was still there and hovering.   Being dark out we couldn’t make out any kind of distinct shape, but the light was very solid with no blinking or haze.  It hovered for about 2 more minutes and then slowly moved northward towards our position at the mall.   After just a few seconds of moving North towards us, the light shot virtually straight up into the atmosphere until it was no longer visible.  Although it was partially cloudy that night due to thunderstorms, we could reference a few stars in the sky where it ascended.  Therefore, we knew we hadn’t lost the light in the thick of possible clouds.   The way this light hovered and then shot into the atmosphere with such speed was beyond explanation.  I’ve watched the shuttle take off and reach altitudes till it could no longer be seen, but this light/object did it 10-15 times faster.  It was re! markable and something we never will forget.   I thought I’d share this experience in the hope that others may confirm what we had seen or could perhaps supply a viable explanation of these events.",2011-07-06T00:00:00,,

We had just dropped off a patient on the rooftop helipad of a hospital three miles east of downtown Cleveland and were preparing to depart for base when all three of us witnessed a ""fireball like"" object. At approximately 1:50 AM, July 4th, 201, I was preparing for engine start when I observed this fireball like circular object flying from east to west just north of our position.  It appeared closest when I first saw it.  This is an area of intense air traffic so it took a second look to determine it did not look like an airplane.  At this particular time of morning there were no other aircraft seen. I immediately jumped out of the cockpit and went back to the crew loading our equipment and told them check this out.  All three of us watched the object fly over the shoreline at approximately 3000 to 4000 ft.  Maybe a speed of 150kts at least.  We tried to determine if it was an airliner as this is the same area they fly on their approach to Cleveland Hopkins airport.  However there were no position lights and no strobes.   We could not see any structure except for the roundness and color.  It was a yellow golden sphere with red on the sides (See drawing).  The bright red seemed to have the characteristic of fire or vertical flames but was not flames.  It was not underneath only on the sides with a little on the top.  It was like red electrical fire.  It did not look like jet propulsion. I am not an artist but I did attempt to draw what I saw and that is included here.  I would estimate a fairly good sized object, at least 10-20 feet across.  It flew east to west over the shoreline.  As it approached downtown proper it turned northwest and departed out over the lake at a constant altitude and airspeed.

On the 4th of July, 2011, 15 people witnessed aprox. 12 different red/orange balls of light moving from east to west around 10:00 PM.  The spheres continued to show up for about 45 minutes. Most of the witnesses are non-drinkers and were very alert,  Thinking at first that they were 'Chinese lanterns', only a couple of pictures were attempted.  While watching carefully, it was later decided that perhaps they were something unusual.   A similar sighting was noted in 2009 of a single object on that Fourth of July, and it was also reported. On the 4th this year, it was a warm night, little to no wind, fireworks going off everywhere.  Some of us are familiar with various human made craft, and have seen 'chinese lanterns' in flight.  This was purposeful and did not flicker or move in an erratic way.  One group of five or six contained four spheres that were very close together in two sets of two.  These broke apart and coninued to soar in a shape similar to the markings on dice -  Like the '6' with one dot on the top missing.  The sixth sphere winked out and lit up again as they traveled to the west.  The shape became similar to the Big Dipper, but the movement was smooth and did not appear random. The objects came from the east, but at different points along the horizon.  Some were farther away, most were 'BB' sized or smaller. One of the objects was observed for at least four minutes -  It crossed under the flight path of a commercial airplane as the plane was starting to descend towards SeaTac Airport.  The plane was aproximately twice as high as the object, and the object was aprox. 100 feet above the tops of mature alder and evergreen trees.  The object did not flicker but seemed to pulse a beautiful orange color. It did not veer in any way but stayed in a straight path at the same altitude, speed was relatively slow.  At the closest point, it was slightly smaller than a wooden pencil eraser and was coming from the east, and it continued to glow as it disappeared into the distance to the west.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,47.29995649484537,-122.18088288659793

Noticed reddish orange circular object that just looked different than airplanes, straight ahead, north of our home, moving south south west.  My dad was a pilot and we watched planes from the time I was very young.   As the object was passing to the west of us, I walked out to the road to get a better view as it moved southwest, thinking we would see blinking lights of an aircraft as it passed us, as many times the blinking lights are not viewable until they pass by at a different vantage point.  There were no blinking lights from the three vantage points as it passed.   There was some smoke in the air, so we also assumed that the smoke may have had an effect on the light we were seeing.   The illuminated object remained the same size at all vantage points, about 2 times larger than the bright light of a lowflying aircraft. The light emanating had a shimmery effect.  The color was a bright orange red! but again the object had a different shimmery effect, as if there was motion in the light, not clear cut points of light.  The other witness described the object as ""flying up"" into the atmosphere.  The light seemeded to fade away as it moved southwest, though it seemed to be much closer to us, lower altitude than the other aircraft that were also in the sky at the time.   The other aircraft in the sky were easily viewable, along with their blinking lights, not an orange/red color and seemed to be at higher altitudes than the unknown object.  We were very perplexed because the object was just not the norm and even though it was the 4th of july and their was a bit of smoke in the air, it didn't add up...given us comparing the unknown object with other known objects visable at the same time.  Still on my mind, decided to look up other possible reports and my goodness there are many! ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF ORIGINAL REPORT)) Addition to report below, there was NO sound coming from the object & we heard noise from aircrafts at a much higher altitude about 5-10 minutes after the sighting: ((END ADDENDUM))",2011-07-17T00:00:00,36.5817,-86.5164

The sky was clear of any clouds and the sunset was receding in the western horizon. It was when I was turning and looking at the southern sky when my attention was focused on what I believed to be a star at first, low in the southern horizon.  It appeared too large and too early in the evening to be any known visible  star, but as I was looking at it I commented to my wife, if she thought it may be in motion. She said that it was moving towards us.  I then spotted it through my binoculars and could see it was not an aircraft because it had no navigation or anti-collision beacon lights and it was a constant glowing ball of yellow light. It took me about two seconds to realize that it was not any possible aircraft of any type.   I called to my wife to go inside and grab my video cam while I kept visual on the object. She returned just as the object now appear! ed closer, but maintaining a constant altitude and distance from my point of view. By the time I got it in my cam viewfinder it had already traveled half way across the eastern horizon from my vantage point.  The object was moving from south to northeast and made no sound what so ever and it emitted a constant yellow-gold brightness to it, but clearly spherical in shape.  On two or three occasions it slowed down to a point that it may have stopped in midair. When it continued it started moving much slower than before.  I would estimate the image size to be about 1/8th of an inch diameter at arms length, traveling at the speed of a Cessna 172, (when I first spotted the object) then slowed down.  It would be difficult if not impossible to tell at what distance it might have been or altitude.  All I can say is that it was moving in a very straight path at about 30 degrees off eastern horizon from south to northeast.  I continued video recording until I lost sight of it low in the no! rtheastern horizon. I captured 1 minute and 35 seconds recordi! ng time. My total observation time was 2 minutes 10 seconds. Light conditions outside at 6:09 pm were very low yielding very low recording image on my digital 8 video tape, but the image was captured enough to see an object moving over our community. My wife was the only witness present and she observed this with me the entire time.  I checked weather conditions for wind in my location and winds were recorded at 13.8 mph WSW.  Had this been a balloon or Chinese lantern it would have been very unusual for it to travel against the wind. This sighting would have been clearly visible to anyone outside having an unobstructed view to the eastern horizon as it was still light outside and the object was moving rather slow against a blue sky.

It was quite bright and seemed to move very smoothly across the sky.  I first thought it was a plane but it seemed to have too much red and orange colors on it.  As it continued to move south , I grabbed my cell and called my neighbor and told her to come out into her front yard.  When I hung up I saw another light appear out of the Northwest and start moving in the same path as the first.  As the first moved further to the south, I was able to get a better look and it seemed it had fire coming from the bottom of it which caused the orange-ish-redish  color – above the orange it was a bright white but I couldn’t really distinguish a particular shape. Then there was another light appearing out of the northwest (now 3 in total) that started following the same path as the first two – they seemed to all gather in the south hanging suspended.  I tried taking a picture with my cell phone but no luck.  My neighbor was looking as well and trying to take a picture with her cell phone.  I think there were 2 more lights appearing and moving the same direction. I then ran into the house to get my camera and by the time I got back out there, my neighbor said they were “all gone”.

I kept driving and the light was dimming slowly to where I could see that it had two blinking lights. One red light at the front and one green light on the back so I thought that it was just a plane.

It is very bright. I thought it was a satelite or something but it comes up every night.  About 9:30 when you look up at the sky to the left, you can see blinking lights.  Sometimes they look red. When you look straight out over the garage to the right, you see a second one doing the same thing. It is much further out though but still you can see it. Over the course of 3 hours until after midnight the 'bright' satelite looking light moves up and by midnight, it is directly above my back door.  As that light moves up, the light on the left moves up and comes closer so you can see that it.  The one up in the right side you can see it but not as profoundly as the left side. Last night I was able to see that it looked like a saucer, it has lights around it so you can see the shape. It seems to be spinning and moving side to side but it stays in only these areas. In other words, it does the absolutely same thing each evening.  I have been watching this now for two weeks. I can see that is is a saucer with lights.  Last night an airplace flew across the sky and went over it. The 'saucer' dimmed its lights to almost zero.  After the aircraft move away, the lights came back up. There are two crafts here.  There is no doubt.  My mother, and neighbor have both been here and seen it. I do not understand why this is not being investigated by our government. There is absolutely something over Katy Texas. It comes back each evening and does the same thing. As the bright star moves up, these two saucers come in closer. Last night I could literally see the shape and lights. My neighbor has taken photos of it and there are hieroglaplics that look like a #3. This may be our technology. I suspect it could be because it seems to do the same and stay on the same track every single evening.",2011-10-25T00:00:00,29.775480377035134,-95.78561259640104

My husband is currently aircrew in the US Air Force.

The orbs move back in fourth in the sky, and periodically dim to black. Sometimes they flash between white and red, or vanish instantly. These orbs are extremely bright. We began noticing them regularly, over the past month. We first started seeing them periodically, back in July. On July 9th (approximate date), four of these orange orbs moved directly over our house at about 1,000 ft. They moved slowly and silently. Three stayed in a triangle formation, while the fourth flew behind, varying its direction, just below the others. After moving above us, they slowly dimmed, and appeared as black spheres. We have been watching for them nightly, and we are able to see them between 3-5 nights out of the week. We only have a few good pictures, as we don’t have a camera able to take good night photos, and lately, we’ve been seeing them much farther away. My husband has made every effort to debunk these objects as celestial phenomena, however, he cannot do so.  A few nights ago, we witnessed these objects in their usual place, moving back and fourth in the southern sky, just above the horizon.  When my husband went to work at 5am Saturday morning, he saw them maneuvering in various formations in the distance. He watched them until they were obscured by trees. These objects are not leaving the area.  Someone with the resources needs to investigate this further. I have never heard of UFOs hovering over an area for such a prolonged time.

At that time it was now directly in front of me traveling in a due westerl course following highway 347 almost to the center of my town. I live in a small town. I estimate based on my military and private pilot experience it was traveling around 500 knots. It passed to my left and I was not able to observe any red or green anti-collision lights or the required white tail light. In my experience I knew a military type aircraft flying at this speed would have some tailtale sign of emmission from the tailpipes and none was observed. I was approximately 1/4 to no more then 1/2 mile from this object that appeared to be the size of a standard size house I estimate its altitude to have been around 1,000-1,500 feet. It made zero sound. When it was in my center field of vision I could see clearly it was a boomerang shaped aircraft that had a very dark skin color that caused it to contrast with the night sky and allow its shape to be easily seen as it flew by. This aircraft traveled for another 4-5 seconds and then made a very abrubt course change to a due north course from its easterly course. This course change caused me at that time to lose any sight of the aircraft. It appeared to follow the Union Pacific Railroad line going north and then west. I called my sister inlaw who lives about a 1/4 mile to my northwest as it appeared to have changed course right over her house and asked her if she was outside smoking and did she see any object fly by. She stated she was outside at that time but did not see or hear any aircraft. She was under her patio cover so if it went over her house she would not have been able to see it. I immediately called Luke Airforce base 556th Fighter Squadron and inquired as to whether they were currently conducting any night time operations in this area or the Barry Goldwater range about 40 miles southwest of me and the duty officer stated no, they were not currently conducting any operations in our area. Note: we sometimes see Lukes F-16 fly over us on there way to the range but it is always in the day time and not at night. I gave the duty officer a brief of what I observed and he entered it into his duty log. I then called my local police dispatch and inquired if anybody including any of the on duty patrol officers had reported any unidentified aircraft flying over town at a low altitude in the last 15 minutes and she responded that they have not received any other reports at that time. I gave her a quick brief of my observation. Closing comments: I have never seen an unidentified flying object before and this is the first time I have ever made a report on one to anybody. I was not drinking and I am of sound mind. I have usually laughed about other people alleged sightings including one my brother and mother reported to me awhile back. What I saw tonight was not anything I have ever seen before and the flight capabilities were not of anything I have seen in my F-14 experience or in other military jet aircraft I have been exposed to. Its ability to make such an abrubt course change defies newton law of an object in motion stays in motion. We currently don't have any known advance technology to effect that sort of abrupt course change. If this was infact a secret military test aircraft then I would say we have advanced significantly in our technology and have somehow been able to develope structual technology that is able to resist high G-force levels both positive and negative. What disproves this theory to me is it takes a lot of energy to make such a turn and it requires extremely strong flight controls to force such an abrupt course change and that would have caused the aircraft to emit some level of noise and this aircraft was extremely quite. It would have caused a significant amount of stress on the airframe and on the flightcrew.",2011-10-25T00:00:00,33.055867567567574,-112.05598918918919

I was walking home from a friends house. Neither of us consumed alcohol or any other perception-changing substance in the evening. As I crossed the field near my house I lit a cigarette, and some distance away saw about four other people in the school below who were drinking. I stayed on the field for a while, then noticed above me a glowing object with an unclear shape. The light of the cigarette was distracting so I put it out. The glowing thing was a dull green and just hung in the air, far above me. It was not unmoving however, as it seemed to be slightly blurry, making its exact form difficult to make out. But it was not travelling in any direction. After about a minute a red line came from the object. It was also glowing and was much brighter than the main body of the thing. At this point the people below at the school left. I believe they saw the object though can't be certain. The glowing red line cast a light on the green object and I could now see ! that it was quite cloud like and slightly transperant. It had no exact shape and appeared more like a floating blob. I was reminded of an amoeba. At this point I noticed, though with much difficulty, many tiny lights cluster around the red line, which were very small and hard to see. I watched this for a few more minutes. The red line did not go back into the main body as the object went away. It is hard to say how exactly it left as it left behind a ""stain"" like after image in my vision from staring at its light so long. This made it hard to tell where it had gone and how it had departed. For a short while after it had gone I noticed a quiet ringing in my ears, but am unsure whether the thing was the cause.

Seen of 4 different occasions On the 31st of July 2011, my boyfriend and I were outside around 10:30 at night. I saw what, at first, I thought was a shooting star. I pointed it out to him and we both watched it move across the sky and get dimmer and brighter.  It seemed to be at a pretty high altitude, but hard to say with no size reference to compare it to.  We continued to watch it for about 30-45 seconds until it completely faded away.  Thought it was kinda odd.  But then another one popped up in the sky, in a completely different spot. It didn't move in a straight pattern this time. It moved up and down left and right at a pretty steady pace. Not fast, not slow. Almost like a cruising like matter you'd see an airplane travel at. Mind you there were NO flashing lights. Just ONE solid light that was white, like a star. Hence why I thought at first it was a shooting star. We watched it until it faded away as well. THEN AGAIN, a third one pops up in a completely different spot and does the s! ame thing. Gets really bright and moves around until it fades away to nothing. We definitely thought it was strange but didn't have any explanation. The next night August 1st 2011, around 10:30 again, I was outside and out of the corner of my eye I caught a light flash in the sky. It was exactly like what we had seen the night before. I watched it travel across the sky until it faded completely. I stayed outside to watch a little longer but didn't see any other lights. THE NEXT NIGHT August 2nd 2011, again around 10:30, I was again, outside when THIS TIME I was looking to the sky to see if I'd catch a glimpse of the lights. And to my ""not so much surprise"" I seen another light!! By this point my mind is blown and I'm really wishing my boyfriend was out there to witness the lights with me again. I had told a couple people about it and every night I would watch the sky to see if there were any more lights. But there was nothing. Last night (mind you this was at 10:00pm last night August 17th 2011) my best friend and neighbor calls me and asks if I can hear the helicopter outside flying around. Apparently they were looking for someone because they had their spot light on looking in all the back yards. (This is the NW Blvd/Maple-Ash neighborhood) When I came out I looked up and seen what I thought was the helicopter. I say to my friend that I don't see its spotlight. She then directs me to the south where the helicopter was when all along I was looking at the bright light ""flying"" around in the northern sky. I am then VERY excited and tell her to come look at the bright light, explaining to her that its just like what I had seen earlier in the month. We watched it fly around until it faded away completely. We sat outside and started talking about how strange the light was when ANOTHER one pops up out of nowhere in the northeastern sky.  Our older kids (10 and 12yrs) come outside wondering why we've bee! n gone so long.  So we start explaining to them whats up. When YET AGAIN another light pops up in the sky. My best friend goes inside to get her camera so we can try and capture some of this. Me and the boys see yet another one moving from west to east, the light got REALLY bright, stopped, then descended to what looks like, from our position, to be about the felts field/valley area. Hard to say from our viewpoint exactly. Anyways, while it descended, it started pulsating red and orange. We watched it until it slowly drop out of the sky until it was out of our view. By this point we're really tripping out! (We never heard any booms though, always silent) We sat out there and continued to watch the ""lights in the sky"" until about 11:00. There were too many to count. Had to be DOZENS of different lights. Some individual and some in groups. Some travel in the exact same flight pattern as the one before it, some are completely random. Some blink on and off. Some are just really ! dim like the light you'd see when a satellite moves across the! sky, an d some are extremely bright!  To me they're UFO's... now that does NOT mean its aliens but it sure as hell DOES mean they're unidentified!!! The best way I can describe them is, they look like stars at first, then they get REALLY BRIGHT, and travel across the sky in no particular pattern and fade away until you can't see them with your naked eye anymore. They do NOT fly in straight lines every time either. Some do, but others move from left to right then up and down then back to the left again. Very strange. Going out tonight to try and catch this on video.! Really hoping for clear skies tonight!!  There were many reports and A LOT of talk on our local news stations facebook pages last night, 8/17/2011 and today, 8/18/2011, about a bright light seen over the Spokane Valley that fell from the sky and a HUGE BOOM that shook people out of their homes to the streets to investigate. The light that we seen descending from the sky, pulsating orange and red is approximately the same time as the reports from the Valley. Coincidence? There is currently no explanation to what these witnesses in the valley experienced.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

Location - Standing on Memorial Park Beach, facing a general North/North East direction, looking directly over Georgian Bay, the large Eastern body of water connected to Lake Huron. Sighted over the far Northern edge of the water in the horizon, possibly navigating over land. Located 30-40 Degrees above horizon line, moving West to East at relatively quick pace, comparable to 2-4x average jet liner speed at that distance (a jet was visible at the time for comparison – a satellite was visible about an hour after wards for further comparison). Conditions at time of viewing: Crystal clear night, 9 PM Eastern -5GMT Time. Less than 100 stars visible at time of viewing less than 10 visible in the vicinity of the sighting, no artificial optics (glasses, telescope, binoculars) were used to view the craft, and I had a second witness who believed the legitimacy of the sighting. Description: The “UFO” was a white light sphere type craft, emitting a white light 5-10 times brighter than any star that was visible at the time.  The ship did NOT change color, did not blink any lights - such as common aircraft, and the brightness level did not change for the duration of the viewing. The craft appeared 3-5 times larger than any star in the comparable visible area, and moved left to right, with a sort of wobble or instability – commonly attributed to anti-gravity technology having issues in our environment. The craft did make slight adjustments in speed, and direction, but nothing concrete. They we're relatively quick adjustments, not a gradual increase or change. The speed was an almost instant increase, of about 10-25%.  The directional change was instant, but only 5-10 Degrees from its original course. The distance the craft moved is unknown to me, but an easy comparison is 7-10 hand widths when an arm is extended making the “stop” hand motion. On a number line comparison; 0 being perpendicular to the water's edge; - being left, + being right, the craft started at -2 hand widths from left (when i turned and noticed it was there), proceeding to +5 or more hand widths to the right  he craft seemed to fade into the sky as it reached the end of its path. I did not break eye contact with the craft (other than to blink) for the duration of the sighting – which was less than 5 minutes; but completely convincing in every way as to it being extraterrestrial in nature.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,44.6001,-80.583

At first I thought the light might have been an exceptionally clear and bright Mars, but I realized quickly that the light was too vivid and bright to be a planet and called my cousin outside to witness it with me.  The light seemed stationary at first, at about 50 degrees above the horizon, but then slowly moved northward.  While the light traveled north, it may have changed speed a few times.  It also pulsed quickly all the while, like a star; between slightly more bright and slightly more dim. As it neared the north sky, the light began an exponential decent towards the horizon and flickered between much brighter and very dim.  Around this time my cousin thought he may have heard a sound like a plane crashing to the earth.

I continued to ask her if she was seeing the same thing above the trees as I was and that I was not just seeing something that was not there.  She confirmed that I was seeing the same thing as she was.  When it passed over us there were no noises coming from the light.  I am intrigued by this and so are the others who have spotted this same burning light in our town.  We continue to watch the night sky hoping we can get another glimpse of this burning orange and red object that continues to surprise us every time we see it.",2011-12-17T00:00:00,42.2322,-85.7736

I believe that we are not alone and I read a lot about UFO`s and all my intrests.. So I looked up in the sky.  It was really clear no clouds it was just horrible cold we have right now -14 degrees in my country (ask me to get information) I saw a really fast triangle flying from East-West..at this moment i just wonder me what can fly so fast..there was no way that it was an Jet or any other Army-Jet because it make no sound no noise!  It had also 3 lights one on the top one (red) on the front (dark, i never saw a light like this it was reflected trought the moon) one on the heck (behind) (white). The lights flashed very fast on out on out every 1/3 seconds it was not very hight so I saw it really good not more than 4-6km  I can t say it 100% but 4-6km no more no less. It were so long as a Boeing 747 or a bit shorter. It is absolut impossible that it was an light reflection or a satelite or a chemical process or something other I had clear view,I do not take Alcohol before or after or other drugs!  And i repeat it were a clear view this morning. There were nobody at this moment at the street. As i saw it I was confused can t move me a feet hold my dog on the line hard so that he also stands still and i just looked up.  As it disappeared in the West i looked 10 min after this in the sky nothing passed, but i saw a normal plane and it does make a lot of sound, at this moment i just wanted back at Home.  I had a strange feeling don t feeling me anymore good and I smoked two cigarettEs. I even do not know how i got back home.  It take normally 2 minutes. After the 2 cigaretts i searched a place to report it, but I don t found anything can't call in th USA because it don t worked. After searching and searching I found this site made an e-mail nobody respond. So I post it here. I think today nobody interest that people view UFO s its a shame and a blame for the human.  I know a lot about the UFO s and other Thema`s but to report it,thats really (a word i don t write). Because I had also the feeling,that this flshing of lights was not meant, ""Hello we are Aliens do you all can see us?""  I think it was an scout UFO and Im 100% sure no other theory were explainable even I m not an Expert. If anyone has a question I'm open for everything. Expect critic - I know what I saw - Don t forget it - I was confused yes and paralyes some way but I can (re) paint the UFO excatly 100% as I saw it. It was no optical error, no reflection, no satelite, no fallen comet, no chemical process, no  Plane or whatever   So read this before do any critic.

I got a very good look at it. I also contacted Peter Davenport and he suggested I post my information here. I was outside smoking at 11pm when something that seemed like a firecracker blossomed in the sky.  It was a red blossom.  However it didn't fall apart like a firecracker does at the end in a shower of sparks, it simply stayed in the sky and started coming closer to my house, I live in the woods so lets just say it had my attention. Then the really interesting stuff started happening. The ''craft'' flew at low level I'd say 300 feet over the trees.( it was night however) It had a rectangular shape who's edges seemed to dissapear in shadows and was very hard to distinguish. In the middle and centre (underneath)of it was a blue light (like a spotlight in intensity). Behind this light also on the belly was a white light. There was also a white light in front of this blue light. The lights seemed to follow a straight line. The ''craft'' passed right beside me over my head. It was making no noise but when it got close I heard a humming noise barely discernible. It was moving quite slowly when it was over me so I got a very good clear look from close. (about 2 to 3 hundred feet over my head it seemed)  This is when I clearly saw the black rectangular shape edged in shadows.  The lights seemed to change in intensity, I got a red glimpse also, coming as if from lights on the sides( it was only seen as a periodic red glow on the sides of the craft.  It seemed the size of a small plane, bigger than a 4 person plane.(it was however night so size was impossible to judge, big though)  At first I thought it could be a remote control flying toy but when it got close enough and I saw the size I knew this was impossible. When it passed me I got a glimpse of the rear of it. I believe this was part of the propulsion system.  It was another yellow light but extremely bright, like a mini sun or globe. The intensity of the bright globe made me think of a jet engine firing without any fire coming out of it. It was a glowing globe of light.  The craft left no exhaust in the sky. I believe this intense glowing light in the rear was the propulsion system because when the craft accelerated this seemed to get brighter. This is what really got me freaked out: when it was 500 feet passed me it accelerated incredibly fast and zig zagged downward (toward the trees) at extremely high speed and dissapeared in a quick flash. I went finished my smoke, went inside, immediately closed the game I had been playing on my computer and went online and on google typed in some of the things I saw trying to figure out what kind of thing I had just seen. I also called one of my best friends who laughed a little at how weirded out I was. I ended up on this UFO report sigt and started reading the last ones from 2011 and some from 2010. I was freaked out by the fact that almost all of them had part of what I had seen but it was obvious from the reports that whatever was being described seemed to correspond to a part of what I had seen. I also heard a helicopter pass over my house several minutes later, which makes no sense at that time of night. My experience seemed longer and more complete than the ones reported. This is making me think i’m in a movie or something but the day before I was babysitting my moms dog and he started barking and growling uncontrollably for a long period of time at 2am the night before. I only thought there could be a link between the craft and the dog today... So here I guess is another report of the rectangular craft that seems described in the 2011 reports I read on web site, only what I saw seems to have many of the elements that were described and was a little different than some others. I didnt really know who I should tell about this so hopefully it interests someone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was on the telephone with my girlfriend standing about 30 ft from our campfire when out of nowhere in the clear sky above me appeared a bright orange ball shaped object moving quite swiftly to the north.   My first thought was it might be an airplane that caught fire, I quickly yelled to my friend to look up in the sky and turn the music off. We both watched intently and listened for any noise but could here none. The object travel to the north for about 1 minute and then took a sharp turn in the sky and began heading south south east at the Sam rate of speed as before.   I hung up the phone and attempted to turn my video camera on to film the object but the screen was scrambled and looked as though it had been submerged in water. I had to take the battery out to reset the phone. While this was going on the objects light began to fade away and after about 1 minute in the new direction it completely burned out or disappeared.  My friend who was with me is an 8th grade science teacher and owns several telescopes I began quizzing him as to what we may have just seen and he was literally speachless.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it in our lives and it was very clearly in our atmosphere and was not an airplane or a meteor.  As we were discussing the possible origin of the ""UFO""  we had just witnessed and the strange thing that happened to my cell phone, the object reappeared in the sky just over our heads, it took what appeared to be a near identical course and it had renewed brightness this time.  It looked like a moving fire ball that changed shape before our eyes.   This time I managed to get a picture of it and both of us got video on our phones of the UFO.  It made the same turn in the sky and slowly lost it's brightness in the same part of the sky.

I witnessed what looked to be an opaque white circular or spherical object fly northward, quite high in the late morning sky!  I have submitted reports here before, so I always watch the skies over where I live, considering that there is an AF Base close by.  The object I observed, I would estimate, was possibly close to 18,000 feet or more, as there were scattered high thin clouds, and this object traveled above and behind these clouds!  It traveled slowly, and almost seemed to come to a stop a couple of times, but always kept in motion!   I watched it for at least a minute or more.  A co-worker was outside with me, but he was unable to focus on this object!  What is worth mentioning here, is that this same co-worker also intimated to me, after the object had gone, that he had seen a similar object earlier this morning, maybe less than an hour prior to my sighting, traveling southward, high up, and going at a really fast speed, he estimated, to be at least as fast as a passenger jet, and maybe even faster!   The object I saw was going due north!  There was no noise associated with this object, nor was there any vapor trails left behind it!  And no flashing or strobe lights!  At this elevation, it would be quite impossible to say it was a plane, because, even at ceiling limits of most passenger aircraft, one can still discern a fuselage of a plane, on a clear, sunny day!

First of all, this had a very straight trajectory and it appeared to maintain a constant altitude much like a satellite.  I tried to look at the maps, but i couldn't find anything that matched up its orbit to what/when i saw this. I live in Belton, MO, which is about 20 miles south of downtown Kansas City, MO, and really close to the Kansas state line. Friday July 1, 2011.  It was a little before 10:00 p.m.  I'll estimate 9:40 or 9:45.  It had just turned dark with the rest of the twilight disappearing.  I was sitting on the front porch facing due south.  People were shooting fireworks off.  There is a tree line about a block in front of me, so the horizon isn't visible.   I saw what appeared to be a very bright glow or light that appeared through the trees to be going straight up.  It didn't make a sound at all.   As it cleared the trees, i was waiting for the fireworks to explode out of it.  Instead what i saw was a triangle/diamond shaped glow.  I realized that it wasn't going up, it was going across the sky traveling due north and the curve of the orbit/flight made it appear to be climbing at first.  I am assuming this, although i couldn't see through the tree line to know this for sure.  It appeared to be directly over head, maybe a little to the east of here, but almost directly overhead. I stepped down away from the house to have a better view of it as it traveled.  At first, I thought it was a diamond shaped glowing object, it appeared shaped like a kite but as it neared, I noticed this was just an aura around it.  It was shaped more like an airplane.   It didn't appear to be solid but more like an object that was made out of fire or an intense orange colored light.  It looked like a phoenix but not flapping any wings, more like an phoenix airplane.  If most jets fly about 30,000 feet, i would estimate the altitude of this object to be about 5,000-10,000 feet or less, it's hard to tell.   There is a 200 foot water tower across the street from me, so it was substantially higher than several hundred feet, but appeared to be very low and bright with the glowing aura and the bright object in the middle suggesting that it was pretty low.   As i watched the object continue straight north, pretty much flying directly over Kansas City, MO, I noticed that it did not make a single sound, and it didn't appear to alter its course directionally or altitude wise.  I like to watch satellites across the sky and this seems to have had a very similar path, just much lower. Due to its shape, my immediate thought was maybe this was the space station on a close fly by, or some strangely shaped comet.  However, it didn't have a tail like a comet and looking up the path of the space station and satellites, I couldn't find anything that matched up, assuming I read the information correctly. I am a 38 year old male.  I am a teacher.  I enjoy looking at the night sky on a regular basis.  I have never seen anything like this before.

They were sitting in the street watching the object, one child came into the house to report what they were seeing and to ask us, (parents, ages 39), what it might be.   We went outside and at first thought it was a planet, then a satellite and then as it disappeared!, we were not able to determine what it was.   We didn't think much about it, (assumed it must have been a satellite, etc.) until we zoomed in on the photo and saw the object more clearly and could not identify it.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,39.7822,-106.9259

I observed a bright reddish-orange light crossing the sky in a straight line, approximately SE to NW.  I initially took it to be the landing light of an airliner, due to its size and the fact that this is a common flight path for plans arriving at Pittsburgh International Airport.  However, the color was wrong for a landing light.  In addition, there were no blinking lights anywhere in the vicinity of this light, as would be found on a plane's tail and wingtips.  I also did not hear any noise at all, as I would have expected from a jet flying overhead. The light progressed across the sky at a fairly slow pace.  It passed overhead perhaps 30-45 seconds after I first noticed it.  As it did so, the light faded out.  There was a faint dark shape that continued in the trajectory of the light until the glare from Pittsburgh hid it.  The impression was similar to a vehicle with a headlight and no taillights passing by.  The shape was faint enough that I cannot describe it with certainty - perhaps triangular or rectangular?  In the sky it was perhaps the size of my thumbnail when held at arm's length. A check of NASA's SkySearch found no satellites passing over the McKeesport area between 11:00 and 12:00 this evening.  After retrieving my camcorder, I sat outside and observed the sky until 12:30, but did not see anything besides the usual jets passing overhead.

It was orange in color and seems to glimmer like a flame.  However, we begin to watch as it moved across the sky beyond our view.   It appeared to be high in the sky.  Roughly 10 minutes later another ""orange flare"" came across the sky following the same pattern almost, it too flew out of view as the first.   As it flew overhead, binoculars form within the house were obtained.  View through binoculars, the object was very hard to focus in on remaining blurry.   Approx. 10 minutes later another flew in about the same path and direction as the previous. This time, this particular ""orange flare"" was moving faster than the others coming from the same direction and going towards the same direction as the other.  (The direction these things were going was from the North - Northeast moving towards the southwest - sometimes turning west).  This one slowed down and appeared to come to ! a complete stop while still glowing orange.   A minute or two later, the item began to move in a western direction and slowly began to disappear until it was gone.  Once it disappeared, another came into view across the sky to the north again - it followed the same path.  This point was when the choice to grab the telescope was made.   However, as the telescope was being sought after, two more objects appeared outside. This time as one went across (same direction) another appeared across the sky in the direction they were coming from making visible two of these objects at one time.   These objects were photographed and caught on video (phone).  However, watching the video and film afterwards, it is very hard to see what was actually seen.  Describing the view through binoculars - the objects appeared to be an orange spot light moving from side to side almost.  It was very hard to focus in on the objects.  The sky was clear except for some smoke in the southern portion of the sky from t! he fireworks - however, these objects moved through clear skie! s.   When the one object stopped, we observed a plane flying from the east to west and appeared to be flying toward the direction; however, when the plane flew by the object - you could tell the plane was much higher than the object.  However, it seemed weird that object slowed and stopped as the plane approached and as soon as the plane passed over head of the object, that is when the object begin moving in the westerly direction as the same as the plane, then vanished.  Further research on the internet mentioned items such as Chinese lanterns which may be possible - not sure because we have never seen them but the objects were weird as they seemed to be moving at various speeds and the one that stopped.  We have never seen anything like this before. The first two objects came from the North and traveled in a southwestern direction.  The remaining objects came from the Northeast and traversed in a southwestern direction except for the one object that stopped and changed to a western direction.  All objects except the first vanished or disappeared in the sky in view, while the first vanished behind the house out of view.   The object emitted no noise from at least what we could tell - there were fireworks going off in the distance and the booming of those were heard, however, when the plane flew by, we could hear that.  The objects were very hard to focus on and appeared blurry even through the binoculars; however they were very bright in color and looked like flares in a way but without the excessive smoke or flame appearance flares give off - the same color though.   The first two were moving about the same speed and the third that stopped was moving very fast before it slowed to a stop.  The remaining was various speeds but no! t as fast as the third.  The items were viewed from about 2115 hours to approx. 2215 hours.   The objects appeared as circle type and blurry.

They were above a field, but by the time I took the pictures, trees were in my way.

It was hard to judge their distance, but they must've been at least a mile from my position.   They were curiously bright- not blinding, but well defined and certainly not planes or helicopters.   I stopped briefly to observe them, and two of my neighbors, who had just pulled in, joined me.  We speculated about what they might be, and as it's July 6th, I posited that they might've been a sort of firework.   My neighbors rejected this immediately, and admittedly I'm not familiar with with any fireworks that behave as these lights did.  As I said though, the lights were already in the sky when I noticed them, so I can't speak to their ascent, but once in the sky they did move upwards, downwards, left, and right (slowly) despite it being a still night.   After observing the lights for a minute or two, I continued into the la! undry room, and when I returned they were gone. I did have my phone on me at the time, but I'm sure the lights weren't significant enough to register on the phone's shoddy camera. Describing them plainly as two orange balls of light is perfectly accurate. A bit of background on myself...  I was, and still am, skeptical about the existence of sentient alien life.  I think these lights could reasonably be dismissed as fireworks, although I can't explain their duration or behavior.  It looked like something straight out of a bad UFO TV special, and could've easily been some sort of light attached to a balloon, but it's testament to the sighting that they were impressive enough for me to bother googling this website and submitting a report. I'm not, however, interested in following up on this sighting or volunteering any personal information.   Thank you.

Dear Mr Davenport,   Missing time on July 1st, was something I won't forget, sitting on my front porch with husband at 7:45 pm, listening to music, hanging out.  Next thing we know we are in bed, we remember NOTHING. No memory, nothing.  Not even sure how we made it inside the house, everything was still on, stereo, TV, lights and the door was unlocked, which is not something we do.  I woke at 2:45 am totally confused, feeling all ""warped"" and the fear, fear very strong, but wasn't sure why.I was naked,  I do not sleep naked, EVER. This was not the ""norm"" for me. When I woke, I had the most intense pain in my neck, shooting through my upper back and up through my head.  I reached around with my left hand to hold my neck and there is a ""bubble"" of sorts and it was very painful to touch.  I could not lay there as it hurt so bad, so I sat up, and became so nauseous, dizzy and still confused.  I got up, holding my head, as the pain was incredible.  Got my bearings and walked to the bathroom which is just out the master bedroom door, and I looked in the mirror, and saw not me, but a warped me, as in, I could see me, but I didn't recognize the person staring back at me. I suddenly was overcome with even more dizziness and nausea,  I turned, and vomited like crazy for the next cpl hours.  My husband WOULD NOT wake up. I finally crawled back in bed 5 am after I went downstairs and locked the house, turned off the lights and was still very confused as to what happened.  My husband woke at 5 am, to feel the same way, only not vomiting, but very confused too, and not sure how or when we went to bed the night before. He is still VERY unsure what happened!   the whole next week I was terrified. beyond fearful.  I could not even go upstairs by myself to use restroom, take a shower alone in the house, NOTHING, I was so afraid.  We saw nothing, there is a void and it is eerie.  There is a feeling of being watched constantly. Thursday July 7th, again, I was sitting alone in living room, watching TV, and I was overcome by fear, I felt something was watching me again, I got very scared, (not like me at all) I sat there a few minutes only to hear a strange noise, not something I could identify, but I felt it from the upstairs, and I ran out of my house and to my neighbors house, I was scared again.  My husband was at work, I texted him to tell him I had a melt down and needed him.  He came home about 20 minutes later.  We sat and talked a bit, I calmed down, sorta.  Then we proceeded to bed to sleep. @ 11:30 pm.  I tossed and turned a bit, was very restless. It started at 0:30 am for me.  I was awake. I was lying in bed with husband, and I could feel fear, beyond fear, it was incredible to feel this way, though not a good way, but none the less, intense. husband rolled over onto his left side to go to sleep, I curled up behind him, and suddenly I could see these lights, little tiny lights, lines, shapes, all different colors, my heart began to race, and in my mind I could see flashes of ""monsters"" ugly ones, real strange looking.  I prayed so hard, I was so terrified, and yet I could only pray, husband was no longer awake and wasn't going to wake, I KNEW that. Hubby wouldn't wake up at all,  I was alone in this one. I felt a ""weird"" hand on my upper back, it rolled me over, I saw ""them"".  Three of them, two of them were a little smaller, with bits of stringy hair, they were at the foot of my bed, and one was taller, on the right side of me, and felt very ""powerful"" no hair, but the eyes, dark, ugly and very hypnotic.  My right hand was ""forced"" for better words down to my ""privates"" and my left hand was ""forced"" onto my chest.  I felt an odd heat coming over my body, and then I was ""forced"" to roll onto my left side, my knees were forced to my chest and my hands now forced across my abdomen.  I felt a sensation like never before.  My stomach was moving, literally. like a rolling sensation. I felt a heat between my legs, it was very warm and it was a rod like thing going inside me, a warm liquid came out of it, I could feel it.  Then I was rolled back over onto my back, and the big ""being"" had in it's hands a small ""baby like"" being, I heard an incredible high pitched noise in my head.  Next ! thing I know I am waking at 5 am, I have an overwhelming sadness, tears coming out of my eyes, I KNOW, I just know I was ""visited"".  A knowing/feeling/sensation that won't leave me.  BUT I am once again at peace, not afraid and no longer nervous, paranoid or anything, I am great actually.  Strange, I do not feel afraid. The next day, my nose, is sore,  It is still painful just to touch the right side of it, NOT sure why, but will be going to a doc to find out.

It comes from a different location each time, but mostly comes from either the north or the west, goes in a straight line across the city then when it gets over the mountain it begins to dim.  It first turns yellow then red then with a small flash like a camera flash it disappears. It has been happening nightly to several times a week for the past 2 months. The color of the bright white is like a very bright halogen.  Brighter than any star or moon or sun. It’s white light is just as bright if it is coming towards us or going away from us.  It’s intensity never changes. There are no blinking lights of red or any other color. It is steady and strong till it dims and disappears. There is an airport nearby but no airplane has anywhere near this bright intensity. It is probably around 10,000 feet, moves very smoothly. No beams of light come from it. The light is just itself glowing brightly. When viewed via binoculars or telescope the shape cannot be seen until it dims and turns yellow or red. Then it is clearly a round object. The flash is almost as if it is entering some type of fast transport mode either leaving with a speed beyond visible sight or entering something and disappearing.

When seen it is enormous. Larger than any star or plane in the area. It is relevant to 2 or 3 times the size of Jupiter as seen from our yard. The intensity of the light gives it a starry appearance with offshoots of brilliance. Last night we had the whole family over, 8 of us and we all watched it as it came over then disappeared over the landslide area in the canyon.

(est.).",Harrington,WA,2011-10-17T18:42:00,light,15-20 seconds,"Occurred : 10/17/2011 18:42  (Entered as : 10/17/2011 18:42) Reported: 10/17/2011 11:26:35 PM 23:26 Posted: 10/19/2011 Location: Harrington, WA Shape: Light Duration:15-20 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/084/S84603.html,"Bizarre light seen streaking across the clear and cloudless evening sky, covering 120 (+ or -) degrees of arc in 15-20 sec.. I had just completed my nightly walk on the 9-hole Harrington Golf Course, and was standing beside the practice putting green, located at the north end of the course.  I had paused, to enjoy the beautifully clear, almost cloudless, night sky.  I was facing generally north-northeast, and could see the star, Capella (I believe), almost straight in front of me, just to the left of the town water tower, and at approximately 20 degrees angle of elevation. My attention was suddenly drawn upward to a fast-moving light, the approximate size and luminosity of the International Space Station (ISS).  When I first observed it, I estimate that it was located approximately 30-50 degrees to the left (west) of Capella, and at approximately 60-70 degrees angle of elevation.   During the first instant I saw the light, as it coursed toward the east in the northern sky, I assumed that it was probably the ISS, or perhaps the German ROSAT satellite, which is currently anticipated to re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere at sometime between October 22-24, 2011. However, within probably a second, or so, of my first having sighted the light, I realized that it was not the ISS, which I have witnessed on many occasions, and that the object's angular velocity across the sky was far too high for the object to be either the ISS, or any other man-made orbiting object.  Whereas a typical satellite in low-Earth orbit has a maximum angular velocity in the vicinity of one degree per second, the object in question appeared to be moving at perhaps 5+ degrees per second.  My impression was that it was ""streaking"" across the sky. In addition, the object may have had a very faint blue, or perhaps purple, tinge to it.  Its color was not quite that of a typical star in the night sky, although the color distinction was very faint. The object continued coursing to the east, and disappeared from my sight when I could no longer resolve it visually.  It did not fade out, as satellites are seen to do when they enter the Earth’s shadow (or ""terminator"").  It simply got smaller, until I could no longer resolve it visually. I immediately opened my cell telephone, and noted the time to be 18:42 hrs. (PDT), and it took approximately 30 seconds for the indicated time to turn over to 18:43 hrs..  Consequently, assuming that cell phone time is accurate, the time of the sighting may have been 18:42::30 hrs. (PDT).   The object coursed from approximately 340 degrees (true) to approximately 90-95 degrees (true) in, I estimate, 15-20 seconds, again, at a much higher angular velocity than satellites are seen to move across the sky. The event is somewhat complicated by the fact that the ROSAT satellite had passed through the same general area of the sky some eight minutes before my sighting.  The website, www.Heavens-Above.com, indicates that ROSAT was first visible in the northwest sky at 20:34::37 on the same date as my sighting, October 17, and that it would have been at an angle of elevation of 56 degrees, at its highest elevation.  However, that satellite would have traveled from the northwest sky to the south-southeast sky over the course of 240 seconds, at a much lower angular velocity than that of the object I observed. I considered the possibility that the object might have been a fragment of the ROSAT satellite, but even that possibility does not seem feasible.  The object disappeared from my sight when it was within a few degrees of true east, and the ROSAT had coursed to the southeast, approximately 4 minutes earlier. I also considered whether the object could have been a meteor, but that does not make sense, either.  Its luminosity did not fluctuate during the entire sighting, and no fragments were seen falling from it.  Moreover, 20 seconds is a very long burn-time for a meteor, particularly a small meteor, and there was no terminal burst, which commonly is seen for long-duration meteors. This event has me thoroughly confused!!  This was a very strange occurrence, for which I have no ready explanation!! I hold a commercial pilot rating, and I am a former flight instructor.  In addition, I am a frequent and avid viewer of the night sky, and am able to identify many of the heavenly bodies and constellations by name.  I own a number of reflector telescopes, and several pairs of high-quality astronomical binoculars, all used for night sky viewing.",2011-10-19T00:00:00,47.42069999999999,-118.3997

Searched through your sighting database and found first posting of my sighting on 10/31/10 at 19:30 in Northridge, CA, posted on 11/21/10   I had described as “rounded “boomerang” shape of about seven or nine dark circles”.  This time I was up early around 5 AM on morning of 10/21/11 so I grabbed a cup of coffee and went in backyard to watch the meteor shower from Halley’s debri.  Was an absolutely clear sky and I did see a couple good meteors and several weaker ones.  Also saw a couple satellites pass.  Was actually watching one of these when something else caught my eye.  At first is seemed like a very dim and tight cluster of stars, like looking momentarily at the little dipper.  And then I realized it was moving. It was a V shape with very dim “Burnt orange’” colored round objects, I can’t say lights, or globes, or even circles because I just couldn’t see that kind of detail.  It moved from the Northwest and to Southeast di! rection.  This time I really focused on it until it just got so faint it “disappeared”. Like last time it did not travel so far from sight that it just got so small or distant that I could no longer see it, it just kind of faded into the night sky.  By this I guess I mean the object was so dark and dim that it was hard to see in the first place, as it moved away it got dimmer and until it was no longer distinguishable from the dark of the sky. It was so quiet out I could hear the leaves rustling from a very light breeze.  This thing did not make a sound. Description: V shape, point of V was the “front” of the object, or at least pointing in the direction it was moving. The point was one of five orange “lights” for lack of better description, the left side of V was three more orange lights, right side was one more orange light, I assumed it could have been at an angle where more lights might have been on the right side I could not see. Totally estimating/guessing elevation of ! around 1000 feet? Speed again guessing 50 to 70 mph. Seemed to! glide o r float but pretty fast, and again dead quiet. Sighting location was the same as last time, Northridge, CA, just above the 118 Freeway, my backyard which is south facing. Seriously have no idea what this was, but it definitely seemed to me to be some sort of propelled object, not balloons, not a plane or helicopter.  Again no idea what it was, but this time I know I saw it.",2011-10-25T00:00:00,34.25238827586207,-118.53934206896552

This sighting took place on Friday, August 19th, 2011, at about 10:20 am. The weather was sunny and cloudless. The moon was visible in the western sky. I was driving west on Cleveland Road in South Bend when I noticed a dark circular or spherical object at least several hundred feet up in the air, moving east.  The object moved parallel with the road at a steady speed with no erratic motion. It was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or a bird.  It could possibly have been a satellite of some sort, but the object seemed to change its shape subtly as I observed it, especially toward the end of the sighting, which lasted about 30 seconds. The object reflected sunlight and appeared metallic. As soon as the object passed from view, I did a sharp U-turn and parked in a nearby driveway, got out of my car, and looked east to try to see the object again, but I couldn't spot it. I had just been talking to my 4 year old son about the moon and how mysterious it is. Just a minute before the sighting he had craned his head down below his car seat shoulder strap to peek out the windshield in order to see the moon (which he saw).  He did not see the ufo.

While it was falling the flame appeared quite large, after it leveled off the flame was mostly out however it did NOT lose speed or altitude during it's flight.  It's as if the flame was turned off but we could still see the afterglow until it got to far away. None of us saw a craft of any type.  The flame was too bright to see anything around it however there were 2 distinct intensities of luminescence.  The center portion was a yellow(er), more intense light than the outside area.  The outside light while still very bright was almost translucent.  Both lights dimmed at approximately the same rate. It moved completely across the sky in less than 30 seconds however there is no telling how long it was falling as I only saw it when it came into view.

STATEMENT OF UFO SIGHTING  I was driving home on August 19, 2011, and turning off of the highway at US 95 North at Fort Apache - Horse Drive at approximately 8:30 pm.  This location is situated in North-West Las Vegas, Nevada. As I was approaching Horse Drive, I noticed two very distinctive bright orange colored lights in the sky.  At first I thought they may be special street lights, because they are doing construction work in the area.  As I got closer, driving down Horse Drive, it suddenly became clear that they were not street lights. I continued driving down Horse Drive, glaring at these lights and when I was sure of what I saw, I stopped to observe.  There was a maroon colored van, which had apparently been observing the two lights as well. The two lights were like fire and shaped like a tear drop or a clove.  The sky was dark (just beyond dusk), stars were visible.  The objects were identical.  The color was pinkish-orange at the bottom, yellowish-orange in the middle, and yellow at the top.  They were very bright.  It was just like fire and they were hovering and behaving like the movement of fire.  They appeared to be much larger than the stars, yet about 1/3 size of a regular full moon.  They were a good distinctive distance between each other, but they were clearly identical in shape and size. As I was observing these two beings, one of them shot away over and behind the western mountains.  The maroon colored van made a U-turn and drove back up Horse Drive.  The speed of the shooting being was a little slower than lightening speed, but very, very fast.  The remaining one just hovered.  As I began to move down the street a little further, the being moved parallel to me.  I proceeded to turn in on my street and I could still see it.  I stopped the car again just before turning into my garage and the being just sat there.  I pulled into my garage and closed the door.  I grabbed my digital camera and went back outside to take pictures, but it was gone. I called the police to report it and they gave me your number.

I didn't know what it could possibly be.  We have planes flying over our home all time because we live near an airport so I have seen my fair share of lights in the sky.  This object was totally unfamiliar to me. It was a pentagon shape made up of 6 orb-like dull green (swamp green) spheres.  I couldn't see the actual object (if there was one); only the spheres that made up the shape.  The spheres were located at each point of the pentagon and one in the middle of the object.  The reason I say ""orb-like"" is because they didn't emit any light as I would expect them to.  When it came into view, it was as if it were coming out of a cloak.  I could see the object for about 2 seconds (flying straight) before it vanished the same way it came into view (cloaked).  If you were in the dark with a flashlight and something passed by the beam of light, that's what it looked like except a light shining on this object would have made it more visible in my opinion. It took a second for me to realize I could have just witnessed a UFO.  I contemplated in my mind what it could possibly have been to no avail.  I stayed outside for a little longer to see if it came back or more could be visible but there was nothing else.  There was not much time to analyze more detail of what I had just seen as it was here and gone so fast (about the speed of a shooting star). I finished my cigarette and went inside but didn't tell my wife about it immediately.  I cleaned up the living room a little bit, grabbed a sheet of paper and a pen. I drew out the shape of the pentagram and showed it to my wife.  I said, ""I just saw this in the sky.""  She asked if it had any lights on it and I said no then gave her the description from above. I went outside with my camera to try to take some long exposure shots of the sky to see if I could catch anything else but didn't see anything more. I wanted to make sure I remembered what I saw, so explaining it to my wife was my backup.  This morning, I decided to make an animated GIF image of what I had seen.  I tried to make it as accurate as possible so I used a background image of last nights sky.",2011-12-17T00:00:00,33.0313964028777,-80.18812302158273

As I followed behind him, he unexpectedly sped up around a sharp curve and proceeded to slam on his brakes.  He hopped out of his truck, sprinted to my vehicle and out of breath, he yelled, ""Did you see that?""  I listened skeptically as he told me he spotted three bright lights hovering above the clear cut to our left. 7:57 PM: Before I could tell him that I’d have to see it to believe it, a bright light moved slowly, from left to right, below the tree tops in front of us.  This perfectly round light faded out of sight near the top of a group of tall pines.  My attitude immediately shifted from skeptical to alert mixed with a little fear.  We hopped in and drove on to our destination, which was still a solid 1.5 miles straight through the woods. 8:02 PM:  My eyes were glued, and my head was on a swivel.  My windows and windshield were completely fogged over due to my body temperature’s rising.  The floating objects did not make us wait long to confirm their existence once again.  Around the same altitude as the first, two lights appeared to our right, creeping along together.  The other driver pointed toward the lights, and I stopped my vehicle.  The two yellow circles continued moving for a few seconds, then stopped.  When they resumed movement, one light disappeared, while the other remained in motion and faded out of sight.  I wiped the fog off my window as we carried on down the path. 8:10 PM:  Convinced the encounter was over, I spotted two more floating lights to my left.  I beeped my horn to notify the other driver I was stopping.  They flew at the same altitude, but they were now in a completely different set of tall pines.  Being in high alert mode, I realized that the lights seemed to be reacting to us (disappearing as we initially rounded the corner, appearing up ahead of us, moving towards our rear whenever we stopped).  Similar to the first pair, one light disappeared while the other slowly flew out of sight. The yellow lights were constant, with no flashing or flickering.  Even though they were moving slowly, they seed to leave a lighted tail behind them (similar to a comet).  There was no noise of any kind associated with their presence, even though they seemed to be within a 100 yard radius of our trucks.  They stopped and started multiple times, displaying their ability to ""hover.""",2011-12-17T00:00:00,31.8581,-81.5854

So, I grabbed a knife, set it against the window to measure, and sure enough:  The ""star"" was moving. Then, I began to think it was a helicopter flying about, so I opened the window and there was no sound of a helicopter at all. So, I just stared, measured it with the knife again, as it kept moving in different directions, and then I noticed that it had a much smaller light on top of the bigger light. That's when I figured that the smartest move would be to wake my brother so he could see the ordeal and interject some opinion. I woke him up, went into the kitchen, and it was gone.

I was staying with her over the 4th of July weekend.  I saw 3 reddish-orange orbs.  They were very large.   At first I thought they were from cell phone towers, so I did not think too much of them. As I mentioned, they were very large and they were not blinking as cell phone towers normally do.   So I thought I'd pull over on the side of the road in her neighborhood and see if they moved.  To my surprise, they were moving very slowly across the sky.  The lights were sort of oval in shape.  The center was primarily reddish orange but there was a whitish or lighter color outside of the orange color.  There was no noise whatsoever.   I watched them for approximately 3 minutes as they moved across the sky.  A car pulled in the neighborhood, so I needed to move my car.  When I finally reached my mother's house I couldn't find them again. I have a keen interest in UFO's and sightings, and I tried to think of everything I could to explain what I saw.  The lights did not behave like traditional air craft lights.  They were much to big and they were not blinking.  Plus, I believe that aircraft would've moved faster across the sky.  They were not lights from a cell phone tower or from a satellite or star.  I'm telling you, these lights were very large.   I wasn't going to report this until I spoke with my father today.  He said that he saw something similar last night in his area of town.  Apparently, he was watching some fireworks with his wife and neighbors and they saw them as well.  He said he even said, ""Hey, do you see that?"" to his neighbor about them.  That's when I knew this was a significant event and that I needed to say something.

They didn't make any noise and looked like they were floating across the sky...it looked like they flew higher and then disappeared.   Other cars driving by were looking up pointing at them.   I called my neighbor on my cell phone and told him to hurry and look toward the west to witness them.  He and his wife saw them...he got his binoculars and said they looked like neon orange disks.  There was a group of them... then a line of them and finally one straggler.  I called the 9 news station to see if anyone had called it in... I hope there is an explanation I have never seen anything like that!   I am a register nurse...my neighbor is a contractor and his wife is a retired postal supervisor.

On July 2 before  8:20p  1)  I saw a star-like object moving roughly west-south west to east north-east in the night sky.  After moving halfway across the sky behind some clouds the object suddenly veered to the right as in a giant L.  It moved quickly away southeast without a sound and became dimmer as it went behind the clouds.  My wife saw the object weaving back and forth slightly before it changed directions. 2)  I saw a second, dimmer star-like object moving roughly west to east again, much slower than the first object.  This time I noticed it weaving slightly.  I lost sight of it when it went behind some clouds.  at this point, my wife went to the bathroom, and noted the time at around 8:26 when she was done. 3)  I saw a third star-like object dim and as slow as like the second object, moving roughly north to south. 4)  As the third object moved behind clouds, a fourth dim star-like object appeared moving from the southwest heading northeast.  at this point, the occurrences were getting closer together.  I went inside to tell my son, but he did not believe me.  As my wife and I were talking about what we saw, we noticed  5)  A fifth bright star-like object.  As bright as the first.  It appeared in the east, yet somehow overhead almost above us moving very slowly southward.  We observed that it suddenly grew extremely bright and then dim, and then lost...perhaps behind the clouds?  Hard to say.  Some stars were visible in the vicinity. 6)  A sixth bright star-like object appeared shortly after a couple of minutes...or less...moving slowly southward.  It grew suddenly very bright, then dimmed, and was lost behind the clouds.  It's pattern was similar to #5   We waited outside for more activity...nothing...when we went back inside; it was ~9:20 p.m.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,19.69938031496063,-155.13851102362204

As it's July 2, many people in the neighborhood around my home were shooting off fireworks, so when the fireball-like object first entered my vision, there was a second or two where I wasn't paying too close attention to it.   Looking closer, I then realized that it wasn't a firework or a piece of one, but whatever it was, it appeared to be burning, as it had a flickering quality to it, which is why I describe it as fireball-like. Its size appeared to be something along the lines of a kernel of corn held at arm's length. Initially thinking it was a crashing aircraft, I jumped off the couch and ran outside to observe the object (2-3 seconds or so elapsed at most) and made it outside in time to view the object cross the sky by about ten more degrees or so before passing over the top of my house, out of my sight.  The sky was overcast, and to the best of my knowledge, this object was below the clouds, yet moving too fast to be an aircraft, even a crashing one, and too high to be a firework.  It indeed appeared to be on fire, yet there was no smoke trail and the object made no noise whatsoever.  After it passed over my home, I lost sight of it, as I would not have had time to run around the house and follow it to the horizon.  The fireball-like object appeared to be traveling from the N/NE towards the S/SW, and was visible to me for between ten and fifteen seconds from the beginning of the sighting to its end. I have seen the ISS pass over my town before, and know what it looks like; to the best of my knowledge, this wasn't that (especially as it appeared to be below the cloud layer).  Don't know what it was, meteor or otherwise, but I'm sure with all the people outside lighting off fireworks for the holiday weekend, someone else must have witnessed it as well.",2011-07-04T00:00:00,38.1009,-97.2469

It was moving in and out of the clouds.  Witnesses beside us said it was a candle tied to a balloon, or a japanese lantern, which i started to think ""oh yeah that makes sense"" but, the orange ball continued to pulsate and then the orange ball started slowly dimming, which i thought was the candle going out due to lack of oxygen.   The weird thing was though that as soon as the orange glow went out there was a bright blue flash immediately followed b! y a bright white flash, (and the flashes werent like the flash of a firework) the object disappeared for a minute, then the orange glow reappeared and continued to pulsate again for a few minutes.  As it was approaching above our heads, the object stopped glowing, but you could see the silhouette of the object in front of the blue sky.  It looked like an oddly shaped blimp or something, still hovering above us.  Then it floated out of sight.

About 9:30pm (I'm guessing on the time, it was not yet completely dark to the west when this started) on July 4th, 2011, I was in my backyard taking video of the fireworks going off in the neighborhood.  I was panning back and forth as the aerials went off around me, but I wasn't looking through the lens; I had the LCD display turned out, but I was eyeballing for launches and then would turn the camera that way.   To the SSE, I noticed a red glow in the sky, automatically thought some sort of firework in the distance, but it wasn't moving, it didn't explode, it just sort of hung there.  I turned the camera toward it, but it wasn't bright enough to show up on the LCD display.  Nevertheless, I did keep the camera trained on it for about a minute by lining up the top of the camera and the side of the camera.  My eyesight is not the best, (I'm in my 50's) but it seemed to have at least two points, high and low, producing the red glow, although they were very close to each other, but the point is that it did seem to have some structure, it wasn't just a point of light, and although I had no idea of the distance between us, the diameter of the glow was about a tenth of the diameter of the moon. I went back to filming fireworks for a couple of minutes, went inside my house and transfer the .avi file from the SD card to my computer, and decided to go back outside and film some more.   This time I went into the street in front of my house, and although about ten minutes had passed, the red glowing object was still in almost the same position, although fainter and smaller, giving me the impression that it was moving away from me, although I couldn't really detect any movement.   Again I trained the camera on it by lining up top and side, but after about a minute of that, it became so faint that I could no longer see it. This morning, 7/5, I did a search for UFO sightings, and I noticed immediately that there has been a lot of ""fireball"" sightings, very similar in description to what I saw, so I felt compelled to report this.

Was orange with yellow aura around it. At first I told my kids, its probably a firework or a plane.  But I soon realized as it got closer, it was not burning out, was not making noise and was getting brighter and larger. After a few minutes, it seemeed to be following the vehicle and flew overhead. At that point my 12 year old daughter got very upset, started freaking out and saying. ""Its a large circle with a orange light in the middle!  It's hovering over the car!  Its a UFO!""    At that point I stopped the car immediately into a parking lot.  I looked up and the oject shut off its lights. It appeared at first to have completely vanished until my 10 year old son and myself looked over at the treeline and saw the shadow of a craft hovering over the trees.  IT was shaped like a layered cake.   My son drew what looked like a three tiered circular object with an antanae on top. I watched the object flip on its side, and then was a perfect black circle, which then flew off slowly with no sound.  As I watched it it then took off in the blink of an eye upward too fast for any terrestrial plane to accelerate. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, to reflect an evening sighting.

I have reported this in the past 2 years also.  You can see my prior reports on same day at approx. same time.  I think someone may be trying to create a hoax because it happens, so far, every 4th of July soon after fireworks (over past 3 years I’ve seen it). It was approx 9:55 pm.  An orange glowing orb glided slowly across the sky from the (approx) SW toward the NW for about 15 to 20 secs.  I and a friend made sure to have binoculars handy this time and sure enough, the same sighting as in the past two years.  We saw no other lights on the ""craft"" just a glowing orange ball. The ""Orange Glow"" seemed to intensify and then dull a little a few times (like manipulating a dimmer) but for the most part was steady.  Then, it just dimmed a bit and went abruptly totally out, while I was looking at it in my binoculars.   But, I could not see anything of a ""craft"" once the glow disappeared.  I looked with bare eyes then again with binoculars.  And could not see a thing, nothing.. it was gone.   Also, there were no other lights, none flashing or steady like a normal plane or helicopter etc. Anyway, I hope u were able to have someone out here this year to try and catch it and find out what the heck this is and if someone is hoaxing it.  Ill watch your site intermittently to see if you found an answer and if anyone else reports same. What keeps intriguing me on this is that I do see other sightings of apparently similar looking orbs in the night sky…..and some on the say day. Ill keep reporting and watching for answers.

On July 9, 2001 at 10:35 am, I was sitting on my back porch while talking with my mother (facing east) on my cell phone, I noticed an object in the sky. They sky was bright blue with some random clouds at very high altitude. Basically a bright sunny summer morning. The object was fairly obvious to notice in the sky because the sun created a shadow underneath the object giving it shape as I was looking up. I initially thought it to be a high flying bird or hawk approximately 250-300ft above the ground. But then I noticed that it had a consistant course of direction and was headed my way. It grew larger as it approached (object was heading due west at approximately 30-40mph). As it approached, it grew in size and became clear to me that this was not a bird or a normal/everyday aircraft as I heard no noise. Living within a few miles of the approach path for the largest airport near our city, and an avid military aircraft buff, I knew this was nothing I had ever seen before nor could I identify. My second impression was that a balloon was let go and drifting, but this object continued to maintain a westward course against a south/southeasterly wind at 10-15 mph and did not change altitude. As I started to mention this to my mother (while on the cell phone and the object now close to overhead and probably just two to three blocks north of my house) we lost cell reception, and our call was dropped. I have always had excellent if not perfect cell reception the 7 years i have lived in my town.  This was not normal cell reception as the closest cell tower is only a half mile away. The object was a very soft triangular shape (roughly the size of a compact car such as a mazda miata or something) and looked disk shpae from the side. So picture a very soft triangle from underneath the object, but was convex or disk shaped on the roof of it. It had a slow rotation to it the entire time, it maintained level flight, never made a sound, and did not roll or pitch in a fashion that a tirangular shaped ballon might tumble while moving along with the wind. It was silvery gray with some shimmer that the sun provided which informed me of the rotation it had. Then I thought, as weird as this was, I would try to snap some pics with my cell phone camera. I quickly took two pictures and I continued to watch the object continue it's course until it was completly out of my sight (heading due west). So I started in the back yard, facing east, and walked to the front yard, facing west, and watched it until my polarized sunglasses (which helped see the object for a much further distance) were of no use and the object was gone. I then was curious to see what my photos had produced. There was nothing in the sky that I could see on my pictures. I had some of the neighboring house tops in as references to possibly size and distance the object, but nothing of the object was visible. I was then a little un-nerved about this. A photo expert may be able to find something or I may have not gotten the object into view while taking them. I honestly cannot say, but I did make an honest effort to capture the object on two pictures. Either way I was extremely disappointed. I have never seen anything like it before.

I was looking into the southern sky and I noticed above my head, to the left of my periphery I saw a triangular shaped object that was semi-transparent and was definitely a solid shape and maintained its proportions and there is no way it could have been anything other that some kind of flying vessel! moving at a slow speed (for a flying vehicular) directly in the direction that I was facing and I saw it with eyes locked to it for a good 5 to 6 seconds.  My teacher was talking about a constellation and when I saw the object I pointed at it immediately and ""said what is that"", I kept saying it and the guy next to me saw it too and was excited about it, my girlfriend was standing next to me and saw it as well, I was so excited that I interrupted my teacher in the middle of him speaking!   The object which was semi transparent had a whitish-grayish turbulence looking feature across the face of its surface.  This surface seemed to move but I believe that I was seeing like a distortions of the stars above the object as it passed underneath them. There were absolutely no clouds in the sky that were visible and it was actually kinda light out . There is no way this was any kind of light reflecting on clouds or anything like a light beam. The object seems to kind of reflect light but did not give off or have any lights that I could see.  Also this smokey ""turbulence"" surface (that seemed to be moving) had a greenish kind of tint to it or at least that is how the image in my memory is fixed.  The object did not do anything except silently flew forward until at a certain point even though I was looking right at it, it kind of just disappeared before my eyes.  I could only see the bottom when the face of it was kinda parallel with my view, when it got further in front of me i couldn't see it like the kinda no-outlined-distorted triangle with kind of a glassy looking distortion like in the movie predator literally!  I know that may be a cliche but it honestly looked exactly like that to me.  I have never seen any kind of U.F.O. before this event tonight and although I have considered that aliens probably do exists somewhere out there I didn't think I would ever see something like this unless this and much less be writing all this about it online!   Also this thing had sort of features on it like extruding out of it but I don't know if it was the kind of cloaking distortion thing or what but there were definitely some kind of features, it wasn't flat looking. In other words I saw this thing in perspective from almost directly underneath at a 10 degree-ish lean to my right, and then this object flew towards almost the center of my perspective view, it seemed like it was less than a thousand feet in the air, honestly it looked like it was just a few hundred feet overhead, but no sound at all no engines, no fires, no lights, nothing.  I  am estimating (roughly) that this U.F.O was about only a few football fields in front of me when I lost sight of it completely, it couldn't have been that far because the object when compared to the size of my hand (average size) when I held my hand outstretched completely to point at it, the object when directly overhead was larger than my hand although dimly visible and when it was in fro! nt of my view about 30 degrees up (star class remember) it was smaller in comparison than my hand but became more brightly visible I think maybe because of the city lights in the low background, it seemed to somehow kind of reflect the light around it.  I don't know if this helps anyone or if anyone has seen something similar, it is very weird for me to have seen literally what looked like the predator cloaking device type of Klingon bird of prey from star-trek as it de-cloaks looking stuff but I don't really have anything to compare it to as it did look rather like those types of effects to me.  Remember the sky was completely cloudless and this could not have been a lighting effect as the object clearly maintained it's shape and proportions and moved at a consistent pace until it was not visible. I don't really know what else to put I didn't see anything else really the whole night and this was definitely not a plane as I had seen at least 10 planes fly over and they all had lights and were much smaller in comparison to this object and moved slower across the sky although remember this object looked really low to me, and seemed to be moving less than maybe 100 miles per hour or so. I don't really know the accurate speed of the object but I know I couldn't see any features of planes except for the lights... and this had no lights at all and I could see it quite clearly, it was incredibly eerie how long I was able to focus on this thing...  Also there were planes in the sky when this object was in the sky but not directly in view they were behind me going in the same direction as this object as well as other directions and coming from that direction. I doubt that they were related but I don't know, it was a lot of planes in the sky even my teacher said it himself that there was a ton of planes in the sky.  I don't know if my teacher saw it but some of the other students were talking about about seeing a weird light flash (but I did not see a flash) and I don't know if it was the same thing that I saw since we were kind of spread out and looking in different directions. I never thought this would ever happen to me. I hope someone can tell me what is going on??! I can't believe my girlfriend even is blowing this off and she said it herself that it looked like a manta-ray to her and it looked smokey but I am completely freaked out and blown away by this event as nothing like this has ever happened to me.",2011-10-19T00:00:00,31.097821476510067,-97.34603489932886

I've always been one to check out the night sky looking for meteors, satellites, planets, etc. But, I've never seen what I saw this morning in over 40 years of sky watching. I noticed a bright light moving from the NorthEast to the South, below the moon which was directly overhead. The path was not low, but not high in the night sky, about the level of Orion's belt to the right of the moon. I originally thought it was a satellite that had caught the morning sun not yet above the horizon. As I watched, the bright light became fainter, almost disappearing, but the object was still visible on it's path. Then, the object became really bright again, then fainter, then bright, then faint before disappearing totally.  The speed of the object as it moved across the sky was similar to a satellite - not fast, but steady. There was no jet noise, that I would have heard if this was an airplane of some kind.  Jets fly overhead all the time and usually there is some level of noise even at the highest altitudes, especially during the quiet morning. I'm not sure what I saw, but there was something unusual in the sky.

These were not meteors emitting a quick burst of light, they seemed to hover, nearly motionless, for about 15 or 20 seconds. I could see my shadow on the ground.  There was absolutely no sound as the lights appeared, and the craft took off at an astonishing rate of speed. Almost immediately, our property, which spans many acres, was inundated with very loud aircraft, all without any lights.  I have been to NASCAR events and the way these aircraft were flying over my home would best be compared to the 'flyover' at the beginning of every race, except they went over our property multiple times.  We live within 20 miles of an international airport, so I am not unfamiliar with many types of aircraft flying over our property, everything from homemade on! e-man contraptions to huge commercial airliners.  This object moved in a manner I have never seen any identifiable aircraft move with lights as bright as the mid-day sun, which in and of itself was puzzling to me, but when it was followed by the roaring sounds of what appeared to be jets flying without any lights, it really drew my attention.  I have lived in the area for over 25 years and have never seen a UFO here during that time.  But I did live in the Hudson Valley region of New York State and witnessed several mass sightings in that area, some of which made headlines in local newspapers and television.

I have driven down this road countless times in the past year and I knew that light wasn't there before.  I said to my son"" what is that blue light over there, do you see it?""  He replied ""ya, I see it.  I don't know what it is.''   We then came to a point in the road where we could pull on a side street.  We sat there for a minute and watched in wonder.  This bright object was moving from side to side, even doing a ""figure eight"". I drove a little further down the street to get closer to it.  We sat and watched it for another minute, then it just blinked out.  Gone.  And before I could say anything, it was back, bright as ever, just in a different spot.  I'm sure this was the same object we had been watching. To me, the shape was oval, but there was a time or two when it moved it almost seems to get longer.  We had the windows in the car down,there was not any noise that we could hear. Ok, so I really wanted the validation of another person.  I tried to flag a car down, they wouldn't stop.  Cant say I blame them, but that didn't stop me from flagging another car down.  He did stop. I said ""thanks for stopping, and i know this is going to sound crazy, but do you see that blue light up there?"" as i pointed to it.  He looked and said ""yes"". I said ""don't you think that it looks weird, the way its moving?""  I believe his reply was ""  I think its a police helicopter"".   Um.... Are you kidding me? My father is a pilot, fixed wing and helicopter.  I grew up in a plane. I'm pretty confident I could figure that out myself if that was the fact.  The guy was still watching the object and then he says ""maybe it a searchlight, ya know, like when a new place opens and they want to draw attention"".

About 8:20pm, Tuesday October 18th, 2011, I zipped through my usually route home.  I took one more loop around a traffic circle, which meant that I would now have to take a right to progress up the hill on which I live. As I came to the stop sign I notice 3 distinct lights flashing.  These lights were in a straight line and appeared about 150 to 350 feet off the ground.  I saw in what appeared to be a straight line of 3 lights of equal spacing at a distance or roughly 75 to 100 feet apart. The two outer lights matched, meaning they were two pulsating lights, one  was orange the other red. The middle light however remained constant and was orange.  This linear shaped object turned to the right and progressed up the hill appearing to ascend slightly on the way up the hill. As I looked at the object and took a right to begin my ascend on my motorcycle I thought to ask the man walking his dog if he saw the object, as he appeared to be looking up in that direction.  I also, thought to pull over and take a photo but my phone was in my bag and I was fearful I would lose the object as it continued to ascend up the hillside and over the wood line. I stayed behind this object for perhaps a quarter mile at a speed of 26mph.  My first thought was that it was 3 helicopters flying in a tight formation.  Then I noticed that the middle light was different and that the object  seemed to turn with the middle light being the center point or axis. I  have seen and jumped out of C130's from 300 feet.  And this was much larger. I could not make out the object, in terms shape, but it appeared like a large looming dark silhouette. I plan on asking the guy who was walking the dog if or what he saw   Given the size and time, I could not be the only person who saw this. I finally lost the object behind some trees.

I saw the objects as I was driving towards the interstate.  At first there were 4 objects falling from the sky,  that looked most like fireworks.  Each object had a “tail” streaming behind just like a firework that had just exploded in the sky and falling back to Earth.   As I continued to stare, it reminded me more of a comet, especially with the tail and because they were evenly spaced in the sky and falling at the same speed.  They looked more like concentrated balls of light than a firework explosion would.  The objects were higher in the sky but definitely at a very close range.   Suddenly, all at one time, the 4 objects stopped mid air (a short ways above the tree line). The “tail” behind them disappeared, and they were clearly circles of light floating, now not moving at all. Then they started moving side to side, up and down, in all directions. The movement was easy and fluid and when they moved the “tails” reappeared. I’m starring wide eyed, not knowing wha! t to make of what is actually happening, then it really got weird. The objects, together as if perfectly synchronized, moved to an aligned position. It wasn’t a straight line, but more like 3 in a line, then the 4th to the side, like it made a pattern. But the way they moved to this position was the strangest. Each object moved independently, but knew it was going to that particular spot. It reminded me of kids that file into a classroom with assigned seats. It’s as if you could tell they were communicating with each other. It wasn’t a star, and it definitely wasn’t any airplane of any kind. The movement of these objects, the quick speed the floating, the dynamics indicated that it in no way could be an aircraft.  Since I was getting on to the interstate, already in the turning lane, I couldn’t pull over to watch them. But as I drove onto the interstate, they were still there, floating close to the tree line. They were no longer in my line of vision, so there is no telling how long there were really there. My husband was in the car behind me, and saw the same exact thing. My mother was about 7 minutes ahead of me, going in the same direction, and she also saw the same situation. Above the objects in the sky was there was an actual plane. I’m not sure if they were watching the object. But it was there the entire time. I drove up I-459 North, and looking in the direction that I saw the objects (to the right side of the interstate), I thought I saw one of the objects again near the tree line, but I really can’t be sure of that. It was much more difficult to see from that side. There were however, a lot of planes in the sky. Planes that were not commercial airliners headed toward the airp! ort. But they seem to be staying around that same side of the interstate in the same area as the objects. I have never seen anything like this in my entire life, but I know it was definitely not a plane, not any sort of firework, it was not natural.",2011-10-25T00:00:00,33.3151,-86.75599999999999

We both talked how unusual it was to hear so many military jet passes.  My husband was facing the EAST sky and told me to look.  I saw 2 white-yellow circular lights and 2 objects (white with red lights) in the sky.  The white-yellow circular lights were faster than the other 2 objects in the sky.  It looked like the 2 objects were chasing the circular lights but could not keep up because the circular lights were making erratic moves and were much faster.  One of the circular lights would go right, then make an extreme northern change in direction while the other circular light would go left and disappear and then re-appear.  Then a 3rd and 4th circular light would appear.  Once in a while they would be headed in the same direct! ion and then split off and circle in other directions while the 2 objects (white with red lights) would try and follow them.  At one point, there were 4 white-yellow circular lights and 2 (white objects with red lights).  We continued to occasionally here the military jets (white objects with red lights) over the next 10 minutes and then they disappeared. The next hour we continued to watch 1 to 4  white-yellow circular lights dancing in the sky.  They made impossible erratic movements. A few times the lights would stay in one place, then suddenly race across the sky. The lights would sometimes get larger (as big as a star) with the naked eye, and then change directions and get smaller (1/2 the size of a star).

We assume the jets were military.  The jets were much slower than the objects they were circling.  By compass, we observed the objects between 90-120 degrees east.  We observed these objects for 90 minutes and watched them make extremely erratic maneuvers across the sky at high rates of speed – sudden horizontal to vertical to diagonal reversals and spiraling and stopping across the sky.

I had seen reports the day before of sightings on the M11 and I asked him to describe exactly what he saw (I could see nothing as I didn't have my glasses and am blind in one eye, shortsighted in the other: the dashboard is hard for me to see let alone anything at cloud level!)  The description he gave exactly matched what was filmed yesterday on the M11 (a report my partner had not seen) and when we returned home I showed him the camera footage- he was visibly taken aback! and explained that what he saw was identical except he saw only one orb as opposed to the four in the footage. We reported the sighting to the local police 20 minutes ago. I highly doubt it was a chinese lantern due to the speed it was travelling according to my partners account- the fact he shouted ""Jesus Christ!"" when the orb accelerated was enough of an indicator for me- I only wish I had had my glasses with me.",2011-08-21T00:00:00,,

Suddenly, something prompted me to look up and to the right into the night sky (admittedly, this alone was odd because I rarely if ever look into the night sky and also because there was no sound triggered me to look). Immediately I saw something moving fast, directly crossing into the moon’s glow.  My first thought was that it was a meteor but before I could even complete that thought, it changed. What I saw is difficult to explain. It was massive. Clearly looked like it had a cigar shaped body. And it was moving really fast. Faster than anything I’ve ever seen. And it was completely silent. I’m terrible with distance but in terms of height, it was up not that high up and it was descending fast at a sharp angle. Over the next few moments, my mind kept asking what type of craft is that?  There were two red lights, lights, on its rear and it looked powerful. Into entered into a cloud formation and disappeared. I’m a writer; my entire education is in film. While I do believe in the UFO phenomena, that our universe must compliment life that is not only human, and that our ancestors possibly were visited and interfered with by beings from other places. All of that said, I am a rational man.  I want what I saw to be explainable within the framework of our scientific understanding while at the same time, if I trust my instincts and the awe, jaw-dropping moment this created, I can’t help but believe it was something else. The entire time, all of four to five seconds, tops, I stood there asking myself ‘What ((deleted)) is that?’  I have seen shooting stars and meteors.  While there is a chance that this was a meteor, it didn’t look like one.  There was no streaks left in the sky, there was nothing protruding outward from this at all.  Only two red lights, and this thing looked like it was firing towards earth. Sadly, Berkeley is like most suburban neighborhoods where so few people walk the streets at night.  Thus, when I turned around to see if anyone else just witnessed what I did, there was no one. If it were a meteor, there seems to be no reporting from the science community.  This would have made some impression because of its magnificence. A friend found this discussion forum (http://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/ndio4/i_think_i_just_saw_a_meteor/) where a woman in San Jose speaks of seeing a meteor but then she says that it looked like a bottle rocket shooting towards earth.

Multiple luminescent reddish radiating lights in a line pattern that each changed course then faded into distance.,Steger,IL,2011-07-03T01:00:00,light,1 min,"Occurred : 7/3/2011 01:00  (Entered as : 07/03/2011 1:00) Reported: 7/3/2011 2:40:49 AM 02:40 Posted: 7/4/2011 Location: Steger, IL Shape: Light Duration:1 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82091.html,"Multiple luminescent reddish radiating lights in a line pattern that each changed course then faded into distance. I opened my patio door that faces south at approximately 1:00 AM.  In the southern sky I saw what at first I thought was an oncoming plane with bright reddish light.  The light was not completely steady but not blinking either. It seemed to be radiating like a twinkling star but much brighter. It was a very luminescent light with a definite shade of red. I think it was at least as bright as the planet Venus as it appears in the summer sky. It got a little brighter as it got closer.  I estimate the altitude to be 1000 to 2000 feet but that is hard to tell without knowing it's size and it's distance from me.  It was moving from south to north northwest.  The object was moving steadily but I'd have to estimate the speed because it depends on it's altitude and size to be accurate.  The object seemed to change direction and turn straight west.  As it did it's luminescence grew fainter and fainter  as it kept going west.  It was fading from sight and it's view was going  to be blocked by the treeline west of my house so I began to step up onto my deck bench.  I had no lights on so I looked down a few seconds to be sure footed as I stepped onto the bench.  Now on the bench I looked back up and now to the south and I saw three more lights exactly like the first one and they were on the original course as the first object when I first sighted it, seemingly coming from the south going to north northwest.  They were in a line one behind the other and evenly apart.  Then one after the other they all turned west and followed the first objects course and as they did they too began to grow faint.  I tracked them until they faded. I got the impression they were gaining altitude slightly as they proceeded west, but I'm not positive. The estimated speed is hard not knowing their distance from me.  There was no real point of reference. If they were 1 mile from me and at 1000 feet they were possibly a meter in size and traveling at around 50 mph. If they were ! 5 miles from me and at 5000 feet they were much bigger and goi! ng much faster. There was no sound coming from the objects. I did see a couple of flashes like a heat lightning not near the object but more to the west. There were sounds of explosions like fireworks in the distance, it is close to the 4th of July and the local yahoo's are blowing them off even at this hour. There appeared to be some clouds to the south and southwest of me and definitely more distant than the ufo's. After the objects faded out of sight I then checked the radar online and saw there was cloud cover at the time of my sighting approximately 10 miles to my south. So logically these objects were less than ten miles from me. There was some pretty severe storm activity to the south at the time of my sighting but at it's closest it was just south of Kankakee, IL approximately 40 miles south. There was sporadic but small rainclouds (according to the weather.com radar maps) in the area. I don't know what these objects were. I tried to come up with reasonable explanations. They were not like any kind of fireworks display I'd ever seen and I'm well past 50 and seen quite a few . I don't know if the sound of the fireworks and or the distant storms were coincidental or related. I tried to reason that they might be flares suspended under a string of helium balloons somehow tied together to remain in a straight line. But the last three appeared so suddenly and how would they be ignited? I've seen many aerial fireworks displays. This didn't seem to fit. I'm almost positive the wind was blowing in the opposite direction too. How to make balloons travel single file and turn uniformly following an exact path that the first like object took sounds like an improbable task. I've seen my share of meteors. I've seen the really fast small streaky kind and the slower fiery kind. These were not even close. They were much slower than a meteor and held a course, held a pattern! and then changed course in pattern. They were objects for sure, I cannot identify them and they were flying. I hope there were others who reported this. I was going to call the police but I wasn't sure what they'd do or say, so I did a search on who to report sightings to and found your site. I was just going to forget about it and go to bed, but someone has to at least know about what I saw. I am a professional musician.  I am well over 50. I am a reasonably logical person.  I do not take drugs. I only drink occasionally and then only one or two.  I am not given to flights of fancy.  I do not hallucinate.  I have a very credible and reliable reputation both professionally and personally.  I do not frequent any ufo websites or follow anything related as a hobby or as a way of life, I am too busy with my everyday business.  In other words I'm not a big ufo fan or anything I'm just an  everyday Joe.  Tonight I finished my job and drove the 40 minute drive home and just after I got home, and opened up the sliding door I spotted these objects.  I never saw anything like these before.    In my long life I've seen a couple of things in the sky that I still can't explain.  I told a few friends or family and I was not the only witness on those occasions.

These lights were not blinking or fading and they were roughly 4 or 5 times the size and brightness as the largest visible planet.  They were close to being in a straight line, made no noise whatsoever, and left no trail.  Had they left a trail, I would have guessed they were meteors. At the time I was with 2 friends who also saw the objects and thought them to be odd enough to quickly call their wives outside to check them out before they disappeared over the horizon.  It was then that one of the wives exclaimed there were more coming, and sure enough 3 or 4 more appeared from behind the treeline and followed the same path at the same speed.  More kept coming in random intervals for the next couple minutes, sometimes only 2 at a time, sometimes up to 5.  There were no patterns I could discern except for a couple groups seemingly forming a perfect triangle.  There were about a couple dozen total over the course of 3 or 4 minutes.  We managed to get videos on cell phone cameras, but they are what you would expect from filming with such a device against a dark sky. We were amazed and baffled to the point that we called 911.  While we admitted to the officer who came out that we felt a little silly calling and that we had been drinking all night, we felt a burning need to let authorities know what we had seen. I checked wind direction for that time frame, and it was blowing South at 5 mph which pretty much discounts the possibility of chinese lanterns or flares.  I have absolutely no clue what these things could have been, and I feel very fortunate that I had friends with me to witness this.  We are all in our 30s and have careers in retail, insurance and teaching.  I am sharing this experience in the hopes that someone else saw these and can possibly explain what they were.  The random formations discount (to me) the possiblility of military aircraft, the wind direction rules out lanterns or flares, it was a clear night so they weren't reflections, and no trails tell me they weren't meteors.   Absolutely unexplainable, and the quantity made it somewhat of a scary experience.   For a brief time I wasn't sure if they would stop coming.

I could make out three lights in what i would say were in a formation with the center light blinking rapidly.   It was obvious to me that these lights did not originate from any aircraft known to me i automatically called 911 and was told there were other confirmed reports of these lights as well as my own report.   It has been a month now and i have experienced lapses in time between the hours of 3 am onward and after a few strange dreams i woke up with a numbness in my right hand.  This IS NOT an attempt to hoax.

University Place is just south of Tacoma, WA. It was 10 PM and dark. The lights in the park had just shut off, so I do know it was just about dead on 10PM. There was no detectible wind at all.  I was looking directly south, (I know this because the road entrance goes directly North-South.)  I just verified this on a map so that I would be absolutely sure. An object was heading due south running parallel to this entrance road.  I immediately knew this was no aircraft.  It had none of the required FAA lighting on the craft.   I am an amateur astronomer and an aircraft enthusiast since I was young. I can tell you what a B-25, B17, Lancaster, 707, F-22 Raptor, etc. all look like.   The first thing I noticed is that it was spherical in nature and had these flames surrounding it.  I immediately thought, ""bolide.""  No.   As it was at my highest Zenith point to me, approximately 80 degrees over the western horizon it had no tail or flames at all trailing behind it.  The flames were a dark reddish hue, hugging the craft on the sides and seemed to have an electric/plasma effect to it that made them appear to adhere to the craft in vertical, striped patterns.   The way that I can further explain this effect, is this: In an old TV set, there is a yoke on the back of the picture tube directing a scanning electron beam to the front.  This is what the vertical electrical/plasma pattern was appearing to me to give off this unusual visual effect.  It was to me an electromagnetically controlled plasma. This above explained reddish pattern would be replaced by a more yellowish underlying glow that would switch back in forth, pulsing every 3-5 seconds.  I just timed this in my video. Now I will try to describe the size, speed, and trajectory as best that I can.  I was the first to see this between the three of us.  I was looking north.  I would say it was approximately 60 degrees above the Northern horizon, and ever so slight West by approximately 2-5 degrees.   When I first saw it, I would say it was the size of a pea at arms length.  But when it came at our Zenith my 13 yr old son said it would about the size of a penny at arms length.   I could not see this because I was busily trying to keep this centered & steady on my camera from this point forward.   Speed was steady the whole time, never wavering at all and was completely silent.  The height is almost impossible to determine in the dark!   But the one thing that I would say, is it appeared not to be more that 20-30 feet in diameter.   The trajectory is the easy one.  It flew directly in front us in an exact North South direction following parallel to that entrance road.  Speed is a little tougher, but it did appear a consistent speed that maybe a private 2 engine Lycoming engine based aircraft would be doing while it was in cruise. The entire sighting I would estimate to be 3-5 minutes in length in which it traversed 150 degrees of the sky.  We saw it until it completely disappeared into the southern horizon.   When I was a young boy I saw 2 bolides in the sky flying in parallel, one slightly ahead of the other with 2 long flaming trails.  This was even more fascinating!  My conclusion in all of this is that it was constructed and controlled.  I need not speculate any further.",2011-07-06T00:00:00,47.2012,-122.5419

At 22:01 three neighbors from down the street had been watching fireworks (southwest) and approached, one woman asking my father (due to his knowledge of aircraft) ""What kind of planes are those?""  He told her he was uncertain. The six orange lights flew in two wide triangular formations that stretched and contracted, narrowing as they passed over us.  The lights were solid, exhibiting no blinking or pulsing.  The lights made no sound, and my father remarked that ""you can't hear the rotors.""  The lights paused at times, ascended and descended. He asked me to photograph them with my Droid.  I attempted to first record video and second snap pictures.  I got two of them, but only caught one light in the picture.

I live in Humboldt County, and I never thought I’d see a UFO.    My father stepped outside to smoke a cigarette, and then he called me outside.  It was nine forty at night (21:40).  I was standing in my front yard looking north towards 27th and Alliance Street in Arcata.   At first, I didn’t know what I was looking at.  There was this object, and it had bright green lights.  Then it turned, and I saw a red light.   I thought it was a plane or a Coast Guard helicopter.  This is a coastal city, and I have occasionally seen Coast Guard helicopters fly by.  However, this object was different.   It couldn’t have been more than 1,000 feet away, but it made absolutely no noise.   My father and I stood completely silent and we could not hear a single engine noise.  Another indication that this was no helicopter or plane was how it moved. The object moved up and down, left and right, and it even did a spiral traveling upwards.  The object moved like a fish swims.  All of the turns were very fluid and graceful, and it would stop and move up or down in a single second.   Also, it never left a certain area of the sky.  It would dip up and down, and move left and right, but it always stayed in an area between two trees and sometimes going right behind the tree and coming back out after a couple seconds (from my point of view).    Another odd thing about the object was the lights.  I have never seen a plane or a helicopter use green or red lights.  Also, these lights were very bright.   Even though it was a about a 1,000 feet away, I could still make out the rough shape of a square.  And there were two distinct shapes of green light and an orb of red light in between them.  The lights were much brighter than any stars, and as bright as the Moon.  Also I knew the elevation couldn’t have been very high. It was a cloudy night.  That is another reason why this thing was so noticeable.  The clouds covered the stars, and the Moon.  There was no wind so the cloud did not move at all.  I don’t know how low the clouds were that night, but the object had to be a few hundred feet above the ground.    The object also came very close to the ground.  It dipped so low near a field that I thought it had landed.  However, I climbed on my fence and I saw it was hovering maybe a few tens of feet above the ground.  Then immediately it rose up a little bit. After watching the flying object for thirty minutes, I went inside to find a telescope and a camera, while my father kept watching outside.  My camera batteries were dead, but I did find a small telescope.  I set the stand up on my car, so I could have a steady base.  The difficulty was finding it.  The object was still moving around in the same area, so I knew where to look.  I centered the telescope on it then I looked in the eyepiece to locate it.  After a couple minutes, I found it, and tried to focus the best I could. I got a nice quick frontal and side view of the object.  Front view:  the two green lights on the sides were actually four.  The green lights were arranged in a square or rectangle pattern and the four green spheres were at the corners.  A single red sphere or oval was in the center.  What was odd what that the red center looked like it had eyes.  There were two yellow lights in the red center that looked like eyes to me.  That was something completely new. Side view:  the object turned and I got a good view of its side.  I saw the two green spheres on the side and they appeared as a line with the sphere at the ends of the line.  The red center had what appeared to be some kind of tail behind it.  It did not look like legs to me.  The best comparison that I can think of is the vehicles of Tron and how they are made of light. After I got a good look of the object, I decided to get my brother to show him.  He saw it as well and tried to look through the telescope.  Then I woke my mother up.  She was a little groggy and didn’t believe what I told her, and then she saw it.  Even though she was confused she went back to bed because she was very tired.   I came inside and drew what I saw to the best of my limited artistic abilities.  At that point it was ten forty (22:40).  When I went back outside, amazingly the object was still there. My father was still watching the flying object, but was tired so he went to bed because he couldn’t do anything more than watch (for an hour).  My brother followed shortly (he had only been watching for fifteen minutes).   I shortly came inside.  An hour later before I went to bed, I checked and the object was still flying in the same area as before.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,40.853795454545455,-124.05069393939394

My wife and I were walking around the eastern end of the marina at the Lighthouse Landing Marina and Resort in Grand Rivers, KY, at approximately 10:00 PM on Friday, July 8th, when we observed an object in the sky moving from East to West-Southwest.  It seemed to be above the canal that connects the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers about ½ miles south of Grand Rivers.   We first thought it was a hot air balloon when it appeared over the tree-line in the distance because it seemed to glow as if lit by a flame.  But it seemed too round and move too fast to be a hot air balloon.  After about 5 to 10 minutes, it disappeared over the tree-line on the western bank of Kentucky Lake. We found it peculiar, but did not think too much of it.   The following night, Saturday, July 9th, at approximately 10:15 PM, we saw what appeared to be the same type of object again.  This time it was travelling from East-Southeast to West-Northwest and appeared to be almost directly over the chalets and campground on the southern side of the marina resort about 100 yards away.  We had a very good look at it this time.   I cannot be sure of its size because I am unsure of its altitude.  If I were to assume it was at the same altitude as small aircraft I am accustom to seeing in the area, I would estimate it would be about 20 to 30 feet in diameter.  Of course, if it was lower it would be much smaller and it would be larger if it was higher.   It also travelled at the same speed I would expect a small aircraft to travel.   It appeared to be dark orange and seemed to ""flicker"" from the lower front and underneath along the sides as if lit by a large, lazy red-ish flame, but I could not actually see flames.  There were no other lights visible on the object such as navigational or search/landing lights on an airplane or helicopter.   The object did not glow, radiate light or a beam of light. The night was clear and the sky filled with stars. This was not a light emitted from a river barge or other craft on the river.   Although it was relative! ly quiet in the area, we could not detect any discernable noise from the object.  The hot air balloon comparison most accurately describes the color and appearance.  However,  I want to stress that I do not believe it was a normal hot air balloon, as it was close enough, I should have seen a basket, it was the wrong shape, the flickering ""flame"" that wasn’t a flame came from the front and not underneath and it was moving way too fast.  We watched the object for about 15 minutes as it disappeared over the tree-line to the west of the Kentucky Dam.  There were several people in and around the marina parking lot that night that and someone else should have noticed.  However, we did not discuss what we saw with anyone and returned to the chalet we rented for the weekend.  The following morning we asked as we were checking out if anyone else had reported seeing the strange object.  The ladies behind the desk were very excited at our report, but said no one had mentioned seeing anything like that.   If anyone knows of some kind of secret high-speed hot air balloon in Kentucky, please let me know.  This will haunt my memory until I have a logical explanation of what we saw.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,37.0803,-88.2728

The time of the event was approximately 2100 hours on Friday October 21 2011.  The writer of this report has 2 BS and 2 MS degrees and a military background.  The writer is also 40 years old and has never saw or reported a UFO event in the past.  This is my first real experience.  I do have a background in science so I do believe that there is other life in our vast universe but until this event I had never really given real credence to intelligent life being here on earth. The evening in Monterey, CA was very nice at around 60 degrees and very clear.  We were celebrating the birthday party of my 12 year old daughter and decided to take all the helium filled balloons outside and release them for good luck.  The whole party included 3 adults, including myself, and 12 children with the average age being 12.  We were all looking up and watching the balloons go up when I noticed the object streaking across the sky.  I pointed at it and said out loud “does everyone see that thing.”  We all did except for one of the little girls.  We followed it until it was gone and then we all were sort of dumbfounded as to what it was.  On any other evening we would not even have been looking up but because we were watching the balloons we just happened to be looking up at the night sky. The two other adults, one of which is my wife, were really sort of at a loss as to what to tell the children other than we did not know for sure what it was.  There were also some shooting stars and an actual airplane so we were able to judge that it was not anything conventional that we were aware of.  It was moving from north to south and because we are on the coast I believe that it was using the coast line to navigate in a southerly direction.  The speed was very vast coming in from north and only staying in view for approximately 15 seconds at an angle of about 120 degrees, almost horizon to horizon. The object looked industrial or what I would say on earth as manufactured and not like a rock or some other type of object.  It had sort of an airplane shape but the wings were in the reverse chevron direction.  It had no sort of tail wins but there was a nose with a bit of a cone shape.  It was moving very fast with no sound at all.  There were no lights on the object so it was not a plane.  It sort of looked clear as if you could see through it but I believe that we were seeing the reflection of the city lights on the bottom of the craft.  At the same time there was a human airplane flying higher than the observed craft flying perpendicular to the UFO.  There were also several shooting stars so we were able to determine that it was not any of these things.  And because we had released the balloons for the party we could see depth to the space between us the balloons and the real airplane and the unidentified craft was sort of in the middle space flying across.  The speed ! was nothing I had ever seen in all my time in the military or observing other aircraft including military aircraft.  And it was also in an absolute straight line trajectory.  It was not threatening or anything like that but rather peaceful in its movement.  This experience has changed all that I believe about what is among us. I can not rule out the fact that this could have been some type of experimental aircraft.  I do live in an area that is in close enough proximity to military bases that work and do research on military operations that it is conceivable that it could have been an experiment.  That being said it is still out of my realm of understanding of physics and science to totally let this one go as the speed and lack of sound of the object did not fit into the conventional paradigm of conventional thinking on my part.  There was no streaking or any type of contrail and there were other examples in the background to go off of.  I have also observed satellites in the sky and this was larger than that and also moved faster.  It also did not seem to have any noticeable propulsion system as it trailed off.  We did not see any fire or thrust. This was definitely not anything that I have ever observed before.

We suspect that he is an exceptionally good witness.  PD))",2011-10-25T00:00:00,36.38391818181818,-121.84402222222222

I looked up and saw what looked to be 3 points of light forming a perfect triangle in the sky about 50 degrees up from the horizon. The object was moving very fast, I yelled to the other two people by me to look and they also locked into it right away. As I first saw the object I stayed locked onto it and never took my eyes off it. Out of my peripheral vision I noticed a 2nd object dip down in the sky and then back up, it then followed the triangle formation on the exact line of flight in the sky. The 2nd object was only one light and about the same brightness as the triangle formation. It trailed the triangle by about 2 hand widths if you held your had out at arms length.  The triangle consisted of a point of light in the front and flanked on each side by one light. The brightness of these objects was pretty much equal to your average star in the sky. I have witnessed and track satellites with computer software and have also seen the Navys NOSS Satellites pass over before and this was not that. Size of the triangle was equal in width to a penny held out at arms length. I know how fast satellites travel when the pass over and this was these objects were traveling 3 to 4 times that fast if not even faster. They covered about 35 percent of the sky in roughly 5 seconds or less. The sky was clear except for a one small cloud. The objects passed above this cloud and then faded out and we lost visual on them. Also as the triangle formation went across the sky in between the 3 points of light there was kind of a shimmer of very dull light for a brief second. No shape could be observed and as the object traveled through the sky it didn't pass in front ! of bright stars so I can't say if it would visually blocked out the star or if it would seemed transparent. That remains unknown. There was absolutely no sound from either objects even after they had passed from sight. We live in a small town out in the desert and its dead silent out here if was a jet of some sort we would have heard it. We also live in close proximity to the Barry Goldwater Bombing Range so we see our share of military jets pass over but they do not fly as fast as these objects where traveling. I have no idea if this something traveling in our atmosphere or if it was in space. Normal orbit speed in space is roughly 17,500mph and as I said this was 3 to 4 times as fast as that. If it was something in the atmosphere I would have to estimate the speed in excess of 2000mph, there was no sonic boom either.  I consider myself a amateur astronomer and I am also heavy into civilian and military  aviation photography. This was nothing like I have seen before. If I had to guess I would say it was some sort of military object that isn't known about yet? All 3 of us where at a loss for words as to what this could have been. I would really like to know if anyone else beside us saw this that night? All 3 of us were glued to the sky for another 1/2hr as we were amazed by this.

Triangular UFO. My friend and I were passing through Waldenburg, Arkansas on our way to Little Rock. It was somewhere between 1:40 and 2am. Just a few hours ago. For the record: it is October 22nd, 2011. We were headed down AR-14 going toward US-67. It wasn’t long, after hitting Waldenburg, we saw it. We’d pass the closed liquor store and over the railroad tracks. We were just riding and talking with the cd player on low. If you’ve rode down AR-14 at night you notice the red lights on the towers. I’d noticed those because I was watching the road pretty closely to avoid deer and other animals that like to jump out in front of vehicles. We were passing one of the towers, when out of nowhere, just above us,  appeared this huge, dark, black, triangular shape, with three, eerie, and distinct red lights on each corner. I hit the breaks because it freaked me out. I yelled for my friend to look. We both leaned forward and looked up into the sky while still slowly driving at about 3! 0mph in amazement. As it passed over us, or rather we passed under it, I begged her to look out the back window and see if it was still there. I turned the music completely off to see if I could hear any engines. It was completely silent. It seemed to me that the craft was hovering, directly above us. It wasn’t much higher than the tops of the trees.  The lights flashed on and off but not in a specifically timed manner. For lack of better words they sort of dimmed up and down. Never completely off. Whatever was above us was a solid object because within the triangle the stars weren’t showing and all around the object the stars were visible. My first thought was, “Oh my god this is a UFO!!”. My second, was to stop and try to take a picture, but my friend was freaking out as much as I was. She talked me into staying in the car rolling up the windows, locking the doors, and flooring it until we hit the interstate. I didn’t know what to do. I thought about calling the police bu! t they’d think we were insane. We picked up our friend just ou! tside Li ttle Rock and headed back the same way we’d come. It was a few hours later, and feeling braver, we’d tried to figure out logical explanations. The object was gone by then. Whatever it was must’ve descended straight down because we hadn’t noticed it driving toward it. I don’t know of any craft that silent. At least not one that’s also able to descend straight downward so quickly. We tried recreating our first pass by but to no avail. I have no idea what I’d seen. We both agreed on what we saw. Even what it looked like. All I know is after seeing it I must’ve been driving 80-100mph the rest the way toward Little Rock. I was honestly disturbed. I would like to know if anyone else had seen it. I'm making an anonymous email address. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I could not believe what I was seeing so I ran onto my deck and up the stairs where there is a landing that gives me an unobstructed view of the northern sky, north of my residence.  Sure enough, the lights were still there and were moving slowly in a northern direction at a slow speed.  I hurried back down the stairs and into the back door of my residence and called to my wife, son and daughter to come outside and look at what I was seeing.  We all went back up the stairs to my previous location, looking north and sure enough, the lights were still there, continuing to move north however, during the time of our observations, another light emerged just over the horizon and seemed to be following the previous three.  There were five more obj! ects that followed and all four of us stood there in amazement because there was no sound to be heard, there was no pattern to their flight together at all and over the next few minutes, all of the lights faded away. My wife captured a short video of the objects on her HD cellphone video camera, however upon review, it was nearly too difficult to see the objects given that the ambiance of the city street lights quashed anything that could clearly define our observations. For argument sake however, I asked her to keep the video for reference if questions were ever raised about the four of us seeing all of the same occurance. We came into the computer room and went online and observed that these objects had already been reported by someone in Martette, MI, but they observed 15 of the objects. Sometimes I have to be a skeptic because we do live close to the Selfridge ANG base in Mt. Clemens, MI, however on the Canadian side, and the orange lights would be indicative of jet engines in after-burn taking off, however, Selfridge ANG, 127th Wing only has the A-10 on location at this base and they are a subsonic aircraft; their engines have no afterburners, so the typical orange glow could not have appeared behind those aircraft, even if there was a full squadron taking off, but yet, there was no sound to the movement of these objects. That was a very cool experience for my entire family and myself simply because we are hoping there is intelligent life in outer space and in some cases more intelligent than any of the life on this planet. Cheers!!  Thanks for the show!! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and credible.

There was a yellow light on top a green light on bottom and one red light that blinked every 3 to 4 seconds starting from the bottom to the top.  I was unable to see shapes of the craft are a number of lights it was just too far away.  I did however notice a pattern in its movement. It moved on a Y axis or straight line.  On this straight line it moved in a zigzagging manner.  Picture a line with a lightning bolt over laid on the line.  The bolt is the direc! tion of travel it moved in.

The object set roughly ten foot from the top we where about 120 yards away from the pine trees.  The pines in question stand approximately 45 to 55 feet a piece.  The object was on the right side of the moon in a south eastern direction towards the Roddy, and Dubois (pronounced do-boys) area of the North Dodge county region of Middle Georgia below Cochran.  At the time I counted 4 aircraft in the sky around the area and the aircraft came in clearly than the object but at the same level as the object on a hor! izontal grid.  The odd part was during the air traffic the obje! ct stopp ed moving it was not until the aircraft moved a certain distance away that it started back to moving in its pattern. It is currently 12:17 and the object is still there in the same spot dancing happily in the Eastern sky above Georgia. If I may make a hypothesis this could be nothing more than a star or group of gases, but for a moment I would like to think that not all UFO’s or Alien life forms are like ourselves maybe an asteroids contains a life form or maybe certain stars are alive that we have yet to examine. Space could be the Ocean inversed without life forms but with large coral formations holding single cell organisms and hiding secrets.",2011-12-17T00:00:00,32.4333,-83.341

With the lights on facing the north I looked to the west and thought I seen a satellite I pointed out and realized it was not a satellite because the shine of the sun would reflect upon from the west as I would see the shade side.  It seemed to look as if there were airplane lights on it but one red flash then the rear flashed after repetitively around once each per second we also seen three lights, the direction of the un identified object looked as if the lights were not on wings, there was also 2 white lights parallel to each other and another in front near red flashing light, we knew it was not an airplane because the lights in the rear and the direction of the plane would be going in opposite direction at the same time it also was changing directions just as the un identified object left sight we looked to the west again and seen a second object coming from the same direction possibly a little farther south, this object flew in almost a straight line but yet to be going faster than a satellite, it also had the same type of lighting not 1 minute later a third had come the same path as the first, as it turned north at what seemed the same co ordinates facing now south east we seen the first a little higher up but farther away as the third followed continuing north east, the second object had faded into the sky so that you couldn’t see the lights just the red flash per second.  These objects were all going the same speed as each other, yet to still be faster and lower flying than a satellite. Seemed the two were going towards Hudson bay after they turned and coming from Regina going to northern Quebec.

At this point in time it was still light out.  One member of the party noticed a strange lit up object moving across the sky from a Southwest direction.  As the object passed overhead the party discussed whether or not it was a familiar aircraft.  No wings could be seen and the craft had a constant, strong light in which we noticed slight flickering as it passed overhead in a beeline headed North. Initially this was dismissed, however less than a minute later a formation of 12-15 circular craft appeared above the horizon where the first craft was seen.  The craft were ""stacked"" in a vertical formation in two columns so as to appear in a zig-zag.  As one party member ran to fetch binoculars the other two witnesses watched the objects go overhead, following the first craft.  Some of the objects had lights and others did not.  When viewed through binoculars, the objects appeared to change shape slightly from what one observer referred to as a ""smart-car"" (in profile) shape to a sphere.  About a minute after this event, a final craft appeared and headed in a Northwest direction as if anticipating where the previous craft were headed. All the craft were silent and moving quickly across the field of view.  The first craft appeared smaller (as if it had the greater altitude) and the rest were about 1/3 to 1/4 the size (in height) of a visible sliver moon.  After the stars came out it was plain to see they (the craft) were significantly larger than any stars or planets visible.  One observer noted that they must be quite large if we could see them so distinctly from our distance.  It was hard to determine color as they appeared dark against the light sky.  Also unusual was that no one could recall seeing them appear or disappear, just that they were suddenly there and just as suddenly gone.

After about a minute, the light stopped, as if it noticed we were watching it, and it began to disappear into the night sky away from us.   None of us had our phones, and we cant explain what we saw.   It wasn't a firework because it moved steadily and on a straight path.  And it couldn't have been an airplane or satellite because it stopped, then within about 5-6 seconds, it disappeared moving away from us.   All we could do is say, ""That was a UFO..."" and drove home down the road. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))",2011-07-06T00:00:00,,

This happened on the evening of July 4, 2011, around 10 pm (time is approximate.  I did not check the exact time when the sightings occurred).  All three sightings occurred when there were fireworks going off in the sky, and later when the fireworks ceased, we had no more sightings. The first sighting happened at approximately 10 pm (plus or minus 15 minutes).  My son and his friends noticed a red/pinkish light in the distance to the southwest.  It grew larger as it got closer and then they said the light just went out.  That’s when I looked over to see what they were talking about.   At that time, I could see the object, but it was pitch black.  There were no lights on it at all, which ruled out commercial aircraft immediately.  Also, the shape of it was irregular.   From my angle, it looked to be somewhat triangle shaped, with the nose slightly rounded, but the “tail” was not straight as a triangle would be.  The tail was rounded, or bulged out.  It was almost heart-shaped, with the point being the nose.  If flew due north at this point and my wife then saw it as well.   After the red/pink light(s) when out, there were no more lights that appeared on it.  It flew into the distance and we lost sight of it.   The entire sighting lasted maybe a minute. The second sighting happened about 5 minutes later, around 10:05 pm.  This time I saw the red/pinkish light in the southwest.  It immediately got my attention since it was not blinking at all.  We watched as it came closer (heading approximately northwest) and before it got over our location, it turned east.   At that point the light began to diminish/fade out.  I watched it as the light faded out and at that point it was behind a tree in the neighbor’s yard so I could not get a good view of it.   I went to the other side of the tree to watch it as it headed east (I assumed it would be the black mass like I saw before) and I did not see it emerge from behind the tree.  I searched the sky but could not find it.  Again, the entire sighting lasted maybe a minute or more. The third sighting happened about 10 minutes later and this time it was again the red/pink light in the southwest.  I wanted to get a good look at this one and take a video with my phone.  I turned to tell me son that another one was heading our way, and as I turned back to look at it, it was gone. Being the 4th of July, it’s very easy for people to dismiss this as fireworks, but I can assure you that this was definitely NOT fireworks.  The black mass that flew north (the first sighting) moved about the same speed as the commercial jets that cross the sky in my area (there is an airport near, and we did see other aircraft that night).  But I have never seen an aircraft that just had one red/pink light (instead of the red/green that is required), that did NOT blink at all (commercial craft lights blink).   Also, the light faded out; it didn’t turn off as in a switch.  It was gradual.  Plus the shape of the craft was NOT anything that I’ve ever seen.  Even if some would say that it was a commercial craft that had it’s lights off for some reason, the shape of the craft was not like any aircraft I have ever seen. There may have been one or two more sightings by my son and his friends before the initial sighting in this report, but it wasn’t until I saw the craft as described above that turned completely black that I started documenting the sightings.",2011-07-06T00:00:00,39.17450311744155,-84.48136299381886

When I pointed them out, my friend said there was no way for a cop car to get there and no reason at this hour.

We, soon after, saw that the object wasn’t on the hill but hovering slightly above it.  We stayed to watch it and it began to move northwest.

Where we had originally spotted it, there seemed to be a disturbance in the air.  It was like a billowing cloud of smoke but it was translucent and had a shimmering effect to it.  When the UFO got far enough away, we could see at least one other object farther out to the north-east that appeared to be ascending and scanning the ground as well.

These lights seemed to hover above the hill and were obviously very active, moving about the hill quickly and erratically scanning in miniature like the UFO had been.  They stopped, sometimes, reconvening and resting. We did not see the figures except faintly in the light of the UFO scans.  They were brown looking in the dark and very, very tall.  The first glimpse my girlfriend caught of one it seemed to be doing flips, like a slinky would.  The figures were lanky, bony looking and gangling.

Moon was out and approximately half full, waxing. 3 orange colored lights appeared low in the sky in a semi triangle pattern.  The objects appeared to be moving at a comparable rate to small aircraft, roughly 60-100 knots.  A fourth object of the same color and size appeared behind the first 3.  Initially these objects were thought to be small aircraft, but their proximity to each other seemed too close, and like nothing any of the witnesses had ever seen before.   The orange light was constant and no flashing beacon lights or strobes, as would be seen on an aircraft were observed. Approximately 20 seconds after the first objects appeared, the initial 3 turned southwest and rapidly moved out of sight.  The fourth object made a turn in the same direction, southwest, and was observed for another 20 seconds, until the object was completely out of sight. Witnesses are avid outdoors people and spend a considerable amount of time observing night skies.  None of the witnesses had observed such lights in the past.  One witness is a lifelong aviation buff, and former air traffic controller. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2011-07-17T00:00:00,,

A wave of relaxation sprung through my limbs and into my fingers. I could even fell the sting in my finger nails. It felt like when you fall asleep and accidently block the passage of blood to your arm, and a million ants start to crawl up the muscles, chewing away. As this happened, it was as if (and this part will sound most strange) me and this formation of people, suddenly felt the same thing. But not merely felt the relaxation, but felt instead  each other. As if there was a third arm infront of me, I would try to move it, but could not. Another bang interupted the flow and the most beautiful thing I've ever seen appeared infront of me. I could not begin to explain it. I can hardly even remember the shape of it, as if my brain is unable to fathom it's form. I feel strange even typing this. There were five of these things, and they flew perhaps a 1000 feet above us , watching. Seconds later, they were gone.  We just looked at each other, as if in denial, looked at each other with this look that I'll never forget, as if we were discusted with the other persons behaviour.

While heading east toward our home, I, my husband, & our three year old daughter, saw what appeared to be large pinkish lights in the sky.  At first, I saw three & thought it looked like what would be seen at the top of three towers, because they were stationary.  But, living here, I knew there were no towers in that direction.  Plus, the color was wrong & the lights were too large to be on a tower.  Then, as I asked my husband what the lights were doing just hanging in the sky, he said one of them was moving.  Sure enough, one was beginning to move toward the northerly direction.  Then, we saw more coming from the south, moving slowly.  At that point, I turned onto our street, heading south.  My daughter, very into looking at the moon & stars whenever we are out at night, asked, “What is that daddy?”   My husband told her he didn’t k! now.  Coming down our street, we saw three or four more coming from behind the tree line down our street.  One at a time, they came in a northwesterly direction & we pulled off of the street into someone’s front yard so my husband could get out & watch them as they went behind us.  Other cars were driving by in both directions.  We’re not sure if they saw them too, but no one else stopped. I could have probably blown it off, but my husband has a military background, specifically Air Force, and he was unable to tell me what he thought they could be.  I knew they weren’t fireworks, or airplanes.  I’ve never seen anything with pink lights hovering or flying in the sky, especially lights that large.  They made no noise that we could hear, like if you heard a helicopter or airplane fly over.  They did not act like Chinese lanterns, which could be sent out into the sky, for traditional celebrations.  I talked my husband into getting back in the car, so we could drive another half a mile to our house.  We all got out, but didn’t see anything else.  Apparently, they had all passed over by the time my husband got back in the car to come home. I checked the website for the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration to see what the surface winds were, according to the Lynchburg Regional Airport, & it said calm.  We didn’t feel any winds when we all exited the car in our driveway either.  Once home, I asked my daughter what she had seen.  “Pink lights”, she said.  I asked her what they had been doing & she replied, “Floating in the sky.”",2011-10-25T00:00:00,37.4702,-79.0652

Just prior to turning onto our street, while heading east, we saw up in the night sky, a large number of bright pinkish glow lights, possibly with a pale light blue haze behind the pink glow.  Compared to what stars sizes appear to be, these looked ten times bigger.   Once on our street, we were headed south & continued to observe them.  It was something that neither of us had seen before.  We pulled off of the road to the right to better observe them.  I got out of the car & was looking at them, which would have been in the northwest sky.  At first, it looked as though they were stationary in the sky, but after a few moments, some appeared to be moving, but others weren’t.    I think the count was between seven and nine total from when we first saw them.  Each light I observed was separate from the others.  The distances b! etween them were different too.  They all appeared to be the same size, so I assume they were all the same distance from us. !  I’m not really able to know for sure, but they appeared to be at a 3000 foot elevation, maybe closer.  The sky was completely clear & calm.  You could see the stars, no fog, no clouds, nothing.  No winds prevailing either.  I’m not confused over what I saw.   As I got back into the car, the lights seemed to leave our area of the sky that we’d been observing them in.  That’s when we lost track of them & we came on home. Because of the six years I’d been in the military (Air Force), specializing in radar & weapons, I had dealt with a lot of anomalies & false blips on our radar screen.  One of my assignments was with the Air Defense Command that later became the Aerospace Defense Command.   I’ve seen night flares, helicopters, airplanes, gunships, fireworks, hot air balloons, landing lights on aircraft, all in night skies, but these are totally different from what we saw last night & different from anything I’ve ever seen before.",2011-10-25T00:00:00,37.4702,-79.0652

There was one object in the lead, followed by 3 other objects in a triangular formation.  All objects moved very slowly across my field of view to the left.   After being in shock of what I was seeing and pulling the car over, I tried for about a minute to snap photos on my cell phone but I was not able to get the objects into focus.  I put down my cell phone to watch the objects disappear into a slight faint pinpoint type glow.  Objects appeared to be at several thousand feet, I figure possibly someone could have launched some type of flare or firework and maybe this is what I saw burnout, however while I was watching these objects I didnt see parachute or anything that would have suspended them in the air.  And the objects didnt appear to be burning, just glowing orange.   The weather appeared as a hazy like overcast, aviation weather reports an Overcast to Broken cloud layer at 10,000 feet and 10 SM visibility, I believe the overcast clouds and haze had an effect on how I viewed the objects.

The fireworks ended about 9:50 PM (and were a long way away and not visible at all where we were due to the height of the houses and the distance to the fireworks (2 to 3 miles).   At 10:25 PM, I was in the pool with my girlfriend and I was looking up at the sky saying how great it is in California to see meteorite showers and other such things in the night sky because the sky is always clear in the summer in California (as opposed to Illinois where I lived all my life (58 years) until this past October).  Just after I stated how clear it was and almost ""on cue"", four round, glowing objects came into my line of sight out of the southwest, heading northeast.  They seemed fairly small, and flying fairly low; similar to the altitude of a single engine plane flying low.  They almost looked like four searchlights shining on a thin cloud, but the stars were out, and there was not a cloud in the sky.  They were fairly dim, but brighter in the center, and rimmed with a soft glow around each.  They were in a ""v"" formation, but there were three on the right, with one on the left. I am aware of the ""v"" shaped sightings that seem to be the underbelly lights of a larger craft.  These did not seem to be that since there was only one light on one side, and they were not flying slow.   They continued at a steady rate, much faster than any prop or jet plane would fly, and in a straight line. I watched for about 8 to 10 seconds from when they appeared in my line of sight until they went out of sight. I am not sure at this point, because they were not really visible, but they may have dispersed from the formation, because as I was watching the point where they went out of sight I caught a glimpse of a streak off to the northwest of where they disappeared that flashed for just a second. After seeing them for 2 - 3 seconds and realizing they were somethin! g special, I pointed to them right in front of my girlfriend's! face and emphatically said, ""Look! Look!"", and she was able to see them for about 5 seconds or so. She has always been a scoffer and has made fun of me watching Ancient Astronauts and other UFO related shows on TV.   She was a little shocked, a little scared, and would love to tell someone what she saw.  I think the incident changed her mind.  I hope we were not the only ones to observe this.

I then saw an almost steady bright orange-amber ball in the sky, like a fireball.   I first suspected a still incandescent remnant of a firework of some type.  It was not falling in a parabolic manner though, but was traveling linearly instead.  I was hearing sparse firecracking so I naturally suspected firework.  It then appeared much higher than expected for a firework and seemed to last unusually long.  I dismissed the possibility of a plane as no blinking lights were seen.  The ball was steadily traveling linearly, like a meteor, but a little slower.  It was like traveling across the sky from a north-east to full west direction and seemed to pick up speed.  Only as I saw it approaching a cloud that I realized the cloud looked to be beneath it?!?  The light was covered by the cloud.  I could still see a orange light through it.  It seemed at this point to follow a slow rotation, the light started fading a little.   The weather was not hazy and only a few trails of clouds were scattered in the sky.  Could it have been a (new type) of fireworks?  The fact it passed over the cloud made me doubt.   I then had the surely exaggerated thought of a plane possibly on fire. It continued its course until it went full west then behind a building.   As I took my car i then saw it (or maybe rather another one) again up in the sky in the west direction in the horizon.  It was glowing amber, seemed to stand still and slowing faded as it slowly moved further in the horizon.    Firecracking and fireworks rare noises were much closer to me than was this light which seemed to be much further away.  I suspected a new type of fireworks but having seen recently meteor, (not a meteorite nor shooting star), crossing the entire sky near this place this spring, it looked more like this.

As it got closer the shape remained the same but the light it emitted was flickering as if it was made of fire.  For a while it looked like it was floating but it slowly made its way from North to South.   When it was almost directly over our car the light began to get dim and it went out.  When the light was out I could still barely make out the shape of the craft and it seemed to be grey in color.  It then veered quickly East and seemed to disappear.

Disappeared in about 1 minute My wife and some friends were standing in an open lot behind a plywood factory watching the 4th of July celebration.   During the event we noticed three small, bright lights appeared northeast of our position.  The three lights appeared to be several miles away judging by the distortions or twinkle of the lights and appeared to be orange to almost red in color.  Initially, I believed them to be some sort of aircraft in a line formation as the judged altitude was about 3000-4000 ft with motion and speed consistent with an aircraft. As I watched, I realized the lighting was inconsistent with any aircraft beacons or navigational lighting.  The light emitted was a constant reddish-orange. The objects appeared to be traveling in a southwest direction towards us.  As they neared, all three objects gradually faded, sequentially disappeared one after the other.   Nothing unusual was further seen afterwords.   Weather conditions at the time were very clear with a slight breeze from the southwest. I am convinced this was something very out of the ordinary as I have very extensive knowledge of aircraft patterns in the area and am very familiar with civilian and military aircraft types.   I do not believe it was any kind of firework either as the position of these lights observed were 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon and did not have a trajectory consistent with any kind of firework.  Even a flare suspended by a parachute could not have done this as the wind was blowing opposite the direction of travel.

Beginning at 8:05pm, my girlfriend was out on our balcony smoking a cigarette when she called me outside.  There was an object in the sky that was moving at a steady, casual pace towards the West, but as we were watching it, began heading south.  My girlfriend informed me that she had been watching it for a minute already and saw it fly past the moon, which is to our Southeast this evening.  Watching the object, we could tell it was not an airplane because it was SO high in the sky, there was no contrail, and the object appeared to ""float by"" instead of being ""propelled forwards.""  Plus, for it to interfere with the view of the moon this evening, it would have to be flying very high and far away because the moon is at ~65 degree angle from us.  From our balcony, we see every flight that leaves Memphis International Airport, and THIS was not an airplane.  It was silvery in color and shaped like a long string, more cylindrical than cigar-shaped, but very narrow compared to its length.  It also appeared to ""grow a glow,"" but then it subsided.  It soon flew out of distance. So, we stood here in awe (we are still on the balcony now) and before we knew it a plane was flying West and here comes another one of these objects almost brushing the airplane!   We knew the passengers of the flight HAD to see this happen and we watched that object fly toward the East at about the same rate as the first one we saw, except this one was clearly lower and more cigar-shaped and looked to maybe have a light on each tip, but we are not really sure.  Each end was brighter than the silvery object itself. Before that one could leave our view, ANOTHER one flew from the East heading West and was flying against the other one.  They passed each other at about the same distance as the airplane and the second object.  So, that's three.  We watched them until they flew so far, we couldn't see them anymore. Then another one came and was flying Northeast at what appeared to be a slow, steady pace.  It seemed very casual, like it was in no hurry.  This one also looked cigar-shaped, same as the third one.  Same color, approximate altitude, etc. During all of this, we called a friend who owns a shop down the street who we asked to look outside toward the moon.  We talked to him on the phone for a minute and before we got off the phone with him, he saw an object to the South.  We couldn't see it, but stayed on the phone and it showed up.  Same type of object, cigar-shaped, silvery, although this one appeared lowest of them all, but maybe it was because it was heading our direction to a Northwest direction. We were off the phone with him and decided to stay out here knowing we would probably see more.  Then there was another one.  This one was different from all the other ones.  It's hard to describe the shape because it was so far up in the sky, but almost appeared like a cigar, but like it had something else on top of it or maybe kind of an L-shape to it or something.  Most notably, though, it had a reddish hue to it, like a haze, but not really ""light"" like it was shining, but maybe because the sun was going down and it was absorbing that color is my best guess.  That was at 8:28pm. We counted 6 total and it's 8:53pm now and we haven't seen anymore since that last one.  Also should be noted, we KNOW the airport had to know about that one coming so close to that airplane.  And we have not seen ONE airplane in the sky since that happened.  We are very used to the airplanes and never get tired of watching them even though they are around all the time.  I must say it is VERY unusual to go this long without seeing at least one airplane flying any direction out of the airport.  It's just unusual. I also want to add that I am in my 20s and have never seen anything like this in my life, not to mention so many.  I have always heard about them flying in groups, but we saw each of them singly.  The only time we saw more than one at a time was when the 2 were flying opposite directions of one another and that was weird.  Why we called the friend during all of this, though, was not only to confirm what we were seeing, but about 2 weeks ago, when my girlfriend was at work at the shop down the street, the two of them had spotted one of these objects then that she said looked just like these except the one she saw was bigger and appeared out of nowhere, disappeared, then returned heading the opposite direction, was reddish colored, and cigar-shaped with the brighter ends. We were so excited to see these tonight.  It must be a blessing or something!  It certainly is miraculous what we saw.  Oh, and I want to add, the friend we were speaking to on the phone, describe the clouds to look ""affected by electromagnetism"" if that means anything to anybody else.  We saw what he was describing and I would describe it as super thin clouds appearing to ""ripple"" across the sky... very huge.  I really don't think I would have noticed it had he not pointed it out, but it was very unusual, especially since the clouds were so thin and transparent.  The sun was setting so the whole sky was clear, purpley-blue and what cloud you could see was more purple and pink.  It's definitely the type of sky that suits this occasion. It's 9:06 and we just saw ANOTHER one, much, much higher than ALL of the other ones.  This one was heading north.  For being as high as it was, it must have been going really fast before we couldn't see it anymore because of the trees.  And then we just saw our first airplane since all the other stuff, heading East, blinking and clearly an airplane.  Wow.  Well, I will end this here.  If I have to do another one, I will.",2011-07-17T00:00:00,35.12547266265719,-89.92692482230727

Once we both were looking at it, it came to a stop and just hovered.  it would jump from moving east to hover to moving east again.   When it started to move east we noticed another light of the same color but dimmer.  That second light never moved and just hovered.  The second light dimmed out to nothing and the first light eventually started to dim out too.  The light of the first one was very intense and strong enough to produce strong rays to my eyes!
