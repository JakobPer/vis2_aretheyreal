The first rocket fire was seen at 9:15 pm. EDT.  The next rocket fire appeared 10 minutes later in the sky at the same position as the first one appeared.  There were a total of 4 rockets seen.  Each rocket followed the same trajectory and at one point, two rockets could be seen, one overhead and one in the distance.  There may have been more than four rockets.  The witnesses only saw four.  The sightings were made from Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.  All four witnesses were sober.  The rockets themselves could not be seen.   What was visible to naked eye was a fire ball similar to ones seen from rockets launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in the 1970s and 1980s.  The witnesses considered the possibility of the phenomena being airplanes.  They dismissed this possibility, as the fire was very bright and burned steady as the rockets ascended.  There were no standard flashing lights as seen on most private and commercial aircraft.  We have scanned the news sights for other sightings.  None have been found at this point.  The witnesses talked with other areas residents, most had seen nothing, Two said they spotted at least on rocket crossing the sky.  We are curious about this.  The witnesses did not think these were extraterrestrial craft, and thought most likely a military exercise.  If you witnessed this, we are curious to know your observations.",2013-09-09T00:00:00,42.0511,-70.196

That's when we realized that there were actually two crafts flying in offset formation. We saw the trailing craft first and then observed the lead craft.  At that height, we should have heard some kind of engine noise leading or trailing.  Neither craft had the usual red and green blinking light or bright white strobe that you see with typical aircraft.  As the crafts moved overhead, we went around to the back deck and by that time, the crafts had accelerated almost as if they knew we were observing them.  The reddish orange light caused me to remember a similar craft that my daughter had observed back in 2004 in October.  Very unusual, I wonder if the reddish orange light was some sort of thermal imaging or night vision equipment.  It might put one in mind of a dark room developing lamp or maybe some type of mylar photo correction film. Just speculation at this point.",2013-09-09T00:00:00,39.955024074074075,-82.0707148148148

I answered his call only to be told to rush outside with my camera to the park that was located directly out front my building.   My camera battery was dead and I knew it so I immediately put on my shoes and just ran out the door.   As I approached him he was standing at the furthest point of our small park looking towards the west at the horizon just over the tree's.  I asked him what it was he was seeing and he preceded to point and say look just over the tree's.   Then I saw it, an entire fleet of orbs some red and some white.  Some were in formations of two side by side really close and others were flying around slowly like dust would in the glare of the light coming through a window. I saw about 15 to 20 orbs all coming from the west just over the tree line and then proceeding to head towards the south direction.   There was NO SOUND, they were far away though but you would think! that many planes all together would give off some sort of sound eventually.  My neighbor was taking photos but I have not talked to him yet since the incident but at the time he said they weren't all showing up on his lcd screen but I will find out soon if there is valuable data. I was telling my neighbor how crazy and awesome it was and he preceded to tell me that before I came out their were hundreds more of them.  He actually said that if he placed his hand in front of him he wouldn't have blocked them out of view.   The sky was faintly cloudy but I could still see stars from behind the thin cloud blanket.  All the orbs would get to a certain spot in the sky and suddenly just disappear.   Then about a minute or two after they all had gone and it seemed as if no more were going to show up, I turned around and looked at the sky just trying to look every where at that point and I saw a very wide but faint light going around in a circle in a clock wise direction against the clouds.   I told my neighbor while he was on the phone with his wife and he got off the phone walked over to me and saw it as well but it seemed like it could have been a spot light coming from somewhere in Manchester so we just decided to ignored it and it eventually stopped. I don't know who or what was flying last night but we do have a  Airport close by. But if it was military why would they fly in the hundreds risking freaking everyone in Manchester out.  Too many questions would be asked but that’s my opinion.  I will admit I have seen plenty of weird things in the skies and I have actually gotten used to it but when my neighbor whom always makes fun of me for admitting to being a believer calls me freaked out and sees it for himself it is a great feeling.   I have learned to not get too far ahead of myself and I understand there is many things these could have been but I have ruled out  Meteors, Lanterns and balloons.  I'm just curious as to now who else had seen them because it has to be impossible that these went unseen by anyone else.  These orbs were floating around for a good five minutes or more.  They were over the highway and plenty of residential areas.   I want to also find out what was flying in Manchester, N.H., for planes at the time of this event.  Does the city know?  But as usual this will be just another pawned off sighting.  I'm going to do my best to figure this all out.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,42.972094248608535,-71.45090269016697

The three light were angled at a 45 degree angle as well diagonally.   We initially thought it was a crane or something, and were utterly confused as it was a rural area.   As we got closer the light began to move horizontally.  We then watched the light from our front porch.  They were hovering over where a small mountain was (with nothing on top).  They would shoot back and forth across the sky and at one point one converged with another and then shot out so fast it made me jump back in reaction.

I have thought about it frequently since it happened.  It occurred on a summer day in the evening. I was sitting on my balcony watching the sunset in western skies.  Something dark in the sky caught my attention. What I observed was a v-shaped craft slowly heading east.  It was about the size of a regular commercial airplane.  It wasn't very high at all and I was able to see it clearly. as it passed over my apartment I rushed inside to grab my binoculars and headed to my back balcony.  As I looked thru the binoculars the first thing I noticed was that a dark blue light traveled on the sides of the craft. Then I noticed that it had a slow spin to it.  Which now when I reflect I find very strange.  You would think the craft being v shaped would fly with the nose pointing to the direction it's heading.  This was not the case making it not normal flight.  This craft was hovering and rotating slowly traveling from west to east.  One final detail is that this thing made absolutely no noise at all.  Being that low in altitude it should have made engine noise. I watched it heading north east until i lost sight of it.   live very close to ohare airport and see many planes at low altitudes.  This was not a plane nor a helicopter.  This craft was truly unidentified. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Please refer to my YouTube vide at the following site:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK2GXXrNs6U  I also have a PDF of my sketch of the craft. I have spoken to MUFON about this incident as well. Note that I am a licensed helicopter private pilot, and former Police Officer (keep confidential; only provided for credibility purposes). 11:30pm Sunday May 5th, 2013.  I turned North on Hastings at the same time a caucasian male jogger was looking into the sky at the same thing I was seeing....so I know at least one other person witnessed this event.   It looked like a larger aircraft on final approach to runway 35 at Sundance Airpark, but then I realized it was not on approach, it was hovering and flashing red, white (maybe white spot lights).  While stopped at Surrey Hills Blvd and Hastings, the craft was hovering about 500ft or closer off the ground and about 900 feet to the Southwest, emitting no sound.   I later realized, on a subsequent trip to the area, that it was hovering over the LDS Church, which has a brightly illuminated steeple with a gold horn blower figure at its peak.  I believe that the extremely bright upward shining steeple lighting is what illuminated the craft enough so that I could see its shape. I then thought to try to get video from my phone.  I turned Southwesterly on Surrey Hills Blvd and ! started the video....the craft seemed to detect what I was doing and it proceeded Southwesterly as I trailed it at approx 25-30 mph.  Note that prior to pursuing the craft, I rolled down my driver side window and faintly heard what sounded like what a ""thruster"" might sound like on the shuttle in space (an air propellant sound).   In addition, I could swear that I started the camera sooner, when I was closer to the craft, but as it is, I only have a view of what it looked like pulling away from me. I thought it may be a ""lighter than air"" craft out of Sundance Airpark, located appx 2 miles Northeasterly, however I do not believe LTA crafts can operate at night.  Even if they can fly at night, I'm pretty sure no aircraft can have red lights at the very tail end (flashing and in a triangular pattern).  FAA requires aircraft light markers to be white strobe at the rear and red and green static lights (port and starboard) on the wing tips or furthest protruding point on an aircraft, even helicopters.   I was close enough at the beginning that I could see that it was much longer than its width, thick like a clay brick, slightly narrower in the middle like a dumb bell but not as thin as a regular dumb bell at the hand grip section; corners appeared to be at 45 degree angles, looked like it was over 200ft long and several stories high with no apparent windows that I could see over the bright lights on the belly; which were at least 6 red and 4 bright white static, flashing and strobing lights, and three slowly flashing red lights at the tail in triangular shape (one at top, two at bottom).   Prior to the video, the belly lights were flashing in a random pattern, almost as if it was a light show; it was more likely photographing the steeple, in my opinion.  I followed it Southwesterly for .85 miles while attempting to video tape it; difficult due to twists in the road, shifting gears and losing the craft in the trees.  I have sketched a diagram of the craft which I can provide upon request.",2013-07-22T00:00:00,35.532890476190474,-97.77063492063492

Upon observation through binoculars it appeared more diamond shaped. When I was traveling along a freeway on 09/02/13 at approximately 18:35 p.m. I saw a unusually bright light in the north sky from Mesa, Arizona.  I made mention of it to my wife who also noticed it's unusual luminiosity.  Since I have been a night shift worker for 21 years I am used to looking up in the night sky and noticing anything that seems out of place.  As we drove along I notices that the object was above the clouds, since as we traveled some high clouds would come in between the object and us.  I thought this unusual since balloons up that high would hardly be visual.  Since that area in the sky is in the normal route of commercial aircraft arriving to land at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, AZ, I thought it unusual that this object was much higher than the descending aircraft who were approaching to land (and below the cloud level).  When we reached our destination in Mesa, AZ at 18:55 we immediately requested some binoculars from the home of my my father! -in-law to observe it more closely.  He complied.  When I looked at it in the binoculars the object seems to have a diamond shape.  It appeared to have lighting from within itself. The object did not appear to be moving at all, just hovering.  I, my wife and several members of her family observed it through the binoculars for several minutes. One member of the family thought it was a hot air balloon due to it's shape, but observing it myself I could not detect any flickering from the typical flame that normally occurs in the ascent and descent of a hot air balloon.  I observed a flight of an airplane that passed by but I have no reliable experience as to whether it was close at all (the same altitude, etc) to the observed object.  I did notice people in other cars at stop lights observing the same thing from their cars, it was that noticeable.....",2013-09-09T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

((ADDENDUM FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC SITE)) Dear Peter,   I heard your interview on Coast to Coast with George Noory, last Sunday, June 2, 2013.  You mentioned that in the previous week you were astounded that there were over 400 UFO sightings.  I reviewed some of the sitings and they seemed very easily explainable to me.  One of them, in Maine, I believe was very obviously the B-1 Bomber in the sky.     I checked with a local AFB website (Creech AFB has a website - near my home in Pahrump, NV) and as I expected, the Air force - specifically the B -1 Squadron out of Texas) was doing Green Flag exercises from May 17 - May 31.  These are exercises which replicate exact tactics that are being used currently in Afghanistan.  They are also trying out a new targeting system which explains the sighting in Cleveland or Indianapolis, I believe, where someone saw planes flying in formation chasing a white light - it turned red (blew up), then vanished (because it disintegrated in the air).  This is typical  Air force exercises that occur at different times for military readiness.     I hope this helps with your quest.  I am an extraterrestrial hopeful, and am always interested in extraterrestrial life - would like to believe we are being visited, but in these cases the only vists are from Uncle Sam.   Thank you.

Could you please direct me to the website you accessed?  Also, if you spoke with someone in the U. S. Air Force, could you please provide me with a name of, and a telephone number for, that person.  I recognize that any aircraft in the air might give rise to a UFO sighting, but the U. S. Air Force probably does not shoot down “targets” over civilian areas, or even over unpopulated forests, given the damage and injury that could occur. Other aspects of your observation that I don’t understand is why two B-1B bombers would be flying in close formation, and why they would have bright lights on them.  Moreover, they are very loud, and even at a distance of many miles, they would have had a sonic signature.   Thank you, again!

The flash would occur 2-3 times very quickly, then it would occur again to the left of where the last occurred about half a second to a second later, then again for a third time to the left of the previous again half a second to a second after the previous.  It would all repeat again roughly starting back to where the flashes came from the first time (they were moving) and continue in the same order. The three flashing lights were moving at the same speed, at the same distance apart, and at the same height (being about the same altitude as a large passenger jet would be when circling or turning to land) as they came closer.  So it appeared that all three were some how attached.  For a brief moment I thought it may have been three airplanes in a formation and their flashing lights just happened to occur to appear one after the other. It was obviously not a single airplane as the right most and left most flashing lights were to far apart even for a large jet.  However, I quickly realized that I've never seen any airplane lights flash 2-3 times very quickly like these did. I therefore continued to watch these flashing lights.  Together they turned and started heading West much like a large airplane would do.  The three flashing lights got closer to each other while turning to go West.  This is when I called my wife to come outside.  She came out and we watched them until we could no longer see the flashes of lights.  It lasted 3-5 minutes from the time I first saw the flashing lights to the point I could no longer see them. To help describe it, a very simple example would be to imagine looking at a stick (horizontal with one end pointing East and the other West) with a light that flashes on the end pointing East, after it stops then a light flashes in the middle of the stick, after it stops a light flashes on the other end of the stick pointing West.  Then slowly turn it so the end the was pointed East points South/South-East and the end that was pointing West points North/North-West.  While turning it the lights will appear to get closer to each other. There were no other lights such as a red strobe light or any lights that were constantly on.  No objects could be seen, only the flashing lights.  I could not hear any sound but the A/C unit for my house and neighbors were running.  The way the three flashing lights appeared to be connected and how they turned would resemble an airplane(a light on each wing and one on the nose or underneath between the wings).  However the span from the light on the right to the light on the left was way to long to be a single airplane.  Maybe it could have been three planes in a formation but I've never seen lights on a plane flash 2-3 times that quickly.  Also the timing of the lights flashing one after the other would seem very unlikely across three planes.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,34.79423655913978,-87.0204129032258

The city lights were reflecting off the bottom of whatever this was more than it was being lit up by the lights that were on it.  There were also two “normal” airplanes, one heading southwest towards the Portland Airport that was fairly low and clearly audible, and another heading due north that was too high to hear. Both of those planes moved at what one would consider a steady rate and direction of travel for a typical airplane, lights blinking clearly even on the more distant one.   This object seemed to be at an altitude between these two, but moving in a serpentine line south and east very, very quickly and what was impossibly smooth given the rate of speed.   I’d say I’ve never seen anything move like that before, but this is the third time since January of this year that I have seen something unexplainable like this in nearly the same position in the sky.

At first I thought it was some kind of search light but we live in Brooklyn and there are no search lights in Brooklyn. When my boyfriend saw it he said it was probably a ufo because there were no beams of light. I thought that he was joking and I dismissed it but as we got on the highway and continued to drive for another 15 minutes we saw the same exact light rotating in the clouds with no sign of any beams.  We had already driven a significant amount of miles from where we originally saw the white lights so I began to wonder how we were still seeing them and why it seemed as if we were getting closer to it. I am a believer in extra terrestrial beings so I began to believe that it was a possibility that, that was exactly what we were witnessing.  I decided to Google my sighting to see if anything similar would pop up and I happened to read a report that was taken in 2010 in California and the witness reported the same exact sighting as me.

I hoped to get a better view of the object when I was on the pier and sadly I did not have my camera,  I often take my camera with me for sunset but on this day I went earlier than normal on my evening walk.   I dismissed the blimp idea and still wondered what it was and then the object looked like two grey balloons side by side but this was not a hot air balloon or two.   As I neared the pier the object moved at a good speed towards the land and by the time I got to the pier I could not see the object, it was as if it had disappeared into the palos verdes peninsula hillside above the cliffs.   I searched for the object for many more minutes but could not see it at all.   I have been interested in UFO's for twenty years and have never seen one and was not thinking UFO at the time at all, I just wanted to know what this object was as it certainly was not a blimp, balloon, cloud, helicopter, plane, etc.   When I heard you speak about the recent flap in UFO's on Rense and then saw the recent LA sightings, I thought I should report it.   As for the size it was at least the size of the goodyear blimp, maybe twice that size.

Since it was remaining stationery, what caught my attention was the orange hew and how low it seemed to be, yet not close to where we were.  It was a singular light above the tree line across the street. I couldn't say what the distance was. I kept my eyes on it, my daughter came out and I asked her what it was, specifying what it couldn't possibly be due to it's nature.  During that time it  disappeared.  Being it was around the trees, I assumed I moved my sight in a way that a limb was obstructing it. My daughter and I walked out into the yard until we spotted it again.  It was a bit lower but of the same orange hew.  Although we never seen any actual movement of it, we would lose sight of it for a second only to find it in a lower position. This went on about 10 more minutes.  Since we had to keep adjusting our positions to gain sight of it again, we eventually zigzagged our way across the street to the neighbor's yard.  Had I first seen it at the level it was at this point, I wouldn't have noticed it because our security lights are of this same color.

My son says look a ""firefly"".. I shut off my car with windows down and no sound what so ever and no beacon lights were coming from the object.   As I watched it moving (approximately the speed of a small cessna type airplane but floating like a balloon), instantly another huge ball of light just appears in front of it (about 200 yards out) coming directly at it..  This one is bright GREEN..  Right as they are about to collide they both instantly stop in the sky at equal distance apart from each other and rotate 3 times in a perfect circle counterclockwise facing each other and then completely stop for about 10 seconds (hovering) and then they continue on side by side (the purple one slightly in front of the green one) in t! he same direction over the tree line (about 1/2 mile away).  My son and I watched for about 20 minutes as the purple one ascended and descended at a pretty fast rate (it would come up in a straight vertical line to about 1000 feet, stop, shift from side to side for about a 30 seconds to 2 minutes and then descend at about the same speed it came up) over the tree line several times while gradually changing colors (purple, red, orange, blue).. This happened 4 times over a 20 minute period. The second time that this happened, I was on the phone with my father holding my son and as the object in the distance was hovering, a bright vibrant green flash went over our head with no sound, so fast it left a green trail for a split second and disappeared as fast as it appeared (almost as fast as a lightning flash but directly over our head and heading from south to north - we were watching the other object off to our East). My son once again said ""that was a fast green firefly""  My 13ish year old neighbor walked up and as I was explaining to her what we were experiencing, the purple object ascended up from the tree line again, this time morphing vibrant colors from purple, red, orange and blue. We watched this event for approximately 2 minutes before she got a bit scared and went home. I snapped 3 VERY quick pictures (each picture was taken as fast as I could hit the picture button. Milliseconds from the each other) back to back with my iphone as the one in the distance was ascending (it was blue at this point)..  It's the cobalt blue light at the top of each picture.. I didn't notice until after I looked at my phone and zoomed in but, in the first picture, you see just a blue object. In the 2nd picture, you see the blue object but above it, a white ball swooping in with a tail or streak behind it. In the 3rd picture, you see the blue orb, no object above it but now a big white object with a mushroom shape to it below it. I could not see these with the naked eye, only after I looked closely at the photos.  The lights themselves were much larger than anything I have ever seen before (huge) and they maneuvered like nothing I have ever seen (i think ruling out planes, helicopter, remote control vehicle)..",2013-06-02T00:00:00,34.17941111111111,-84.1402945386064

About a minute or less apart from one another. The balls did not blink, but remained solid.  Sometimes flicked a little. Changed color somewhat. White, green and blue mostly. I ran into the house to get my wife after I watched the first 2 or 3 objects.  My wife saw the remaining 4 or 5 objects with me float majestically up an into the clouds.  When asked, she agreed that they did not have the appearance of either an airplane, helicopter or fireworks. ""Didn't know what they were,"" and also thought what we witnessed was ""unusual.""   Shortly after my wife came outside I ran about a block closer to where the ball-shaped objects were flying so I could try to hear a sound or get a better view with binoculars. Silence. I could not hear anything.  Through binoculars all I could see was the glowing round light.  The objects seemed large.  At least the size of a truck. The very last object was bright darkish red.  Larger than the other objects at first. (or the light around it more intense?)  Not a ball.  More like a giant red flame in the sky.  This object quickly moved up erratically and over the trees unlike any conventional aircraft and then slowed down.  It headed in the same direction as the other ball-shaped objects.  The bright red color slowly turned into what looked similar to the same color/shape as the other luminous ball-shaped objects.  Disappeared into the clouds.. Several minutes went by.  My wife went inside the house. I retrieved my camera. I then noticed two objects meet roughly in the same location as the objects were flying. First I noticed a red light and then a blue light joined it.  Within a few minutes the blue and red light started to fly in my direction (heading south west) while slowly descending!   Soon I thought I could hear a humming buzz of what I thought could have been a helicopter or a small propeller plane.  I don't know for sure. I'm usually good at identify craft by their sound.  The ""helicopter(s)"" nearly flew over me at a very low altitude. It was probably not a coincidence that the ""helicopter(s),"" if that is what they were, met where the objects were flying and then flew in my direction. I was able to photograph the ""helicopter(s)"" with the blue and red lights.  The photos are strange to say the least.  All that is visible are one blue cylinder and a red cylinder side by side seemingly too close together to have been a plane.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,44.9483,-93.348

About 16 miles east of Gunnison CO saw large circular white light to the south, headed west at about 60 mph. Coming down Monarch Pass and watched a unusual cloud formation to the south of Pass. Roughly 16 miles east of the town of Gunnison I saw a bright light to the south above the skyline of the mtns.  Way to big to be a star as there were a few stars visible behind it.  Seemed to big and bright to be an airplane. woke wife to see it, which she really didnt care.  kept watching while driving and seemed to be moving about same speed 60mph.It was headed west.  Stopped in gunnison to gt some coffee and proceeded on.  Light was still visible to the SW ahead.  Seemed to actually be dropping in altitude from the skyline of mtns.   lost sight of it a few times when i got to blue mesa resevoir area. last saw it at about the easterly bridge area.  Seemed like it went down (landed maybe?)around big blue creek area. dissapeared. didnt see it anymore after that.  Sometimes i would see a airplane flying by to the south and i could plainly see flashing lights,and they were much smaller in! size.  Weird.  the speed is what gets me because it seemed to be going same speed as us.  just slighty ahead and SW. I think there is a fancy lodge up in that area somewhere. Theres just no way it could have been a helicopter because of brightness ,size,no flashing lights and speed. seems to slow for a chopper. I dont kmow, but it was to me unexplainable. wife did see it numerous times also. i would keep waking her, saying what is that? she would look say i dont know and go back to sleep. it kind of looked like a large star in the sky with maybe just very slight flickering.distance was kinda hard to tell but probably within 10 to 15 miles from us? hard to say.

I'm not sure how els to describe the sound,other then world war 3! we checked local news to see if maybe there was construction going on to explain this or if we were in fact being ""attacked"" ..we couldn't find a thing. the noises stopped around 10:30 but shortly after around 11:00 they started aga! in,only this time right out the front door!! we could clearly see bright flashes of white lights with an orange red glow-now i'm a rational person i tend to believe there's a reason or explanation for most everything,but this was very weird!!! the lights would come & go but in almost the EXACT same spot each time-again we could clearly see the big dipper along with other constellations this made NO sense at ALL!! how is it these lights came with no clouds? why where they there? so again we checked the local news,nothing! we even turned on the computer scanner sure we would hear a rationale explanation for this,but we did not find 1!! so we stand outside watching these ""strikes""  of light but that sound,that sound ill never forget! it was so eerie..I've heard people say they have seen crafts but never any noises at this point now i'm thinking outside the box! as the entire block gathered 1 a retired police officer & his family the other a judge here in billings,so ! on so forth & we are all completely confused! all of us watchi! ng now w e see the bright white lights behind those lights an orange reddish glow from below & behind this ""event"" we'll call it seeing as no1 has mentioned it on the local news or anywhere other then social media sites,we did not see any kind of ""craft"" or anything like that,other then when the light came it was very peaceful outside,clear beautiful sky's no storm cell's NOTHING out of the ordinary except these weird lights above & behind our homes! the stranger thing is they moved around billings in a FULL circle,my husband called his sister in Lockwood about 8 minutes out of billings-as we listened & watched in disbelieve we could hear & see it moving,she also heard & seen these strange lights & sounds out in the Lockwood area! she had thought maybe a storm had kicked up out of the blue or maybe the refinery was having issues as they sometimes do here! she also said the noise was so loud that the car alarms in HER area went off each time this happened-but in th! is case i think we can safely say this was NO storm & had nothing to do with the refinery's! again this went on from 10pm to 1am..if anyone can please help explain what this may have been i would be very grateful for any information! it was july 12,2013.. on & off from 10:00pm to 1:00am .. very fast moving lights bright white very loud war of the worlds sounds,along with an orange & red glow about it more at ground level,i know this may sound completely crazy but not 1 of us can figure out what the heck was going on!!! in total there was me,my husband & to be far i would say 20+ people - some with their children so not counting the little one's,but thats how badly this ""event"" has freaked us all out! .. again i'm a fact based type personality so i am trying to find some logical explanation for this..i guess a ""had to be there"" moment to understand the bizarreness of it all- between the extreme sounds & amount of lights it was all just VERY VERY bizarre! ! i know it is near impossible for just us in the heights to hav! e seen & heard this! i think most people are just ignoring it or chucking it up to something logical like i was trying to do which is why i'm just now posting this,a friend of mine looked all over the internet to see if any1 els had posted about seeing these & she found this website - so i know this is very long i just want to know if any1 at all knows what it could possibly be! while we watched it did cross our minds that maybe we were being struck by a meteor shower by the sound of it & at first site! it was not that so..again sorry so long just looking for good info on this event! i almost forgot my husband just reminded me as i read to him what i am posting-this is very important i cannot believe i left this part out sometime around 11:00 pm all th way until 1:00am we did hear & see 1 helicopter & several air plans you could see & hear they were not big crafts like jet plans going back & forth city to city these looked & sounded smaller like maybe military or we could be totally! wrong & it could be just the local air port,its just kind of ironic the sky was completely clear untill this event & than we seen & heard air plans & a chopper..thankfully my husband reminded me of a very important detail i almost left out! ..  b/c i am certain the crafts we DID see are from the area i didnt check the little box that asks the # of crafts seen,but in total we seen 1 helicopter & 2 air crafts - not like ufo air crafts they looked like ours ..i would say for certain they are ours ..but did not witness any strange air crafts- i.e. ufo or strange looking crafts .. i just want to be as clear as possible and give all the facts & give them right so theres no confusion ..",2013-07-22T00:00:00,45.75458535031847,-108.50157707006369

We, with our best guesses, estimated it to be flying at about 500-600 feet and it didn't appear to be traveling very fast.  Maybe 75 - 100 MPH or so.   There was very little if any wind at the time.  It was hard to really gauge how big it was because it was hard to tell how far away it was.   It flew completely silent, no noise at all.  It continued on its course until it went out of sight behind the trees.   The second one appeared about a minute later on the same heading as if a carbon copy of the first but as soon as this one got almost directly in front of us the light flickered a few times and went completely out then we could see the roundish or maybe octagonal shape of 'what! ever' it was.

Within what seemed to be maybe a matter of twenty seconds or so, I saw two more come up back to back and do the exact same thing.   My next door neighbor was coming out of his front door about this time and we saw this same thing happen multiple times.  With the sheer amazement of what we were seeing neither of us could honestly say how many there actually were.  Our best conclusion was at least seven in total.

I my self have  done my share of private flying.  I feel that I can honestly say that I have been around enough fast planes to know that these were no airplanes.  It almost looked as if missiles were being launched.  I thought at the time about the possibility of fireworks.  There never were any explosions.  I went as far as calling 911 non emergency to see if anyone else had reported this event while it was taking place.  The dispatcher I spoke with was not aware at the time of any calls.

As I made my way to the end of my street I made a right, which left me facing due East, onto a dead end street.  I walked a couple steps before I glanced up at the sky something having caught my eye.  I found that what had in fact caught my eye was a single burnt orange and perfectly round orb/fireball looking object.   The object was silent.  The night was absolutely clear this night and I was absolutely certain this object was not a star or the moon.  For the next 20-30 seconds I’d guesstimate I tried to reason it was some unfamiliar aircraft and I began to look for lights on the object I’d recognize.  Red, blue, or white lights that are typical on more common aircraft.   ((NUFORC Note:  Aircraft do not have blue lights.  PD)) As I focused more on this object I realized it was going at what seemed to be a very fast speed, and it appeared to have a hazy effect around it which appeared to emit an off, faded yellow type aura around the orb itself.  The object was low,  I can’t say specifically how low, but I will say it was very large and it almost looked as though it was approaching at an angle as if to land. **According to our local forecast center the Wind speed at 9:53pm on July 13, 2013 was 11.5 mph and its direction was ESE. To continue on… as I continued walking forward I glanced down at my phone which is how I can record the time I saw the object.  I did not think to take a picture or video, for some reason the idea simply was not present.  A minute or so later I looked up to see any changed in the object and did not see the object.  It had simply vanished. I walked home, quickly and somewhat leery at this point (as the object had disappeared).  And continued on with my nightly routine still not entirely sure how to respond or what to think to what I’d seen.   After a couple days I decided to see what I could find online about similar experiences and realized there are many.  I found this website, and although unsure of it, am choosing to share my experiences here. I hope this helps. -B ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2013-07-22T00:00:00,33.1161,-97.0118

We have seen similar things twice before during this past July and August but I can't give accurate dates or time. That's why I wanted to report this sighting while its fresh in my memory.  After a few minutes the lights went south east and past our line of view behind the trees.  These were not known helicopters, airplanes, Chinese lanterns, laser lights or remote control toys.  The lights were high up, they looked like stars that change from white to pale blue. We had clear skies when we saw the lights, so I don't believe they were objects alter! ed by clouds or atmospheric gases etc.   One more thing, we didn't hear anything either.

Once outside the front of our house he pointed to the sky and said "" I just saw a big ball of light fly across the sky and there are still two more hovering there.""  I looked and sure enough, there were two shimmering orbs and above those was a very bright colorful star.  The two orbs were reddish orange in color and were very bright.  They were right above the tree line on the horizon (one on top of the other), I estimate maybe around 20 miles away or closer.  I kept on comparing them to what I thought was this superbright ""star"" above both of them and was just in awe of how these orbs could be stationary, yet about 5 times bigger than this star and bright reddish orange.  Then slowly, the orb on the bottom of everything closet to the tree line started moving to the right (west)very quickly and was blinking blue and red.  If I hadn't just watched it be a big stationary orb for about 5 minutes, I would have thought it was a plane.  At this point my husband asked me to go inside because people would think we were crazy and we should just forget about it. So, I went inside, but of course had to check to see if there was anything in sky behind our house.  As I walked out the backdoor and got beyond our back porch there's a silent (I'm sure military) helicopter just above our house headed southwest towards where I saw the orb headed.  There were lights (regular spot light type lights) on the bottom of the helicopter and I could see the ""feet"" that the helicopter lands with, but couldn't hear a thing! Just a slight wooshing of air and that was it. I was amazed and ran inside to get my husband out of the garage to come and see-  In the approximately 5 seconds it took for us both to get outside in the back yard the helicopter was totally gone.  We stayed outside for about two minutes just talking about everything that was going on and all of the sudden above our heads there was an aircraft with a large orange/red triangle on the bottom, (the craft was about the size and shape of a really weird plane), a second mini triangle on the back of what looked like a tail end, and very ""plane like"" red and blue flashes on what we assume was the ""wing"" tips on each side of the large triangle. It was headed to the east. The opposite direction of where the helicopter was going.  We were really shocked and stood in the backyard talking about what could possibly going on... There are military drills around here a lot, so maybe this was a military drill? Maybe the military has developed orb and triangle lighted planes? We are on the brink of war with Syria, so who knows...  So then after about 4-5 minutes we go back to the front of the house.  Now there are ""heat lightning flashes"" to the east (I saw about 4) and the 2nd orb is moving straight upwards. Just going straight up in a line pretty slowly.  Then, it flashed and disappeared for a second, reappeared, and quickly moved west blinking like an airplane just like the other one did.  I went back inside to call it a night; I clearly knew we weren't going to find out what these things were.  My husband stayed outside.  About 10 minutes later he comes running in the house telling me to come outside. I go outside and he tells me about a super fast white streak that blazed across the sky east to west, but it was now gone.  ALSO GONE IS THE HUGE STAR FROM EARLIER!! So, what I thought was a super bright star or planet that was having a good day, was not that at all. No more heat lightning either, everything was now totally calm and normal. What was all this?",2013-09-09T00:00:00,34.9273,-80.7278

We were sitting on the porch, and chatting.  1 of my friends was sitting on the steps of the porch and looking down (Possibly texting, I do not remember.)  And my other friend was a foot behind me and standing to my left.   Well we were at a trailer park, and around this trailer park it is heavily wooded. When you step out on the porch there is a tree line.  So, we were all talking outside on the porch laughing, and I had this funny feeling, like I was being watched.  I turned my head, and I saw it.  It was a cigar shape, with two VERY dim red lights on each end of the craft. It hovered there for 1 second, then it came up higher from the tree line into full view about 250-300 feet away from us and about 50-70 feet high.  Then it rose up higher, and made a 180 degree turn (Slowly) and shot up and out of sight, when it did this, it revealed its pointed front end (Triangle) so it came out of the woods, completely flat and appeared to be cigar shaped.  When it reality it was a triangle shape, the event lasted roughly 6-7 seconds.  After this I was dumbfounded, and before the words could leave my mouth my friend that was behind me said, “Yea, I just saw it to. Oh my God.”  The friend on the steps didn’t see or hear a thing, and to this day thinks we were just yanking on his chain.  The lights we saw were so dim, that in all honesty you had to be looking for them in order to see them.  I still have no clue how we saw them.  A month or two later I got the nerve to look behind those woods.  And there was a woodless grassy area where I assume the craft took off from.  It was fantastic and scary, but I haven’t stopped looking up in the night sky ever since. (Note)- I called your hotline the day after this occured and I never found a report on it, on this website.",2013-10-03T00:00:00,35.971698461538466,-81.55111076923076

I don't recall why I looked up into the sky but I looked up and there were two amber colored lights floating across the sky.   A small airport is 2-3 miles away so I am accustomed to seeing objects in the sky but nothing like this. I have been an airplane buff since I was a kid and, even as an adult, I still look up to the sky when aircraft pass over.  I know that airplanes have red and green blinking lights and that's what caught my attention, the fact that they were steady lights and amber-colored.  They looked to be fairly low-flying, perhaps no more than 500 ft above me and flying over the spot 200 yards away from where I was standing. As I saw these two lights coming in my direction, at first I thought, ""That is something big, because I was thinking it was the lights on the front of a plane's landing gear.   But then I could determine space between the two lights, with sky in the background, and I realized it was two separate entities. I listened for sound but heard absolutely nothing.  No propeller, no jet engine, zero sound.  Even with the light of a full moon, I could not determine the shape of any sort of craft.  They just looked like two bright lights floating across the sky. The lights were traveling at a steady velocity and did not deviate from each other. They were traveling towards the southwest, directly at the airport.  Also in the southwest direction, a few miles beyond the airport, is a large U.S. Army base.  Thus, at the time, I thought I was seeing some sort of experimental military aircraft. I watched the lights for as long as I could see them. They seemed to slow down as they approached the approximate vicinity of the airport but that may have simply been an illusion as they got farther away from me. Eventually, they were hidden by the trees and I could no longer see them so I don't know what direction/action they took once they reached the airport.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,32.502702332361515,-84.93712623906706

The object was approximately 20 ft from the actual ride and moved with the bouncing ride similar to the natural movement of the ride itself but then took a sudden turn as the ride was bouncing back down after the 2nd bounce and went in the opposite direction of the falling/bouncing ride. As the ride was coming back down during its final bounce the object suddenly shot back up into the sky in a very fast zig zag direction and vanished.

I noticed the “satellite was much brighter than others I had seen and was also traveling much faster than others I have witnessed.  Just as I was thinking all of this it quickly changed directions and began travelling south while picking up speed.  It was very bright and the light pulsated twice before coming to a complete stop then lit up extremely bright then disappeared.   Just as it disappeared two more similar objects appeared in the sky but this time they were headed from the west heading east and were flying one directly behind the other but displaying the same flight pattern as the previous object.   These objects were also quite fast and ended changing direction again to end up in the same approximate location as the first object! when they too came to a complete stop, lit up extremely bright then disappeared.  All together there were six objects all identical to the first and all stopped at the same approximate location in the night sky before lighting up very bright then disappearing.

At approximately 3:30 a.m. observed what was initially thought to be a helicopter to the south about two hands' widths above the horizon until I noticed that one of the flashing lights was blue.  It was the brightest non-moon object in the sky.  The sky was clear with no clouds at any altitude.  Observed with binoculars but was unable to tell shape of object.   I asked my fiance what colors she was observing and confirmed red, yellow, green, white and blue.  Object remained stationary for 45 minutes cycling colors randomly.  The lights at times seemed directional at times sphere-like at times rectangular/cigar-shaped or a cross as its aspect changed.  It was too distant to see a superstructure with any clarity even with 8 power binoculars.   Observed two aircraft (red/white navigation lights at much less intensity than the object).  One traveled south at a relatively high rate of speed towards the object and then banked right and traveled quickly out of view to the west.   Another traveled north along the horizon at relatively high rate of speed to the east of the object about ten minutes later.  Total time of observing the aircraft was approximately one minute per observation.   Given time of night and nature of flight patterns I speculate that they were Air National Guard from Burlington, VT.  I attempted to take a video but the camera-phone was less than ideal, it is shaky and I upset a sleeping bird. Stopped viewing for about ten-15 minutes at the 45 minute mark approximately. Returned to the window and saw that the original light had moved west and was partially obscured by a tree limb.  The observed several lights, originally thought to be stars but noticed they flickered.  Binoculars showed the same light emission patterns.   There were 5 additional lights arranged roughly north to south with varying intensity due to distance with two advanced farther to the west forming a roughly L shape, though I believe there was a salient in the formation as the dimmest and closest to the horizon object was not the tip of the L..  The lights maintained this formation and drifted slowly west until they were obscured by a tree.  Total time observed was approximately 1 hour with a break. I have observed aircraft in this area for thirty years and have seen all manner of USAF and commercial aircraft at night as there was a air force base here formerly.  I have observed helicopters and I believe a drone in the area as well at night.  These lights were unlike anything I have seen in the night sky.  I can't explain what I saw, I do not believe in extra terrestrials and I can see no rational reason for any craft to use lights in this fashion. Nevertheless, we saw what we saw even if it defies explanation.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,44.4413,-73.5212

Difficult to say the distance but they seem fairly close (I estimate a couple of kilometers or less at about 1500 feet).

My neighbor said he watched them for a good three minutes before I came outside, all followed the same route, east to west until they were right in front of us and turned north towards Ottawa. The objects never changed altitude nor did their speed change and no sound at all.  About a minute after heading north they just dimmed and faded out.

I eventually witnessed it just literally blink and it was just gone. .  Wife and I were very weirded out soon after maybe 30 minutes later we started hearing fighter jets what it sounded like.  Around 12 am I heard it for the 3rd time eventually she went to sleep and I stayed outside.  1:43 am rolls around and what looked like jets with odd red pulsating lights some with different formations of light patterns on the belly started to damn near break sound barriers.  The crazy thing is I could 100% identify jets but some of them didnt have thrusters on the back and the one that stuck out most was straight narrow with three red lights on the belly and didnt have a thruster nor sound.

I was talking to my neighbor and glanced to the east.  I noticed a big orange/red ball.  I asked my neighbor what that was, and he said probably a firework, since someone was shooting off a few in the distance from where we were, and we could see them.    We kept watching silently.  We noticed it was moving towards us. When it was passing, I told him that wasn’t normal.  He said no it wasn’t.  We both said we have never seen anything like it.  It had no sound, nor a tail.  I viewed it very well.  It didn’t have a white glowing light nor an open place in the bottom like Chinese lanterns have. I got an excellent view of the east, north, west and bottom of this object.  IT HAD NO OPENINGS WHATSOEVER!  Brilliant orange red color.  I did focus on it’s rim after it passed by me to see if I saw anything emitting from the sides.  I did see a little energy, one might call it. My close up look revealed that it did not flicker like most you tube videos of orbs do.  It was very bright, but didn’t hurt my eyes at the moment looking at it.  I didn’t have to squint like looking at the sun makes one squint.  It was a big ball traveling across the sky.  It seemed to be intelligently controlled in my opinion.   I have not ideal what I saw, but I can tell you in my opinion what I  believe it wasn’t due to the close up view I got of it.  It has been suggested it was a Chinese lantern.  I have looked at Chinese lanterns on you tube.  There is no comparison to what I observed.  There was no white light.  It was perfectly round like the moon.  I know it was not a falling star, nor a piece of space junk that fell from orbit.  I witnessed a piece of Russian space junk falling and it looked like a plane on fire with a long tail.   This orb looked more like a ball of energy, perhaps one might say an orange round moon traveling.  The color was not flickering.  I didn’t see any white or black spots.  The color seemed the same all over, just brilliantly colored.   I didn’t see a triangle or any other shape within or outside of it.  I observed it long and close enough to honestly say in my opinion it wasn’t a Chinese lantern which skeptics want one to believe. There is a place that makes flares on the east side of Oakland.  I sometimes see them testing early in the morning off in the distance from our house.  They fall down.  I’ve seen enough of those to know it wasn’t a flare.  Besides it was on a Sunday night, and I’m sure they were closed.  They don’t travel at a constant speed and altitude either. As the object traveled past, I didn’t feel any weird feelings within my body.  I probably wouldn’t of noticed any weird feelings since I was so fixated on the object in question.  Again, it had no openings on the east, north, west nor bottom of object.  I could see it most clearly.  If it landed on top of the house or in front of me, I could not have viewed it any better. I called the National Weather Service in Memphis, Tennessee this morning.  The gentleman said the surface winds were out of the east at 10 mph.  Speculating winds aloft were out of SE 500 feet and above.  He said they didn’t keep a record of winds aloft, so he was going by what it has been lately with winds out of the east.  I didn’t like hearing winds out of the east, because that doesn’t help me with my case as to what I actually viewed.  The skeptics reading my report will suggest it was a Chinese lantern, which in my opinion clearly wasn’t.   Before saying that I would say it was a ball of energy coming from the fireworks.  I feel so strongly it wasn’t a Chinese lantern due to the great views I had of it on the east, north, west and bottom sides. Whatever it was…. The color was very pretty.  I don’t see Chinese lanterns having such a brilliant orange / red color.  It wasn’t like it was lit up inside an object.  The object was the light itself. Everything I have written is my honest opinion.  I will say the altitude of the object was perplexing to me.  I can’t give you  an altitude, but I can tell you it was big enough and close enough for me to see everything I needed to see.",2013-07-22T00:00:00,35.2199,-89.4996

At first we thought it was a firework.  As we watched it, we noticed it was moving towards us.  It seemed to be at a low altitude or either it was very big and gave that impression. It passed overhead and therefore I got a good view of it.  The orb was circular like the sun and moon.  It was very bright, but it did not cause me to squint to look at it as the sun does.  It didn't have a tail, nor make any sound. It didn't have any other colors in it nor did it flicker like the ones you see on you tube videos.   After it passed over, I made a point to look at the rim to see if I saw anything emitting around it.  I did notice a little energy, I guess you can call it, but only when I looked hard at the rim after it passed. It was not a Chinese lantern as some may suggest.  I got a good look at it probably between 2 and 3 minutes, especially when it passed overhead. I know it was not what has been suggested it might have been to me.

PD)) SIGHTING #  10 – July 14, 2013 – 5th sighting of “glow” The weather this night was overcast with thunderstorms in the distance.  I was over at my friend Carol’s house again and at exactly 10:10, after looking around since 9:20 or so and just looking at a black, overcast sky, we again saw, if only briefly, the mysterious white glow on the Gulf of Mexico, to the WNW of us, off the northern end of Clam Bayou, almost precisely were we had seen it before, but more to the north (our right).  I tried again taking pictures with my camera set on “night,” but the shutter speed is too slow to hold the camera by hand – nothing came out anyway, no smears or anything. The glow “dimmered” on and off four times within a minute or two, and that was it.  We immediately went inside and looked again at Google Earth to see where the glow was coming from, and...nothing there.  The closest house is some way’s away. While looking through my binoculars at the spot I could see a dim spot of white light, with a bit of glow around, that was partially blocked by mangroves.  Thinking about it now, a couple of days later and knowing that pictures wont come out, if I see it again I will keep my binocs trained on it to see if that’s where the glow is coming from (I was fussing with my camera when the glow was on).  Looking at close-ups of the daytime pictures, there’s just no way the light could have been from someone exploring down there because of how thick the foliage is.  Also, the bayou is closed off and there are no boats in there. I don’t know if this means anything or not, but I had been going out to the observation deck the previous half hour, flashing my flash light, with no responses during those times.  I also flashed my flash light at the glow, but no apparent response. With this being the fourth sighting of this glow at this relatively compact location (the other sighting being on the horizon of the Gulf of Mexico,  Report #3), plus this time a dim point of light that likely was coming through swamp trees, In addition to two sightings of the amber-to-red lights and a possible landing, I feel certain whatever these objects are, they are at this particular location for a reason.  My gut feeling is that something big is about to happen here.  (unfortunately, my present back problems prevent me from getting out more often…send help!)",2013-07-22T00:00:00,,

On Sunday July 14, 2013, at approximate 2220 hours while in my home watching TV, I noticed through my sliding glass door which faces west, several orange objects fly in a single path from west to east.  This parade of identical objects appeared at intervals of approximately every 2-3 minutes traveling in the exact same manner as the proceeding object.   To get a better view, I stepped outside of my home.  Visibility was unrestricted, the wind was calm and all was silent among the bright stars.  I was unable to hear any sound from the objects unlike normal air traffic.  The flight path of the objects from the westerly horizon was approximately 45 degrees increasing to approximately 60 degrees as they traveled east. The objects were a solid orange.  There did not appear to be any detectable mass with each light.  After observing this pattern continue for approximately ten minutes and seeing approximately 5 or 6 objects, I decided to get in my car and drive to the waterfront which is approximately ½ mile from my home for a better look. Upon arrival at West Falmouth Harbor, just inside of Buzzards Bay I observed the parade of orange lights continue from west to east.  There was a bright street light at the dock where I stood that did not impede the distinct orange lights.  I observed one cluster of two orange lights side by side in the parade of single lights for another 15-20 minutes. In hope of a better view and to triangulate the path, I drove to Chappaquoit Beach which is approximately 1/2 mile south of the harbor dock and was unable to see any objects so I then drove north to Old Silver Beach and was unable to see any lights.   I then returned to the dock at West Falmouth Harbor and spotted 2 more orange objects.

Sky Watch Report I watch the sky on a subconscious level – very thoroughly and passionately, very focused on the basic layout of the night and day skies around me – it’s innate, I believe. I have never seen anything out of the ordinary in the night sky – not for one out of any of the millions of seconds that my eyes have spent glued upwards, lost in the majesty of it all – have I spied anything that even remotely tickled my senses and made some primal alarm go of in the recesses of my modernized human brain, as I experienced late last night in my own backyard. I went out to smoke a cigarette around 11:30pm, before heading to sleep.  This is routine for me, and the routine does not ever include the porch light at that hour, so it remains a very darkly lit routine. As I earlier noted, I have some built-in awareness of the sky in general, having spent so much time looking at its diagram and the layout of the stars, etc.  Last night, as I stepped outside, I was struck immediately by an unfamiliar “star” to the east from me, northeastwardly somewhere.  Upon closer observation, I saw that it was in no way a star, as it was flashing four primary colors in sequence (not necessary in any particular order that I ever tracked though), just: blue, green, orange, red; and white – bright white – also. I called my roommate outside to show him, as I was taken aback by what I was seeing, especially after I determined that this object was not only indeed, flashing colors – but also was seeming to move in the fashion of being pulled in opposite directions at once – never really making any substantial progress in place. It remained more or less, in the same location for at least twenty minutes while we watched it through the scope at low mag. The colors were definitely confirmed that way as well by both observing parties. The magnification also made apparent, the general nature of the object as well. It was observed at numerous points in time as an unnaturally bright white – to color-changing “fireball” traveling at an extremely slow and steady speed across the distant night sky. Several common aircraft were seen flying in between the location of the object and myself at usual altitudes, creating the appearance of the object marinating a shockingly steady and almost stationary position and an exceptional altitude of its own. It remained for as long as I could stay awake – just gradually traveling across the sky in a southward surge that only became apparent at the end of my observations. It was still flashing brightly, had not dimmed at all, all the same colors and appearance as it had when I first spotted it. It was mind boggling and amazing, it was scary as hell. I am still kind of in shock.",2013-09-09T00:00:00,37.28045681818182,-121.95654772727272

Maybe there is an explanation for this event?????  I stepped out onto my back deck, (evening of Saturday, September 14th) started to sit down on a chair but looked up before doing so.  Coming from the direction of the southeast there is a bright orange round object moving over my house. Higher then a helicopter but much closer then an airplane.  It is bright orange on the outside/underside but a deeper orange in the center.  The color in the center seemed to be moving but that might have something to do with the atmosphere.   I stepped into the house and the clock reads 9:40 pm.  About 30 seconds later a second one appears coming from the same direction, displaying the same thing as the first.  About 30 seconds after that another orange one goes over my house but still at a level that I could see the darker orange moving around inside the center.  All three objects move out of sight into the northwest sky.  I went back outside and have been watching but I do not think any more will come tonight. I am not very good at trying to judge size and distance but they were close and big enough that I could see the variance of the orange colors inside the spheres/UNDERSIDE.  I believe if I would stretch out my arm, the objects would be about the size of the palm of my hand.  This is the first time I have seen anything like this.  I did have trouble sleeping; I kept seeing images of them in my mind all night long.  All I can say is, it might be explained away but I can see the stars in the sky, so it is a clear night.

These are original and untouched photos.  There are others before and after, general scenery shots of the area being taken at the time.  We did NOT notice the orb when the pictures were taken.  Only after, looking at them October 1st, looking through photos, noticed the image on 7014 and then “discovered” the second on 7016 and pieced the sequence of events together. When I saw these the other day, like I said looking through some pictures we took, taking a second look at 7014....what IS that. The moon's coming up and that isn't ....mars? “The thing is way to big.”  “My camera lens isn’t that powerful!” – blew it up and noticed the reflection of the moon on the left hand side of this perfectly round ball. What?  After a few minutes I check on the remaining photos in sequence, and notice on photo 7016 there it is again, and gone in the next shot 7017 taken a few seconds later. Not right after, as we were not taking pictures of this object (had no idea it was on the photo), we were taking pictures of the pink sky in the case of 7016 and 7017.  Again, if it was something floating in the air like a cloud or a balloon etc., shouldn’t it still be there 24 seconds later?  Moving!!

Please note - the total time between the first and last picture is 1 minute 35 seconds. Between image 7014 and 7016 is only 40 seconds at that altitude, must equate to quite a distance in 40 seconds. The distance travelled between picture 7014 (facing East) and 7016 (facing South) is quite large in a time of 40 seconds and results in a complete directional change (photographers vantage) from east to south. We had no chance of “seeing” this when we took pictures of the “beautiful moon” and “pink sky at night”.  This thing was moving too fast obviously. Again, we only noticed the (what I now call “the orb”) round “spot” on the first picture 7014 a couple of days ago and started questioning. Have shared this with some family members here, they seem to agree there is something in the photo.  Of course they know me and it was interesting that my nephew said “if it was coming from someone he didn’t know, didn’t recognize the property, knew I wouldn’t have any interest in putting themselves “out there” he would have dismissed these images.  I might possibly have said the same thing. Makes you reflect on the other stories you hear. The first shot (7011 through 7014) we are looking East. Picture 7015 moving from east to west. Pictures 7016 and 7017 are facing south. So a fairly large piece of sky for something to move so quickly across. How many miles at that altitude in 30 seconds!?  These pictures have good enough resolution to blow them up fairly large (you lose focus after a bit) but the shape is round.  No matter how big you blow it up, the edges don't distort. It isn't a cloud or a wisp of smoke.  The pink picture, 7016 shows the image quite clearly again. We had no idea these images were on here.  Doesn't appear to be an ""airplane"" or ""swamp gas"" to me. And the distance it moved it that time....no wonder the naked eye doesn't see this stuff. This isn't a joke...I have the original photos (date and time stamped) unaltered and no skills, software, time nor interest to play games. Well.....what do you think?  Thank you for taking a look and getting back to me with any feedback you feel relates or explains or supports these images as being…….what???  All the Very Best. Michael PS – towards some “vetting” of myself.  I am aware of sightings, not a fanatic, just open minded. We have had some famous ones here in Nova Scotia.  My friends and some family have reported seeing things “in the sky” in the past, they couldn’t figure out.  My partner ((woman's name deleted)) and I have recently seen a very bright “star” over the complex of wind turbines locally last week.  It was that bright we first spotted it from several miles away. Just sitting right over the wind farm complex.  Wasn’t there an hour later when we returned?  Then, when I came across these a few days ago….just kind of ""wigged me out"" and thought I'd ask the opinions of your organization.  Actually having something in my hand like this that I KNOW without a doubt is real, has me now totally convinced there is some major stuff going on we’re not being made fully cognizant off.  I mean, come on!    How can we capture an image like this and the “gov’ment” can’t grab a pic or two and let us know what “they” think.  I’m getting some suspicious over here.  Especially now.

At approximately 21:11, (9:11pm) I was walking outside to go to my truck to go to the grocery store. As I walked outside I looked to the east and at that time I noticed a light in the sky.  At this hour I was not used to seeing stars in that location and it was in the wrong place to be an airplane as the flight pattern for the airport is above my house.  This light was many miles to the east closer to the mountain that is approximately 10-15 miles away. 	This Light is what is commonly called the “fireball UFO’s”.  It was an orange orb seemed to be glowing from the inside.  That’s the best way I can describe the glowing light.  This did not have a trail like a real fireball or meteor would.  I am used to watching the sky at night as I often do and when the meteor showers are in duration I actively watch them.  This was not a meteor because of the deep orange color and the lack of trail or tail.  This orb was also moving way to slow to be a meteor or an airplane.  I watched this for about a minute and a half as it appeared to be moving south west.  After watching it for a minute and a half, the orb suddenly blinked out.  Like as if someone had turned off a light with a switch. Just like that it was gone.  I watched for another 10 minutes just to see if anything would come back and it did not. When it disappeared, I started eliminating reasons for its sudden disappearance.  It did not go behind view of any building as it was too high for its location and there was still plenty of room before it would have gone out of view by going behind the apartment building to the east of the one I live in. If I were to guess, if the orb wouldn’t have blinked out and continued at the same speed, it would have been another 3 to 4 minutes before it would have gone out of view behind the building. It also did not go behind the mountain range both because it was heading the wrong direction to do so and it was higher than the highest peak that it was around as I could see the outline of the peak. 	I have had this type of encounter before. It was about a year ago and the orb was directly overhead. It glowed from within just like my encounter a year ago and was the same darker orange in color as the encounter a year ago.  Unfortunately, I was unable to enter a report at that time and no longer know the details as far as time and date.  However, it seemed to be the same type of UFO as then.  I don’t view it as being a meteor or an airplane therefore it is an unidentified flying object in my book. I look forward to hearing what you think at the NUFORC.",2013-10-03T00:00:00,40.6916,-112.0011

(Please note:  I do not use drugs or alcohol; and I do not believe in aliens; but these were Unidentifiable Flying Objects, so here is my report.)   It was a gorgeous, peaceful, perfectly clear night:   I was seated comfortably on the 3rd-floor balcony of my ocean-front condo, admiring the full moon over the ocean and enjoying the gentle sea-breeze.  There were people sitting and chatting of the balcony next to mine, and there were a few people walking down on the beach.   Suddenly, from the east-northeast horizon there silently appeared a large, very bright red/orange (with a tiny bit of yellow) globular-shaped object, with a slight undulation in shape.   My first impression was that it had been launched, like a flare, because its initial trajectory was like a flare; and its brightness was also like a flare (though it was multi-colored, red/orange/yellow, unlike any flare I've ever known of, and it lacked the sparkling/flaming aspect of a flare).   Six or eight seconds later, a second object, identical in size/shape/color-scheme, appeared on the exact same trajectory.  Unlike a flare, these objects did not diminish in brightness and arc downward into the ocean.  They continued in their initial trajectory, in a perfectly straight line, from northeast to south, across the ocean, at a velocity of no more than 40-45 mph.  I estimate they were a half-mile from me, traveling perfectly across my totally unobstructed field of view, their altitude slowly but steadily increasing to maybe 1000 feet above the surface of the ocean.  If my distance-estimates were even vaguely correct, their mass was vehicle-sized.   They continued in perfect silence, in a perfectly straight line, south over the ocean, and then over the coast off Kiowa Island.   After about six minutes, the lead object faded and disappeared.   The trailing object continued in the lead's trajectory; and did not fade from view until after an additional two minutes.   There is nothing in my life-experience which can even come close to explaining what I saw, and I cannot conceive of any natural or man-made object that could even come close to either the appearance or behavior of these two objects.

The surface was highly reflective and the crystal clear sky and viewing conditions were ideal.

We don't have binoculars or a telescope, but we were flashing a big flash light up at the craft, my two children and I were waving and trying to send messages to it telepathically, asking the aliens to please come down and visit us if they are a benevolent species.

We were outside on our deck watching it and trying to communicate with it and the craft seemed to become brighter for a brief moment.

Near Clark Dry Lake, 10 miles east of Borrego Springs, Ca, on Rockhouse Road directly next to an official State Parks Benchmark indicating the Anza-Borrego Park boundary. Approx 11;30 am, Saturday, May 26, 2013  I looked up from my campsite and saw a gleaming metallic object, flashing in the sun, falling, leaf-like from the sky to the north-west of my location approx 120 yards.   It was already at about 50 ft elevation and descending erratically.  It soon touched the ground directly next to the Boundary Bench Mark along side this dirt road.  I assumed that the object was a mylar balloon or piece of airborne aluminum foil judging from the way it reflected the sun brilliantly and its relative small size as well as its apparent flight path and demeanor which both suggested that it was being carried by the prevailing wind (from the north-west to south-east.).  Still I felt obligated to investigate. I walked down an intersecting access trail never losing site of the now grounded, highly reflective object. It was blindingly bright and continued to flash as it apparently swayed in what bare little breeze there was at ground level. As I came closer, (approx 50 yds) the object, appearing intentionally, moved away from me as if in an attempt to hide.  It did this by ""hopping"" sideways.  I still believed it to be merely the wind.  As I came even closer the object quickly ""hopped"" behind a five-six foot high mound of dirt outside of my view.  I continued my approach. A few moment later, ( now about 40 yds away) the object raised directly up from behind the mound exposing about 80 percent of itself and then dropped back down (As if looking at me and then hiding again!).  I had now closed the gap to about 30 yds from the object and was attempting to flank it from the right when it began rising and also drifting to the west, AGAINST the prevailing wind! It rose and traveled at approx 15 miles per hour and achieved and altitude of (A rough estimate) approx 500-800 feet before leaving my field of vision.   The sky was clear blue and there were no obstructions between me and it.  It also moved, ag! ainst the wind, surely strong at that altitude ( as they usually are here) about one half mile to one mile west-northwest of the landing site and now my location.  There were no marks on the ground. It was very warm, over 90 f and I am certain that heat could vector lightweight items up from the desert floor in that heat.  At one point when it was ""hopping"" away from me I got an excellent view of the item. Instead of being a high polished aluminum as I had thought, it was opaque, I could see right through it.  However when it turned just so it reflected the sun as if polished metal.  Also surprisingly it was completely smooth and flat as if freshly ""ironed"". It appeared as if it were a plane of glass or plastic.It was a rectangle of about 3x2 feet.  It at one moment turned completely perpendicular to me and appeared then as only a black line perhaps 1/2 inch thick or less.  It had three ""wires"" or antenna all of even length ( maybe 2 1/2 feet) hanging from each of three corners of this rectangle.  One corner had no appendage.  I am certain of the prevailing wind, not only from lengthy experience here but there was a brush fire currently in progress near Julian, Ca, about 20 miles west-southwest of my location and in the mountains at about 4000 feet.  The smoke from that fire was travelling due east and dropping down to the desert floor nearby.  This specific location, Clark Dry Lake, typically has a wind from the west-northwest as it is a adjacent to a canyon and  is the lowest pass from the Riverside and Los Angeles areas.  The wind from the coast funnels through there to the desert floor.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,33.1799,-116.2731

Walked out of my house with my brother and started talking before his departure.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a large fireball in the sky and told my brother took look as well.  We both thought maybe it was a plane but thought it strange since the fireball was very bright and not typical of commercial planes in the area.  Living close to a major airport we see planes on a regular basis and can identify commercial planes by there flashing lights.  Once we realized that it could not be a plane with a bright red orange color light we started walking toward the yard to get a better look at it.  At the same time as I reached for my phone to record the event the bright red orange glowing fireball emitted a smaller fireball that went straight down.  A second or less after the first smaller fireball a second fireball was emitted.  Shortly after the release of the second smaller fireball the larger fireball disappears. We were so amazed by the strange lights that we quickly checked my phone to see if I captured any of it since it only lasted a few seconds.  I did get it on video but only the last couple seconds.  You have to see it on a larger screen to see the smaller fireball but the main fireball is very visible.  Wish I would have gotten both smaller fireballs coming out of the larger one.

This is my second UFO encounter.  I have tried every way I can think of to explain this but I cannot.  These were , in my opinion , the same kind of objects I first reported on the 5th of June of this year.   This sighting has one major exception though, I was in my car with the windows down and moonroof open listening to some music.  The lights in my car started to dim, so I started the car thinking I was draining the battery.  Lights back to full intensity, for about 20 seconds.   Then everything, engine, lights, radio, horn, security system, went haywire for about 10 seconds and then my car went silent.  No power from anything.   Almost immediately these lights appeared from above me and spread out in a line, north to south.  The 4th light was directly above me.  No sound could be heard and I was in an area where there is very little or no sound pollution.  I know this sounds like ""encounters"" of the third kind but this was more intense.  I felt the need to get out of my car and look up at the lights.  They seemed to be perfectly still above me.  This lasted for 3 to five minutes.  Then the lights apeared to either disappear completely or ascend straight up.  The color of the ""objects"" was a bright deep orange.  I returned to my car which was still unresponsive to my attempts to start or using my keyless remote to open doors or trunk.   About a minute after the objects left the lights blinked and the horn honked, like you had just locked the car. I pushed the start button and it started.   I drove home and as I was leaving two people outside the gate where I was at flagged me down and asked me if I saw what they saw.  I asked them hat it was they saw.  They told me that ""a bunch of lights came down and one of them hovered right over me.""  They wanted to know if I touched it.  From their vantage point it looked like the light was very close to me.   The night was clear, no clouds, wind was variable.",2013-07-22T00:00:00,34.60069111111111,-92.49105555555555

I do not believe this is a typical sighting of a craft but I could be wrong. I was looking at the sky last night from my glass room on the back of my house and was standing looking out my full glass door which faced east and looking straight up at the night sky stars.  It was one of the most visible skies I have seen.  The stars seemed to just stand out and I live where there is no lights.   When I looked straight up in the night sky (which would be close to one of the stars in the small dipper) I saw something I don't think I was suppose to see.  I double checked there were no jets in the sky.   I saw a visible rectangle which was fully lit light a bright retangle lit fully.  Not like a shinging out of light but a box fully lit with light.  It appeared and it did not appear.  There was no fading just there and then not there.  No movement just in place and seen and then not seen in seconds. I watched and never saw it again.     I have seen ufos throughout my life in western Maryland and here once but this was not appearing as a vehicle but a marker?  There were no planes in the sky and it definitely was not something moving or flying.  It looked to me more like something that was in a specific place permanently but not suppose to be visible but some reason it made itself visible or something allowed it to be completely visible for a brief period of time.  Since you have to look straight up it would not be something unless you were standing outside and looking directly up in order to see.  It was very far away like a marker above.  Since it was not fading in or out but just there and then not there and never was in any kind of movement.    So I will continue to monitor the sky in this part now that I have seen this.  I have never heard of anything like this in my readings and wonder if you have ever had anyone report this? I live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland on Deal Island which is Somerset County, Md. The nearest main town is Salisbury Md.   Please feel to email me if I can provide any further information.  I do not have a cell signal on the island.",2013-07-22T00:00:00,38.1691,-75.8682

This object was changing course in an instant moving at very high rates of speed also hovering completely still and always stayed within view, movement that indicated intelligent changes in direction, for example the light would gain altitude dramatically followed by a pause hovering completely still then a much slower decent, after that the object moved around from east to west in more of a diagonal pattern, the type of maneuvers no conventional aircraft could come close to, and this is definitely not an object being pushed around by wind.  It also changed colors from bright white to red/amber, the flying oval appeared to distort into rectangular and triangular shapes then quickly return to an oval, the entire time there wa! s trail of dimmer light coming down off the object like a tail or an exhaust beam always pointing towards the ground.

When we walked onto our deck (looking due north)- I could clearly see unusual lights coming from the farm fields located directly behind our rural property.  We live on a hill with clear visibility for at least ½ to ¾ mile to the north.  I noticed that my small dog would not leave my side.  Normally he would be off sniffing in the darkness for  ocal small wild animals etc…  It was quite unusual for him to stick close to me- in fact he kept walking right back to the door like he wanted to go inside instead of have his last late night romp.  I guess you would say he was acting out of character. I was a bit shaken by what I witnessed in the night sky.  First of all- the night sky was very clear with awesome visibility of the stars.  However- I witnessed something I have never witnessed before.  It looked to me quite a bit like the aurora borealis directly behind by property.  There was what appeared to be a misty quality to the area from the ground and up for approx 100 feet or so- but ONLY in the due north direction.  There were also beams of straight light that appeared to be coming from the sky down (or from the ground up) into this misty green and purple hazy lit up area (the color was green closer to the ground- and had a tint of purple the higher it went- also it seemed to have a bit of a sparkly aspect to it as well).   What was very odd about this is that directly above where these lights were- and where the spotlights stopped up in the air- I could not make out what was above that.  It was a clear black out.  Normally I would see stars in this area of the s! ky- but it was solid black!  I could not see a shape or form of anything in the sky- it was like it was blacked out on purpose!  I could hear no sound.  I could not hear any sounds from the nearby highway- I could hear no local animals (horses-dogs-crickets etc…) there was literally NO NOISE- even the naturally occurring country noises outside.  It was still as ever!  The beams of light would rapidly change position- following no obvious pattern.  I walked the entire distance of my deck (60 feet) back and forth trying to make sense of what I was seeing- and to try and figure out what I was looking at.  I was home alone with the dog and did not have the courage to walk down onto my property and out into the field directly behind my home.  I unfortunately did not have my phone or a camera with me. As I watched the lights- I tried to make out whether they were coming from above or from the ground- and to be perfectly honest- I couldn’t really tell.  I just noticed that the lights were very strong and vivid and much like a spotlight that you would see in the sky for a Hollywood premier- the lights had a bit of an orange and hazy sort of sparkly  tint to them- and were sometimes moving so rapidly that I couldn’t tell where they were stopping and starting.  From what I could tell- there were no farmers out doing any crop work- as there was no machinery noise like you would hear during harvest time- plus they rarely harvest in the dark of night.  There are no homes due north of my house- only farming fields.  There are no trials for   hiking or four wheelers back there.  There should have been nothing there at all! I watched this light show for approx ten minutes and then became scared and went indoors.  After about ten more minutes I looked out my back window and all of the lights were gone!  There was also no more mist or fog in the air.  It was just clear night sky.,2013-10-03T00:00:00,43.3221,-89.36470000000001

The moving light pulsed several times before dimming out then disappearing.  4 minutes later what at first appeared to look like an airplane due to a much lower altitude appeared from ! the south and as it flew overhead lit up several times almost as if it were pulsing with an immense bright white light.  It generated  no sound as it flew over and right when it was directly overhead it came to a slow crawl as it lit up immensely again  as if it recognized I was looking at it.  I took out my video phone but was unable to catch it on video due to the low battery on the phone.  After stopping and lighting up extremely bright it continued on its original path before disappearing out of sight.   Due to all the recent activity around here I am beginning to wonder if these crafts are related to Beale AFB as they seem to travel to and from the general direction of the base.

They flew almost directly above us but slightly to the south of our vantage point.   There were objects (at least three dozen or so) which appeared to be circular in nature but more oval shaped (similar to the body of a jellyfish).  There were no sounds at all or any beacon type lighting.  They blended in with the sky very well but seemed illuminated by the ground lights of the city/suburbs near us.   The moon was not visible to us for any comparison but they were much bigger than any stars (about the size of a quarter or fifty cent piece hel! d at arms-distance).  When we first noticed them, they came in “squadrons” of about three in a seeming v-type formation.   There were several of these and were followed last by a very large clustering with no definite formation other than being in a large group.  They were all flying at speeds consistent with each other and very close together, not breaking from their location in relation to their set patterns and the other objects.

The craft had four lights closely spaced together near the front of the craft in a half circle shape, and then a light at the back two corners.  These lights were constant and were a faint orange color. In the center was a very slow pulsing red light.

I would like to start by saying that I am an avid astronomy enthusiast and I am often looking up at the night sky. I have seen meteors, comets, satellites and I often watch the space station as it passes overhead so I am very used to seeing moving objects in the night sky.  Both my boyfriend and myself witnessed this. I went out tonight to try and see if I could catch any of the lunar module launch from Virginia at 11:25pm.  Unfortunately there were too many trees obstructing my view but I did notice something else moving in the sky to the south.  It looked like a star. It looked very much like a star.  It wasn’t blinking at all and it was catching the light the same way the space station or a satellite would but its movements were very fast and erratic.  I observed the object for a little over a half hour and only went inside because it was very late, it was still there when I left. The object would remain stationary for quite some time and then move very suddenly and very fast in various directions. Sometimes it would move to the left or right or straight up or down, other times it swerved in a figure eight type of pattern.  At one point an airplane passed close beneath it and it moved suddenly straight up and back away from the plane and then remained still until the plane passed, at which point it moved lower again.  It was moving very quickly and changed direction with ease and had a sort of halo effect around it.  When it moved it created a slight tail trailing behind it.   It stayed in the same general area of the sky, almost as if it were circling the area. From where I was standing the object was 156 degrees to the south east (I have a compass app) and not terribly high up, right about in the area of the constellation of Aquarius.  (I have an app that shows me where the constellations are at any time so I am sure of this.)  It was very small, the same size as a star.  If I hadn’t been watching the sky long enough to see it move I would have thought it was a star.  I have never seen any object move in the sky like this.  I am an amateur astronomer and my boyfriend has a degree in physics and we cannot explain what we saw.  I am not the type of person to instantly think of a UFO, but once you have ruled out the possible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth, so I am reporting it in the hopes of finding out what it was.  I would welcome and explanation if you have ever seen anything like this before.",2013-09-09T00:00:00,44.3668,-69.1889

Tonight while driving Eastbound on I-275 from Clearwater to Tampa, myself, fiancé & daughter were in vehicle and I noticed a flashing white & red light descending rapidly in the sky.  First thought it was an airplane or a Chinese lantern, but when it started getting lower thought it was possibly a life flight helicopter.  It descended straight down rapidly at a 45 degree angle, almost like a flare from a flare gun.  It stopped blinking and began pulsating - we tried to slow the vehicle down to take photos but couldn't get a clear shot. There is a large blue water tower on the left side of the highway - between the Ybor City exit and the I-4 interchange - and when we began driving past it I started screaming ""what is it"". It was a flat black and round (as if you'd lay a car tire on its side) with one large round blinking white light on the left, and two large round red lights in the right side. It was near the same size AS the water tower so I was surprised nobody else could see it, it was VERY large.  My daughter began crying and we couldn't find an exit to turn around to look for it.  The craft came straight down, and literally STOPPED beside the water tower, it was hovering beside it.  That's when I started panicking because if it was an airplane, it was close enough to crash into the tower.  It was not a small engine plane as it had NO wings at all. Just a large black round & disc shaped with the 3 lights.  It made absolutely no noise, and when we started passing it, it very rapidly rotated out of sight to the right side, back behind the water tower. About a half hour later, we drove to the roof of the parking garage (5th floor) at the Hard Rock Casino in Tampa to see if maybe we could be high enough to see it or take a picture, but only had cell phones and the video was poor quality.  My fiancé stood on the hood of my car and I was just outside the car, and there were two more of the identical craft, approximately 1000 feet away - but these ones were ascending straight up.  Not at an angle at all, not very fast.  The same 1 white light and 2 red ones on each.

From the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of a bright orange/gold color light in the northeastern sky near South Mountain.   As I walked over to the window to get a better visual, the light/object moved across the sky slowly from the southeast to northwest direction, and appeared to get closer to my home.  The object finally came to a rest at what appeared to be 800-1000 feet off the ground, and perhaps 1/4 mile from my house.

After watching the object for another minute or two, I called my wife to take a look at what I was seeing.  The very instant she turned her head to look in the objects direction, the object quickly “shut” from top to bottom almost like two doors sliding shut and meeting to close in the middle.  As it was shutting, the light grew dimmer till it was not visible.  However, I was still able to briefly see the outline of an ovular object. Upon the objects disappearance, there appeared to be two airplanes approaching from the southeast, with one of them splitting off heading southwest, and the other making a sharp turn directly to the north, heading towards the area of Blue Ridge Summit Pa.   I watched the airplane for a few minutes and notice it was circling the area at a high altitude, almost as though it was looking for something.

On Saturday night, my fiancee and I were sitting out on the front porch chatting.  Suddenly a very bright orange light caught my attention above the tree line on the opposite side of the street.  We both were astonished as we got up from the porch walking to the back of the house to keep the light in sight as it travelled over the house.  It appeared to descend and turn dark as it dissapeared behind the woods.  Just as we could no longer view it we turned and immediatly noticed two more identical lights travelling in the same pattern and direction as the first one.  The first of these lights seemed to have a haze over the top, and all were equally bright.  Immediately, we jumped into the car and attempted to follow these lights, however they dissapeared rather quickly.  My first thought was that perhaps they were associated with the military base, however I quickly realized that the only aircraft associated with the base are helicopters, and these lights certainly were not helicopters. I have seen the military aircraft every day of my life for the past thirty years, however have never wittnessed anything like this.  I believe the lights came from the west, were extremely bright, and made no sound.  As the lights appeared to be descending behind the woods they appeared to fade or darken and the shape seemed to be something of an elongated sphere.  I am not good with size or distance, however I would describe them as being the size of a smoke detector held at approximately two arms lengths.  Upon returning home, I called my Dad who happens to be a pilot and asked if he knew of any aircraft that had bright orange lights, he did not.

As I was walking to the front door I looked to the North and saw orange lights in the sky.  It had been dark only for a little while but the lights were easily distinguishable and I knew that what I was seeing was out of the ordinary.  At first there were only four of them each following the same path as the one in front of it?   I immediately opened my front door and yelled for my mother to come out to see what was going on knowing that this was something never seen before.  I asked her to grab her phone so I could record what I was seeing.  My parents have lived in this home for something like 40 years and I grew up there.  They’re home is near the McCoy International Airport so there are planes coming and going in the eastern sky (literally) at all times.  I know what a plane looks and sounds like and these orange lights were moving much faster than ! any plane I have ever seen.  The orange light did not appear to be a beacon on the aircraft but it seemed to be the aircraft.  At one point one of the orange lights moved toward a plane traveling west from McCoy and came right up next to it, to what looked like a stone’s throw from it.  I don’t believe that any passenger plane would allow another plane to come that close or even a military plane over a civilian population.   As I was recording the strange lights they started to change direction from the north to south path to a direction due west and then one of them just disappeared, shortly after this another disappeared and then another until there was only one left.  The last orange light just kept heading west until I could not see it any longer and just as I stopped the recording another orange light appeared from the same spot as the other four.  It followed the same path as the previous four heading south until almost over top of me and then turning west until I could not see it any longer. I am not a UFO enthusiast, I don’t watch the skies for anomalies, and I have never seen anything like this before.  I was totally surprised at what I was seeing but I can tell you this, I knew right away that what I was seeing was something that had never occurred here before.

They seemed way lower than the few clouds we had that night, and remained at a slow constant speed.  To me it seemed about 150 ft up. I was standing on the pond bank by now for an interrupted view.  The two outside lights dropped uniformally lower slightly to suggest a triangle, removing the idea of a glider plane.

I talked to the airport and they had nothing in the area at that time.   I also contacted the National Weather Service and they were not reporting any strange weather.

So once we got to house, I grabbed my camera and tripod and went out side and quickly snapped two pictures of the object.  To the naked eye it looked like a very large bright white light that was stationary.   Once the camera was set up, I noticed that the object was moving very slowly west and that it seemed a lot closer than a stars appear to be.  The two pictures I took were the best I could do with the equipment I have, which since we have been seeing strange things lately; I have with me at all times now.   The pictures were uploaded and I looked them over and was surprised to notice that in both pictures there was the object; and then there was a small blue light/object next to it. what was even more strange is that this blue light is in a different spot next to the object in both photos; like it was orbiting the larger light.  The Larger object in the second photo also had what appeared to be a split between it; which was strange but could be clouds shadowing it.  I am happy to have gotten this on camera, it is definitely unidentified to me.  If you have seen this before whether its normal, strange, or camera glitch; please let me know.

It was a perfect evening with no wind, clear skies and mild temps.  I was sitting out on our deck.  I had been playing a very soft tune on my guitar that I was making up.  My thoughts were of how perfect the night was, and how much I was enjoying connecting with my guitar.   I looked up, toward the SW, and what appeared to be rising over the roof tops were five orange/red lights suspended in front of me.  They just floated there, in a formation of two at the top in a horizontal line and three below . All lights were evenly spaced in the formation.  The individual lights were not spherical when close/brightest, but  vertically elongated in a line like a lower case i without the dot. They were very short, ""1 degree tall,"" not long lines of light.  I cannot say how far away the lights were.  There was no noise. The lights simply hovered/floated at first.  When first seen, all of the lights appeared in a space about 10 degrees wide and about 15 degrees in height in the sky.   At first, they seemed to be directly over the rooftops of the houses fronting the ocean.  The lowest light seemed about two hands above the rooftops.  The lights were as bright as the waxing gibbous moon, but reddish-orange in color.  They reminded me of brightly glowing embers, but did not flicker, pulsate or change in intensity until they began to move away/fade. The words that come to mind are suspended formation. I did not understand what I was seeing, and looked upon the lights as a small child might view a new discovery for the first time. I was spell-bound.  Two began to slowly drift out of view/fade toward what seemed to be a southerly direction.  At this point, I snapped back into reality and ran to get my son.  He hurried outside in time to see a formation of three lights in a horizontal line about three hands above the roof tops.  As we both watched, he realized we needed pix of this. We both ran to get our cameras and tried getting some shots without the flash.  Mine didn't come out; his did!! It shows the lights near the final moments of their display when only two remained.  He also got some video that we are processing now.  Due to auto focus and distance, the lights only appear as round orbs.  The pix were taken when the lights were much farther away/fainter than when they first appeared as the group of five.  I know these were not propelled by the wind.  The movements were too deliberate as they changed position, then remain fixed again. I feel blessed to have witnessed this!!!  This was an experience that he and I will treasure and share forever!! We know what we saw!!!  NO, they were not helicopters.  We see them all the time and they do not move like this, nor do their lights remain in the exact position.  With the changing viewing angles helis show their red, green and white lights.  There were no green or white lights.  There was no noise. Flares don't move in this way either since the lights would rise, fall, move left and right very slowly.  I have not ruled-out the possibility than five remote controlled devices could have created this, but the power source/batteries for the lights would need to be very heavy to have kept the lights at the high intensity and duration we observed. What did we see!!! He and I both agreed that nothing of this Earth that we knew of moved in that manner in inner or outer space.   We clearly BOTH witnessed an anomaly.  Was it extra-terrestrial?  Was it local?  Was it spiritual?  We don't know.  I can only swear to you that it happened.",2013-07-22T00:00:00,44.45660000000001,-123.9414

Four separate triangular shaped formations, which consisted of 3 fireball objects in each triangular formation.  At different times, one fireball object would break away from their triangular formation and move in very rapid movement; appearing to move horizontally away from their group of three fireballs and then rapidly rejoin their formation after 3 to 4 rapid movements away from their group of three.  The four groups of three went from a straight line and then formed a “V” shape almost like a flight of geese does.  I spoke with three other individuals who also saw it, but I also witnessed other people along my drive who were pointing to them in the sky.  This took place over Lake Onalaska, just north of the La Crosse airport, between La Crosse, WI and Onalaska, WI.  The fireballs moved too erratically and were shaped too round to be convent! ional, manmade aircraft.  They seemed to have the ability to cloak themselves because one minute they were visible and the next they were gone.  They had the ability to hover, but they also had the ability to move very quickly as well.  I’ve never witnessed anything like it.  I was driving south on Hwy 35 and attempted to call my wife on my cell phone who was at a friend’s house to see if she could see what I was witnessing and my cell phone was unable to get a signal to complete the call.  The area I was in always has a cellular signal available, but I can only speculate that the objects in the sky had the ability to disrupt the cellular signal, because once they were no longer visible, the cellular communications were restored.  When I made it to the location where my wife was at, three other people at the house saw what I was talking about; the strange thing is, from their location only three of the fireball objects were visible…again I can only speculate that from their! perspective the other objects were cloaked.  Cellular signals! were sp otty for the rest of the night.  The time of the sighting was during dusk or sunset lighting….again speculation that maybe that type of lighting makes it difficult for their objects to cloak themselves.

Subject:		 UFO sighting  Date of Sighting:	 Summer, 1966  Location of Sighting:	 Old Ridenour Road Gahanna, Ohio (near Columbus, Ohio – capital of Ohio) (between Old Ridenour Rd. on the north and east, Agler Rd. on the south, and Stygler Rd. on the west)  Position in Sky:	 Southern sky, moving from east to west  Number of Witnesses:	 2  Age of Witnesses:	 13 years old and 16 years old  During the summer of 1963, when I was 13 years old, I was in attendance at a family get-together dinner.  My aunt had a small pamphlet which talked about a group of people in Arizona who regularly meditate up to the skies in hopes of attracting UFO sightings/contact.  My cousin-in-law, who was 16 years old at the time, and I decided to go outside onto the open patio at the southern side of my aunt’s house and try to meditate up to the skies in hopes of attracting our own UFO sighting/contact. 	Though we didn’t really know how to meditate, within a couple of minutes something appeared approximately 80-100 feet above the ground, just above the tree line in the southern sky, and it was approximately one quarter mile away from us.  It looked like a glowing light, and it was moving slowly from the east to the west just above the trees.  There was no definable shape to the object other than that it was a glowing round light.  (If you were to elevate a lighted Volkswagen Beetle one quarter mile away and suspend it above the trees, that is what the approximate size of the glowing light could be compared to). 	As soon as we saw the glowing light, we jumped out of our chairs and exclaimed to one another that there was something up in the sky.  My cousin-in-law immediately ran into the house to beckon the rest of the family to come and witness what we were suddenly seeing.  I remained behind, on the porch, and watched the movement of the glowing light.  It proceeded to move to the west, and just as the first of the other family members was coming through the door to the outside, the glowing light dropped down below the tree line, making it impossible for anyone else to see it.  My cousin-in-law and I implored the others to believe us, that we had indeed seen something out-of-the-ordinary, but there was no visible proof anymore of what we had seen only a minute before.  Most of our family returned inside to their party, laughing at what they thought was our feeble attempt at a UFO sighting hoax. 	In good faith that we had indeed seen something, and in an attempt to be supportive, one of our other family members jumped into his car with my cousin-in-law as navigator, and they drove off to circle the location of the house and the sighting by driving around the large country block.  When they returned they spoke of seeing only a bright light anchored to a telephone pole above one of the neighbor’s homes.  (The light anchored to the telephone pole was not visible to us from my aunt’s house.)  They did not see a glowing light moving in the sky.  And neither did I see the glowing light again that night, or any other night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",,,

In the summer of 1977 or 78, I went to spend a few weeks with my aunt and uncle living in Tennyson, Texas.  My uncle worked at the Goodyear proving grounds but had farming and ranching interests also.  He worked in coo ordination with a man who owned a Ford 9600 tractor.  The tractor was diesel powered.  It was almost new and he had arranged for a custom plowing job to be done at a neighbors property.  I agreed to do the work and he would pay me some of the earnings.  I was on the last field and nearing completion.  It was probably nearly 1 AM in the morning.  It was a clear night and no rain as best I recall.  While heading in a Southerly direction with the plow in the ground, I saw a light far off in the distance moving my way at an astonishing speed.  It was low on the horizon but definitely in the sky.  It captured my vision as I was headed directly toward it.  As it moved toward me it consumed the entire sky and eventually lit up the entire area around the tractor as fa! r as I could see as bright as daytime.

It would have to be taken out of gear and the starter engaged.  But, because of my fear, I immediately lifted the plow thinking if I don't I will be electrocuted.

I asked questions of my uncle and aunt as well as other local community members and found out that others had sightings that were similar although I didn't commit to seeing anything.

I was there for 2 full weeks beginning May 31, 1978 until June 13, 1978.  The event occurred during the last 4-5 days, I was there.  So, on or about June 10, 1978 is the closest I can come to being exact.  I believe it is firm enough to publish the data.  In all the years since then I have never seen anything like it again.  I can arc weld and the brillance of that light on a small scale may serve as an example.

The site I chose to set up my camp was right on the southern limit of the camping area so there was no obstruction to view other than cacti.  Several times each week and always at night I would see a large, right triangle shaped object at some distance.  It sported three red lights and emitted a low humming noise and move slowly.  This puzzled me for aircraft do not sport position lights in that configuration.  On fixed wing aircraft they are red on the left wing and green on the right one with a white anti-collision light mounted on top of and to the rear of the vertical stabilizer (tail). 	Judging the size of the object, distance from my location and its altitude was difficult as I had no point of reference.  It could have been a mile or two away or it could have been 20 or more miles distant.  Depending on the distance the object could have been 400 feet in length at the closer distance or much, much larger at the farther distance.  However, it seemed to be below 1000 feet above the ground. 	Initially, I paid little attention to it as I assumed it was military due to it's location, for south of where I was camping is the large Yuma Proving Grounds of the U.S. Army.  Logic said secret military aircraft but after years of hearing reports of UFOs being triangular in shape and having an associated humming noise, I'm inclined to think that what I saw was something unique. 		Was it a UFO?  Yes, positively!  I could not identify it and was therefore unknown and it was flying and it was an object.  Was it military?  Possibly.  Was it other worldly?  One might have suspicion of such. 	Was I hallucinating? No.  Was I under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  No. I eschew the former and seldom imbibe of the latter.  Am I flighty of nature and imagination?  No.  I am a former high school teacher plus I hold a commercial pilot license and am a certified flight instructor. 	So, what did I see?  Good question!

Circling overhead at between 1,500ft - 2,000ft. Despite the time, being summer it was not dark but dusk and the silhouette of the helicopter was reasonably definable. Within a minute or so, we noticed a fleet of 10-12 square-shaped dark craft flying silently in tight formation at no more than 1,500ft, in a South-Easterly direction. Due to the closeness of their formation, (that is that they were either overlapped or touching) at first glance I thought I was watching two massive birds of prey cruise overhead, however formation 1 converged into a diamond configuration and formation 2 opened-up with breathtaking precision. They had no lights and were obviously thin profiled as they appeared to disappear quickly as I chased after them across the green outside my home. They flew individually as diamonds not squares, i.e. across their corners. The closest known stealth aircraft to these would be the BAe Taranis, however there were no notches out of the rear section and I do not think for one moment that even if they had built so many of them, they would not be testing them over a busy town of 100k people, in such proximity to each other. The fl! ight characteristics were such that they would have knocked each other out of the sky. As for speed, they didn't hang about but could not have been doing much more than 350mph. After this, the helicopter turned about and crossed the sky overhead in an easterly direction. The helicopter had 2 - 3 spot lights fitted to the aft of the main fuselage pointing straight out, not down but nothing at the front was on. It continued to circle overhead for some time. As well as being an aviation enthusiast, I live 10 minutes from Gatwick Airport directly under a helicopter corridor for both military and civilian craft. I often see Apache Longbows, Chinooks, MD 902s of the police and air ambulance (for whom I work) and Agusta executive helicopters. As a musician and sound engineer I can easily recognize the specific sounds of the aforementioned aircraft and identify them long before visual contact. So much so I can be outside with a video camera ready to film the Longbows as they come over as I can hear them approaching from miles away. It is important to stress that as the fleet of UFOs flew overhead the only noise that could be heard was that of the Lynx, which also sounds similar to the Puma at that altitude but quite different from a Merlin. The helicopter sighting made this week's local newspaper wherein a former soldier believed it was a Chinook by its sound as he didn't see it and was clearly mistaken, since other non-qualified witnesses could see it only had one main rotor. Its presence was a mystery according to the paper as nobody else had witnessed the UFOs that the helicopter was clearly monitoring. It is quite possible that people may have been so distracted by the chopper, that they mistook the fleet of UFOs for birds and paid no attention. Fortunately, I have excellent vision. Too bad I could not get to my phone camera quick enough to capture the UFOs, though I did manage to record the lynx. The footage appears darker than it actually was but then a little cloud contributed to the quickening night sky.",2013-07-05T00:00:00,,

I was having trouble falling asleep because at the lake near my house people were shooting off fireworks because it was the day before Memorial Day.   There are skylights in my room that are angled at 45 degrees so while I was lying on my side I was staring out one.  I can usually see aircraft towards the top of the window flying around but it’s just planes and such.  While I was staring out the window a pencil shaped object that had lights on it went flying by.  It was close to the ground and traveling very fast.  It made no noise and was going in a straight line from east to west.   I do not do drugs or drink which is why I am very confused about what I saw.   I did further research about UFO’s in Old Lyme and found out a similar story that described the same craft I saw which took place five years earlier.

We noticed an orange cylindrical comet shaped object traveling across the sky at a high rate of speed (much slower than a shooting star but about twice as fast as International Space Station), traveling from East to West 265 degrees magnetic.  Object was losing altitude and a orange tale was noticeable, tale increased in length (Est. 10 mile long tail) as it approached the far west skyline.  Approximately 20 degrees off the western horizon object stopped in sky and ejected 2 orbs then ejected an additional 2 orbs for a total of 4, they were very bright and would move in different patterns from a triangle to a horizontal straight line pattern slowly ascending then descending. We watched this activity for about 7 minutes when they slowly disappeared.  I did take some pictures of this event, two of the pictures are somewhat skewed due to me moving the camera, all objects were perfectly cylindrical.  I also attempted to take video with my I phone but it locked up because it was processing pictures.  The video is short but shows how objects were moving in the sky, and pictures clearly show arrangement of objects. My wife and I witnessed a similar event last year in Centerville OH, but our observation time was cut short due to the many trees and buildings in the area.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,39.5327,-84.2901

As I approached the hill at the end of their street, I noticed lites rising above the tree line that borders Prettyboy resevoir, one by one, the lights rose up slowly, strategically in a manner unllike  familar aircraft maneuver.  They were uniform in color, shape and size.   These amber colored lights were at least 50x larger then the biggest star visible to the naked eye and as bright as car headlights set on high.  They were staggered in their allignment and some of the lights hovered and appeared to wait as others that were observable through the trees slowly rose up to complete the formation.  I would aproximate that there were at least 15 crafts visible and hovering above the trees, but it was also dawning on me that this was not a normal occurence and you just don't see things like this unless you are watching a Will Smith movie!!  I was in panic mode now. I quickly backed down the street and into my parent's dive way. Barefoot and tripping over myself I stumbled into my parent's house.  Breathless and in broken English I tried to explain what I had just witnessed.  Better yet, I talked her in to coming back out with me so that I could show her firsthand.   We arrived at the spot where I had seen the crafts and two were still visible. I suggested we drive around the reservoir to see more.  At this point we did notice the sky was bright pink and we both felt cold electrical charges though out our bodies.  After a half hour or so I turned around to take my mother home. As we approached my parent's street I commented on how I was feeling that cold, electrical feeling again, only it was even more pronounced. My mother responded and told me not to freak out but there was a good explanation for this.  There was a craft directly above my car!  It was at this time I saw an amber glow outlining my car.  To the right of us we saw 15+ crafts hovering above my parent's house. Just as before, only this time I had a witness, and better yet, I wasn't alone!!  Both, my mother and I have had a long history of unusual happenings-though never something this big or tangible. By the time we arrived back to my parent's home, all the crafts had vanished, that quick.

A friend and I were driving west down I-80 passing the 355 intersection, and as I was driving I stated how weird that 3 airplanes were flying so close forming what appeared to be a triangle to which my friend exclaimed ""those do not look like airplanes"".  As we approached closer, I noticed there were 5 bright glowing red circles high up in the sky, but not as high as an airplane.   My friend tried to take photos and video with my iPhone 5 but they were not coming out...I had to turn around and see if the lights were still there. I exited Lincoln highway and turned back around heading east on I-80.   The lights were still in the sky, in the form of a triangular shape, parrallel with the ground in the same manner an airplane would be flying.   As risky as it was, I had to pull over on the highway to take photos and attempt a video (only one light was left at this time).  I was trying to figure out exactly what these lights were and I immediately thought of lanterns because they were glowing...but they were moving in sync and in form which boggled my mind.   Here's the weirdest part, I have seen these lights before in 2006 in Tinley Park.   I used to be a big believer in UFO's and have always looked towards the sky, but over the years I have no longer cared as there are no answers.   I am only reporting this for due diligence. Whatever the lights were, it was either a clever trick using lanterns or something that is beyond what we will ever know.  I want anyone reading this to know that I have a witness,  I called the non emergency police to see if there were any other reportings, I have (sadly) bad photos and video, and I was compelled enough to turn on my hazards and pull over on a busy highway to try and document this.  If it's someone playing a trick, they need to be caught, and if not, then it can only help.  I have become very rational since 2006, and I wanted to view these objects to come up with the most rational answer that I could, but what I have posted is all I can say.  The most important note is the the lights were the exact same lights I happened to witness in 2006, and appeared traveling across the sky.  It appeared the first 6 lights formed almost a ""flock"" if you will and disappeared, leaving one light behind that I was able to record.   I want people to know I am not looking for fame, attention, money, I just felt it was my obligation to report this and have it documented somewhere for someone who still cares.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,41.5129,-87.9605

Today I was on my 2nd floor balcony observing the very display of numerous stars over Austin, where city glare and haze limit observable stars to a dozen or so every night. This morning at 5 AM I was viewing the eastern sky with large 10 power binoculars when a star of the second magnitude (brightness) appeared to be blinking with reds and blues in addition to its white light.  It was at 100 degrees East, elevation about 45 degrees, and with the binoculars it was like the thing I reported to your site about a week ago.  I took some clumsy videos that time, but was afraid I had taken photos of lights in the parking lot below my balcony, and because there were only short ""views"" of the supposed UFO lasting only moments during a long blank video, I did not edit or forward the videos. This morning, however, I made nine videos, and was able to zoom in with my 15 power optical lens and capture many seconds of continuous video images of the UFO blinking red, green, brown, orange, white, blue, and mixed colors.  I was forced to hold the camera in my hands, so the UFO seems to be jumping and zooming around, but that's due to my jiggling hands. What it did do was appear as if it were a blinking white star, but suddenly it would become an round image, as if it were holding up a red, brown, green or orange shield in front of itself.  The apparent disk shielding the UFO was solid color, or occasionally a dull color rimmed with red or orange.  It rapidly changed appearance, with the ""shield"" image seemingly closer and larger than the hidden image that seemed to be behind it.

Corrected version below. Reported to:  http://www.nuforc.org/  on July 5th 2013   On July 3rd 2013 at or about 9:45 p.m. I was watching fireworks from my yard on the North side of my garage. I live in Crestline, Ohio. As I watched the fireworks display at the local High School from my yard I noticed what I thought was even more fireworks out of the corner of my eye, through the tree limbs and leaves to my right. As the Glow of these extra fire works became more noticeable for some reason, I began to watch them or as it turned out to watch it. I observed a large glowing object with a fluctuating orange semi structured, moving orb like craft. I call it a craft because it was definitely under intelligent control. The object left the obscured view from the trees and leaves and showed itself to be moving slightly slower than a small private plane and as the object entered clear sky after a short light misty rain, an orange spherical like object with a fluctuating tail, resembling a rocket engine exhaust flame, slowly navigated from the eastern sky at maybe 3000 ft about the lower altitude of a small private plane. I estimate the size to be similar to the size of  a small Cessna at that altitude coming from the direction of  north Mansfield, Ohio; as this orange slow comet like object,  with a flickering orange tail approached the center of the village of Crestline the craft made a gentle course correction to due north towards Cleveland from the east to west trajectory the craft had been on.  When the craft was directly overhead there was no sound from any jet engine or a prop. In fact there was no sound at all. It seemed to me only a helicopter could go that slowly and not fall out of the sky but there was no pressure wave from any rotors. And helicopters don't usually glow orange and have a flickering definitely orange tail. This all happened with in the space/time of about 5-7 minutes and the craft gradually and gently increased it's altitude, disappeared into the northern night sky seemingly on its way to Cleveland.  This object was so unusual it drew my attention to it, I have never seen anything like it in the night sky other than a very distant meteor but meteors do not change course and usually have a bluish cast and remain in one trajectory. I have no idea what this object was. I do think this observation merits reporting because of the uniqueness of the circumstances. Make of it, what you will, perhaps more sightings of this object will come to light near the same date and time and geographical location. For me it will remain a UFO for the time being. I do not drink or use drugs. I was sitting on a lawn chair in alight misty rain watching the fireworks display when I noticed the object.

The neighborhood kids were gathered for a game of ""kick the can "" when suddenly a burnt orange sphere around 3 feet in diameter appeared silently gliding about 4 or 5 feet above the power lines.  It was moving so slowly that we were able to walk and follow it down the street.  It paused above an intersection that had a large vacant lot on one corner and a small number of houses on the other corners.  I observed within the sphere what at the time I thought was burnt orange smoke swirling within the globe emitting a light that did not illuminate any of the surrounding area.  I also noticed in the center of the sphere was appeared to be a turning disc that reminded exactly of the disc on the old electric meters of the time.  We followed this disc giddily as children do, but after it paused it seemed we just as suddenly began to fear it for some reason and! all ran home to our own homes.  I told my folks, of course, they didn't believe me. After that experience I began seeing UFO's for the rest of my life.  Particularly through the rest of my childhood.  I had my last encounter in the area when I was 19 years and was preparing to Nam.  I've also seen formations of them; which was witnessed by many high school friends.  I do not want to diverge topics, so I'll return to the sphere. When I was 15 y/o I was helping a friend as he was flagging for a crop duster in the early predawn hours.  We were west of town and noticed the same type and color of sphere again, but this time it was at a distance of 1/4 mile or so and appeared larger that the one that was hovering over the power lines.  It astonished me because it appeared to be, at least, 6 feet in diameter from that distance.  It appeared to setting down in a gulley, but we could not investigate because we were needed to assist the crop duster. I don't know if this relates to the fireballs you've described, but it's closest to any comparison I've ever heard.  I hope this has some relevance for you, so I wanted to share it.  I am now 65 y/o and of all my experiences this is the one that has dogged me every day for all these years. Thanks for your tireless work. ((name deleted))",,32.7484,-104.4359

My son was in his room, and I was in my room and I realized that there was a constant roaring noise similar to an airplane engine, but it appeared to be hovering over our apartment building.  I noticed that this sound was right over the roof and had a duration of 2 minutes.  It would then just abruptly stop, (I didn't hear any trailing of sounds, it would just stop).  The sound would come back after around 10 minutes it did this 3 times.  My dog's hair stood up on the back of his neck and he would not run to the window to see what was going on, he was clearly on alert.  My son came out of the room shaken, as was I and we surmised that it could not have been a helicopter nor a plane flying low because the sound was a constant loud engine sound directly above our heads n! ot like a plane totally indescribable, nothing that I truly have ever heard.  I shared this with a friend in another state, who texted me the next day to see if I had asked my neighbors if they had heard what my son and I had heard that evening.  I didn't want to seem cuckoo, so I didn't share my experience with neighbors.  I heard the noise again this evening on Thursday 3/7/13.  I am wondering if there is a coincidence of the fact that the woods have been cleared where I live and from the sky it my look like a landing field.  I know that what I heard that evening in those three intervals was not man made as well because the sound was too close and the noise stopped abruptly after a length of 2minutes of roaring.  The event lasted about 30 to 40 minutes.  I do believe then as I do now, that my son and I had encountered a UFO over our apartment building as we are on the top floor.

You are dropped off in the woods at night with just your pack and sleeping bag.  As I lay looking at the sky, a variable number of different colored orbs appeared in the sky at a relatively high altitude.  For hours, I watched as the objects sped up, slowed down, maneuvered around each other.  The objects exhibited different colors and appeared to change colors.  These were red, green, blue , yellow but I never recall seeing white.  Being alone didnt bother me as they seemed a great distance and rather ""playful"". On Saturday after the solo campout, all new OA candidates must remain silent until the evening meal.  At that meal, one of the adult participants at my table started talking about the lights he had seen in the sky the night before.  He said he was an air traffic controller at the Ardmore, Oklahoma airport and that it was unlike anything he had ever seen.  This started a conversation that involved many of the overnight campers who had witnessed the same light show. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",,,

At first I thought it was a meteor due to its very high speed.   The rectangle travelled in a southeast direction, disappearing over tree tops in approximately five seconds.  The rectangle was very large given its elevation, measuring approximately 3 inches.  Later that evening a Boeing 747 Dreamlifter flew across the same space.  Its elevation was much lower than the rectangle.  I measured the 747 at one-half inch, the diameter of the Moon.  The rectangle covered the same distance as the 747 in a fraction of the time as the latter. I could not detect any sound from the rectangle.  Even though unlit it was observable against the clear night sky, possibly reflecting city lights off its bottom surface.   I believe the rectangle was flying at least 3 times higher from me than the 747.  Given the estimated lengths of each, the rectangle at that elevation would have ! been about 18 times larger than the 747, at 235 feet in length.

Our house is on high elevation in Lorton. We overlook the Mason Neck area. We can see everything from 1-95 freeway to South East Lorton, all the way out to the Potomac River.  Left to right in that line of sight are the areas of Ft. Belvoir Army Base, to Mason Neck/Woodbridge area on the right.  It's about a 5 mile distance to the river. Tonight was an overcast evening.  I was watching TV with my husband and I looked out the window that faces the river and saw what I thought was at first a reflection.  I kept staring at it, wondering why it looked like Christmas lights, because the roof of the house behind us isn't that high (and it was July!).  These red lights reflected in the mirror behind me as well. We both got up to check it out, went out on the deck and saw what appeared to be a formation of lights over the area of the Potomac River.  There must have been 2 dozen at first, and slowly as we watched, they all blinked off until there were none. The lights were red, sometimes white, all traveling left, right, and up (and sometimes slightly downward). Some blinked brightly, others stayed red.  I told my husband, I felt like I was looking at the milky way, but it was impossible because we never see more than a few stars at night around here, and with the overcast skies, it didn't make sense.  But that is what I could compare it to. I ran inside to get my phone and was able to get one picture. You can see about 9-12 lights above the roofline when I over-expose the image in photoshop.  I took 3 videos, only one slightly turned out.  It's totally black except towards the end of the less than a minute video, where you can see a few red lights.  I'm going to see if I can take it into my video software and lighten it up. After the lights went away, we watched an airplane fly in the same area, horizontally, right to left, then turn and fly right over our house.  I caught most of that on video as well.  We live near the flight path of Ft. Belvoir, but rarely do these planes fly at night, and they usually don't go over our house, but stay on the other side of 95. Coincidentally (?) police helicopters flew over our area for the 20 minutes afterwards that I was out and about.  That's not unusual, seeing as we live along the i-95 corridor, in the busy suburbs. I don't know what we saw. It could have been a wedding that released chinese lanterns. I've actually never seen those lanterns in the sky before, but there is NO breeze tonight at all.  It's hot and still and humid, so I don't know why they would be moving all over if they were lanterns. Just my opinion. We are both 42 year old professional people with a family.  I am well known in the community.  That's about all I'm willing to put in writing.",2013-07-22T00:00:00,38.69152580645161,-77.20670322580645

UFO Sighting Report  On July 3rd, 2013 at approximately 10:30 PM, I was gathered with 4 other family members in Hixson, Tennessee after viewing the fireworks display provided by Camp Columbus.  It was an overcast evening and the display was inspiring.  The flying objects that we could not identify were southwest from our vantage point on the tent camping site 93 of Chester Frost Park. Two were on the same plain of approximately 40 degrees up from the horizon and one was higher at approximately 45 degrees.  The sun had gone down about an hour earlier so it is possible that the objects were reflecting the twilight.  The first thing that appeared odd to me was the uniform brightness.  Their color was also a uniform glowing orange.  There was no reference for distance but it appeared that the higher orb was at a greater distance.  It was stationary but the lower two were closer together and moved erratically as if re-positioning very easily.  I was watching very closely and my son in law was wor! king on getting his phone to take a video.  He could not see the objects on his phone display but he did record video where they might be found on a computer monitor.  I believe that the smoke from the display passed between the lower objects and our perspective but others in our party say that they instantly disappeared.  We all agreed that it seemed that the objects were admiring the fireworks display.",2013-07-05T00:00:00,35.1705,-85.2095

No idea what was piloting this object.   I was sitting in my backyard keeping my husband company while he cleaned up his tools after working on our back deck when I saw the object.  My husband did not notice the object as it passed above because he was bent down picking up tools. At first, I thought what an odd firecracker flying way to low down, but I quickly realized this object was Not fireworks of any type.  It caught my eye when this bright yellowish-white flying Sphere ball of light with what appeared to be a tail or trail coming out the back of the object, the tail or trail coming from behind this object was not as uniform in shape as the sphere but appeared to be part of it, as it passed right over my house,  It was completely silent and unusually slowly moving (coasting) at a low just above my rooftop level but just below the height of the tallest evergreen tree it flew by heading SE.

As we were talking she said to look up at the shooting star. As I looked up the object did infact look like a shooting star but then it started to glow even brighter and looked like the back end of the object had caught on fire. I quickly got out of my car because the first thought I had was that it was a plane that had caught on fire since we live pretty close to the airport. As I started to pay more attention to the object I realized it was moving at an unbelievable speed. It crossed the sky almost in the blink of an eye. I hurried up and took my phone out and began to video tape it. The way the object cut through the sky was unlike anything Id ever seen before. Then as it began to slow down another bright white object came into view as! well as 3 others. The original object shot up in the sky higher than the others did and just hovered there. Then my eyes shifted to the remaining 4 objects. They started to make a Y formation. One at each end and one at the intersecting point. They stayed in this formation as the other just hovered above them. I believe they were in it for no more than 5 to 8 minutes. As this was happening one of her neighbors stopped on their way home and observed it with us. As we were watching the formation it seemed to come together but my attention was drawn to the top object as it started to drift down towards the ground. We watched it for as long as we could till the tree line covered it. I have never seen anything like this. Not the speed, movements, formation, or the brightness of these objects ever in my life. About 10 minutes after we noticed several airplanes and helicopters in sky in that area as if they were looking for something. I also watched the way those planes and helic! opters moved and their speed. It was not even comparable to ho! w fast a nd smooth those objects moved around the sky.

I was a young boy between 9 and 10 years of age, residing in what is called the Westgate area of Metairie, Louisiana.  I believe the Parish is Jefferson County at that time.  Our family lived on the Metairie side of the street, while Kenner was on the other side. My dad was working as a Buyer/Purchasing Agent for The Boeing Company supporting NASA on the early Saturn Rocket and Apollo space programs at the Michoud Assembly Facility. Anyway, I remember my dad was reading the newspaper that I believe was the ""New Orleans Times Picayune.""  Dad told me a newspaper article said that one of the Pegasus Satellites would be visible in the sky that evening.  This was incredible, because I was so fascinated with all that was going on with the US Space Program and had many Vernher Von Braun and astronomy books.  I was so excited about the news of this Pegasus Satellite that would be visible in the evening sky, that I ran over to my neighbor buddy's house to tell him about this news.  We were so excited about this, that we were out early in my back yard looking up in the dark clear sky before this satellite was to appear overhead. While we were waiting to get a glimpse of the Pegasus Satellite, all of a sudden two circular illuminated objects flew slowly directly over our heads.  The best description that I have, is they were flying in a staggered formation and looked like two circular illuminated objects, illuminated just on their outer perimeters, and there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Their distance or altitude to be between 300 and 500 feet.  The direction of flight was from right to left as we were looking directly to the backyard.  We were so astonished that we ran in the house to tell my dad, he laughed about it, although my mom went outside to look and the objects were now gone.   This experience that I had as a young boy has bothered me for years, because of time gone by can cause uncertainty in believing, and as I have always wondered if any other residents of Metairie or Kenner had made any recorded reports of UFOs.   I figured because of the ""New Orleans Times Picayune"" newspaper article that many residents had to be out looking in those evening skies, someone may have seen these objects too. I do not know which Pegasus satellite we were looking to see at the time, as there were actually three that were launched to study micrometeoroid densities for the early Apollo Space program.   My research tells me that the three Pegasus satellites were launched between February 16, 1965, and July 30, 1965… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

These are the events that I remember, as time may have clouded out other information, this is what happened to my cousins, friends and myself all in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania as I can remember.  I use lived in the town were the movie Ground Hog day was filmed.  In fact, as a kid, I use to play in the same park where they filmed the movie. As kids aged 8-14, growing up in that time frame and area, we spent a lot of time out doors.  In fact, we were outdoors crazy.  Hiking, camping, hunting, and playing were our normal activities.  We were very much in tune with our surroundings.   One day, while out hiking in our little group, we were returning from a long hike and about a mile from home. We noticed in the sky 3 black, dark looking clouds.  These clouds did not look normal to us and in fact, bothered us.  The sky was clear, except for these three black clouds about a quarter of a mile away, or at least they looked like clouds from our vantage point.  They moved in a very odd way, not really floating it seemed, like they were looking for something in unison, sort of back and forth. In only a few moments after observing them, we ‘felt’ like we were being watched.  It bothered everyone in the group to the point that we got scared and ran into an old concrete, abandoned building nearby.   We never left that place for a long ! time, fearing something was out there observing us. We ran home sometime later.  Those clouds were very strange, in that it was very windy out and they just did not move like normal clouds would, but stayed in a certain area in the sky.  The only thing around there was a gravel pit, old coke mining ovens and a nearby military school/base. All of us lived near this military base/school.  Soldiers marched around and sometimes they held live Howitzer cannon firing exercises.  There were, it seemed like UFO reports in the news daily back then. One night, I was sitting outside on a very hot night. It was clear out with stars visible.  I sat for some time and started getting that feeling I was being watched, again.  This time I looked up and saw three lights rotating in unison and in different colors, red, blue, and white directly above me. About as half the height that airplanes traveled, but these lights, never moved, just rotated around.  I became nervous and went inside and hid.   On another night, one of my cousin’s and I decided to camp out in the field behind his house. Again, later that night, we felt we were being watched and became very nervous and decided to go to the porch and try to sleep.  Within a few minutes after settling down on the porch a very bright light was noticed at the edge of the roof over the po! rch.  We ran into the house. The dog was barking like crazy, his sister wanted to know where the bright light was coming from as it penetrated everywhere it seemed.  We heard a scraping sound outside, like something had scratched the side of the house.  After that we don’t remember much of what happened.  The next day, we remembered only the noise against the house and there was a huge, long scratch along the side of the house. On another occasion, my cousin was playing baseball in that same field behind his house. He said a saucer type craft came over the hill behind his house and toward the field that he and some other kids were playing in. It did not stay long though.  Over the years, I have had very strange things happen to me with things like ESP events, involving my father’s passing away, another was a car crash I was involved with and more, much more.  Also, there was a feeling of being observed or followed for years thereafter.   I also know many people who have seen or know people who have encountered crafts and beings.  It was like it was meant to be that I meet these people for some reason.  It was very odd how all of it came about.  There is more to all of this than can be wrote here.

I suddenly saw a huge, glowing, white, oval, object pass over our heads and out of sight in less than 2 seconds.  The object was easily twice the size of two houses....easily.  It is difficult to judge how high it was in altitude.  If pressed I would guess that it was very low to the ground as it was so large and out of our sight in seconds.  The object made no noise....not even the sound of something pushing through the air. In approximately 30 seconds (which seemed like and eternity) my friend said: ""Did you see that?""

We were aboard the USS Boston CAG-1, a heavy cruiser in the Pacific ocean about 10 days out from Panama enroute to Hawaii and then ultimately Viet Nam.  I was an e-5 fire control technician in charge of the 5"" gun radar which was a Mk 25 mod 3.  It had a range of 100,000 yds. with a plus or mines 10 ft accuracy.  I had been in Viet Nam in both 1967 and 1968 and was the radar operator and range spotter.  I had experience tracking all targets both surface and air. It was after work hours and a group of fire control techs were up on the o-7 deck lounging around when I noticed a light off to our port side (south) and assumed it was a passenger plane going to Hawaii.  My assumption was such because of the light that I figured could only be from the windows of a plane.  Since there were not many targets out in the middle of the ocean I wanted to track it to check the radars function ability.  Myself and two others climbed into the director and the rest of the men departed below decks.  It took three men to work the director.  A pointer, a trainer, and a radar operator.  I was the radar operator, which was my usual station. We trained left and visually picked up the contact and and when it was locked into the radar, I ordered it to be ""kicked in"" to automatic track.  The director did just that and I was then observing it through the range finder as well as on the radar screen. Due to my experience I could tell that the ""plane"" or object had a very high rate of speed.  It was at a range of 20 to 30 thousand yard out (I forget just exactly) and so I called down to the plotting room below decks and asked the technicians there to put it on the computer and give me a speed.  The technicians there were playing card at the time.  I asked for the speed several times and there was no response at first.  I was then asked what I had up there.  I responded that we were tracking a plane that seemed very fast and when I again asked for the speed he informed me that the speed indication was ""pegged"" or at maximum.  That would have indicated a speed over 2800 miles an hour. I went back to a visual fix through the range finder and the object went from a horizontal to a vertical aspect without any arc what so ever.  It then accelerated with such ferocity that the motor drives of the director actually screamed or roared to keep up.  It was such a noise that I actually lifted the deck plate I was standing on to see if they were all right.  The optics of the range finder had gone 90 degrees so fast that I could not view them any longer so I just watched the radar screen as the target went to 100,000 yards straight up over the ship.  It maintained an auto lock through the entire time and then just went out of our range.  The time from the abrupt directional change until it was out of range was a fraction of a second. I made a subsequent call to CIC (combat information center) to see if there were any ship (carriers) in the vicinity and was informed that we were alone.  I did this because anything with great speed  would not have the range to be out here.  The fellow I talked to had no contacts, either surface or air, and so we shut down the director and called it a night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Frightened by the eerie lights, she tried to speed up, but they stayed with her no matter how she adjusted her speed.  After maybe 5-6 minutes, they zipped off so quickly, she didn't see exactly where they went.   My mom has passed on, but she told me this story right after it happened in 1969, I think.  She never talked about it much, as she was very religious, and wasn't prone to believe in aliens and UFO's, but I had her repeat the story to me shortly before she died.

It was about 11:00 on a summer night when I parked in the parking lot of the club, walked across the dark lot and looked up, and saw lights in the sky.  There were six white lights flying in vee formation at a very great altitude, like satellites, which I had seen many times in Arizona.  They came up over the hill of the horizon, and flew towards the ocean. There was a light at the tip of the vee, but missing one light at the end of one arm of the vee.  They were bluish white, like medium bright stars, and they made no sound, and flew halfway across the arc of the sky in only about ten seconds.  Suddenly I felt ecstatic and began to leap up and down with my arms outstretched.  They blinked off and vanished all at once. At that time I assumed that they were six separate objects.  In those days there was no talk of giant vee shaped craft.  It didn’t occur to me that anything could be so large but I was still puzzled as to how they could fly in such unwavering precision.

I believe this is one of the first documented triangle sightings.    I had a witness.  My friend and I came in contact with not one but two ufo on the same night within an hour of each other.  One of the UFO’s came within 3-4 feet of where we were standing. We were able to get an extremely good view of the object.  Doesn’t  this fall under the category of a close encounter of the 2nd kind?   The experience lasted approximately 10 minutes, it was way more than just seeing lights in the sky – there is absolutely no doubt the two craft were working in tandem.  The account can be documented because there was an article in the local newspaper the next day.   My friend and I  have maintained contact over the years only because this was such a terrifying and profound experience we have to contact each and talk the event over  from time to ! time.   We would gladly take a lie detector test.  I could take you to the exact area today.  Who knows – there might be trace readings of high than normal radioactivity.   In all my years of reading UFO reports not one time have I run across an incident where people came in contact with   two separate ufo’s on the same night much less come within a few feet of one.   I would think this information would be very valuable as scientific information within the ufology field. One other thing before I go on with the story – I posted my sighting here on the NUFORC website. I’ve gone back from time to time toreread it and now, as of today it’s no longer there and has been removed from the reports.  Why?  A friend and I had gone fishing one evening in July 1973 on a private estate located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The estate is located on land next to a tributary which opens in to the Chesapeake Bay. My friend’s parents were the groundskeepers of the estate. My friend and his family also lived in a house on the property. At about dusk we were sitting on a section of bulk head with fishing lines in the water, a portable radio playing near by, radio volume low. My friend's car was parked approx. 3-4 feet behind us with the passenger and driver's side doors open - the dome light inside the car was lit. Behind the car was an open field - no vegetation at the time - on the opposite side of the field approx. 50 yards was a wooded area. At one point I happened to glance over my right shoulder and noticed a light in the woods. The light was about the size, color and intensity of a large flashlight. It was moving through the woods waist high from the ground - moving at about walking speed. At the time, the first thing I thought was that my friend's father was walking through the woods with a flashlight. I didn’t pay it any particular attention and turned my head back in the direction of my fishing line and the water.Looking back on the event I realize now there would have been no reason for his father to be in the woods at that hour much less with a flashlight in hand. Approx. 1-2 minutes later I glanced back again toward the direction where I had previously seen the light - now I could see the light had left the wooded tree line and was moving across the field in a direct straight path towards my friend and I. I nudged my friend on the elbow and said: ""Look at that"". We could see the light was an orb about the size or slightly larger than a softball. Glowing a white/yellow color - not particularly bright. The shape of the orb was perfectly round. The light contained within. The surface of the orb was not smooth but had a rather fuzzy appearance. Just a perfect sphere of light. As it crossed the field towards us - it moved at about walking pace and was about waist high from the ground. No sound. It simply floated through the air in a very straight path. By now my friend and I had dropped our fishing poles and were standing up. We watched the orb approach his car.  It slowed down as it reached the trunk then slowly glided up to the middle on the roof of the car, stopped and hovered.   This thing was under intelligent control and seemed as if it was very interested in the car,  as if it were checking it out.    It seemed to be very curious. It hovered approx. 1-2 minutes then began to slowly move off to the right toward some nearby trees. When it reached the trees - it climbed to tree top level and moved over the top of the trees. That's where we lost sight of it. I can remember as we were watching the orb hover above his car literally a few feet away I could see my friend out of my peripheral vision - he and I were absolutely frozen with fear. We could not move. I realized at that moment this thing was nothing I had ever seen before in my life,  was under intelligent control and could probably do with us whatever it wanted t! o. After we lost sight of the orb we immediately got in his car and drove the very short distance to his parents’ house and told them what we had just witnessed. We left the radio and fishing gear behind.  About 10 to 15 minutes later my friend and I, his mother, father, sister walked out  into their front yard and looked up towards the sky. Now it was dark and you could see stars.  At not too high off an altitude we notice a dark triangular shaped craft with large white round lights outlining the two longest edges of the “V” shape.  The craft would travel at what appeared to be a short distance at an incredible rate of speed, literally stop on a dime then make sharp right angled turns. The G force alone would have killed a human.  We watched for a few minutes then eventually the craft moved straight up until we lost sight of it. The story can be documented as my mother called the local newspaper the next day to report what we had seen. I remember seeing a very small articl! e in the paper within the next day or so. I have not been back! to the sight since that evening however I have located the exact spot where this occurred on Google Earth.",2013-04-12T00:00:00,38.7937,-76.2941

In the clear night we saw a craft flying erraticly making instantaeous 45 degree turns caught our attention and landed approximately 75-100 ft on a small plateau infront of us.  The craft was dark black in color with red & green lights along the edge.   The size of the craft was 45-60 feet in length.  The craft was clearly visable to us and made no noise except for a slight humming mechanical sound.  The craft landed and had three thin legs, centerwise to the orientation of the 3 triangular legs it had a light that came out from underneath with a mechanical articulated 3 joint arm.  That seem to interested in the ground for some reason.  On the side of the craft had red and green lights emminating with a slight color alternating.   After 15 min my other whitness decided to approache the craft despite my best efforts to! stop him he moved toward the craft.  The commotion of our struggel seemed to be recognized by the craft and the craft immediately shown the light directly at myself and the other witness. At that point we both froze in our shoes.  Then the craft retracted the light and retrieved the landing legs folding inward and hovered rock solid in air with no support and completely stationary.   At that point we began to hear a very low frequency sound beginning to emminate from the craft.  This startled us so much and we ran to both of our cars.  The frequency of the sound emmating from the craft continued to increase both in freqency and amplitude until after a few minutes it was shaking the hood of both cars.  My car started immediately but my whitness truck would not turn over.  Both of our chests were vibrating as well from the noise of the craft.  The craft moved slightly forward (as though you had removed the parking brake on a car) then the craft slowly moved forward (east) then elevated in flight to a 45 degree angle and took off at a high rate of speed estimated to be 2-5K MPH continuing upward into the night sky and in less than a minute it was out of sight. The remaining evidence of what we saw that night was the indentation of the ground of the legs of the craft and some burnt grass where the light had shined on the ground.  My proximity to the craft and seeing it first hand in full operation has haunted me for all these years.  I don't know what is that we saw but it had to be an advanced aircraft of some kind.   Over the years I have researched various kind of aircraft flight systems and know the USAF was working on an advanced design similar to this in Albuquerque but what I saw was literly 50-100 years ahead of what we would be seeing today.",2013-04-12T00:00:00,35.4004,-106.1111

I pulled over and stopped and tried to see if I could see what it was shining down on my truck by leaning forward and looking up toward the light.  There was no sound associated with the light either.   As I start to look up, suddenly I'm outside of my truck on the drivers side leaning forward on the bed, holding the top portion of the fleet side bed, and looking up into a clear starry night.  There was nothing in sight.  I looked toward the cab of my truck and the drivers side door was open, the motor was off and the park lights were on.  I never stopped the motor or turned the lights off that I know of.  I told this to no one for many years fearing being labeled as crazy.   The people I did tell of this are ones that first told me of experiencing sightings of unknown origins or something similar.  I've tried to dismiss this by researching what it might have been.  Most recently, was seeing the meteor that flew over Russia and how bright it made the sky.  However, the light I saw was from a fixed position and came on like someone flipped a switch.  I've thought “Police Helicopter”, but there are none in that rural area, there was no sound, and it still doesn't account for my lapse of time from being in my truck to being outside.   I've struggled with this phenomena from that moment on wondering what it was and have yet to discover any information that could make sense of this event.  I sincerely hope you contact me with some resources that may help me unravel this mystery.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

At the time I was 19 years old, I lived Lozells, a suburb of Birmingham 2-3 miles from the city centre.  My place of employment was the 200 bedroom 3 star ‘Ladbroke Hotel’, Union Passage B2 4RX, I commenced employment there in June 1979 and left in January 1990. The hotel is now called the ‘Britannia Hotel’.  My first position there, as a school leaver, was as Hall Porter, when I resigned my position was Sales Manager, having held various managerial roles such as Reservations Manager and Front of House Manager. I had arranged to meet my cousin, Brian, at the Backyard Bar at the Grand Hotel, Colmore Row, Birmingham. I travelled to Birmingham City Centre on the 33 bus from Lozells.  It was a windy, drab dark early evening, I walked through Union Passage, the location of the ‘Ladbroke Hotel’,  late shoppers and workers going home were walking towards me, there is an overhead hotel signage canopy which obscures the skyline for approximately 15 yards, when the sky was visible I saw an enormous lit spherical shape in the sky, the typical flying saucer shape. Firstly, I was stunned and stared at the object for what seemed minutes, but probably was only seconds. My first inclination was to beckon to the people walking towards me, I said “Look at that”, there was no response from anyone, I repeated, “Look up there!”, still no response, I was getting frustrated that nobody was taking any notice of me so I kept repeating the request, eventually I realised that there was no sound coming out of ! my mouth. I followed the object, still trying to get people to look at it, but everybody ignored me. I walked through Union passage, and turned left at Union Street; I crossed the road and stood almost directly outside ‘Rackham’s department store, Cherry Street. The object had moved to directly in front of me but probably 1-2 miles away. I stared in disbelief, and then the glowing object moved rapidly to my left and out of sight. I returned to the Ladbroke Hotel to ask the on-duty Receptionist, Lin, if she has seen anything unusual also if any guests had reported the sighting, she said no and looked at me in disbelief. The following day (Wednesday) I was due to attend the wedding reception of my very good friends and colleagues, Gwynne and Richard at the ‘Yard of Ale’ public house in Birmingham city centre. I received a phone call at home from my cousin, Brian, he said “I’ve been trying to contact you, are you ok?”, I said, “I’m ok, I’m going to Gwynne’s and Richard’s wedding reception today, Brian replied, “It’s Thursday evening!”. I thought he was joking, so I turned on the TV and ‘Top of the Pops’ was on, (Thursday 7.30pm). I felt confused, stood there for a while trying to understand what had happened, I had lost more than a complete day and missed the wedding of my good friends. I called them to explain, but I could not explain, I was forgiven, eventually. Years later in 1991, I worked for ‘Hilton National Hotels’ as ‘Front Office Development Manager’. My base at the time was the ‘Hilton National Hotel’, Farlington, Portsmouth; this is where I met my future wife Mary, an American from Colorado. Mary was a guest at the hotel; I checked her in and showed her to her room, she was in a wheelchair having suffered a serious car accident in London. Within a week of meeting I asked Mary to marry me, she accepted and we moved to Rotherhithe London, moving to Ashby-de-la-Zouch a year later. I told Mary of my ‘Union Passage’ experiences on many occasions, back in 1992 the Internet was a relatively new concept, but Mary, being from USA, was already experienced, she Emailed a UFO investigator, I think from Leicestershire or somewhere fairly local, can’t remember his name, he was interested in my experiences and a meeting was arranged at our house in Ashby-de-la-Zouch. On the day in question Mary had organised tea and cakes etc. and I was eager to meet with the investigator. Everything was arranged, he was due to arrive early evening, I went upstairs to change clothes, sat on the edge of the bed, the door bell rang, Mary shouted up, “Steve, they’re here”. I cannot explain what happened next and still cannot to this day, I had ‘turned to stone’, I told Mary to send them away, I just could not move of the bed, I was embarrassed but there was nothing I could do, I felt controlled not to allow the conversation to take place, eventually they left the house, shouting up the stairs that they would come back with pleasure if I changed my mind, I never did, until now. I’m now 50 years old, looking back I realise that I had changed a lot after the experiences of 1983, nothing quite seemed the same again, I feel that I have had memory loss, time loss and a feeling of dread and intrusion, I have had dental problems but feel a total dread of anybody looking in my mouth, in fact it’s distressing for me to open my mouth wide. I cannot touch my navel anymore and since then digestive problems. When I’m alone I do not feel alone. I woke up during an appendix operation in 1985, I could feel the pain but I was unable to tell the surgeon, the same feeling I had when I saw the object in Union Passage. My friends recall incidents to me a few years after this experience; I cannot remember those years, I was responsible for 60+ members of staff but to me those years are mostly blank. I have never experienced a ‘UFO’ again, I have told family and friends about my experiences, some believe me some don’t, it doesn’t really matter to me if they believe me or not. When I hear the stories in the media and the debates on whether ‘we are alone in the universe or not’ I feel a great sense of satisfaction in knowing that ‘I already know’. Surely I cannot be the only person who experienced this in Birmingham in the early 80’s; I would be fascinated to hear from anyone who has had similar experiences during this time. Thanks for listening.  Steve Welsh",2013-04-12T00:00:00,,

A couple minutes later a light appeared above the eastern horizon.  I couldn’t determine the size of the object, nor approximate elevation.  But I can say it looked like elevation was increasing and it west travelling to the South-west. Aside from the size and elevation, this light or fireball looked like it was travelling about the same speed as the commercial airplane.  And by this I mean it looks like it would take the same amount of time for the fireball or light to fly across the sky as an airplane. I want to say it was more like a fireball because of the flickering yellow and orange light it was emitting.  The fireball was pretty big when it came over the horizon, but it appeared to either burn out, or exit the atmosphere.  I think it burned out though; it didn’t look like it was travelling fast enough to just pass through the atmosphere.  BUT, there was no sign of projection.  No hot air balloon would travel that fast, and it wasn’t burning any fossil fuels because it didn’t leave a trail of smoke.  All it did was float south-west bound for about a minute and a half before it completely burned out.  After it burned out there was still a floating silhouette of a sphere-like object, but only visible momentarily. While I was still looking for the object after it burned out, someone pointed back to the eastern horizon and there was a second fireball.  Travelling in the exact same path and it burned out at the exact same place.  There wasn’t really a timed gap between the 2 fireballs.  They were pretty simultaneous. I couldn’t figure out what was going on so I thought I would report it and hopefully someone will either tell me what just happened, or maybe my report could help someone else’s investigation.",2013-07-22T00:00:00,43.08378091286308,-79.10258340248963

At approximately 17:00:00 we observed what appeared to be a triangular formation of orange lights appearing from the south (S) and heading north (N).  The lights had a orange, flame-like glow and were low in the sky. Initially, we found this very disconcerting as we watched this formation slowly drift off to the N.  As the lights vanished out of sight another appeared from the S, this time lower in the sky, and we were able to observe that it was in fact a paper lantern.  I was able to zoom my camera (Nikon Coolpix P510, 42x optical zoom) on the object to confirm it was indeed a paper lantern.  However, I was not able to get a clear photograph of the object due to the difficulty of using autofocus on a moving target.

I live in an airplane flight  zone and close to a small airport, so lights in the sky is something I am used to. The reason this object or objects caught my eye was that it was July 4th and people were starting to light  off fireworks so I was looking around to which neighbors were lighting them off. The 3 lights were exactly the same distance apart the whole time I was watching them. They were about the same distance up in the sky as  the smaller airplanes are right before they land at the Kenosha Airport, just south of my house(about 5 miles away). They were not making a sound and then the left light(on the east side) slowly went out. It was not like a light switch being turned off, though. It almost seemed to fade out. The other 2 lights kept moving at the same rate of speed, the ! same distance apart for another 30 seconds and then the back right light(on the west side) went out the same way as the first. The front orange light was still on and moving at the same speed, same height for another 20 seconds and then that light disappeared. My friend and I  looked at each other and said what the heck was that. About 20 seconds after that, I saw a black triangular shaped object behind my friends head, about the same height, moving the same speed, making not a single sound moving north. I asked him if he could see it, but at the picnic table he was facing west and by the time he turned around and tried to look for it, he said he saw nothing. I got up from the table and ran across the street to my house to follow it, but after it went behind the trees in my neighbors yard to the east, I could not see it anymore. I am a very skeptical person, but I saw something I have never seen before in my life. The reason I thought it was more than one object was because! when I saw it at first, it looked like 3 objects moving toget! her in f ormation, but I could not see a separation of any material or a specific form that would have definitely made me think it was one object. When I saw it behind my friends head, all I saw was 1 triangular object which made me think I had seen 3 lights on the corners of 1 vehicle before they went out.

We were planning on spending the day at Wallis Sands state beach in Rye, NH, but due to the incredibly hot weather, traffic, and my overheating engine we decided to stop short of our destination and spend the day at the North Hampton beach.  For those of you not familiar with this area, it is on the border of Rye, and is far from the main Hampton strip which helps cut down on the crowds for a much friendlier environment. We arrived at approximately 2pm and spend the day in the water, and at the beach. As darkness and the July Fourth fireworks displays were approaching, we decided to walk North up Route 1A to find a vantage point which would allow us to watch both the Hampton Beach display, and the Rye display at Jenniss Beach.  The point we found is after a bend in the road which is 3/4ths of the way up a rock face overlooking a large majority of the New Hampshire Sea coast.  From this point the Salisbury water tower and Seabrook Nuclear facility is clearly visible.  According to Google Earth the nuclear plant is 5.72 miles at a 222.40 degree heading from the vantage point. The approach path the objects took was at approximately 210 degrees relative to our vantage point. Private properties began setting fireworks off at 21:00 (9:00 pm EDT) to accompany the municipal displays which were going on at the time and continued past 23:00 when we left the area to return home. Our attention was first drawn to the first set of objects when my girlfriend noticed that one of the fireworks over Hampton looked like it was burning frozen in the air. My initial though was that it was a flare or something that someone had shot off, but I realized this could not be the case because it was slowly rising from the horizon. We studied this object for a moment, and then to our surprise there was an additional one next to it as if they had come from the same place. The objects continued to rise, but they looked as if they were slowly picking up speed. They were at about a 35 degree angle relative to the horizon when they began to move forward. They looked as if they were rising with the same speed but they were slowly moving through the sky at a diagonal to us from South West, to North East over the water. After watching the objects move over the water and get further out, they began to rapidly gain velocity, and elevation. The objects became less luminous, and as they looked like they were about to leave visual range, they shot off at an increased angle of attack. As the objects left the point at which we acquired them at, the lateral distance between them increased as they approached different parts of the sky. As soon as we turned back to the fireworks, unsure of what we had seen, we realized that two more objects were already half way to the point where the last two had just disappeared and we watched the exact same process happen again. In both cases, it was identical objects, coming from the same point of origin, moving in an identical way, with each of the two objects going towards the same two points in the sky which the previous ones had moved towards. We watched the same process happen again (for a total of 6 objects) and then the phenomenon stopped for a while. In all cases the objects rose from approximately a 210 degree heading (between the nuclear plant, and the coast line) from where we were sitting. All objects looked like balls of red-orange fire, but as they approached, what looked like a tail from the movement became a defined triangular shape that could only be seen by the reflection of the light coming off of the leading vertex of the shape. As the objects moved, and were about to start the final acceleration, each time the visible triangular part would swing out parallel to our view point, and the faintly visible triangular body would become invisible to us. The only thing visible would be the ball of light until the object accelerated off. We decided to lie down on the rocks we were sitting on initially and after another 45 minutes I got a feeling that I should look. So I sat up to see four of the objects following a slightly higher angle of attack and still in the same group of two pattern as they were initially. From the size of the triangles, we were able to determine that the objects that were moving to the more northern part of the sky were significantly closer to us than the objects which were moving to the more southern point in the sky. I also noticed the higher angle of attack, and realized that over the past hour and a half or so they sky had shifted. The objects were going to the exact same points relative to the Milky Way as they were beforehand except they angle of attack was steeper to compensate for the rotation of the earth. I’m no astronomer so I have no idea what constellations can be used to pin-point the area where we lost line of sight, but it was about 2 to 3 hand widths away from a clust! er of four very dim stars on the lower half of the northern part of the Milky Way. The event repeated itself one last time before we decided to leave around 23:00 (11pm EDT). In all encounters the objects were identical, moved to the same place, in the same way through the same means. All objects were silent, made no noise, were of red-orange color, and flickered like a candle, or pulsating light in a storm. Upon returning to the beach from our vantage point to get the truck, we realized that because of the angle of vision that the bulk of the population had, it is unlikely that many other people were able to witness the event. The view was obscured by the fireworks and by a fog off the water at the beach. By the time the object would have been in unobstructed view, they would have been at a high enough angle and altitude that they could easily be written off as stars, or a satellite. Also, as a foot note, I was a 24 hour, three day per week manager at a local hotel last season. I have been around for a military air show at Peas AFB, and am familiar with the normal local air traffic. I have flown on many planes both commercial and recreational due to family circumstances, and I have never seen a civilian or military craft that would fit the description of what I saw tonight. I also have a passion for the Space Program, so I know this doesn't fit any man made vehicle that we currently operate.",2013-07-05T00:00:00,42.9317,-70.8427

I was sitting near Symphony Lake, under some pine trees. I had a clear view of the lake, and of the sky above the lake where the fireworks would be (there was a gap in the group of pine trees, with a direct view of the spot across the lake where the fireworks are set off). We were all looking up at the sky, waiting for the fireworks to begin. Before the fireworks started, I suddenly saw a bright red glowing light fly over the lake. For a moment I thought it was the fireworks starting, but quickly realized it wasn't. The reddish light appeared quite large and low in the sky. It appeared about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It appeared to be flying lower than an airplane would fly. The strangest thing was that the light pulsed, or glowed, in a slow and steady rhythm, completely different from t! he lights on an airplane or helicopter. It glowed bright, and then waned, and when it had just about disappeared, it would resume glowing up to a bright red, and then wane again. It flew in a straight path above the lake. It flew overhead a total of three times before the fireworks started. I overheard one person near me commenting on it, wondering what it was.  Then, I also saw a different light formation fly over the lake. These ones were different: there were two lights, a yellow light and a green light (yellow on the left, green on the right), and they appeared to be connected as if they were on a solid object. These lights were smaller than the red light, about the size of typical airplane lights. They flew without blinking or pulsing. They flew overhead twice before the fireworks started, and then once during the fireworks show, at which point several people around me were joking that “that plane is going to run into the fireworks,” and other people said no, it must be higher than the fireworks. I couldn't tell whether it was higher than the fireworks or not. Then, after the end of the fireworks, when everyone was walking back to the parking lots, I saw the yellow and green lights fly overhead one more time, over the road (a little lower than an airplane would fly).  This is not my first UFO sighting; I've had at least dozen UFO sightings in the Raleigh-Durham area in a little over a year. Most (but not all) of my previous sightings have happened when I'm driving at night.  Most of my previous sightings have also happened when I'm by myself, which made me question, at first, whether I was imagining things or not. Most of these sightings have been similar to what I saw last night-- strange colored lights flying in the sky, that don't look like airplanes or helicopters, and without any noise. I've also seen one ""black triangle"" with lights that hovered motionless directly over my car, and I've also seen white starlike lights moving in the sky (seen in daytime, and once at night). My first UFO sighting, in April 2012, was the one that scares and baffles me the most. I would be willing to discuss it over the phone. The sighting last night was the first one where I could verify for myself that other people were seeing and talking ab! out the same things I saw. I don't know what these lights are, or what it means, but at least I know that other people saw them too.",2013-07-05T00:00:00,35.78376197916666,-78.80133489583334

One of our daughters was looking up in anticipation and noted 3 moving lights in formation. When first observed, the lights were located to our southeast.  I at first thought they may be the headlights of a small plane since there are many that fly in this area. However, it became clear these were different and unique.  Approximately 10 minutes later a fourth light passed and a fifth passed approximately 10 minutes after the fourth.  All lights were similar.  There was a fairly strong westward wind and it was partly cloudy with the clouds travelling northwest.  The following is a summary of the observation.  Formation, speed and flight path:  When the 3 light formation first appeared, the lights were noted at about 45 degrees from vertical while facing south east and appeared to be travelling directly towards our location. For the fourth and fifth lights, the same pattern was observed. The 3 light formation may have been a vee, but with only three, this is likely an assumption although the middle one seemed to slightly lead the others. They remained close together approximately in the same position relative to each other as they approached us and travelled overhead. As they moved away, it appeared that the formation may have separated but the light intensity changed and this again may be as illusion.  It is hard to judge speed, although it seemed to be constant. I have observed many planes flying overhead and most commercial flights that are landing at PBI, can be seen travelling between 10,000-15,000 altitude and I believe their speed is much less that 500 mph as they ready their approach. The lights appeared to be of similar altitude but this is very hard to judge. Based on this assumption, the speed would be greater than the commercial flights by approximately a factor of two which could be over 500 mph. This is very hard to judge and is highly dependent on altitude. For example, I have also observed satellites and they do not appear to be moving rapidly, but due to relative altitude, they are in fact travelling much faster than a plane. The speed seemed constant and unwavering during the approach and while overhead. after they passed and were moving away, it is possible that the speed changed dramatically since the brightness  faded rapidly as though they were travell! ing rapidly away from us. However, this occurred in a very short observed distance so if this were the case, the altitude would have to have been increasing as they would be moving in nearly a straight line from our angle of observation.  This is unlikely. The more reasonable  condition is a change in intensity as described below. The flight path was straight from the southeast to the northwest with the potential change observed just before we lost view. For example, vision of one light ended well before the other two.  For the fourth and fifth lights, the same pattern was observed.  I was specifically looking for flight changes that would be difficult for any known aircraft but this was not observed. The speed seemed to be well within known craft and there were no observable changes in acceleration. Overall, with the potential exception of the anomalies towards the end of the observation period, no unusual flight information was observable.  Lights:  Each of the lights looked about the same,  although the intensity of light varied between the three each was constant to itself during the approach and while overhead. The one in front was the brightest and the other two  were close but slightly different in intensity with respect to each other.  The intensity of the fourth and fifth were similar but cannot be compared directly.  The lights were different than any plane light. The light was not a beam but was more of a glowing effect. The main light was golden yellow emanating from the center with a bright red perimeter that was concentrated on the front or lead end possibly half way around, however, with no clear demarcation point. The general intensity was much brighter than stars and similar to plane head lights until they began to fade after passing. The lights were beautiful and glowed in a consistent fashion providing the impression of a Christmas ornament. The intensity was the same upon approach and while overhead. The intensity lessened after they passed and the red glow became much less observable. While overhead, they appeared to be circular, however there may have been a slight ovality with the long end aligned with the travel path. This, however, is a guess in that the two colors may have been deceiving the eye. Also, the shape of a light is automatically assumed to be circular or spheri! cal.  After passing, the light intensity slowly faded and then changed dramatically when the angle was about 45 degrees. One light faded and extinguished from our view while the second and third remained possibly 30 seconds to a minute longer with each fading and finally disappearing.  The fourth and fifth light acted in similar fashion.",2013-07-05T00:00:00,27.285686301369864,-80.36344363992173

My first thought was that it was a plane, because it had clear red and blue lights similar to a plane.  But it was moving only vertically. My next thought was that it was some sort of remote-controlled alien spaceship toy, because it seemed in the stereotypical saucer shape even though the lights were only in a slightly curved horizontal line. I don’t think either of those options is possible, because it seemed much too big. It rose slowly straight up,  I saw it for less than three seconds and jumped up to turn the light off and get a closer look, but when I looked out the window, it was gone. I ran outside to see if it was still there, but there wasn't anything in sight, even though the sky was open and there weren't any trees or anything blocking part of the sky. I’m a firm non-believer in aliens, so this was bizarre for me to see and I don’t know what it could have been.  It was much too large to be a satellite.

In Oct, 1984 around 7:30pm while going to parent teacher meeting at Alvarado grade school in north valley of Albuquerque, NM, something very odd was experienced by myself.  Due to not enough parking in front of school I parked in the back side near the play ground.  As I was walking toward the classrooms suddenly there was something hanging in the air.  No sound at all, not sitting on any legs for feet, just hanging there and about 16 ft in diameter.  It was metallic with lights around the bottom in blue, yellow, red, green and purple.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing so I walked back toward the car and it disappeared.  Walking toward the classrooms again and there it was once more.  It was as if it was cloaked in some way that unless you were within so many (6) feet of it, it wasn’t there at all.  While standing underneath it I tried to reach up and touch it but it was just high enough that it was out of my reach so about 6 feet high.  The upper part of it had w! hat appeared to be blackened windows. Suddenly a man came out of my daughters classroom walking very fast toward me.  I figured he had just got finished with his teacher meeting and also wondered why he had on sun glasses in the dark. He also had on a black suit, white shirt with thin black tie. I got his attention right away by requesting him to look at this, what is this?  Right away I could tell he was very nervous and asked me, look at what?  I said look at this medal thing just hanging here. He said it’s nothing and I said yes it is something what is it?  He said it’s for advertising.  It flies around advertising. I said to him that no it wasn’t for that at all, there was no sound and no air so it wasn’t a helicopter or airplane and it didn’t have any feet or legs; it was just floating there and we had nothing that would do that.  Again I tried to reach up to touch it and he looked at the window and nodded. What was that about? I had no idea.  Then something happened to me and to this day I don’t know if I went into my meeting with my daughters teacher or not.  Actually I don’t remember at all how I got home, it seems that months and months are still missing from my mind. To this day I feel that this man knew exactly what this was and that he had in fact came in that thing to his meeting. Either this man was an alien himself or someone working with them.  Of course that’s just a very strong feeling I have and also I believe that UFO’s are always there, right in front of us but we can’t see them unless we get within so many feet of them or if by chance light hits them in a certain way.

A single yellow light appeared far off in my rear view mirror so I cut out the cruise control , lowered my speed and moved into the right lane waiting to be passed. I thought it was a truck with one light out but as it got closer I could see no other lights and now figured it was a motorcycle as the single yellow light was vibrating like a bike's light would at high speed on a highway. The light was now less than 100 yards behind me and it was still gaining on me and much brighter.  It made no attempt to move into the passing lane.  It was no longer acting like another vehicle, and I focused on the road ahead waiting for it's approach. As I glanced up to look in my mirror......it was gone! I looked in all my mirrors.....and kept looking for some sign, any sign, that something was indeed behind me. At first I though the vehicle had turned off it's light, and I was scared, but the more I looked, I could see no evidence of anything following me.  There was nothing there and it stayed that way until a couple of miles later when I arrived at the border crossing. I can't explain what I saw .....but I know what I saw ! I told the border agent my story and reported it to the Plattsburg State Police,  just in case a motorcycle had indeed gone off the road....but I'm having trouble believing that myself!   I'm a ((fifties)) yr old Canadian male, with no background in any paranormal anything what so ever.  Just a normal guy.",2013-04-12T00:00:00,,
Multi colored lights attached to saucer shaped craft at night,Stanton,KY,1990-06-06T22:00:00,disk,5-10 minutes,"Occurred : 6/6/1990 22:00  (Entered as : 06/06/1990 22:00) Reported: 3/18/2013 11:53:15 AM 11:53 Posted: 4/12/2013 Location: Stanton, KY Shape: Disk Duration:5-10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96651.html,"Multi colored lights attached to saucer shaped craft at night I am unsure as to whether you can use such a dated report or not but I will submit it anyway. The dates are approximate.  I can not even attest to the year with certainty. It was a late evening sighting, around 10-11pm.  My neighbor and I witnessed at least a dozen lights, of different colors. They moved slowly through the night sky as if part of a single large craft.  At first only the lights were apparent, not the craft itself. The lights were mostly blue but there were also red, yellow, green and a few white lights.  All of the lights were of approximately the same brightness and remained solid the entire time they were on (no blinking or similar).  They also seemed to be arranged haphazardly around the craft (no pattern). We observed the object for 2 to 3 minutes as it moved slowly across our field of vision in an approximately West to East direction.  It was then, that a bright white flash emanated from behind the craft.  We could clearly make out the silhouette of a smooth saucer shape.  After the flash, most of the colored lights began to go out one by one very quickly.  After about 10 to 12 seconds, all but 5 or 6 of the colored lights were out. It was at this time that I became aware of the sound from the craft.  It was very quite but not silent.  I am not sure if it didn’t make noise before the first flash or if I just didn’t notice it. My neighbor said later that he was unsure as well.  The sound it made was a kind of hum;  Similar to the kind of hum that some older electronics make.  I have since heard electric transformers (like the ones on telephone poles) make a similar noise. For the next 5 to 7 minutes, we watched as the craft apparently changed its direction very leisurely to the North West.  This was almost exactly away from where we were standing.  We observed two more flashes like the one I described.  Each time there was a momentary pause (for about a second) in the hum. We lost sight of the object as it moved away from us and descended behind a line of trees.  I estimate its length was around 25 feet long. Its height was approximately that of a two story house.  I feel confident in this estimate since I am familiar with the line of trees that it went behind.  They separate two fields that were used to graze cattle.  My friends and I sometimes used the field as a shortcut. I used the trees as a reference as it descended behind them.  Although it was night, the tree line is visible against the starry night.  Due to the hilliness of the ground, there was no way to see the bottom halves of the trees or the craft. Unfortunately, I am unsure of the exact date.  I was around 12 at the time, which would have been approximately 1990.  I think it was in the mid to late summer since we were outside without jackets and perfectly comfortable.  The moon was near full and the stars were plainly visible in the sky.  There were a few fluffy white clouds but the object was never near them. I believe the bulk of the sighting took place within a quarter of a mile away but I can’t say for sure.  The tree line that the object descended behind is at most a quarter mile away   I can’t say whether the object landed or not but it certainly flew below treetop level.

I do not know if they are extraterrestrial, but I do know that people honestly do see things they cannot explain. My sighting happened on a nice warm sunny day.  My girlfriends house was right next to a park and the fenceline was shared with the park.  I looked up as we were sitting outside and she was clipping her dogs hair. I then saw in plain sight a chrome looking egg shaped craft which was highly reflective and travelling at a high rate of speed. It was about the size of a couch and made no noise whatsoever.  It was slightly higher than a telephone pole in height and wasn't but about 50 yards away.  We both watched as it flew over the park and then continued on in a straight line until it disappaeared from view.

As it moved east it looked to have a burst of speed every time it changed color, then slowing down again. The light traveled about a third of the sky then just simply stopped and hovered for about 40 seconds.

The UFO immediately started hovering higher and moving away from my location at around 30 MPH and gradually built up speed and rose higher until it was no longer visible. 	After seeing the UFO, two of my friends and I were watching the skies for the UFO in case it returned.

There were six groups of them flying by that I witnessed. The first group were three orbs, glowing red. They seemed to flicker. There was no sound. They looked pretty low, I would guess maybe only a few hundred feet above. They were moving fast, way faster than the 10 mile an hour winds the weather report says for our area. As they moved closer to the east they seemed to fade but you could still make them out, we watched until they went too far to make out with the naked eye. The second group was another three orbs. The third group was three orbs as well. The fourth group was two orbs. The fifth group was two orbs. The sixth and final was a single orb. These all followed the same path, from west to east. They all moved about the same speed, although in the first group, one was moving out ahead of the others at a faster speed. We are all dumbfounded as to what this could have been. There was no sound. They were moving very fast. This event lasted about 15-20 minutes. I have witnessed lots of balloons, lanterns, remote planes, toy rockets, flares, fireworks, etc. and I can definitely state that this was not that. The only thing that might even remotely explain this would be some type of lantern, like the Chinese floating lanterns.

On March 29th, 2013, me and my girlfriend were driving north on I-35, just south of Moore, OK, when my girlfriend claims there was a motor cycle (single white light) right behind our car, she then claims it disappeared.  Almost right after she said that, a very chaotic, unecplainable event started.   After 10 years in the Marine Corps., I learned how to take detailed notes and reports, so thats what I did when I got home.  First, there was realy strange lightning all around us, but no thunder, and it seemed to be far away and at a high elevation.   Then, the lightning got lower, brighter, and closer to our car.  It was so bright, it was lighting up the whole sky.  But it looked different, unnatural, and was completely silent.  The next thing that happened was very scary, and the craziest part of this whole sighting.  The sky was filled with strange objects of different sizes and colors.  My girlfriend was so freaked out she almost wrecked the car.   There were multiple crafts with with three lights in a triangle shape and red lights in the center pulsating.  There were.  Small, bright white circles, that zigzaged through the sky. Some of the small white balls would zoom in, a big black cloud would appear, and the object would zoom away veey fast.  One object was really close and looked like about 5 oblong white circles right next to each other, and stoop approximately 15 feet tall.  There were HUGE dim white lights that moved slowly through the sky, and appeared to be 5 or 10 miles wide.  There was objects that looked like thunder but had only 90 degree angles and stayed lit for about 5 seconds.  There were bolts of lightning that kind of looked like jelly fish and moved slowly across the ground while they stayed lit for about 10 seconds.   Next, the aircraft's disappeared and there was a huge mushroom cloud that took up about a quarter of the sky, and a very loud but low and deafening rumble for about 10 minutes. And wind coming from it so strong! it almost knocked me over.  Then, everything ended and was qui! et. We t hen got back into our car and drove home.   The next day, there were the strangest clouds I've ever seen, followed by a tornado warning, not sure if a tornado actualy happened though, but in the same area we were at in Moore the night before.  That night, we saw the same strange lightning and about 20 of the same triangle shaped objects. They were go back and forth in the sky.  I showed the neighbors, and called my family. I plan on watching the sky tonight with hopes of recording them.   I got multiple videos last night, but really only one good one.  I would have recorded the events in Moore two nights ago, but we were so freaked out we dident even thing about it.  I have never before seen a UFO, and swear on everything I love that these statements are 100% true.  I don't know what's going on, but I need some answers!",2013-06-02T00:00:00,,

My niece, her husband and myself on night of July 4th observed strange lights in the sky.  First noticed a “diffused” area of light kind of in a bar shape.  My niece’s husband saw it first and thought it was headlights on a mountain side.  They had just moved in with us and he was not familiar with direction, the mountains where far to the west of the lights we were looking at.  When I noticed it I immediately thought it looked out of place went inside to get binoculars.  Upon looking through it at binoculars the object had changed from my initial observation, it was now three bright lights in a triangle shape.  I would compare the brightness to a commercial jet landing light.  I handed the binoculars to my niece’s husband so he could see; he then handed back to me and as I was looking one of the lights went out leaving two lights.  Shortly thereafter another light went out leaving only one light.! The lights where stationary or moving very slowly to the north away from us.  The lights varied in brightness over the course of the observation.  We observed the lights from approximately 12500 block south and 8000 block east, approximately 15 miles south-southeast of downtown Denver.  We were on top of Surrey Ridge in the Daniels Gate subdivision of Castle Pines were we have a complete view of the city.  Lights where straight north of our location, I would estimate just east of downtown or to the northeast of downtown.  If I made an educated guess I would say they where over Brighton, CO.  After looking through the binoculars for the second time I handed them to my niece so she could see them.  I then went up to our loft where I have a spotting scope (Celestron Ultima 80) to see if I could make out any detail.  The one light still looked as a single light I could not make out anything additional.  Object was still nearly stationary.  I did notice in the field of view co! mmercial jets flying past (heading towards landing at DIA) and! a helic opter.  However I noticed another group of lights to the west or left of the bright light.  These lights where much dimmer and varied in color, I would guess there were 6-12 lights, hard to say exact number because they where flashing off and on.  This object was also stationary.  Total length of observation was approximately 15-20 minutes at which time the lights disappeared.  Time was about 9:30-9:50pm mountain time.  I went back down stairs and looked through binochlers some more to see if I could locate objects, I did pick up the flashing colored lights and they were now northeast of our location.",2013-07-05T00:00:00,,

I have a BS degree in applied physics and worked 27 years as an aerospace engineer (flight and fluid mechanics) for the navy performing research and development testing of missile systems at the Naval Missile Center Pt Mugu, Ca. Standing in my lemon orchard in Camarillo, Ca, on Aug 2, 2002 10:30 p.m. to watch annual meteor shower.   No city lights, very dark. Facing eastward looking upward, extremely clear sky black as pitch except background of stars and moon at my back. to the west. Suddenly a craft with no lights and no sound moved rapidly from south by southwest to north by northeast across my line of sight . Would not have seen it since it was flat black against a dark background but it was faintly illuminated by the moonlight so there was enough contrast to see outline. Would not have noticed it except my eye caught the motion and I watched it traverse the night sky until it was no longer observable. The following are my observations  1) craft was controlled: smooth transition, constant altitude, constant velocity, constant direction  2) time to transit across my field of view: approx 15 seconds. velocity estimated above mach 12  3) approximate altitude: only a guess but I estimate 15,000 ft - 20,000 ft  4) size: very large (huge).  I estimate 200 ft - 300 ft length (minimum)  5) shape: concentric symetrical shape, flat undercarrige, beveled edges fore and aft rising to a flat upper surface (picture two inverted pie pans one smaller on top of the larger)  6) ratio of height to length: rough estimate 1 : 6  (no idea of top profile since I was looking at it broadside)  7) sound: absolutely none - silent  8) lights: none. totally flat black. barely illuminated against dark night background by reflected moonlight.  9) features: none that I could discern, surface appeared smooth  10) propulsion: not chemical, no combustion, no sign of heat or exhaust no sound  11) anamolies: extremely large, apparently frictionless motion, no sonic wave, no sound , no visable lights or leading edge surface heating,    Conclusion:  Observed  a UFO of unknown origin. material structure unknown, propulsion prossibly electromagnetic or gravity field manipulation, independent of aerodynamics, frictionless-no visible leading edge heating and no sound origin unknown..impossible to account for observation using known science and technology.

I came across it while putting my photos into my computer. I took the picture in Alberta Canada about 2005 I will try to describe it for you. It is a brown and white rectangular above a white V shaped cloud, there are two objects that look like meteorites, both have extended trails, one is traveling from left to right and the other from right to left they are quite far off in the distance and are hard to see. What I believe to be a UFO caught my attention because it looked like it was a cloud in the shape of a V and very white. It appears to not be moving because nearby clouds are not being disturbed. In the original picture there is a thick brown line above this cloud, but when I expanded it with the computer, the object is very visible, and this is what you see only half of the V is what looks like a cloud, but it looks like it is being produced by the UFO, the other leg of the V is a solid object. This object looks to be about 40 or 50 feet long, it is only one object but is two different colors, so I am going to describe as two units. The upper portion is brown, the height is less than ¼ of the length and the width is a bit more than ¼ the length The bottom portion is the same length and width and about half the length high. I am not able to tell the size of it because there is nothing for me to reference it to, however I am sure you have experts who are better qualified to determine it’s size. While checking this object I have noticed that there is a second object that appears to be another solid object, when blown up several times it almost looks like it is the same as the main object far off in the distance, but because the main object  has teased my imagination the second object, may just be a cloud. It was probably about 50 to 75 feet to that embankment from where I would have been standing and the embankment is about 5 feet high as are the bushes on the horizon. I am guessing that the top of the hill is about 30 or forty feet beyond the embankment. I am 73 years old and have never encountered anything like this during all those years, but I have to admit I have always been intrigued with UFOs and the stories about them. I have just the one photo, and I would send you a copy if you give me an Email address to send it to as that is the only way I know how to send it.  This picture has tweaked my interest and I would like to have someone to check it out for me, but I don’t know how to find someone who is qualified to make judgment as to what it is.

August 25, 2009 10:10 p.m. PDT.  I was in the process of driving a U-Haul truck from Albuquerque, NM, to Sacramento, CA.  I was on Highway 95 in southern Nevada, perhaps six miles north of the town of Beatty.  An overnight stay was planned later, in Hawthorne, NV. Traffic had been light, but leaving Beatty and heading north, the traffic all but vanished.  Even the local traffic had disappeared.  I was all alone in the night, half-listening to George Noory on the AM radio.  Noory promised his listeners a ""UFO Extravaganza,"" later. Suddenly to my left, I saw a light in the sky, heading south.  The light looked like a very bright planet - like Venus - but in motion.  I did a double-take, thinking it might have been a reflection in the driver's-side window of a stationary light located to the right of the truck, but that was not the case.  Something was flying south through the air, not very high, and not very far away. It is quite plausible that the light belonged to a small private airplane.  There is a small airport located just south of Beatty, equipped with flashing beacons for nighttime travelers, and the airborne light was heading in that direction. But still, private planes are supposed to be equipped with colored blinking lights for nighttime flight.  This light was not blinking at all.  Was the cockpit light on for some mysterious reason?   If so, why were the external blinking lights off?  That would be an unsafe condition, especially at low altitude!  It was all puzzling.",2013-04-12T00:00:00,36.9086,-116.7592

It's even hard to explain, just because we don't have the vocabulary for what I saw, but I will do my best to describe it to you.  Maybe (hopefully), one of your readers saw the same thing and can help me TO describe it. (lol)   First off, we live near an active Air Force Base and Missile Range, so hearing planes and sonic booms is nothing but background noise to us.  What made this night so unusual, was the number of planes SCREAMING over our house that late at night.  It literally sounded like a war was going on outside.  Complete with, what sounded like, explosions.  I used to be in the Army and supported the infantry guys, so I got used to the  sound of explosions, just not over civilians.  It got me VERY concerned.  I went out onto my back porch which faced the AF Base to see what in the heck was going on. I look out my back porch door, and saw what looked like a flare shooting up from the base.  I kept thinking, I know those things are bright, but there is NO way I could see a flare that well from this distance (approx 20 miles as the crow flies from their testing area to give you perspective).  I realized then that it was a missile they were shooting!  And from my point of view, directly towards civilian houses.  It hit something REALLY big.  This is the part I will have a hard time explaining, we really don't have words for this next part. When the missile hit whatever it was, and it looked like a dead on hit, it didn't act like any explosion I have ever seen.  This is the only way I can describe this so I'm sorry, but you know the movie Independence Day, when they shoot all the missiles at the ships in the beginning and it hits a force field?  It looked like that, without all the green special effects.  The explosion wrapped around whatever it was.  I could actually SEE the explosion wrap around whatever it was.  It was no plane I'd ever seen.  It looked like it was roughly the size of an aircraft carrier. with a weird cigar shaped looking front and no wings.   I saw the bits of the missile fall down and then nothing after that.  The next day they had helicopters everywhere in the direction of what I saw, and way more jets out then usual. So that's my story, it's definitely the weirdest thing I've ever seen, and even now my brain has a hard time comprehending what I saw.  It makes no sense you know?

Corner of Wherle Dr. and Genesee St. Reason for being there:	  I was watching the fireworks show from the Cheektowaga town park.  I chose that 	location because I wanted to view the show with a much smaller crowd around. My observations:		  What drew my attention to it was that it was not behaving like an aircraft, and was clearly too high to be a helicopter.  Due to the proximity of the buffalo Niagara International airport, I am quite familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft and helicopters.  I make my assumption of its altitude because it was clearly above any clouds overhead.  In addition, it produced no noise, and no strobe lights and no navigation lights where visible.  At the start of their cycle, they where small.   By the time they where overhead, they appeared as a faintly orange ball.  By the end of their path, they where large and darker than the midnight blue sky.   I was not the only person to observe these lights.  At least 8 or more people saw them too.  There was no wind. Sequence of events:  Roughly at about the same time as the show started, I observed a red light followed by an orange light.  It first appeared to be coming from the Southwest, slowly traveled with a gentle wavering, passed directly overhead, and continued Northeast.  About 4-5 minutes after it moved out of sight, another one appeared from the same location and slowly made its way to the same destination. 	Roughly around the middle of the firework show two of them traveled overhead, and merged close together, then apart, but still held the same course. 	These “fly over’s” continued through the firework show. I do not know when they stopped, as I left the area after the firework “grand finale”.",2013-07-05T00:00:00,,

UFO Under intelligent control. On July 4th 2013 at or about 9:45 p.m. I was watching fireworks from my yard on the North side of my garage. I live in Crestline, Ohio.  As I watched the fireworks display at the local High School from my yard I noticed what I thought was even more fireworks out of the corner of my eye, through the tree limbs and leaves to my right.  As the Glow of these extra fire works became more noticeable for some reason, I began to watch them or as it turned out to watch it. I observed a large glowing object with a fluctuating orange semi structured, moving orb like craft. I call it a craft because it was definitely under intelligent control.  The object left the obscured view from the trees and leaves and showed itself to be moving slightly slower than a small private plane and as the object entered clear sky after a short light misty rain, an orange spherical like object with a fluctuating tail, resembling a rocket engine exhaust flame, slowly navigated from the eastern sky at maybe 3000 ft about the lower altitude of a small private plane. I estimate the size to be similar to the size of  a small Cessna at that altitude coming from the direction of  north Mansfield, Ohio; as this orange slow comet like object,  with a flickering orange tail approached the center of the village of Crestline and the fire works display field, the craft made a gentle course correction to due north towards Cleveland from the east to west trajectory the craft had be! en on.  When the craft was directly overhead there was no sound from any jet engine or a prop. In fact there was no sound at all. It seemed to me only a helicopter could go that slowly and not fall out of the sky but there was no pressure wave from any rotors. And helicopters don't usually glow orange and have a flickering definitely orange tail. This all happened with in the space/time of about 5-7 minutes and the craft gradually and gently increased it's altitude, disappeared into the northern night sky seemingly on its way to Cleveland.  This object was so unusual it drew my attention to it, I have never seen anything like it in the night sky other than a very distant meteor but meteors do not change course and usually have a bluish cast and remain in one trajectory. I have no idea what this object was. I do think this observation merits reporting because of the uniqueness of the circumstances. Make of it, what you will, perhaps more sightings of this object will come to light near the same date and time and geographical location. For me it will remain a UFO for the time being. I do not drink or use drugs, I was eating watermelon in a lawn chair enjoying the fireworks in a light misty rain. I could not discern the actual shape of the craft itself only the dimensions of the bright flickering rocket engine like orange glow from what I assume was directly behind the craft.

As I recall, it was around 2200 and the moon was nearly full and there was some sporadic cloud cover. The front of my home faces east and it is located about twenty five miles west of the Atlantic ocean and about eighty miles north of Cape Canaveral. As I gazed up at the moon, I observed a dark, elliptical shaped object silently pass in front of the moon, almost blotting it out, and then disappear in the cloud cover.  I was able to view the object for approximately two seconds, as it crossed south to north.  It was hard to gauge its size, but the impression I was left with was that the object was very large; it was oval shaped in the middle, but the ends were blunt, or square. I quickly dismissed the object as being an aircraft because it had no wings or navigation lights.  The object was completely blacked out.  It was several days before I mentioned the sighting to my wife, who met my revelation with a very perplexed expression.  We’ve been married for twenty three years and she served twenty of my twenty one years in the Marine Corps married to me, not to mention the past seven years that I have been a police officer, and my wife knows I am not easily impressionable, prone to exaggeration, or likely to joke about such things.

Unidentifed Flying Object Distant Sighting Leading to an Up Close and Personal Encounter- Constant Glowing White- 150 ft away.,Hartly,DE,2013-03-02T22:20:00,circle,5 minutes,"Occurred : 3/2/2013 22:20  (Entered as : 03/02/13 22:20) Reported: 3/4/2013 2:23:13 PM 14:23 Posted: 4/12/2013 Location: Hartly, DE Shape: Circle Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/096/S96517.html,"Unidentifed Flying Object Distant Sighting Leading to an Up Close and Personal Encounter- Constant Glowing White- 150 ft away The sighting-encounter occurred in Hartly, DE 19953 on March 2, 2013 between 10:20-10:25pm.  The sighting occurred while i was driving east on Bryant’s Corner Rd, Hartly, DE.  Specifically, the object was seen/noticed far in the distance (south direction) while passing 671 Bryant’s Corner Rd.  At that point I saw a fairly bright white glowing object to my right, moving east in the sky.  It’s fairly large size and bright white glow was very eye catching, I could not help to notice it as I drove.  At that point, compared to a full moon and from my perspective, it was approximately 1/5th the size of a full moon.  As I drove east on Bryant’s corner roughly ¾ mile from the original viewing at 671, approaching 1600 Bryant’s Corner, the object appeared much closer but remained high in altitude directly south of my location.   At that point I was very interested in the object and while it appeared fairly close, there was no outside noise whatsoever.  Foolishly, I flashed my headlights multiple times in a joking manner seeking to get its attention, while I was in a clearing and before I entered the wooded area along the road.  As I drove through the wooded area and sharp bends I saw its bright white glow directly to my right and just below the tree line.  However, it looked very far away yet not high in altitude. Shortly after I looked away and thought to myself, ""Maybe when I get into the clearing I might be able to see it better.""  I turned the final bend and exited the wooded area driving approximately 40mph. At this point on my left I was passing 2307 Bryant’s Corner Rd. At that point I saw the bright unidentified object to my right (south direction) making a half circle, just gracefully swooping down. In a matter of seconds it was less than a quarter mile away and approximately 500 feet off the ground. Its trajectory made it evident it was moving toward and in front of me. I was horrified when I realized this object was completely silent and not of any known aircraft whatsoever, moving toward me and in front of me and my safety could be in serious danger if I continued east on Bryan! t’s Corner.  At this point I would describe it as 1/3 the size of a full moon. I slowed down a lot and hesitated on whether I should continue driving or turn around immediately. I reduced my speed to roughly 5mph as I looked in amazement and as it gently came closer and closer. At the climax of the sighting the object moved in and floated/hovered directly in front of me, blocking me from driving down the road without driving almost directly beneath it, roughly 150 feet away and remaining roughly 150 feet from the ground. The actual object looked about the size of one-two school buses stacked on top of each other. It is difficult for me to describe the exact size because of the radiating white light might have made it look larger. It was absolutely very close and I began to panic.  Thoughts and emotions rushed through my mind, I felt as if it was just starring me down, waiting to see what I would do or if I would stop or get out of my car. I starred for about 10 seconds in total amazement and because my window was half way down I was absolutely certain there was no sound whatsoever and it was not a helicopter or any kind of known aircraft. It was way too large and bright to be any kind of balloon or prank. It moved in such a perfect and precise manner it could not have been anything other than intelligently controlled. The white glow and radiating white light was like nothing I have ever seen, ever. It was so bright, amazing, and silent. Yet it was not blinding and did not hurt to look upon it. As it moved in front of me I felt as if it was just starring me down and watching me. The thoughts of my safety being in serious jeopardy and feeling helpless to defend myself completely overwhelmed me. All I could think about was how fast I could turn around and drive back in the direction I came, running away from it. I pulled in the driveway to my right, and before I quickly went in reverse I starred left looking directly at it. It was hovering there in the same place. Its white glow was constant and did not flicker, it remained hovering in the same location as it had when it first stopped in front of me. I then reversed and began to drive away as fast as possible. I thought to myself, there is no way I can out run this object, I cannot believe something bad might really happen to me right now. I drove as fast as I could in the direction I had originally came, without looking back until I had driven a few miles. It dissapeared from my view when i drove away in the opposite direction.  By the time I looked back I did not see it anywhere in the sky and I drove directly home. The event was very shocking, amazing, and incredible.  Additional information: I first saw the object in the distant sky approximately 10:20pm, however I did notice while leaving my house but it was not until a few minutes later at 10:20pm that it really caught my attention. It was a clear nights sky and some planes were visible very high up but there was nothing else flying close to the ground as the object did during that time. Due to the object being in such close proximity I was too awe struck to take a photo or video, as I absolutely should have and wish I had. I did not want to do anything that could have jepordized my safety.  personal note: I am willing to speak over the phone about the encounter but I do not wish to disclose any personal information. I wish to be anonymous and I do not seek to gain any attention or endure criticism. I simply want to share the experience in hopes that someone else saw the object as well or assistance in understanding the object and its origins.",2013-04-12T00:00:00,39.1564,-75.6912

We live off Georgian Bay, but a few miles further to the west.  It is really the same water way but we live on a point of land that juts out into Georgian Bay.  Our mailing address was formerly Penetanguishene but has now been changed to Tiny, Ontario.

It didn’t appear to be making any sound.  The beach area is quiet with little light pollution, and with not much activity as the water level is low.  The light flashed off in a direct line, quickly and was gone. Tonight, July 04, at approximately 10:20 pm as we walked along our quiet street that has a lot of mature trees, and is close to the beach.  Just above the tree line we observed a hovering object with bright lights flickering all over it.  It is a very quiet night, with a lot of cloud cover and yet it was very bright (orange/red colour) and did not appear to be that far away.  We could not hear it making any type of sound.  Then after we observed it for about 60 seconds, the light started dim, and then it was just a red dot, and then it was gone. We walked down to the beach, and on our way back, over the opposite tree line that runs parallel to the beach a bright green light (like a laser) flashed across the night sky over the tree line, as if something had flashed a laser light. Interestingly, this past October (we have the date and time recorded and a drawing and can look for them if you are interested) we were walking along the same beach in Tiny, Ontario, just after 10 pm we saw a large orange/red fireball flash across the night sky and disappear above the same tree line.

Where our house sits relative to the fields and lakes around here where folks launch their fireworks we can only catch the highest bursts, and those only through gaps in the trees.   We do have a relatively unobstructed view of the southern approaches/departures to SEATAC.  I’m a private pilot (single engine land, ground school for IFR; ‘haven’t flown in years, though), and do enjoy watching the SEATAC traffic when I get the chance. During the fireworks, at between approximately 10:15 and 10:45, we saw 5 orange’ish/amber lights not apparently connected to the usual approaches and departures (departures were to the south at SEATAC last night), not associated with any other lighting typical of the aircraft we see around here, and not apparently connected to the fireworks, moving from low on the horizon west (True bearing; magnetic variance is ~17 degrees east) of us to various headings and elevations.  Each light was a discrete, constant point source.  I am not familiar with any aircraft lighting systems that have a single orange’ish/amber constant light.  No sound was associated with the lights.  There were no apparent trails indicative of an exhaust plume.  The lights all appeared to be the same size, shape, color, and initial intensity, though their directions of flight were varied.  We had a commercial jet pass farther to the south of us than the first pair of lights we saw, sometime between the appea! rance of the fourth and fifth lights as part of its departure from SEATAC, and we could just make out the sound of its engines.  The first two lights we saw appeared to be moving together from west of us to east-southeast.  They were climbing together but not apparently connected to the same structure as they moved toward and a little southward of our house.  They seemed to shift position a bit with respect to each other, and were likely no less than 100 ft apart from each other while we could see them approaching.  One of them started to pass in and out of the thin broken stratiform cloud layer we had last night before we lost sight of them from our vantage point at a window on the west side of the house.  Given their trajectory and distance from us, their speed seemed to be somewhere around 120-180 kts, but we couldn’t see any aircraft structure to get a really confident estimate of distance, and their shifting position made speed estimates from looming difficult.  The third light we saw appeared a few minutes after we lost sight of the first pair.  This second light appeared identical in every way to the first two (i.e., size, orange’ish/amber, discrete, constant point source).  We noticed it starting from a little bit north of where the first two came from, westward of our house.

A bright white light crossing the sky caught my attention. The object was moving at a steady pace south to north.  It was round, and about the size of Venus, a little larger, and noticeably brighter.  It did not blink, flash, make noise, or change color.  About 20 degrees east another light, possibly a meteor, flashed across the low horizon.  At that moment the light stopped, paused for about a second, and started moving east. The angle of path change was about 90 degrees, possibly minutely obtuse.  The speed was slower after this.  At this point I ran to get my brother to have another witness, but the object was gone by our return.  We waited for 10 minutes, but the object did not come back into view.  It is the third object I have observed in that area, but I did not report the other two.  This object bears a resemblance to the first I saw in that area, about two years ago.  That object moved in similar way, but slower.  It also changed color from white, to red, to g! reen, back to white, to blue, and back to red.  That object moved in a sporadic zigzag for about 15 minutes before shooting up at great speed.  Both these objects and another were seen within a half mile of each other, and all three times what appear to be meteors have fallen during or just before the sighting.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,40.03326710353867,-76.30302319790302
