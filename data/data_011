Large dark triangle craft spotted. On 7-18-98 at  about 10:02 PM Mountain Time (04:02 Universal Time) as my family and I drove west away from the Wal-Mart store in Longmont Colorado we spotted a craft flying from the southwest of our area and moving northward across our field of view.  It was moving slowing and in a slightly jerky manner and this caught my attention.  It seemed to have a great many red pulsating lights with some white lights in the central area.  At the time I wondered if it were a helicopter.  It descended toward the Longmont Airport, but it did not follow the usual flight path and was actually going down toward the farm fields just south of the airport.   We lost sight of it behind trees as we drove and I forgot about it.  About 5 minutes later (about 10:07 PM) we were driving north toward the west end of the airport when we spotted a craft that looked like the first one.  We assumed it was the same one.  The craft looked like a very large plane ascending from the west end of the airport.  It was moving slowly and was large enough that as it crossed the road ahead of us the lights on the front passed over the farm fence west of the road as the rear lights were still well toward the east of the road.  The length appeared to be 50 to 60 feet.  As we drove up toward this seen we assumed that this was merely a very large plane.  The airport normally handles small twin engine and single engine aircraft.  Thus, we eyed the craft as it slowly flew over the road about 50 feet above the ground. I commented that it was lit funny because it seemed to be box shaped in that the rear had at least two red lights one above the other, and the front of the craft had two or more red lights in a vertical column.  In the middle area were other red lights and some white.  All four of the four people in the car continued to stare at the craft  on the West side of the Airport as the car was greatly slowed.  The craft ascended slowly toward the west to about 120 feet above the ground and about 1300 feet west of the road.  Then it appeared to stop! and hover.  At no time did the lights change direction and the craft at no time banked or turned around.  Because the lights did not change their orientation we continued to assume that the craft was still going west even though the craft was now growing larger.  Suddenly we realized it was headed back towards us, it having never executed a turn, and it was ascending as it moved back toward the airport in a slight northeast direction.  It came very near the rear of our car (from 160 to 200 feet).  No airplane motor noise was heard - at other times we have heard the engines of smaller craft passing over the road.  It passed over the road at about 170 feet above the ground.  As it neared the road three people in the car saw that the craft was shaped like a triangle with three equal sides.  The leading point was facing the northeast in the direction of its movement.  Many new lights were seen on its bottom hull.  Along each of the two side angles there ran long tube like lights, like neon tubes, that were a yellowish-white.  These tubes curved inward near the west end of the craft and came to sharp points. Just east of each was a large round red light and toward the west two more red lights.  Near the apex of the triangle, the east tip, was a large round recessed hole in which was a bright light-blue light.  While the red lights had been pulsating earlier as the craft was moving west, now all the lights were continually on with no blinking or pulsation.  The lights provided enough illumination to allow the viewers to see that the craft had a dark triangle hull.  We quickly tried to pull over onto another side road to we could get out.  We saw the craft move silently toward the middle section of the airport area, just north of the runway at about 350 feet above the ground.  Then the craft changed course and moved northward until it was hidden by trees near us.  We drove to another location where we could see the surrounding area but the craft was no where in sight.  AT this point it was about 10:12 PM Mountai! n Time. It appears that as the craft lifted off from the airport grounds toward the west it was moving with the flat side of the triangle toward the direction of its movement.  It then stopped and hovered a moment as it lifted the east tip of the triangle and reversed course in a slight climb back over the airport grounds.",1998-11-21T00:00:00,40.1703733197556,-105.08544969450101

We saw a disc with lights all around it glowing from inside. We saw the shape of it very well; maybe from city lights or moonlight. The left and right side of the disc shape was not a pointed shape as in most photos. The shape of the disc had sharp corners more like rectangles, yet it looked like a disc. It hovered above trees for a few minutes and moved toward the right behind trees. So then I moved the van a few feet and saw it hovering again. The disc was close to the trees, did this once more, and we followed again to be able to see it. And then it went behind trees one last time and it disapeared from our vision. It did not spin or glow, it just hovered in one place for a few minutes at a time and slowly went behind trees toward our right. I had never seen a Ufo before.

The evening began with me discussing certain unexplained philosphical phenomena with two other people.  I took the angle of the scientific observer.  I wanted proof of the 'religious' nature of the universe as the people I was talking to exclaimed to exist.  I have always had a week spot in me for the unexplained, but yet, I have never really experienced anything that strayed me from the scientific and the provable.  Yet tonight, as I came home, parked my car in the driveway, I looked up to a remarkably clear sky.  I focused on a constellation, I'm not sure which, and, all of a sudden, a star like object began to move across the sky, starting in this constellation.  I watched it travel in my direction, although it was completely at a great distance.  It was if one of the stars just picked up and decided to move.  I watched it move across the sky at a fairly rapic pace without changing course.  Then it pulled a 'J' manoever in the sky.  It began moving to the southeast and then the east and then partially toward the north.  It did not leave a trail in the evening sky nor did it make a sound as it travelled.  It did not blink like an airplane wing light.  It did not shoot across the sky like a shooting star, of which I've seen thousands.  It was very deliberate yet quick across the sky.  I've seen satellites which moved slower and continued on a straight line.  This object curved in a 'J' motion.  I was cradled in my driveway by trees towards the southern end and it eventually disappeared behind the trees.  I wish I could say that I was under the influence but I wasn't.  The thing appeared and travelled like nothing I have ever seen in the sky before, and I spend a lot of time looking at the sky in Maine, where you receive more than the fair share of night time entertainment.  This wasn't what is ordinarily in my sky.",1998-11-21T00:00:00,43.67350846153846,-70.2808476923077

I thought it was interesting but then when I saw the 2 others, the color difference became quite noticable against the background of stars in the sky.

I had just stepped out of my truck after arriving in Bend at my girlfriend's parent's house and the brightness of these lights caught my eye because I hadn't recalled ever seeing a constellation in that area of the sky before. There had been snow showers in the vicinity and the skys were in a broken condition with cirrus clouds also in the vicinity.  Objects were first observed almost stationary. Then, after a few seconds, I noticed they started moving in a straight line towards an approximate 330deg direction.  The speed they were traveling was about twice as fast as a satellite would be observed moving but much slower than a meteor entering the atmosphere.  All objects remained equi-distant from one another, approximately 1 finger-width between each. They were all white in appearance, the same as the surrounding stars. No sound, fire trail, strobe lights, running lights, flaring, or fragmentation was observed.   The front 3 objects were as bright as the surrounding stars. The 4th object in line was a little brighter, and the 5th object was approximately the same brilliance as Jupiter.

ADDENDUM SUBMITTED BY ORIGINAL WITNESS: Previously submitted on 4-19-99 I have previously submitted our report on the events that took place on Monday evening.  A few people have spoken to me regarding this event that took place and we do not see why others shouldn't know the truth.  We are comfortable knowing the truth of what we witnessed and have spoken to another individual who has also seen it, on the same night.  I anticipate that there will be many others that have witnessed this but failed to report it through the lack of knowing what to do.  We thank you for listening to us and am additionally glad that someone in Lake Wood saw it too.  It confirmed what we reported to you that night and the direction that it came from (Los Angeles Area).  I had to check the location out in a map the next day and was please for what I learned then.",1999-04-26T00:00:00,34.12327628865979,-117.38932371134021

Looking up towards the LITTLE dipper (I think) I noticed a commercial airline jet leaving LAX (as my job is under the departing flight path for those flights heading east). My location was approx. 3/4mi south of the 10 frwy & 1/10 mi. east of PCH. 5-10 sec. later I saw something I'd never seen before, like no other aircraft I'd known. The TWO aircraft I saw appeared to 'chase' the jet from LAX but appeared to be LOWER in altitude than the jet. Each of the two ""chase"" craft had 5 or 6 circular lights along each edge (not the rear) of the craft. I could'nt believe what I saw.  Convinced I'd seen something truly strange...I stayed outside to see what else I might see. 5 minutes or so went by & YES I saw another one! Flying in the same direction...this thing looked just like the first two I'd earlier seen. Thinking I might miss something I stayed outside for another 5-10 minutes. Then I saw a fourth, but this time something looked like it was chasing the 'spacecraft shape' I saw earlier and it was a ""pinhead"" in size compared in size to the larger craft. All of these craft I saw were the same size as the planes I see departing from LAX. I also live under the departing flight path of LAX as planes head east. I have seen A LOT of planes from LAX & this was like NOTHING I have ever seen before.  I also have lived in the San Fernando Valley & have seen Stealth fighters exit Van Nuys airport when they leave from the yearly airshow. I don't think these were Stealth. These craft were absoloutely silent, nothing no boom...nothing, yet I can hear just fine all of the jets and prop planes in the area. The circular lights did not blink but remained solid and were much larger than the lights I've seen on all the LAX jets...yet the craft was about the same size as an LAX jet.

I only saw it for a slight moment before I left for my sister Please be aware this could have been a misidentification.  I have a few possiblities as to what I saw. 1. It could have been a effect of a searchlight maybe above the clouds or below (I didn't see any visible 'beam' (like a search light) going to the illumination in the clouds). 2. Maybe a helicopter above the clouds (account for the searchlight). I really don't know what it was.  Im not rock-solid on the time.  I know it was near 11pm.. but still 10pm.  The skies were overcast.  I could see maybe 4 stars to my southeast.  I was about to go in the house (from a short walk.. few days ago my step-mother mentioned a bright light outside, though this might not have anything to do with this whatsoever) when I saw a helicopter to my west.  I ran out near the bank and I noticed it had its searchlight on.  It looked like it was looking for something on the ground.  I looked up and noticed that there was a 'circular' form of light either above or below the clouds (I thought it was above).  It was moving smoothly with no jagged movement, but fast.  I noticed that as I sat there, just after I looked, it nearly stopped to a halt.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing so I ran for the house to get my sister.  When we got outside the 'circular light' was too far to our east.  We could still see 'flashes' and the helicopter.  We both noticed about 4 flashes.  They were very fast, and very bright.  Kind of like lightning, but faster.  I thought, at the time, the flashing was coming from our east, where the helicopter and 'light' were.  I thought I saw this 'light' above the clouds a few times, but by this time they were miles away.  I really wish I had stayed outside and not ran to the house, I could have deffinately in my mind determined what it was... I wasn't given enough time.  The light above/below the clouds was about the size of holding an orange at arms length... and I remember it moving, but not the exact movements.  I don't know exactly how fast it moved because my 'sighting' wasn't given enough time.  Me and my sister drove up onto Wickiup to see if it would return, but till' 2:02 am we saw nothing.  It seems like the object was heading east, near the Columbia river, atleast relevant to my area.  I must also note that during the duration that the helicoter was visible we were talking about it, so we didn't keep constant eye contact with the area where th! e 'light' or the helicopter were.  As I said, a few times I thought I saw the object moving around in the clouds ahead of the helicopter.  And once I thought I saw a 'beam', but I was unsure (in the vicinity of the helicopter).  I want to know if anyone else saw it so that I can understand it better.  I would also like an explanation for the flashes that my and my sister saw.",1999-04-02T00:00:00,,

A jetliner passed near by the object.  Then a second object  passed near the first, travelling at a speed similar to the jetliner with an apparent heading. It was late afternoon with clear skys and bright sunlight. I was taking a rest after chores on a hammock under a wooden sun shade on an otherwise open air deck. As I layed back, I saw a shiny metallic spot in the sky directly overhead.  It was maintaining a constant position in the sky.  In an attempt to determine what it was, I got my binocculars and returned.  The object had not moved while I was gone. With the binoccular I was able to determine an oval shape.  It was not a convetional aircraft, it could have been a balloon based on it's shape.  I could discern no further details of the object itself. While viewing the object a jetliner passed in the same viewing area directly overhead flying south to north. From my perspective, it seemed the jetliner had to also see the object.  The jetliner appeared to be 16-20 times larger than the object. A short time later, another object of similar size and shape flew across my viewing area directly overhead. It had a heading of NE to SE.  It approached the first object, and went past.  Speed was similar to the rate the jetliner passed. A startling observation for me was the very limited viewing field where I could see the stationary object.  If I left the cover area to an open area of the same deck, I could not find the object in the sky.  If I returned to the hammock and looked straight up I could see the object solidly.  The difference of shade and light surrounding me could be the cause of this effect.  I repeated this several times, until I was convinced near the hammock was the only place I could see this object. I then went to get my video camera.  Laying on the hammock, the object was too small to show up in the view finder.  That discuraged me from shooting tape. I figured that if the viewfinder couldn't see it, I would probably have nothing special on tape. All of this ocurred over about 30 minutes.  In that time the stationary object had drifted only a couple inches south relative to my deck shade. Finally, I just quit looking and went back to my other activities.",1998-11-21T00:00:00,45.4312,-122.7715

I was near the intersection of Columbus and 5th street in Tucson, the night of July 25th, about 10;00 pm when I noticed the three lights hanging low to the horizon in the N/W sky. It struck me as particularly unusual because their brightness and color belied the usual stars or planets that might be seen there. Their position was so low, the city's glare mkes it all but impossible that they could have been stars. And besides, their positions were drifting. >From my vantage point, they appeared to be at least 10-15 miles away from me, but certainly it could have been much further than that. I was too far away to see a whole lot more than what I told you, but I certainly would be happy to confirm any other possible, more close up viewings of what was seen. These were NOT flares. From my vantage point, one of the lights was clearly moving upwards, and often times appeared to draw very close to the most upper of the three lights. Also, the lights did not blink and they're movements were not the movements of any conventional aircraft. i.e. helicoptor or plane. I wish I had been closer, and I'll be interested to see what the papers say I was looking at in the morning. I was returning home from work when I saw the lights, so I have no idea how long they may have been there before I saw them, or where they may have been. I only know I first picked them up at about 9:50, and lost sight of them at about 10:10. From where I was, they appeared to be drifting off further to the N/W, and I lost them below the tree line at that point.",1998-11-21T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

I wasn't looking for anything, I was just driving home, like I did every other night.  (currently I am enrolled in college)  I live on a big hill, with a nice view, so when I got half of the way up there I saw some lights in the sky.  It was freaky, all I could do is stare.  Then I got to a patch of trees where I couldn't see anything anymore.  The sight scared me so much that as soon as I got home, I told my dad about it and I took my younger brother down to the exact spot to see it again.  When we got down there, it was nowhere to be seen.  I waited a bit, but nothing happened so we drove back home.  As I recall, there were four bright objects, floating directly in the center of the sky.  There is no way they could have been attached to anything on the ground.  Since then I put it in the back of my mind, saying that it was just my imagination, that I wanted to see a ufo so much, that I wanted to believe so much, that I created the image in my head.  I discredited the fact that it could have been a reflection in my mirror or window because there were no other lights around, and no one had been following me that night.  So I forgot about the whole incident, until today.  I just read the November 1998 issue of UFO magazine, and on page 9 it shows a picture exactly of what I saw that night.  I am now, totally convinced that what I saw that night can be classified as a UFO.  The sighting that was pictured in the magazine was taken in Texas, in 1996 and I had never seen the magazine before in my life.

This was all viewed by my wife and my self from the rear of the craft and the bottom. The whole event seemed to take place rather quickly. To be honest, my wife and I do describe the object itself in slightly different ways. My first impression of the object was that it looked impossibly large, yet somehow ""faked"" - in the sense that It reminded me of a projection or a hologram. My wife also thought it looked unreal, but her impression was that it was like an orgami shape. We both agree that it was VERY large and had at least ten bright round white lights on it. These were like spotlights except they thru down no beams, for lack of a better description. I estimate that we were no more than a mile or so away from the craft upon initially seeing it. It moved rather quickly to the north or north east and became progressively harder to see because of the cloudcover in the area at that time. 10 seconds or so after spotting it - I thought to run inside and grab my camcorder, but I had no sooner made it thru the front door, when my wife said (in a very non-plussed way) ""it's gone"". in the interim, as I ran into the house she says that it looked like it was turning hard to the east, as if it was standing on it's edge, and then ""changed shape"" and became more spherical right before it dissapeared. When it vanished it did not speed off in any one direction - rather it simply dissapeared. As far as I'm concerned, that backs up my projection theory, at least in some respects. However, that would be one heck of a powerfull projector, to put an image on cloudcover at 5000 or so feet. Now, some background. I am 29 years old and I work in Provisioning for AT&T. To be honest, I have always enjoyed stargazing and have always said that I have an open mind about UFO's and would like to see one, but seeing this really blew my mind. Having said that, let me also restate the seeming ""unreality"" of the whole event in both my wifes and my own perceptions of it. By the way, my wife is 33 and she is a stay at home mom.

I was in Oxford, MS on business, and stopped at a friends apartment befor going out for the night.  On the drive over, my other friends and I had japed that it was a perfect night to see a U.F.O. because of the beautiful clear sky.  I stepped out back (9:45)to light a cigarette, and happened to glance at the tree covered sky line, to see what I thought was a kite flying in the distance.  It appeared to be a black plastic triangular kite, barely reflecting the light.  As the object got closer (about the size of my hand held at arms leangth), I thought maybe someone had lost a kite and it was flying free. The only thing that seemed stange was the fact that the object was flying in a straight line. At this point I realized I could make out the shape of the object because of it's reflective or illuminated front sides.  As the thing approched almost directly overhead the it was still almost invisible, other than the nine or eleven very dim lights outlining the front.  at this time it had gone from legal pad sized to a full arms lenght across.  I new I didn't have a camera, so I called into the apartment to get some attention.  Three friend came outside to see the object pass overhead and disapear into the night on the opposit horizon.  Although the triangle seemed to light up in the front, we could not tell if it was reflecting light or self illuminated.  the triangle was so faint that if you were not looking directly at it, you couldn't see it.  It didn't stand out aginst the night at all.  The object made no sounds or sudden movements.  As a matter of fact, it did nothing spectacular at all. I'v always believed in U.F.O'S, but never that I would see one: until now.  I don't know what to make of this. Danny H.",1998-11-19T00:00:00,34.3402,-89.4833

Object when first sighted was moving towards the west. On the night of November 12, in Bend, Oregon, I was outside of my home observing the moon and the planets currently visible. My roommate had asked that if they were at all visible to let him know (it has been overcast alot here lately). It was clear. I went in and we both came out. I was pointing out a neighborhood light that was in violation of an Oregon code because it was not subdued (any amateur astronomer can relate,) when he pointed to an object in the sky and asked me what it was. I first saw the object heading due west and was about to say it must be an airliner when I saw it do an unbelievable U-turn. Astonished, we both watched this 'craft' do maneuvers that would be impossible for any known aircraft to perform. I am a veteran, and used to work while A-10's and a variety of other aircraft flew overhead. What we saw seemed to be so unhindered by gravity that I can only describe it's behavior as playful, like it was 'dancing' in the air. It performed multiple U-turns, and would accelerate to incredible speeds and then come to a complete halt in what seemed milliseconds. It made absolutely no sound at all. I would estimate it's distance from us to be anywhere from one to three miles away, and it's size as possibly quite large. I did see a very distinct 'disk' shape. The thing eventually seemed to vanish, and we remained outside for about another hour watching for it before we gave up and went inside. I am an Archaeology student, my roommate is a Geologist.

All in a diagonal row. I went out to fill the dog bowl before going to bed. I saw a bright light out of the corner of my eye. I just thought it was the moon. When I turned around I saw a very bright light high in the sky. I was looking east from a small town outside of San Diego, California. I have seen bright lights before but none this bright. So I went to get binoculars. At first, the light was just bright and blury. Then I steadied myself against the house and this is when I saw something very strange. Starting from what would be one's lower left corner of a screen there were smaller lights (star-like) that were spaced apart. There were 3 of these smaller lights in a diagonal line which started at the lower left corner of view and moved up to the higher right side of view. What appeared to be right next to the 3rd light was the larger bright light. Then, still going diagonally up to the right, there was a 4th small light. It was like a perfect line. I didn't know what to make of it. I tried to capture it on video but it just shows a blurry bright white light. The smaller lights wouldn't show up on the lens with the zoom all the way out. Anyhow, I have never seen anything like this. I use the Internet a lot and decided to type in a search for anything that would give me a place to tell about this sighting. I found a site with links that led me to this page. The objects did not move at all. I don't believe it was alien, but then again I don't have a clue what could it could be. The 5 objects were aligned in such a perfect line that it is not something I think is common to see. The distance from earth that these objects appeared to be must make each of the objects very far apart from each other. I have no clue about the stars and systems in space. Maybe the bigger bright light was a satelite that just happened to be in alignment with a row of stars. If anyone has seen similar or knows what this is, please let me know. I am just curious. I have never seen anything like this. And as I write this, it is still visible. Thank you.",1998-11-21T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

I've never seen anything i would consider UFO in Nature and I am very skeptical of it being one but I thought I could at least give you a heads up if this was some thing.

Five lights across the sky and they were very low...there was absolutely no sound, moving ever so slowly...When I looked up, I was so excited, I told my Mikie to run in and get everyone to come outside to see...he was so frightened, he cried running up the stairs...well by the time anyone listened to him and they finally came out, the lights had disappeared into the sky as thou the sky opened up and the lights just slipped into the darkness one by one.

(Official explanations unacceptable) I had a sighting about ten years ago and I never had the resources to check out what I had seen until I got on the net. Which brings me to the point as to why I am writing you. The official comments that were made about the sighting were unacceptable and I believe, would be to anyone who actually saw this object. Unfortunately, I can't pinpoint the exact date, which is a problem. However, there are other details that may help identify this sighting. That way, someone may be able to help me find more realistic explanations as to what I saw that  night. Below is an account of the events as I remember them. It was Oct. of 1988 (unsure of these dates) about eight o'clock or a little later, when I was going to visit a friend, who lives in a rural part of Missouri. I pulled into his driveway, got out of the car and went to the door and knocked. My friend was not at home. I got ready to get back into the car and leave, when I noticed several  lights in the western sky. They were moving toward me at a slow but steady speed. I moved away from the car and into a field adjacent to my friend's house. I could not make out what it was. There was no discernible silhouette, just several lights coming my way. The object then got directly over head and seem to take up the entire night sky. I then noticed that the lights (There were at least three lights maybe more, I don't really recall.) seem to be attached to one large object. The lights seem to be facing toward the object instead of facing outward as you would expect. When I looked at the object, I got the impression that this is what a blimp would look like if it had been flying at night with the lights turned toward it. The object seem to be just above my head, about two hundred feet or so, I'm just guessing. There was dead silence, I heard nothing that would explain its propulsion except the wind. Even though the object moved slowly, I think it would have moved even slower if governed by the wind alone. I  continued to watch the object until it disappeared in the eastern sky. This may have been a total of five to ten minutes. It never once slowed down or veered from a straight course and seem to stay the same distance from the ground the entire time. I got into the car trying to sort out what I had seen, debating on if  I should tell anyone else. I went to eat a late dinner and then decided I would go and tell another friend of mine about the experience. I got to his house right at ten o'clock. The local news was just coming on. Just before I had the chance to tell him about my experience, the first line of the news cast said  ""If you saw it, you weren't the only one."" They continued to say reports had come in by the hundreds and that it had been seen in at least seven different states that night. An investigation was under way. The next morning there was a small news segment about  scientists thinking it may have been a gaseous cloud that had ignited in the upper atmosphere but it was still being investigated. On the following day the official report stated, it was a Russian Rocket that was reentering the earth's atmosphere. I have problems with all the above explanations. For instance, Anything burning I believe would at least flicker. This was not consistent with what I had seen. The lights never blinked or seem to diminish in any way. It maintained a slow but direct course and stayed the same distance from the ground the entire time. I have never seen a falling star or meteors do anything like that. If they had said it was a low flying blimp, I would have believed this before any of the other explanations. That is, before I heard it had been reported in seven different states that night.  But after hearing this, I began to wonder if there may have been more than one object roaming the skies that night.  What I am looking for is any other credible explanations as to what this may have been. If you have any info on the sighting I am referring to or can lead me to others that may be able to help me. Please feel free to forward this letter or e-mail me. I would very much appreciate it.",1998-06-18T00:00:00,38.2762,-91.7574

Then the orbs flew in tight formation in a very horizontal direction to the north, following the mountain range.  Apparently the orbs were either in the mountains or in the Salt Lake Valley, because as they flew northward at an extreme speed, they dissapeared behind the mountain range.

On a warm, clear, dark and moonless summer night (June, July or August ?), circa 1962, my grand mother and I watched in dumbstruck silence as a 100' long object closely resembling a DC-3/6 fuselage sans wings, a tail or exterior lights, approached and hovered over the rural residential community of Morrice, MI at tree-top level. From a distance of 20 yards, the UFO displayed multiple lighted windows ala a commercial airliner of that era....along entire length of body.  After hovering motionless for 1-2 minutes, the tail ramp of craft dropped open in fashion similar to ramps of '60's military cargo planes and subsequent Boeing 727 aircraft.  A coverall clad, normal sized human looking ""man"" walked out on the lowered ramp and physically signaled to the  visible pilot of an identical air craft 1/10 the size of the first vessel,that quickly apporached and stopped (hovered) 10 yards aft the larger aircraft.  The smaller aircraft entered the rear of the larger ""mother"" vessel in a! matter of seconds and the ramp door closed behind it, curtailing the yellow incandescent type light emitted from the larger aircraft's interior.  After a few moments, the droning RPM's of the unidentified craft increased as it moved off to the west at an estimated speed of 25 MPH, still just above the tree tops.  Local TV news the following night (Sunday) reported that UFO's (""Ha!, Ha!) were sighted over Flint and Lansidng the night before.  Morrice is located just about half-way between those two larger cities. Both vessels were dark in color, but presumably metalic.  At first we could only see the outline of the larger vessel, but as our eyes adjusted and focused, we could the vessel rather well against a dark, cloudless, night sky.  The propulsion noise of the large vessel was similar to, yet, different than the sound of two diesel locomotive's whose engines, side by side, non-synchronously vibrating the air. The larger aircraft, again, lacked both wings and a tail, but was roundly ""pointed"" in the front akin to the shape of a traditional commercial or military aircraft. In fact, at first sight, I thought I was observing a slow moving airliner.  The shape of the larger vessel(s) in retrospect, was cigar like.  The smaller ""scout"" or ""shuttle"" vessel bore a front window large (possibly a clear canopy) enough to evidence a pilots head sillouhetted by background lighting from within the cockpit interior.  The shape of that head appeared to be that of what I would consider a normal hum! an being. The smaller craft could not be heard over the propulsion noise of the larger vessel, accounting perhaps for it's unexpected appearance out of the completely dark sky.  The beings I observed, looked like ordinary human individuals, the one on the larger craft being approximately 5'8"" to 6'0"" in height, and again, wearing what I described then at age 12 or 13, coveralls.  I would, today, after having served in the military, refer to the same clothing as a jump suit or a flight suit.  There was nothing extra terrestrial about this sighting.  In fact, the only thing that seemed unusual to me at the time and to this day, was the absence of wings, an air speed too low for even a four place Cesna to stay aloft, the stationary hovering, and the surprising appearance of the second smaller, identical vessel. The event reminded me the recovery of an amphibeous landing craft seen in WWII movies and in photographs. I recently spoke with a retired USAF Colonel, who claimed that ""TOP-TOP-SECRET-SECRET"" design and testing of aircraft was rumored to be taking place at one or more of the AF bases in Michigan (Wurtsmith, K.A. Sawyer, Kincheloe, Kinross, Selfridge ?) in the nineteen fifties and sixties.  Perhaps that is precisely what my grand mother and I observed.  I can recall being frightened enough by what I saw, that I didn't walk from the backyard down the driveway to the street where I could have watched the vessel in question fly across two or three hundred more yards of open sky before being obstructed from view by trees and houses.  Oddly, I don't recall having a conversation about our shared sighting with my grandmother on that eventful night or the next day.  I can clearly remember telling my parents on the following evening upon my return home, about what we saw, and becoming quite excited when the eleven O'clock news backed up my most unusual account.",,42.8497,-84.1454

This did not suprise us as an airport is nearby, and similar jet sounds are heard from time to time.  However, this sound continued well into three minutes, getting louder and louder, unlike any plane that passes by.  I looked out the westeren window of my family room and saw three blue-white strobing lights about 30 degrees above the horizon,  in a pattern which I will represent with an astrix and two periods:                   (     *    .                 .       )       The lower two lights would strobe together while the upper left light was off, then the upper left would strobe while the lower two were off, doing so within one second intervals. The sky was grey overcast, tempeture about 23 degrees.  I then noticed that the lights were stationary.  At arms length, the length of the formation was  approximatel;ly eight inches.  I called my wife in to view the lights. She agreed that they did not look li! ke any plane she ever saw before,  and why was it stationary?  I opened the window and noted that the roaring noise was comming directly from the object, but there were no visable exhust jets or any obvious source for the soise.  Through 7x35 binoculars,  the lights appeared similar to aircraft strobe lights, but very intense.  No shape or outline of any kind was detected.   As I watched,  the formation  seemed to be moving extremely slowly to the west, at a speed of perhaps only a few feet per second, barely noticable.  I watched for 9 minutes before it dissapeared behind the rooftops.  Just before it did, the light on the left moved or rotated towards the center light, almost merging, then returned to its original position.

This I did, and the woman on the phone who took my report stated that a man had called in from Huron Ohio that same morning to report a jet that had been so low and loud, it brook several windows. Huron is due west from my home if you draw a line to it, and this was the direction the lights headed.  My mother also heard the roar, and, although hard of hearing, went from window to window looking for a truck or something, but never looked up.  She lives directly west of us on the same line.

A split second later I realized that it was a hard edge reflecting light back towards me ,but not down.  We sailors always have binocullars available so I was able to get a better view immediately.  Being 50mm lens and having good light gathering ability I was able to see the bottom somewhat,; it appeard featurless.

I again watched it go slowely to the northwest  until it completely  blended into the night sky. It was easy to judge the hight and size due to it`s close proximity to the tower.

Carlisle PA sighting of a formation of lights - 3/27/97 I have investigated several similar reports from the Carlisle area.  There  is a club of ultra-light plane pilots operating from a small airport nearby. They like to play UFO games, and also fly formations.  The fact that the lights reponded when the witnesses flashed a flashlight is a sure giveaway.  Also, this sighting was near twilight.  Ultralights pilots are not licensed.  They are not supposed to fly after dark, but have lights for twilight.  They use Visual Flight Rules and almost never fly flight plans because they return to the same field from which they took off.  They are too small and fly too slowly to appear on radar screens, if at a distance are noiseless (or if the wind blows the wrong way) and may seem to hover, particularly if flying into a headwind.  I have been told by a member of this club that ""If you want to see a real UFO, you should see us turn our spots on and fly IN A CIRCLE,""  and he roared with laughter. How to identify possible ultralight formations: 1) the ""leader"" effect, wherein the lead plane (as with birds) moves around, but the others seem to be steady because they have someone to guide on. 2) unequal number of lights on each wing of a VEE (even number of lights or planes) 3) seen in twilight (although illegal after dark flights are sometimes made) 4) motor noises (but only if very close) 5) usually no motor noses, particularly if at a distance 5) slow or hovering 6) respond to lights or signals from the ground. Investigators should seek out local flying fields on a nice Saturday and make friends with pilots.  They are good sources of info, but be careful you don't give them any ideas. Conclusions: These sightingswere most likely ultralights. PS: I once spoke to an ultralight pilot who told me that in the ealry 1980s he belonged to a flying club which operated out of the airport at Stormville NY.  They even called themselves ""the Martians"".  He said a pix of their formation once made the New York Times.  A 1984 investigative article in Discovery magazine concluded that they were small planes.  He said that the small plane pilots also also tried UFO hijinks, with spots and Christmas lights, etc., but he said the ""real Martains"" were the ultralights.  They stopped doing it after literally thousands of commuters were stopping on roads and they were afraid they would be heldl responsible for traffic accidents.  These were the stimuli for the """"Hudson Valley UFOs"".  Of course, once people started looking up, they saw UFOs everywhere. There is an incredible amount of air traffic in the NY metro area. Delgado and Hynek's book ""Night Seige"" dismissed the Discovery explanation with only a couple paragraphs, yet included sightings with ""UFO motor noises"", no radar contacts, ""hovering"" etc. This book can't be taken seriously because of its dismissal, withouht much discussion, of the Discovery investigation. My acquaintance related this story to me and then roared with laughter, ""Now everybody's doing it"", he told me.",1998-06-18T00:00:00,40.189189427312776,-77.2037678414097

Both objects ran upward only to come back down right above the hilltop. they did this a few times before they went back down behind the hills. They changed colors as they went higher into the sky only to be more defining in shape. when close to the hilltop, the objects seemed more orange and yellow and where shaped like an ice cream cone, but as they got higher the color changed to a more blue and the shape was definitely oval and pulsed as it moved. My nephew thought it might be a military exercise, because we have a air force base right out of town, but I told him I did not think so, the military doesn't ever fly over housing areas, there were houses up on the hill, then we both were also confused because of the speed the objects were moving, then just coming to a dead stop after moving so fast so quickly> They seemed to be defying normal gravity.

I wasn't going to report this, except a neighbor in the area mentioned that her grown son had seen the same thing at the same time, and said the same thing we did:  ""That ain't right!  What IS it?""  I don't know if I'd recognize a UFO unless it landed in my yard. So, here it is....  If you look at a steel I-Beam from the end, it makes a capital I.  This thing had that shape, which didn't change no matter how it turned, and it appeared to be black. The top and bottom of the I were quite thick in appearance.  We thought it had to be a real quiet bi-plane style ultralight, as we see a lot of experimental aircraft flying up from the Arlington airport (some look to be little more than flying lawnmowers, to be honest, and make as much racket!).  But this had No Tail and No Visible Pilot.  It was a bit larger than an ultralight, and moved faster, at about the same rate a small plane would but was pretty manuverable (sp?).  We could see it circling the water treatment holding ponds across from the Dairy Queen in Stanwood (in the Viking Village/Red Apple plaza).  It then moved a little east over some fields and checked those out, then swung down south toward the Warm Beach area.  It was still light out, but it didn't reflect any light.  I'd have to say it was only 200 feet in the air.  If we had been coming down the hill from East Stanwood (which is about 200 feet higher than the downtown area), we would have been able to look down on it. (We do have biplanes in the area -- saw one today doing stunts over Pioneer Highway, but like I said earlier the whatsit had no tail and the top and bottom were very thick.  Too thick to be standard biplane wings.) My seven year old has much sharper eyes than I have, and she was going nuts trying to figure out what the devil it was, as it wasn't falling into any category of aircraft, powered or unpowered, that we had seen.  She's seen paragliders and hang gliders and she assured me it wasn't one of those.  I could make out the shape, but not the details, but she said there weren't any details for her little sharp eyes to see.  My 4 year old also saw this whatsit, but she is very speech delayed so she wasn't much help. Speaking of the four year old, coming back down from Mt. Vernon today at about 2:45 pm, she let out a squawk and pointed at the sky, saying something had burst out of a cloud.  I saw something streak back into the overcast, but didn't get a good enough look.  I figured it was just a jet.  Except within two minutes, some jets from Whidbey Island shot by in the same direction as the streak.  Maybe they were just practicing.  They have been flying A LOT lately over Stanwood, fairly low too.  Oh, you need a little about me.  I'm a 40 year old stay at home mom who wears contacts - one is a toric lense to correct astigmatism.  You see why I rely on my daughter to pick up the details.

From the hill where the church sat, I could see the terminal station of the Sao Paulo subway system. Suddenly I noticed an orange light that changed intensity, sometimes changing to red. I called my parents and the other church members who came out to see. We were there for about 20 minutes. The location of the light was exactly on the path of the Sao Paulo International Airport (Congonhas) final approach. As airplanes would align with final, the light moved very fast and dissapeared, to reappear when tha plane had passed. Later that evening, channel 5 (Globo television network) reported the incident and interviewed several eye witnesses, who reported the same story. They also interviewed officials at the airport who reported an ""unidentified object"" on the radar screens at the reported location. Airline pilots also reported seeing the object. No further explanations w!ere given, and airforce officials declined to comment.The date is approximate, since I don't remember exactly when it happened.

Under the 24 inch wide disk sits another 16 inch disc and under it another 8 inch wide disk.  The top and bottom and each side were symetrical. At first I though it was a bird, but a couple seconds latter in came into clear focus as we flew only about 200 feet away from it.  It was on the right side and roughly the same altitude, about 4,000 feet.  I am familiar with altitude as I have about 20 hours of flight instruction. It was definitely the most uniquely mysterious object I have ever seen, and I can't think of anything to explain it.

He gasped in disbelief when he (we) saw an approaching string of large white lights coming at us from the west heading to the east directly over the city of Jacksonville FL.  The row of lights (7 or 8) were evenly spaced and at the same hieght.  As they approached us they went straight up into the sky and while going up formed the shape of a large ""V"".  The ""V"" continued to go straight up into the sky until it was almost completed out of sight when a flash of light from either the horizon or ground shot up at the formation in an waverly line followed by a second streak of light.  We all sat there dumbfounded by the sighting.  My cousin who is a pilot stated that the light formation was not that of any plane over the US. and the entire time the formation made no heard sound. We all three never really pushed the issue until I had seen film footage of the sighting over Phoenix this year and what was filmed was almost exactly what we had seen.

I was returning home from work on a Friday afternoon.  A major thunder storm was approaching from the west.  Hozel road heads north from Swamp Road.  It then takes a 90 degree turn west for about 800 yards before intersecting Radio Road, which runs north.  About 300 yards prior to the intersection, I observed an object about 700-800 yards distant at tree-top level.  I took no immediate notice because there is a large blue-green water tower located in the general direction.  This tower, however, is only visible from Radio Road about 200 yards north of the mentioned intersection.  When I took deliberate notice, I observed a disk-shaped object with a small cylindrical superstructure centered on the upper half of the disk. This structure's top came to a point.  The object was silver in color but didn't shine; like lead. I saw no movement or heard no noise.  I glanced at the road then back at the tree-tops and the craft was gone.  This had taken seconds so I was not sure what had just happened (or if it happened.)  As I turned north on Radio Road, I glanced to my left, over a farmer's  field and again saw the object, this time almost totally below the tree-tops and on a sharp (45 degree+) angle (north side lower than south side of craft.) This was at about 300 yards.  From this point I could also see the water tower.  It was clear they were not the same object. The flying object did, however, closely resemble the top of the water tower in shape (definetly not in color or direction.) I turned my attention back to the road and once again, the object was gone.  Several months later, I was relating this story to my Brother-in-law and his girlfriend.  The girl got a little upset.  Talking to her, I found that her bedroom window looked out over this same field from it's northern edge.  She said she had occasion to witness bright lights coming from the field at night, more than once.",1998-06-02T00:00:00,41.2098,-80.4934

I turned east off the main road since there was another vehicle behind me in order to view the object. I was putting my car window down when I suddenly saw an aircraft to the left and above me. It measured four to five palm breadths and was a metallic bronze color with a narrow nose/head and a short fan shaped tail.  It was relatively flat with a rectangular shape with two rows of red lights and two rows of blue lights on each side and a single row of red or blue lights on the tail.  It passed over in five to six seconds and no engine sound was heard. When pulling out of my driveway on 09/19/97 to go to work, I turned north onto West Ave. and stopped at the stop sign.  A bright white stationary light caught my eye which I thought was an airplane against the west horizon. I remained stopped at the sign because the light was so bright. As I watched it, it appeared to stop and start very quickly several times.  I pulled away from the stop sign when I saw another vehicle behind me only to see the object speed off faster than any plane goes traveling in the same direction as my car.  To view it better I decided to turn off the main road in an east direction, put my car in park, shut off the radio and was putting my automatic window down when I suddenly saw an aircraft to the left of my car and above me.  Thinking this was the bright object I had seen, it would have been necessary for it to have made a sharp 45 degree angle in order for me to have seen it so quickly. It scared me tremendously and I remember reminding myself that there were other vehicles on the road at this time and I must not be the only one seeing this. With my car window down I was looking out to see the bright light but instead saw an aircraft that seemed unusual, rectangular in shape, large, ( it would have taken four to five palm breadths to cover the length) but not wide, (it would have taken one=half a palm breadths to  cover the width) It was a metallic bronze/chocolate color with a narrow head and fan shaped horizontal small tail compared to the large rectangular body.  No white light was visible and there was no sound made by the craft.  It seemed to move slowly above me taking five to six seconds  to pass and was not visible in the eastern horizon afterwards, however the area is densley populated with homes and large trees. I was afraid it was some type of military aircraft that had gotten off course and flying so low, I thought it would crash into the surrounding homes. Two rows of eight to twelve lights which were circular and not revolving or shining a beam were on each side of the craft. Each row was single in color and one row was red and the other blue but I cannot remember the sequence of the color.  The tail also had a row of either red or blue lights but were perpendicular to the craft and only five or six circular non-beaming lights.  The body of the craft was wider than the sides and angled down like a single step to the edges.  The lights were beneath each edge although I could not see the entire left edge of the craft. After it passed, I remember sitting in my car for several seconds wondering what it was and what I should do.  Not wanting to be late for work, I continued east on the side street to LaGrange Road thinking any aircraft that big and that low I would be able to see when I was past the trees and houses.  However, it was no where to be seen.  I went to work and returned home at approximately 1600  when I contacted the Federal Aviation Agency only to be told that most of their personnel had left for the day and they had no reports of unusual aircraft that day.  I contacted our local newspaper - The Daily Southtown - and asked about any reportings. They informed me they got their information from the local police and they had received none.  Not wanting any to think I was strange, I tried to find somewhere to report this without telling the police.  The local phone numbers for the UFO agency were disconnected.  Although I am reminded daily of the event, only today 12/02/97 did I find the phone number and web site for the National UFO Reporting Center due to a report in the Daily Southtown about another local sighting  of unusual lights two days ago.  I would like for someone to explain that what I saw was an experimental military aircraft or I would think perhaps others on their way to work may have seen the same thing I did.",1998-06-02T00:00:00,41.610895871559634,-87.86089633027522

Saw similar in Lake Geneva, WI 11/28/97 around 7:30pm.  Appeared to be an elxposion or electrical fire; presented with a huge red-orange glow that pulsated and flickered, but without sound.  Saw no craft, but noticed three electrical surges during this time period.  No reports of downed aircraft, substation fires or explosions to local authorities.  If you saw any similar display please report it here. After finishing dinner 11/28/97, a friend and I were watching TV in a condo on Lake Como near Lake Geneva Wisconsin.  There were suddenly three power surges/interruptions in rapid succession, but without any sound of explosive nature.  I got up to check out the electrical system, and noticed a huge pulsating red-orange glow to the northeast appearing to be just beyond the tree line near the lake.  However, no sound could be heard only the strange pulsating, flickering red-orange glow.  We went out to the balcony, but could not determine any more about the visualization.  We heard only one distant siren, but observed several autos heading down our cul de sac and on the roads nearby.  So we apparently were not the only ones to see this occurrence.  Since the weather was inclement, we did not got out to pursue this any further.  Unfortunately, we did not report this event to local authorities either.  I have since called the local police, but without any result.  I have contacted the Sun Times reporter in hopes of discussing his article and what we saw.  Possibly there is some reasonable explanation, but it seemed to be very strange and unworld-like!  The sighting in Will Co Illinois on Sunday 11/30 had similar characteristics.  The observer, a local businessman and pilot, reported seeing a brilliant ""fireball"" about the size of a full moon descend straight down form the clouds at about 125-150mph.  Within 20 seconds it disappeared. Authorities could find no evidence of any downed craft or debris.  Our experience was similar except that we saw no object/craft/etc and the color display lasted for about one hour.  The pulsating/flickering reached intensities that almost totally illuminated the night sky; then suddenly it would stop, start up again, vary in intensity, then flicker and pulsate wildly!  All without any sound!  My first impression was of some sort of electrical fire/explosion, space debris, a meterorite, or possible a UFO!  This event was witnessed by two adult males, approximately 50 years old, ! who had not been drinking, taking drugs, or otherwise mind altered!  One is a business man, the other(myself) a medical professional and student pilot.

I replied, well I don't think stars disappear. So we kept watching. Every 15-30 seconds it would appear in a different location but at the same level of horizon but many miles apart. This happened about 10-11 times. While this was happening there were 3 jets that would alternate flying west to east and circle back. As the jet got closer the light would reappear then fade. At one time as the jet appeared a smaller light left the light object as if a missle tracking a target. This light either circled the jet or just faded as it got closer to the jet. I commented to my wife that I was expecting an explosion as I felt it was just like the Patriot missle that would track and explode the Scud missle. As soon as this streamer light (which did leave a visible path trail) faded. 2 lights the same size reappeared and one was just above the other. They lit up for 3-5 seconds and then faded.

A spherical object  the size of a bowling ball swooped down in front of the windshield from behind and to the right of us, hovered and rotated(or rolled in all directions). The sphere was a melty blue and green metallic object with a luster, and was about the size of a bowling ball. My best friend and I were returning to So. Cal from a short vacation up north for the 4th of July. At almost half past midnight, Saturday night going into Sunday morning, we were on I-5 almost to the summit of the Tehachapi mountains when a spherical object swooped down from behind and to the right of me (on the passenger side) and stopped directly in front of the drivers side windshield, some 18 inches or so out from the glass. Despite our speed of travel, the rotating sphere appeared to be absolutely still and stationary,except that it was rotating freely in a rolling motion going in all directions. The object was quite beautiful. It reminded me of perhaps a metal globe which had gotten melty, and the continents and oceans were all melting together. It was blue and green, with a luster, but I would not call it shiny, as it did not seem to reflect light the way we normally see a shiny object do. I do not have the English vacabulary to vividly describe what we saw, because we don't have movement and color exactly like that in everyday life. The sphere stayed  in front of the window for maybe 45-50 seconds and then took off. The take off was really nice to watch. It zipped laterally away from us for a moment, momentarily forming a sort of tail, like an elongated teardrop. It then paused for a second (maybe 50 yards ahead of us) and recollected into a perfect sphere, and then shot off much faster out ond up and was quickly lost from view. Two things awed me about the object; how it was able to exactly match our speed so as to appear suspended, and how we were able to see it so well as it was above the hood of the vehicle (a Toyota 4-Runner) and well out of the range of the headlights. I don't pretend to know what it was, but it was quite beautiful, and I'm glad to have been able to observe it so closely, that had the windshield been absent, I could have leaned forward and touched it.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,,

Because of the fact that it was a country road, there were no street lights that would have been mistaken for the two lights. (We lived on that road, and were very familiar with any abnormalities).  We thought nothing of it initially (it wasn't something that was highly apparent).  My mom then turned to me and pointed it out, asking what it was.  I said that I didn't know.   We both went into a panic and she slowed the car down.  There was no sound coming from it, so it could not have been mistaken for an airplane.  We sat and watched it moving up slowly, then it flew up into the air maybe 200 yards, and flipped over completely, flying away at lightening speed.  I would guestimate that it was about 250 feet from one light to the next.   All I know is that it scared the crap out of us both, and nobody believes us to this day.

It was I judge to be at least 10 miles away and to have about 1500-2000 ft. of altitude.The light was similar to that of an aircraft light and I watched it just to pass a little time.I probably would have lost interest but the light started to fly with erratic movement.It traveled to the south and as it did it would move ubruptly vertically down and then back up.At the distance I would say that these vertical movements were anywhere from 500-1000 ft.The light continued to do this for maybe 1 min. and then continued moving south until out of sight.There was no sound and the sky was clear and no other aircraft were in the sky at the time. I thought of awakening the other members of my platoon but, it was my first field excercise with them and I didnt think that they would believe me or appreciate being woken from their sleep.I am presently in the Reg Army and I have been since 1990. I have seen military aircraft and civilian and I have never seen anything out of the ordinary since then. When it starded moving funny I moved so that there was a small tree brach between field of vision and the light,at first I thought that it was me moving up and down and not the light but, using the limb as a referance I decided otherwise.I didnt have the hair stand up on my back or anything like that but it just seemed very odd.I would be happy to answer any questions pertaining to this event.

My mother and two brothers were at home on a ranch in wisconsin in 1967, I was 9 years old at the time. I was a very active kid and did not nap at that time of day, but this day I was inclned to nap, as well as my brother. My mother recalls the door opening and felt someone appraoch her from behind but does not recall much else, or at least will not admit remebering. My father ran a cheese factory, he normally returned home at about 5:00 PM, but this day he arrived at about 3:30 PM, I awoke a few minutes before he arrived. He ran into the house shouting come out here look at this, a space ship was hovering above a tree near our house, it was about 50-60 feet from the house and the tree was about 18 feet tall. It hovered there for a while, then it began to move ouer our vehicle and toward our driveway. The vehicle was a green briar, a first version of a blazed type vehicle. Then he asked everyone to jump into the vehicle and we followed it out to the highway, our driveway was about 1/2 mile long. When we approached the highway I could see my freind across the street and his father, they did not appear to see it. It matched our speed but was about 150 ft off the highway over a field, it seemed to disapear when we appraoched the forest, but when breaks in the forest or dips / valleys appeared on the terrain the craft had matched our speed and was still there. We followed the craft to the main highway into Wausau Wisconsin, and at that time it abruptly took a right angle turn and took off at a slight angle upward and quickly disappeared. It all seems surealistic looking back, my mom is willing to admit the event, my day is not so willing. funny thing is he was excited at the time, but did not want anyone to say anything and it seemed to be forgotten.

There were 3 incidences in the summer of 1968. The first one is at dusk in the sky I saw 3 oval saucer shaped UFOs that appreared to be of a shimmering light almost like they were not quite solid is the only way I can describe them. They were over the woods nearby and if they were 20 feet in diameter they would have been approx  one half mile away. They moved forward and backward and zig-zagged back and forth. I heard no sound. I ran away  from the scene. The same month I saw a number of smcall red lights in the sky at night which lasted for hours and I heard neighbors commenting on them. They didn't appear to move much but would disappear then appear. There were over 20 or 30 of them more on the horizon of the sky than overhead. Within days of the above I saw an extremely bright starlike light directly overhead in the evening again. It appaeared to look like a shimmering star but was as big as the sun in the sky. Slowly over a period of maybe an hour it shrinked to the size of a small white light. I thought of getting my Bebe gun and shooting at it as it seemed only a few hundred feet up ( I was 16)  but my good sense prevailed.

I stood there looking at my brother but he was right in front, 5 feet from the window so I guess because he was lookin right at it he couldn't move.  I am a little more observant but the light got very bright and I could see the light wrapping around my brother.  This didn't take  long but it felt very long as the light got my attention and got me.   I remember  my eyes shutting with cray red light all around us in the room.  When I looked at my mom she was completely out, from the back of my older brother I could see he couldn't move. I woke up quickly in front of the window with the red ball still there as if staring, or wanting for me to see.

The four objects of medium luminosity were observed travelling at an undetermined height - but definitely greater than 10,000 feet in line abreast formation with uniform spacing between the objects.  It is impossible to determine their speed other than that they appeared to be travelling more quickly than a commercial airliner, but their speed was constant.  After traveling roughly 1/2 of the way across the visible sky, the formation instanteously changed to a diamond formation with no apparent change in the speed of any of the objects.  It was almost magical, in that it changed literally in the blink of an eye.  After travelling approximately 2/3 of the way across the visible sky the formation again instantaeously changed, this time into a line with the space between the objects considerably diminished.  As soon as this line was formed, in order each of the objects described a semicircular path with the first going right, the second left, third right, and fourth left. With the completion of the maneuver, the objects ended up in a line identical to the one observed just before the maneuver began.  As soon as the line formed, the objects again instantaneously shifted to a line abreast formation, and contined until I could no longer observe the objects.  Thoughout the entire process, with the exception of the semicircular maneuver (at which they appeared to move more rapidly) was there any change in the apparent speed of the objects.  As an enthusiast of military and sporting aviation, I can categorically state that no military or commercial aircraft that I am aware of can make the types of manuevers made by these objects.

It was in September of 1986 around the middle of the month, weekday, probably a Thursday between the hours of 1500 and 1800 CDT, most likely around 1600 to 1700 hrs.  I was driving north within the city and stopped for a traffic signal.  I looked up and saw what appeared to be something falling from the sky in a spiralling motion.  I was naturally quite curious and when the signal allowed me to proceed, I crossed the intersection and pulled into a then vacant business drive access.  I got out of the car and saw that the object was not falling but rather was moving in a southern direction by flipping end over end with a ""scooting"" motion between flips.  The object was metallic in appearance, cylindrical in shape with a small sperical apperature at both ends, rather like a majorettes baton, except not as elongated in the shaft and the tips being slightly larger in proportion to the baton.  I was intrigued by this motion and shape of the object and looked around to see if anyone else was observing this; though  there was plenty of traffic, no one else seemed to notice.  I then looked around in the sky and saw 2 jets travelling in the same southerly direction, but they were northeast of the object.  The jets were in a ""half-V"" formation and seemed to be moving at a speed and course congruent to a ""trailing"" flight.  The jets were at a fairly high altitude as they were quite small, but clear in appearance.  As I recall, it was a clear day absent of clouds, so I cannot accurately guage the altitude of the object itself.  However, as an ex-paratrooper I can safely say that it was not less than 2000 feet above the ground, but it could have been much higher as there was nothing in its immediate sky-space to relate it with, and it being an unfamiliar object, I had no mental reference of how large it actually would appear in relation to its distance.  If it was at the same altitude as the jets then it would have been immense in size, however the jets were sufficiently far enough away from the object to prevent an! eyeball comparison.  If this object had openings, lights or other ""decorations"" I did not see them, what I observed was what appeared to be a solid metallic object void of any rough texture, creases, etc.  The motion as described before, was ""graceful"" in that it took approximately 3 seconds for the ""rear"" sphere to become the ""front"" one, in relation to its direction of movement.  Then its ""scooting"" duration was about the same amount of time of 3 seconds, before it would engage another ""flipping"" motion.  When it performed this ""flip"", it appeared that only the rear sphere changed altitude in relation to the ground, so that the front one remained on the same plane.  There were no ""dips"" or gawky motions or changes in velocity, that I observed, by the object.  As it began to fade from view in the south, I once again looked around to see if anyone else was watching this, to my disappointment, there was still no-one that I could see looking at this strange sight.  When I reached my destination I used the phone to     contact the local airport watchtower (ATC?) and inquired as to the object.  The person to whom I spoke with related that they were not aware of this and that there had not been any other reports made of the object.  I described the object to him and he stated that he had no idea what it was. He sounded neither surprised nor condescending, just matter-of-fact.  I would be interested to know if you are aware of any reports  which match the shape/motion criteria of this report.  I was 32 years old at the time.",2000-09-17T00:00:00,37.7610706185567,-87.15569742268042

I made this trip almost every night for about 4 years. On Olgeby road there are a few house, and a Large Milk plant, most of the houses are farm houses and are surrounded by corn fields.  It was Early spring so th fields were just soil. I had made the trip to her house, dropped her off, and was on my way back home same path back just in reverse, I turned onto olgeby road and started to head down it, thise road is only about 2 miles long before it hit's S.Main.  It has so small hills heading up east and would be heading downward west.  So the road was higher in places, well as I topped the largest hill, I slammed on my breaks, because to the right of me about 35 feet tall there was this HUGE and I mean Huge Orange sphere hovering above the ground over the empty cornfield.  I stood there gazing at it out my passenger window.  I wasn't really scared just shocked that there it was just hovering there, there was no sound, and the light from it was lighting up about 50 feet around it.  I finally stepped out my car and began to look over the top of the car at it.  He just sat there, I watched it for a good 15 mins before I became spooked and felt like getting out of there.  My Brother lived about a mile down the street off of S.Main so i drove like a bat out of hell, got him in the car we went back and the object was gone.  I would estimate it's size to be from 60 to 70 feet tall, and least 120 foot round.  It wasn't smooth it had what looked like panels, but the seams couldn't be seen. Couple days later my brother called me and told me he had seen what i discribed floating over the river while crossing the harrison streey bridge. Just for the record i didn't experience any time loss, or haven't had any physical side affects from this. I also seen those large Orange balls in the sky back in Feb.

Just tonight I remembered seeing that object that night because of the recent sightings here in Rockford, I think they are connected, and I don't care what officals say about it.

Hello, I know 2 people who have, in my opinion, more information to that UFO sitting that was on tv.  The one where there were many small ufo's that formed a 'v' shape.  Remember?  Some people thought it was flares.  Then they each slowly disappeared behind the mountain they said. 1 of the people is in my friends band.  They had a party Saturday night, and I was talking to this guy who was friends with the person in the band.  He told me a lot of stuff I can't remember.  What I do remember is this.  He said he went on a trip with S((name deleted)) (The person in my friends band) and they were sitting out in the desert on private property called 'claims'.  He said him and S((name deleted)) were writing songs by a camp fire they lit out in the middle of knowwhere.  I forgot S((name deleted)) friends name, but S((name deleted)) friend looked up and saw many lights just above them.  He told S((name deleted)), ""S((name deleted)), look up and tell me what you see"" and S((name deleted)) was surprised as well.  Cool thing is, S((name deleted)) friend says they have this all on their cassette tape because they were recording song ideas at the time.  I rememeber S((name deleted)) friend saying that there were many lights that were fairly close to them.  He said he could of shot them with a 30 od 6 rifle.  He said each light was zooming from one place to another at too high of a speed for a person to handle.  The 'G' force would be too great for a person he said.  Then he said all the small lights formed a 'V' shape and took off towards, I forget what state or mountains he mentioned, but I bet it was the same place where everyone on tv mentioned they saw it. So to round this whole thing up.  I think these 2 guys have more information to add to that event.  I think they saw the UFO's before everyone else.  I personally believe them from talking with S((name deleted)) friend.  He had know reason to lye about this.  I was the one who said that they should call someone and report this because from the show I watched on this event, they never mentioned individual UFO's that formed the 'V' shape were on their own at first and zoomed around at great speed, then formed the 'V' shape. I told S((name deleted)) and his friend that I would search on the internet for them to see if I could find a place to report UFO's and that's how I found you.  You can call me, and give me a number to contact you after I get S((name deleted)) and his friends phone number.  S((name deleted)) friend says that he would love to tell what happened and even go back to the place he was at and do a film recording for you or whoever does that. I'll leave my information below.  If you call then I'll know you are interested.  I'll then get your number so I can call you back with S((name deleted)) and his friends phone numbers.  I don't have any of their numbers yet.  I will call H((name deleted)), who is the leader of the band S((name deleted)) is in and I will get S((name deleted))s number.  S((name deleted)) will have the phone number to his friend. See ya, and I hope I helped in this event, I'm sure someone would love to hear these guys story. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  No location in Nevada indicate by witness.

Object in cloud hovers/manuevers then lightening bolt strikes at same location. The following was taken from a post I often send to alt.ufo.reports: I only have one story to share but it has kept me thinking for about seven years now.  A sighting can be very informative if the observer notes not only what was seen but also the circumstances under which it was seen. I use to work for an amusement park in Valencia, California called Six Flags Magic Mountain. I was a senior in high school at the time and worked the summers and weekends (during school). This weekend the forecast called for thunderstorms and a high probability of showers. That Saturday I was on my lunch break when I sat in my usual quiet spot away from the crowds. It overlooked the intersection of the I-5 freeway (north/south) and the 126 (east/west). My view was to the east and toward a small range of mountains on the other side of the I-5. The mtn range is about 500 feet in height. At its base now sits an extension to the original industrial center (at the time a small plot of crops was growing at this particular location). At lunchtime there was a thunderstorm moving from north to south. It had already passed where I was but I could still see the lightning in the distance and the sky was entirely overcast. About 15 minutes after I sat down I had finished what I was eating and looked out at the freeway, at the range beyond, and then to the clouds. I was just passing the time I had away from my work when I saw something moving in the lower layer of the cloud formations. It was situated across the freeway and just above the mtn range (about 200 ft above the hill's peak). At first I thought it was a helicopter even though I didn't see a tail or rotor.  It was in nearly zero visibility because of the clouds. It was moving from north to south as though it were following the storm but from a safe distance (or so it seemed). It was inching southward (left to right), but at a speed non-constant and different from that of the clouds around it (this is probably why it caught my eye). It was a grayish tone (maybe metallic), elliptical in shape, maybe 25-35 feet in length, and had no distinguishing extrusions. If it had any markings on its surface I couldn't see them from this distance (it still seemed close). Patches of cloud would make it appear and disappear over what was to be a 2-3 minute interval. I watched almost unblinking at what I couldn't identify. I don't know why but the thought of a balloon or a blimp never came to mind and it could have been either if not for one last awesome maneuver. I might also add that the only sounds I heard included the occasional yell from someone on a ride some distance away, a light thundering to the south, and the hum of the traffic on the I-5. After 2-3 minutes of this, the craft shot up into the clouds like it had been attached to some long extended rubber band that I couldn't see. The speed was so fast (and the fact that the craft was already nearly engulfed by the clouds surrounding it) that, had I blinked, I would have certainly missed this last maneuver. There was no deformation in the craft that I noticed in the 2-3 minutes that I watched it. What I did see however was the deformation of the cloud as the movement of air suddenly displaced it. This was the one key piece of information that convinced me what I saw was actually there. The maneuver convinced me that what I was dealing with was not a craft of any kind I had ever seen. I thought this maneuver was the last of this sighting and that I'd never see anything this unusual again. I was wrong. I immediately looked at my watch hoping to record the exact date and time of the sighting, but all I could manage to remember was the placement of the second hand and only for a minute at that. This is why. I continued to look in awe over the freeway for some hope of an answer. Sixty seconds after the craft had shot into the clouds a small bolt of lightning (I couldn't even hear it at that distance) struck EXACTLY where the craft (above the hill's peak) had been situated.  I was sure this was no coincidence and I've thought about this sighting (the only sighting I've ever had) for years. I'm 25 and a student of architecture. My interests include design, models, computers, and tennis. I don't normally follow UFO sightings but I do post this story once in a while. I've lived in New Jersey for two years and in California the rest. I don't have a religion and I'm not superstitious. I like to keep an open mind, but I'm often skeptical.  This was just a story for others to read and I hope you found it interesting. I don't expect I'll ever see anything like this again. UPDATE (8/28/00): I decided to hike up to the top of the hill to see for myself what interest anyone would have with this particular location.  From the top of the hill I could see both the I-5 and 126 extending into the distance.  I could see one of Southern Calif. Edison's power stations (a whole bank of power line towers), the Rye Canyon Industrial Center, Six Flags Magic Mountain and basically a lot of new development.  I also found the well (a Wayside Equivalent Zone Unit) that was recently installed and which I had mentioned above.  It turns out Southern Calif. Gas Co. has a plant (and a few dozen wells) on the other side of the mtn range.  I think Southern Calif. Gas Co. probably owns the land this craft was hovering over.  I spent about 30 minutes on that hill and saw a lot of aircraft flying right over head (mostly civilian but also some military).  Both Burbank and Santa Paula airports aren't terribly far.  There has also been some controlled burning of brush on the site (typical of dry brush areas).",2000-09-17T00:00:00,34.42961198156682,-118.57039631336404

(can't tell how many). the Park Rangers pick up the alien body(S) and took then to their station. there, one of the rangers found a camera and took several pictures of the alien while it was lying on a strecher. (this is how they prove to me the story was real, i saw the picture which i describe below). i saw a picture of a alien body lying on a strecher in what looks like an infirmary. the body was lying supine on the strecher. i guess it has to be something like 4 1/2 or 5 foot tall. his skin looked something like grayish with a rose tone. he only have 4 fingers and toes on each extremity.  his upper extremities reached as far down as what looked to be their knees. his head was huge, having maximum enlargement at the inferior quadrant of his head. he had eyes that looked to be big and round(even do you can only see little thru a horizontal line defining what might looks like eyelids. his mouth and nose were in proportion to the proper anatomical positions just like on us humans. apart from that, body showed signs of first and second degree burns mainly to the left side of his body. (remember, the body was lying supine and cannot see the right side.) i was told that the military came and pick up the alien as well as the UFO and took then the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in the town of Ceiba wich is only 10-20 miles from the incident site. as for the Park Rangers, they were send back to the United States something early after the incident took place.

Both performed unlimited climbs until disappering. That morning, was warming up for a fitness test at a local track. I was facing West when I noticed two red lights cruising at a high rate of speed from the North (the direction of Jacksonville) to the South Southwest(towards Orlando). Best guess of altitude was +20,000 feet. Sky was completely clear, morning twilight was beginning in the East. Initially thought the two lights were from the same aircraft and the red lights would have been position lights on the left side of the aircraft. However, I noticed no strobe lights, beacons, etc. which are normally present on aircraft. At exactly the same time, a passenger plane took off from Daytona Beach Int'l giving me a visual reference in the sky. I realized the two red lights were moving even faster than I thought and were two distinctly seperate objects. As they passed the due West position in formation, they shifted, without changing speed. Object #1 made several sharp turns and course reversals, then shot straight up into the clear sky until completely fading away. Object #2 stopped and stayed stationary during the manuevers of object #1. It then spiraled around the first object as it climbed out of view. Both lights diminished as they traveled farther up into the sky (unlimited climb). Aside from the momentary noise of aircraft taking off, no other noise during the quiet, calm morning. I am a civilian and military pilot and familiar with various types of high speed/highly manueverable aircraft. Absolutely none have that capability. While observing, I immediately was able to rule out any known aircraft, atmosphereic phenomena (clear sky, stars visible) and due to the maneuvers, rule out anything like meteors, pulsing stars, etc.",2000-09-17T00:00:00,29.191653301886795,-81.03306603773584

Two friends and I were heading North/Northeast on New York RD about 10 miles outside of Leesburg, Georgia when I spotted something out of the back side window. All I saw were lights and I thought it was just an airplane, but I watched it anyway because no one was talking. I lost it behind the trees about 5 minutes later. We reached the end of New York Rd. and got out to sit and talk. We saw the aircraft again and it was hovering above the trees not far from us, and it was not making any sound. It would hover in one place and dive straight down and back up again very fast. Then it would move over a bit and do the same thing. It was very quick with its movements. I've never witnessed an aircraft moving in such a way as this one did. We soon lost it in the trees so we decided to drive in the direction it was heading, about 15 minutes later while heading south on Lesley Highway back towards Leesburg we spotted it again to the West of us near a radio tower. We followed it until it started to accelerate, at this point we observed a series of lights blink on and off. Three lights blinked on one side(?) and then 3 on the other. I do believe the lights changed too, from red to orange to white(not necessarily in that order). After this it quickly accelerated and disappeared. We didn't see it anymore after that. The 3 of us had not been drinking or using any kind of drug when we witnessed this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2000-09-17T00:00:00,31.7515,-84.1355

I wish I could remember the exact date, but I can't.  During this account abject will stand for the ""UFO"" and jet will stand for the chase planes.  Me and my roomate were laying on top of our apartement's roof.  We lived on the top floor of an old two story house and it was easy to step onto the roof from our stairs.  We were laying there talking when I first noticed a light VERY high in the sky.  It was coming from the west and didn't blink or change colors.  It was white and moving fast across the sky.  I know how to spot a satalite and this wasn't a satalite.  I pointed it out to my roomate and we both were watching it.  Then we noticed anouther craft flying behind it.  We both had been in the US Army and we could tell it was a jet.  You could just barely make out the wing's light's on the second craft.  After the first one went over we never heard a sound of the engine.  At first we thought it was due to the hight it was flying.  But after the one we knew was a jet got passed us we heard the second craft's engines.  The plane had already gotten almost out of sight when we finally heard it so it had to be going suppersonic!  But it never got close to the the first object.  The jet was definately giving chase to the object they were on the exact same flight path.  After both craft were out of sight we sat there and talked about what we had just seen.  Neither of us could hardly believe it.  A few minutes later we saw coming from the north a repeat of the first account!  But after the second ""object"" got passed us we noticed a second jet coming from the south on an intercept course for the second object.  The object blew right past the plane from the sout and the jet performed a high speed turn.  Neither jet ever got close to it. The first jet that waas chasing the the second object was also heard after it passed over us.  The second chase jet from the south never flew over our position so was never heard.  All three craft continued south until out of site. While I was in the Army I personally got to view many aircraft on the ground, taking off, and in the air at night.  The two objects were nothing I had ever sean before.  I was a Combat Medic and went all over the world.  My roomate was a Missile Specialist and also had seen many aircraft and had traveled greatly during his military career.  The only thing either of us could come up with was that the two objects were UFOs (I don't mean that they were Alien nature, just that they hadn't been Identified) and that a total of 3 jets had given chase.  Also that atleast two of the jets  were traveling at supersonic speeds and never got close to the objects. Object description --  The two objects were extreamly high and just looked like a white light. They never changed shape or color and never changed course.

The evening went great and I had a wonderful time, and yes during the show I was one of the & subjects who was hypnotized. Trouble is just before my wedding date, I believe it was the Thursday, I started having dreams of a very different nature.  I dreamt that I was awakened (as if I were right there in my body at that very moment  not like myself standing by my bed watching me wake up, rather I was in my body within my dream.) and there were two short people with huge eyes and what I found funny about that was that they did not have any eye lids or eyebrows.  It was hard to tell what they really looked like because it was dark in the room.  I cannot say that they forced me as much as I volunteered to follow them.  They spoke oddly without opening their mouths and before I could talk they would answer me.  I don't remember much after that until the time that I was sitting on a very low chair, the kind you would find in a kindergarten classroom.  Then I remember talking to them for a while and them telling me stuff about where they come from and then I don't know how the conversation started, but the next thing I know is that whatever the hell it was I was seated in became transparent on the upper half and I could see earth below me.  Then we swerved extremely fast, just like you do when you go around the corner on a roller coaster, except that I did not feel much of the turn.  Just then (I know it sound stupid) I felt like I was turning into water except without the water.  It or I was like what you feel when you get a mild electrical shock, except that it did not hurt and it felt warm.  The thing was it wasn't just me turning watery or melting which I think is more of an accurate description.  Everything melted too  the sun, stars, earth, and the next thing I remember is that I was hovering over some planet with domes on it.  I remember asking if we were going to go down there, but they said no, and then I remember nothing. I was not forcibly confined unlike the stories you hear, and at all times I remember the feeling of free will.  Yes I know what I am saying sounds crazy, but I cannot forgo the sounds, smells, touch, of every part of my senses.  Since last year I have read that you can remember more under hypnosis, and I am willing to go a truth test and be hypnotized again.  If I did experience this, I am sure my dreams of this are somewhat fantasized of what actually happened to me, if anything at all.  But then I have been drawing stuff like triangles within triangles.  I asked my friends if at any point the hypnotist even suggested to myself or anyone that we were on a UFO, but all of them said that that never happened, also I remember everything from the comedy club.  My guess is that the best scanerio is that we can actually find out where they live, and the worst case is that I am pronounced as a stupid fellow with nothing better to do with his time but to dream the fantastic and scream wolf!

I reported this event here and also worked with a local mufon investigator. Since that event occured I have had a host of very strange phenomenon happen to me.I have been shy talking about these things but after confering with Peter Davenport about this situation occurring to me now, from what I beleive is a result of my interaction with this object back in December. He assured me that this would be valuable follow-up information about this whole phenomenon. About two months after my encounter/sighting all of the moles on my body began to fade then completely disappear, too date five moles have completely disappeared and nine more are in different states of fading. About five months after this event occured all of the hair on my arms and legs began to change to light blonde en mass. I have medium brown hair and am only 29 years old. Although I originally considered premature greying I began to notice the individual hairs changed color from the root upwards and when the hair started to change it took about 5 days for the complete hair change the top of the hair fading from medium brown to reddish to blonde  , so it was not as if it was growing out this color and no amount of sun exposure has ever caused lightening like this on me before,also the hairs that have changed colors have actually changed in consistency they were originally a medium coarseness and now they are feather soft fine. About two months ago my spider veins in my legs began to fade and now one that I have had for about 5 years is completely gone and another is fading rapidly. Since this has occured I have had 'dreams'almost nightly of entities who talk to me and claim to be intelligent species from somewhere else and they keep trying to give me strange information I don't understand. I have woken up a few times and caught myself uttering some language that I have never heard before but I have ruled out speaking in tounges because it seems this  'language' seems to have structure and form. I also throughtout the day have feelings of hot and cold in different parts of my body, I get pulsating feelings on the bottom of my feet up my legs down my arms and on the palms of my hands.Sometimes this pulsating becomes so intense it is painful.

For the past four months from May until Sep (now) I have been making a weekly commute from Washington D.C.s Ronald Reagan National Airport to Atlanta Hartfield Airport.  I go on Monday to Atlanta and return generally on Friday evening from Atlanta to D.C. On July 21st at or near 18:15PM EST I was riding in first class on Delta flight 1402 (757 service) in seat 3C (window) on the right side of the aircraft.  It was very cloudy most of the way and the aircraft was flying around a large thunderhead. The aircraft was flying at 31,000 feet at around mach .84 (520Mph or so).. the pilot announced this. I was looking out the window watching the massive thunderheads roll by. I noticed a grey metallic triangular shape hovering inside a thunderhead that had a lot of lightening activity.  The pilot was giving this cloud formation a relatively wide birth and the cloud formation was about 500 meters to the right of the aircraft.  It was quite bumpy and the captain issued a seatbelt warning for turbulence in the area. I kept watching the unidentified aircraft .. trying to determine if it was a ballon cage, a weather balloon, or some other known aircraft.  I could not recognize what it was .. nor am I familiar with an aircraft that can hover at 31,000 feet inside a very active thunderhead without grave risk. I stood up to see if anyone else was noticing what I saw and nobody was looking out the window.  Note that there were no blinking lights on the aircraft though it was quite visible if you were looking below the airplane and to the right just inside the thunderhead. I never said anything to anyone .. though I do know the co-pilot quite well.  I fly on her route very often so we always say hello.  I have been thinking about asking her about this event when I next run into her.  Otherwise .. I have kept my mouth shut because most people just think you are wacky when you say you've seen something unidentifiable in the sky. As an Engineer I live in the world of the rational.  Technologically we have a long way to go and there is a great deal of innovation and secret activity at both commercial and governmental facilities.  I would never.. ever just assume this was an extra terrestrial space craft (it was too small for one thing) .. my view was that it was about the size of a 737 aircraft or smaller. Anyway .. thats my UFO sighting. Nothing glamerous .. but definately something outside my experience.  I do have a very strong interest in both commercial and military aircraft (historical and in development) and this wasn't something I was familiar with. Thanks ((name deleted))",2000-09-17T00:00:00,,

Sighting Date/Time: August 5, 2000, maybe 11:45-12:10PM Sighting Location: Sighting occurred while on the beach of the Minnesota river, approx 3 miles E-NE of Le Sueur, MN Sighting Description: We were fishing on the bank of the Minnesota River.  We had all been watching for satellites and had even had 2 in perpendicular orbits pass real close to one another (2"" at arms-length I'd estimate) and there was about 5 of us seeing it. We all thought that was cool. August also sees an increase in meteoric activity, which we all took in. Skies were mostly clear, humid, 70F, 1/2? moon in the West. I had been left on the shore to watch the catfish lines while my friends went back to town to get another 4X4 truck. I sat, watching satellites go by, and the frequent falling stars, when I looked North to the lowest part of the spoon in the Big Dipper constellation. I watched a light become bright as it moved in what would become a S-SE direction. I assumed, that the increase in light intensity was due to the sun's position below the horizon, and the satellite entering the light from the long-set Sun. (We know that as satellites move into the Earth's shadow, the light fades and they disappear. And I grew up in the country with my dad's 8"" reflector Celestron with the Earth-clock tripod, so I know my way around the stars well enough to hold the evening's conversation.) Anyway, as I watched the ""satellite"" move, I noticed that it was a slower speed than any of the (at least 6) satellites I had observed in that evening, and suddenly I saw another appear behind it, maybe 1/2"" at arms-length at perhaps 4 o'clock as looking at a clock. I thought that this was a treat, since seeing two satellites in such proximity is rare, (if not totally regulated ""illegal"" by some NASA trajectory-assignment committee). From the time I saw the first, until the second appeared, was possibly 20 seconds. At this point, they may have been 3/4 of the distance through an arc between the horizon and a vertical axis going up through my body. As soon as I saw the second, I had two reference points moving in the sky, and was immediately aware that the speed of one was erratic at best. Using the stars in the background, I was then able to verify that they traveled less a trajectory, but rather in a meandering direction, neither holding a constant speed at this point. The second never passed the first. Then, as they were at a point I would describe as 11 O'clock, I saw the third. I felt a rush of disappointment that everyone had left. I watched the three lights, and I hate to try and judge their altitude, but I would put them as ""orbit"". If you were to hold a 30/60/90 triangle up in the air, with the right-angle facing to your right, that is a good representation of the ""formation"" they tried to hold, and the hypotenuse of the triangle would be no larger than an inch at arms-length. They all seemed to ""inch-worm"" across the sky, all wavering slightly in direction, still traveling at what must have been an ungodly speed, with conservative accelerations to what seemed to be trying to preserve the formation. At this point, I had been watching them for probably 2 minutes, had taken off my glasses, looked away, shook my head, opened a 7Up, looked back and they were all still there. I shouted at them, waved, screamed at them that their formation looked shitty, and began to realize that the third, the dimmest of the three could not keep control. The second seemed to act as a ""chase-plane"", like the Tigers that follow the Shuttle's entry.  Sometimes, the second would slow to alongside the third, making equilateral triangle, sometimes drop behind, but not for long. It seemed intent on trying to hold its own position in the formation. I hate to say it, but it seemed like none of them were keeping control. I watched them for what I would estimate as 4.5-5 minutes, as they crossed the arc of the sky. It actually became boring, as I wanted to see some of those eye-blinking accelerations I have heard of. But they continued to stumble their way across the sky at from my vantage seemed a languid, haphazardly jaunt. They faded out of light in the S-SE, as would a satellite re-entering the Earth's shadow. That's one of the reasons I say their altitude was orbit-level.",2000-09-17T00:00:00,44.4354,-93.845

It was about the size of a star in the sky, and just about as bright, a little hazy.  Airliners were visible at lower levels traveling slower than the light.  It still looked like a satelight then it made a sweeping turn to the East, Satelight do not make turns, and faded out of site.  The object appeard to be above 80,000 ft. because of the hazy look to the light.  There were no blinking lights, no flashing lights, just a steady bright light.  It was moving faster than the airliners heading north to Seattle and considerably above them.",2000-09-17T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

Then the object looked like it landed, but shot up in the sky, flipped around, almost in a full circle. I watched it swing out towards the fields I was driving past, then turned and seemed to CHARGE THE FREEWAY.  It was a rectangular object -- about as long as a pickup truck. It consisted of nothing but this grey strip. It had about five lights on it -- when I saw it in the distance they were white.  When it was coming towards the freeway, they were blue.  It was heading east towards my car, I thought this thing was going to run me off the road.  It was flying extremely low to the ground.  I just kept driving, and I passed it.  I was going about 70 mph.  I lost sight of it after that -- I kept driving but could see no sign of it in any of my car mirrors.  It seemed to disappear.  I looked around at the other cars on the freeway to see if anyone had seen it -- no one else stopped.  I flipped on the radio to see if anyone reported seeing the same thing.  I am unaware of any reportings. There was a heavy meteor shower that night, I saw lots of shooting stars. This happened just as it was getting dark.  When I saw it look like it was landing, it was late dusk -- by the time I had driven past it it was dark.

I first saw ""Blinky"" close to a jet aircraft contrail on 8-16-00 at about 2015. Blinky then ascended straight up out of sight. The following evening, he returned at approximately the same time. Blinky first appears to look like a star, and as descends he gets brighter, hovers for a few seconds, then ascends almost straight up and dims out. On some occasions, 3 times over the last 2 weeks, Blinky hovers over what appears to be a cell phone tower in the western sky. Then slowly leaves over Lookout Mountain, to the west. On 8-18-00, after Blinky made his appearance, we had a very strange lightening storm. No rain, no wind, no thunder, just constant flashes over about an hour, coming from one small cloud in the southern sky. This included ball lightening. Looked like a fireworks show coming from this one small cloud that remained motionless. We nicknamed him ""Blinky"" before we found out he already has the nickname ""Bubba"". He is real regular, always on time, and does pretty much the same maneuvers. He looks just like the videos of Bubba that are on SkyNet. Haven't seen Blinky now in 3 days. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the witnesses are observing.  Our first guess would be that the object is a celestial body, but they do not move in the manner described.  We doubt whether the object is related to the storm activity cited, but that is a presumption.  UFO's generally do not appear in one area so frequently that they are given names by the locals.

The past week on our vacation we had been car camping and traveling from our home in San Diego to El Paso Texas, North to Albuquerque, West for two nights and one day at the Grand Canyon and back to San Diego. Lake Havasu was hot. So hot, that night I could not go inside the tent with ((name deleted)), but layed on a picnic bench on our campsite with only a pair of swim trunks on. The picnic bench had a metal top with holes, coated with a thick lacquer. I woke after some time and noticed a large black tent not more than 20 feet from me. I layed on the bench with my eyes half open wondering how someone could have set up this tent without waking me. As I layed there I was aware of quite a lot of activity around me, and in the area. Around dusk another group had set up their camp several sites distance from us, so I assumed they were just a bunch of happy campers milling around the area. At least they were not playing music or talking, or ((name deleted)) would be having a fit. The tent was black. So black, I would call it theatre black. I was thirsty so I woke a little more, sat on the bench facing the tent and puzzled over it. It stood approximately 20 feet tall. The top came together in a pyramid, tight woven fishnet, high tech material. The base was approximately 30 feet square, the sides were not vertical, so the top was a ten foot pyramid with a 30 foot base. I walked over to my car and opened the hatch to get a plastic gallon jug of water. I took a long drink of the hot water, as much as I could stand, and closed the hatch. I figured I had woken my girlfriend in our tent a few feet from the car, so I asked her if she was awake. She did not reply. I figured she was giving me the silent treatment because she was ((angry)). She had been complaining about all the noise in the area, and earlier woke me when she said I was playing my radio. It was someone on a boat on the lake, so I told her so and went back to sleep. There was a lot of activity around me although I couldn't see anyone. At night I carry a flashlight. Near a bush where I heard footsteps, I shined the light on it. I saw nothing and the movement stopped. Someone might ask, ""weren't you afraid?"" For some reason I wasn't. Camping in remote areas can get kind of spooky at night, thinking you are hearing something outside the tent. I tend to feel a little more secure in state campgrounds. I have night vision and a gun. Both were in the tent. But because of my girlfriends bitchy attitude I didn't go in our tent, risking waking her. I wanted to walk nearer the large black tent, but I am cautious about respecting other people's camp. I moved around our area to get a better view of it, the entire time sensing movement and hearing footsteps in the hard gravel. I went back to the park bench and layed down on to as I did before. Soon I was asleep. I woke again. The tent was still there, the same activity near us. I asked Mary if she was awake and I saw her flashlight in our tent. I knew she had looked at her watch, so I asked her what time it was. She said it was 1:30. The park bench was very uncomfortable and it seemed to be a little cooler. I thought it might be cool enough to sleep in our tent now, so I opened it and went in, layed down on our air mattress and went to sleep thinking I would wake early to get a better look at the large black tent at the campsite across from ours. I awoke just as the eastern horizon was lightening. This time of year, it gets bearable at about 3 am. However I swear I can feel the heat coming on about 15 minutes before sunrise. I woke my girlfriend and she agreed we would break camp. I opened our tent. The large black tent was gone. The camp area was silent. As we were tearing down our campsite and packing my car, I told her of the tent and the activity. She agreed there was a lot of activity in the area, so much that she had put earplugs so she could sleep, yet we heard no talking or music in the campground. We both walked onto the campsite where the black tent was. I wanted to verify the site was large enough for a tent the size I had seen. It was. We searched for impressions in the hard gravel, although the gravel was so hard you could park a loaded semi truck on the site without leaving an impression. We saw no evidence. --- East of Gallup New Mexico is a natural formation called Church Rock. There is a state campground there, Red Rock State Park. We hiked as close as we could get to the Church Rock formation, and as we were returning to our campsite we came across this interesting footprint: ((URL deleted))",2000-09-17T00:00:00,,

He told me he had watched it zip back and forth (east to west), quite a bit, but that it had been stationary for around thirty minutes before I got there.  Just looking up in the sky at it, it looked like two stars, one on top of the other.  When I looked through his binoculars, I was really surprised!! I had never seen anything like it!  It was a bright red and turquoise! (bluegreen)  It was kind of flickering the colors, and I didn't know if it was me moving the binoculars a little or if it was kind of jiddering a little.  I watched it a few minutes then brought down the binoculars.  I could still see a flash of red and then turquoise.  It was only one object and my friend said it was shaped like a bracelet.  He could observe it closer when he watched it zipping back and forth with the binoculars.  We were ""in town"", but the object was at a 45% angle to the east (kind of south too), which would have placed it over wooded areas.  There's a river east of us about 20 miles....don't know if it might have been over it or not. Best I recall, there was red on the top and bottom, and the turquoise color was in the center.  It didn't effect us other than fascination!  I'm 51, and I've NEVER seen anything like it before!  Wish I knew if others had.  I watched it till daylight, then I couldn't see it any more.

The week before the airshow (Thunder in the Heartland Aug 26-28) at Offut Air Force Base, while taking children to school I observed a black tear-drop shaped silhouette aprox 1-5 miles away.It appeared from behind the trees and disappear behind another set of trees. The craft was flying slowly from the SW to the South. The teardrop shape was oriented so that the smaller pointed end was the front of the aircraft. It gave me the impression of being slow and ponderous. I did not observe any tail section, propellors or rotors. Since it was a side-on silhouette I would not have been able to observe any wings. As it flew behind the trees I pointed it out to the driver of the vehicle I was in. We waited for it to come out from behind the trees but, it never did. ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the sighting occurred close to an Air Force base, our first consideration would be that the witness might have observed an aircraft. Since the sighting occurred just days before an air show seems to emphasize such a possibility.  The shape of the object is reminiscent of the fuselage of a Hughes 500-series helicopter.  However, that is only a guess.  We will attempt to pin down the precise date of the sighting.  PD))",2000-09-17T00:00:00,41.13068108108108,-95.92197162162161

My husband and I sit on our back porch many evenings. For 3 of the past clear nights we have observed in the sky an object we cannot identify. This evening it was first seen again at about 20 - 30 degrees off the horizon, in the western sky. The object appeared to be round in shape, with blinking red and green lights. It would move slightly about 5 degrees first to the north,then south,the east and west. Then it moved very slowly downward, as if perhaps it might land somewhere. We could still see it in the sky, but very low. We called the tower at the Portland Jetport to report tyhis unusual sighting. We asked if anything could be observed on radar. The gal told us there was only one plane that could be seen on radar. We also saw this same plane she was referring to. This was NOT the same object we were observing, but another.There was nothing else shown on radar. The gal suggested we call your center  to report sighting. My husband and myself are both self employed professionals. We are also intelligent, sane people. We both are in our early fifties.

On the night of August 25th, my 14 year old son and I were returning home from football practice.  As we were headed in a northerly direction at approximately 21:30 MT, my son exclaimed, ""Hey Dad,what the heck kind of aircraft is that?""  As I looked out the driver side window, I saw exactly what he was puzzled over.  About 1000 feet up, directly over the city was what appeared to be a saucer or disk-shaped craft.  This craft had, what I can best describe as a white, strobe-like light on top. Around it's entire circumference was a rotating orange band which seemed to revolve in a clockwise motion around the object.  What was even more interesting was that this object then turned off the strobe effect and it's rotating orange light.  At this point in time the craft was roughly 300 yards away from our car and we had been viewing it for about 1 minute.  It then appeared to assume the conventional aviation lights of a small plane!  As we turned west to continue the drive home, my son said ""Look, that thing is following us!""  It seemed to be keeping a parallel course with the route we were taking.  As we pulled into our driveway, it remained on it's current course and we quickly lost site of view.  The total viewing time of this incident was between 2 and 3 minutes.  I am a computer specialst by trade and my son is a bright, mature, and fairly average teenage kid who dislikes being the center of attention.  The only reason I'm reporting this incident is because we felt it so bizarre and it needed to be archived somewhere.  We live about 5 miles from a small airport and see aircraft in the night sky all the time, but this is the first time I've seen anything close to this......!",2000-09-17T00:00:00,40.42783368055555,-105.1976295138889

This was a big, white sphere with a black spot on one side rotating counterclockwise. It looked like a spinning eyeball tumbling through the sky faster than any airplane I've ever seen. It also ""fuzzed"" in and out of focus while we watched it, ranging in clarity from hard/shiny like a silver christmas ornament to soft/fuzzy like a white cotton ball. It was also impossible to guess how big this thing was or how far away. A Sunday afternoon when the freeways were full of people going home after a day out at the malls or wherever. We were heading east from downtown and were just going over that big spaghetti bowl where the I-10 jacks into that freeway headed towards the Army base, starting to go north along the east side of the mountain. I thought at first it was one of those plastic grocery bags being whipped along in a real high thermal, thinking it was going real fast for that. Then I saw it was big, shiny, solid, tumbling, real high, supersonic speed. Wait: small, fuzzy, soft, close. Hold on, it keeps changing! What the hell is that thing? Like a big, crazy, weird, spinning eyeball. It's really moving on, too. I hope it's one of ours. It's almost out of town, it's gone. Take me to the crazy house cause I'm hallucinating. It either popped like a balloon or got shot out of here like a rock in a slingshot. Maybe straight up or at a slant up and north over White Sands, hundred-thousand mile-an-hour. Somebody tell me what the hell that was! I still wouldn't believe to this day I had really seen something like that except that there were four other people in the car who saw it, and doubtless thousands of others in the thousands of other cars on the road with us. Also, the Nasa T-38's at El Paso International Airport, the ones that escort the shuttle in on its piggyback ride when it lands in California, they were circling around the airport like a bunch of buzzards because what they had gone up to chase was long gone. To top it all off, the driver of the car was a retired Army lifer with all kinds of spooky top-secret clearances for his job he had for years on White Sands Missile Range. We'd just finished a 3-week running debate about UFO's a couple days before this. He described his job, his clearances, and how he'd seen everything there was to see ""out there. And there ain't no such a thing as no little green men!"" He had me convinced for the first time in my life, and kind of depressed at the idea that maybe we really are alone in the universe. I'm glad it only lasted three or four days. He was asking me over and over ""What is that?What is that?"" When it was gone, I had to rib him: ""You tell me, Mr.Top-Secret Man. It was something, you wouldn't ask what it was if you hadn't seen it, an Object! You gotta admit it was Flying awful god**** fast. And until you tell me what it was, (cause you know about everything and I'll take your expert word on it), it was Unidentified! A UFO.""  I think he's still mad at me for that, and still won't admit it was a UFO. But I saw the damn thing, Nasa saw it, everybody on the freeway saw it, and probably everybody in Juarez, too. They can't go on saying millions of us are just crazy or stupid forever. So I'm sticking to my guns, and I'm never gonna shut up about it, and I'll never stop trying to find out what it was. It changed the way I understand reality forever. I don't know about the UFO's other people have seen, I only know ""mine"". Just give me ""mine"" and I'll be happy and go away quiet, dammit. Until then, you organized UFO people keep up the good fight, I'm with you all the way. And help me find ""mine"" if you get time.",,31.7923281835206,-106.3748488764045

My daughter and myself went outside to see and at first it looked like a jet with a stream coming off it.  We said that it was a jet and my grandson said that no it was not, that it was taking its tail with it.  We looked again.  It was moving horizontally very fast across the sky with no jet noise.  It was luminous, yellowish and very bright.  It was roundish in the front and then had like a long tail coming off and tapering down to very small.  Kind of like a sperm shape.  It looked like one thing and never changed its length or shape.  Where it tapered I could see waves of energy moving in it.  It was very beautiful looking.  It appeared out of nowhere in the east and moved across the sky under the sun to the west and then went down behind the mountains.  On 8-28-00 on the way to Calistoga my husband and I saw what appeared to be the same thing in the sky but it was higher up and further away and we were driving and didn't get that good of a look at it.  It too though was not changing its length or shape. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed on these two nights.  We recommend that witnesses, when they see something unusual, stop their car and either get out of the vehicle, or open its windows, to view an unusual object.  Being stationary helps the witness establish whether the object is moving, or stationary.  Also, glass can distort the appearance of an object.  These witnesses may have done that.

When I put my scope (8 inch) on it, it became clear that this object was something strange. It consisted of orange globes of light that formed lines between themselves and connected themselves to each other by these lights.  The lines of light  moved around erratically as the globes themselves changed colors. The object was slowly moving and changing shape over and over again as it just moved around up there in the sky.

I was 16 , got up for drink and looked out kitchen window. White Ball of light huge floating in diagonal toward me and coming lower near hill in fron of my house . It stopped in mid air , and was close . I FELT it had seen me . I was frightened , ran to get parents , screaming ( they did not respond and garbled nonsense ) I was shouting to them GET UP THERES A SPACESHIP OUTSIDE "" They did not hear or get up at all. I ran back and FELT the spaceship was  speaking to  me inside my my head and told me not to be frightened .I was every frightened . Riveted to the floor with my mouth gaping open and just staring . Trying not to believe my own eyes , blinking them shut , opening them again  to check I was not mad . I still screamed out for my parents and they did not come . Then the fear I gave up , and words of YOUR SPECIAL _ DONT BE FRIGHTEND boomed in my mind . It came from the spaceship and I felt energy and calmness all of a sudden .  I asked them to tell me they knew I was talking back and to move the craft when I said so . It did . It did a triangle for me , and then again . It wa so bright and I felt strange . I found myself later in my kitchen at Dawn , sun coming up. I waited by the radio for BIG WORLD NEWS that never came , became withdrawn  and concerned  for myself all by myself for a few weeks that no one else was coming forward . My parents  asked me what the hell I was screaming at them for to get up and confirmed they remembered  something I said about a UFO . My parents under any other circumstances would have whooped by butt and got right up out of bed  for yelling as hard as I was , so I beleieve they were knocked out by something. Greymouth where I saw this , is 13 miles direct south east  of Kaikoura , where I learned 15 years later  while watching a TV show of the white flying objects seen by AIr New Zealand near there.  Famous video footage I believe . I knew  the  that I  had seen the same craft and much closer than they did , in the same dates, but I also had them talking to me for ! years to shut up so I did that , and still feel strange doing so  . They took me away it seems becuase I lost all these morning hours . . I saw more people inside ( approx 20 ) all lined up behind and infront of me , we had to take showers that didnt use water . They said they were us from the future ,historians  trying to learn from the past. It changed my life forever , and I still cry if no one I ever tell this story to is willing to accept my truth or believes me. It is so fraustrating . I am 37 now.  Aliens to me are not scary , and shouldnt be to anyone else .  Teachers , timetravellers or messengers , the ones who talked to me when I was sixteen feel sad  that we are such cavemen especially in our attitudes of all things on Earth ( for example they said - when we mine the gold , quartz , coal , oil , crystals etc  removing and displacing resources  from their natural habitat to all parts of the globe , we are  denaturalising the  skin of the planet . We have wrecked the weather and  many  important magnetic fields doing this ). Aliens as we so call them , also observe us as animals as we are so unclean , full of disease and boast rather  digusting habits , sport loose dangerous ideas, politics and morals . They believe we disrespect too many other creatures that we live with to prove their point, and that we are not every smart, even the greatest of scientists on earth .  They believe we are too primitive and immature as an evolutionary race right now to communicate  with and that we could not handle the truth  about ourselves at this time . They feel happy to share with humans and will gladly teach them things if they are willing to be taught .  They also believe we  can all understand the bible and the analogy of Jesus life as nothing more than the best description of ""Love "" and alot of "" how to live and think on the planet Earth "" ever written by  human beings  probably touched by the same truth ,and the same light. It may be considered wild  by some that Id say all this , but its got to be said ust to get it off my cheast after all these years . Id know there are others out there who have had the same meetings as I have . I have read some of their books and learned that others have heard the voice of an alien as well . Just not all of them actually got to see the source of its projection first . f anyone has , Id be happy to know your there .",,,

It was approximately  2110hrs.  I was south-west bound on sr22.  Just as I approached the perry/muskingum border, I noticed an unusual object in the north sky at a very low altitude.  I pulled my car off the highway and shut it off.  As I climbed out of the car, I noticed that it was even closer than I had thought.  In my estimation, it was approximately 500' north of my position and 250' in altitude.  The craft was completely soundless.  It was shaped like an octagonal or hexagonal cylinder.  It was dull metallic in color maybe the color of titanium or aluminum.  There were no windows or doors, the only distinguishable feature on the outside was a small dome on the bottom west-facing end of the craft.  There is a road across the sr from my position and several times during the sighting I wanted to try to get someone's attention, but terror, fascination, and the fear of it disappearing before I got back prevented me.  As I continued to watch, the dome on what I assumed to be the front of the craft(west-facing end), began to strobe.  After a few minutes or seconds, things begin to get unclear here due to the huge amounts of adrenaline pumping through my body, but another craft approached from the west.  It stopped abruptly at approximately the same altitude and a couple of hunderd feet to the west of the first.  This craft was not shaped exactly the same as the first, but it was similar.   The only thing I remember for certain about the second craft was the presence of the same type of dome on the east facing end which also began to strobe.  This contunued for a few seconds, I would guess, and then they both began to drift north as if they were connected.  I watched until they drifted out of sight.  As the fear began to subside, I realized what an amazing event had just unfolded before me.   The entire time this event took place, not one car passed which may not be that significant considering the fact that this is not a busy highway even ! during t he day.  I just wanted someone else to see it.  I am not saying that this was a craft from another galaxy, planet, or dimension, what I am saying is that I saw what I described, exactly as I described it.

We departed Loring AFB approximately 2300 and the sighting occurred at 35,000' on an approximate heading of 230 degrees while transiting southern Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.   There was a bright moon and at that altitude, very clear.   The object appeared as an intensly bright point of light at an azimuth of about 60 degrees and 30 degrees left of the nose of the aircraft when first noticed by the pilots.  As they were discussing this over the interphone they noticed movement.   The navigators went to the cockpit thinking it was a star.  After consulting their charts and tables they concluded what it wasn't!  Sirius, the brightest star, was below the horizon and they stated this was far brighter than any star.   The gunner and I went forward to get a look and I have to agree that it was extremely bright, blue white in color and appeared far above us.  Note:  The gunner sat forward in the crew compartment and operated his equipment remotely in the B-52G.   While in the cockpit, the four of us watched the object change position from about 30 degrees left of the nose to almost dead ahead without changing its elevation.   The gunner and I returned to our positions to accomplish mission requirements.  Interphone conversation included speculation and keeping the rest of the crew updated.   It disappeared after five or so minutes.  After all these years, I don't remember how it disappeared.   As I recall, this happened just before the great blackout the night of Nov 9-10, 1965.

I know this is an old sighting, but I've never reported it before and have to get it off my chest!  ... I was driving south on Rt. 70S (now Rt. 270) and had just gone under the Shady Grove Road overpass.  The day was gloomy, almost like a foggy-rainy day but it was not raining; the clouds just seemed to be very low.  As I came out from the underpass, I saw this ""big thing"" above me.  It had no wings that I could determine and I tried hard to speed up to keep getting a better look.  I probably got up to about 80, but it was no contest.  It was black (I could only see the underside at first), and at arm's length I would say it was about 6-8 inches in diameter, a real big-un as they say. As it continued south in front of me and drew away, I could see that it had green sequentially flashing lights along the rear (but I could not, of course, see whether these lights went all around the object).  It then slowly changed course toward the East and I lost sight of it because I had to drive.  I think the object was going about 300-400 mph -- it reminded me of the way a C130 had looked the day a friend said, ""It isn't going that slow, it is just that big.""  I let it go out of my mind, but the next morning I heard on the radio that the Air Force had reported that the object seen by a number of people was an experimental plane they were testing.  It did seem to me that something that size would have had a budget that people would be arguing about.  If it was a secret, why were they testing it in broad daylight?  And, most of all, why didn't it have any wings?  I would love to hear from anyone else who has seen something similar.",2000-07-11T00:00:00,39.14072038404727,-77.20584416543575

A friend of mine and I were sitting on the curb of Central Ave at the northern end of the campus of the University of Memphis around 3 or 3:30 am in either November or December of 1993 (although it could be early '94--I do know that it was pretty cold so it was sometime in the winter).  No one was driving on the street or near the area we were at (virtually directly north of were the new university library is)--the area north of the campus is almost entirely residential with no bars, pool halls, or Greek houses, plus most students who are out at the strip are on the other side of campus and usually start to trickle home around 2am.  Essentially, the area my friend and I were in was totally deserted despite the fact that Central is a large 5 lane road when it passes the university. The sighting began when my friend asked for a cigarette: as I held one out to him, he looked in the general direction of my hand (towards the east).  Just above my hand, he later said, and down the street about a mile and a half he saw something headed our way and said ""what's that?""  I turned and looked and saw a blue-ish fireball about a block and a half down the street headed in our direction.  This fireball was maybe 3 or 4 feet in diameter and was travelling pretty fast (approximately 40 to 50 mph) down what looked like the center line of the street.  When it passed above and in front of us, we noticed that it was at a heighth about 5 or 6 feet above the telephone poles that support a traffic light set up for students crossing the street (no cross street). As it passed, the fireball made a kind of ""hushed"" whooshing sound: similar to that of a cardboard tube when one swings the tube like a bat, but very subdued.  Also, the fireball had a short tail of blue-ish flame (about 5 feet), but left no smoke trail behind it.  The fireball zipped by us and continued down the street to the west until it was out of sight. I'm not sure if what we saw was ball lightning or something different and possibly more exotic, but I thought it might be worthwhile to let somebody know about this just to see if anyone else saw the same thing...I find it hard to believe that my friend and I were the only people to have seen this thing.",2000-08-19T00:00:00,35.12547266265719,-89.92692482230727

Nice evening, not a cloud, starlit sky like Montana.  As I watched the moon cut a vertical through spindly trees on (the EAST-SIDE ?) the reflection on the water was not really noticed, as I was laying on my back, hands cradling my head, watching the ORB ASCEND. THEN...........a starlight went out to my left, AND THE FEEBLE DIRECTION DESCRIPTION NOW GIVEN: (feet AT 12:00, ""10 o'clock WAS LIGHT-BLINK"", and 100 feet above the water, traveling on NORTH-TO-SOUTH CENTERLINE OF LAKE). THE INVOLUNTARY 'LOOKING' AT A LIGHT THAT BLINKED OUT......... WELL, THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON, AND I SAW A DARKER-THAN-SKY TRIANGULAR OBJECT..............NO LIGHTS..........NO TURBINES OR ANY OTHER SOUND.......... TRIANGULAR........70' LONG.............50' WIDE............and now before ""What ((deleted))????"" went through my head..........the objects' belly reflected 10 to 20% TO ME AS THE OBJECT APEXED ME AND THE MOON. WELL MORE LIKE LIGHT-ABSORBED 80% OF THE FULL MOON'S REFLECTION !!!    JUST A GLIMPSE OF WONDERFUL TECHNOLOGY: the 'tiles looked 3' long, 2' wide, butted perp. and staggered, to form an interesting pattern that could absorb or deflect...............YOU WORK ON IT. Tail of delta was 20-30' high at apex, flat-assed, and had three dull, dull, orange circles 6 'dia. in each vertex. The object moved 30mph..............my impression: Of being observed as though it was a 'tour bus' from the future.............. PROMPT: ""AND NOW LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  STARBOARD YOU WILL NOTICE ONE RECLINING AT WATER'S EDGE, ENJOYING THE SUMMER'S EVENING..............................................then disappeared over the tree tops.

SHORTLY AFTER THIS 'OBSERVATION', ON A SHOW CALLED ""THE X-FILES"", THE ACTOR CALLED MULDER HELD A PHOTOGRAPH OF A DELTA-SHAPED AIRBORNE OBJECT.  Now you may understand my apprehension at the time:  1. Just one OF THE WAVE OF 'I SAW ITS', to respond to this query.....no thanks.   2. A personal decision for the 'private experience' to remain my own.  3. If the craft WERE OUT FOR A CRUISE, then any source-acknowledgement-discovery would be realized as a WEAK SPOT and will have to be worked upon.  I felt no atmosphere disturbance as She passed, nor sensed any ultrasonics.........................but to feign pointing towards the object and murmur ""OVERHEAD......."" ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS, DATED 16FE11)) Just wanted to let ""ENOUGH TIME HAS ELAPSED THAT MY....... Just wanted to let ""ENOUGH TIME HAS ELAPSED THAT MY APPREHENSION HAS WANED"" to know that I also witnessed the object that night.

This had become our custom following a previous sighting I had seen alone in early August, 1995.  We live in Larimer County, Colorado, just south of the city limits of Fort Collins, approximately 2 miles from the foothills in front of Horsetooth Reservoir. We were positioned in such a way that our field of vision was to the south.  The sky was so clear that night that we remarked that the Milky Way was visible.  There was no moon visible at that time, although about a hour later, there was a full moon.For no apparent reason I looked over my right shoulder toward the NNW and saw clear skies.  Suddenly appearing in my field of vision was an object moving at what I guessed to be at cloud height.  There was no sound and the object moved fluidly toward the SSE, in the direction of Denver. The leading edge of the object seemed to be lit - possibly by the moon which had not yet risen but which may have been lighting the leading edge of the object from the east.    Also for no apparent reason, my wife turned her head and looked over her shoulder toward the NNW.  After having first noticed clear skies, the object suddenly appeared in her field of vision.Just at the moment that I realized what I was seeing, I said to my wife, “Do you see that?”  Before I could finish the sentence, she responded “God, I do.”As we watched the object proceed toward the SSE, we had enough time to consider and reconsider what the object might be.  The object moved with the fluidity of a bird riding a thermal, but there was no evidence of any wing movement or a change in course that a thermal would create. The object was much too large to be a bird - at arms length it would take a baseball sized object to obscure its visibility.  The shape was reminiscent of the Batman symbol with a curving leading edge that almost made a half circle with a point in the center rear.  The object appeared to be more oval than round, wide rather than long, and the center point was less that half the radius of the implied oval shape.The object remained in our field of vision for 30-45 seconds, long enough to pick up, set, and focus a camera. (The prints came back black.)  There was enough time for the internal dialog of considering, “Yes, I really see this - Yes, its really there” to take place more than 4 or 5 times as we watched the object track directly overhead.  It then disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.  Our field of vision was such that we should have been able to track its movement longer than the object was visible.The object seen in the earlier sighting in August, 1995, was similar in size, height and flight path with the direction of travel being the reverse course, SSE to NNW.  The leading edge was illuminated by 4 rectangular blocks of light and the previously mentioned rear center point was not noticed.  The object also appeared and disappeared in the same sudden fashion at approximately the same positions in the sky.We would be interested in knowing if anyone else had observed this or similarly shaped sightings.  If so, please e-mail us at: ((email address deleted.))",2000-08-19T00:00:00,40.55069822812846,-105.07729501661129

The craft was above me and moving from my right to my left and away from me at an angle. It was grey in colour and although the sky was a leaden grey and so were all the buildings around owing to their windows reflecting the sky and each other to a large extent,it was still clearly visible to me. There was little or no wind. It looked a frail structure to me and reminded me of an old air ship type structure though this could obviously be a subjective interpretation and totally incorrect. It was entirely unlit and in spite of it being a quiet night there was no sound that I could hear. Just as I thought it would fly on out of sight it stopped dead and without any movement either forward , backward, up or down, it began to rotate slowly around within its own length to finally face back the way it had come - a 180 degree turn as if on a mechanically fixed position turn table in the sky! It then immediately began to retrace its flight back along what seemed to me the exact path it had just taken- unlike an aircraft which obviously would have to bank and fly in a wide circle in order to maintain lift and stay airborne when turning back during flight. An inflatable air ship would not have performed such a mechanically precise manouvre. Only a helicopter could get near to this performance and a helicopter aint this shape and dont fly at night without lights.... To continue - again it surprised me by stopping dead and slowly turning left ! through 45 to 90 degrees and heading off at the same fixed speed behind the Natwest Tower. I did not see it again but it left me in no doubt that I had just witnessed something quite extraordinary. I had the distinct impression that it was robotic in nature and was performing to some preset co-ordinates. No humanoid would want to fly like that as it would not be much fun apart from any other consideration. But a change of plan seemed to occur as its return path seemed to be a waste of time and very laborious. It initially flew above the tallest structure in the City- The Natwest Tower- and having turned back finally angled off behind it; which some person may be able to determine its size from perhaps? I seem to dimly recall a similar report in the English paper The Sun which I think reported ' A flying banana 'in its usual sensationalist way.",2000-08-19T00:00:00,,

Location: West Wyoming, PA. I was driving home at about 10:30 pm on a Sunday evening on approximately 11/15/95. This part of the town is a wooded area with no street lights. A light caught my eye to the left as I was driving and I looked out of my driver's side window. I continued to drive for about 30 seconds and there was a clearing in the woods where a house stood nearby. I saw the light very cleary. I pulled my car over to the side of the road to get a good look. I remained in the vehicle the whole time. I saw three (3) distinct vertical columns of green light. Each column of light was perfectly cylindrical and tapered at the top and bottom. The lights were about 30-40 feet high, 5 feet in diameter and approximately 10-15 feet equidistant from each other. They were about 5-10 feet from touching the ground. The color was green and  somewhat muted or hazy, almost flourescent-like. I rolled down my window to make sure that it was not a reflection or glare on the window. I observed the lights for about 1 minute. I did not see a physical craft above the lights. There was no movement of the lights and no sound at all. I continued to drive home dumbfounded and this is when it really hit me that it was something unusual: About 3 minutes later I saw the same lights higher in the sky (about 1000 feet) but they were moving in a south-west direction and increasing in altitude. I was also traveling in a south-west direction (same direction as the lights) and I continued to clearly observe the lights until they were totally out of sight.  This continued for another 5 minutes.The lights stayed in the same shape (3 columns of green light) as they moved off until they were so small that I could no longer see them. The total time from when I first noticed the lights until I saw them disappear was about 10 minutes.

Sighting took place: September 1, 2000, Approx 1 am MNT/2 am Central On August 31, 2000 I started my trip from Denver, CO to Andrews, TX. I met a potential client in Colorado Springs, CO and then left there around 6:30-7 pm. I arrived in Raton and stopped at the McDonalds and called my family in Andrews at around 9 pm mnt/10 pm central. From Raton, I headed Southeast on 64/87 and went through Clayton and Dalhart. Once 87 turned into 385, at around Channing or Vega, I started seeing what I thought were peculiar lights moving down the fields I was driving past. The lights I saw would go one at a time at approx the same height along the stationary ""normal"" lights at that were in place in the field. I watched this as I was driving for about half an hour or so. At approx 1 am mnt/2 am central on September 1, 2000, I stopped my car on the RH side of the road to watch a light I’d seen out of the rear mirror of my car that appeared to be moving inwards in the field. I turned off my engine & watched the light move across towards the road and then ""hover"" out in the field for a few seconds. It was the same color as all the others I’d seen - a white light (same as starts you see in the sky or headlights from most cars). All of a sudden, this light ""whipped"" around to stop approx 15-30 feet behind my car a little to the left above the road. I could very easily see it out of my window. Immediately upon stopping it ""opened up"" or changed form (there were no ""doors"") and I was able to see much more than a ""blob"" of light. This inside was defined by shades of light - golden hues. I could see 2 distinct cylindrical shapes coming from this part of the object. They were more horizontal than my drawing shows (they were not pointing down at the earth, but outwards towards me). There were ""bands"" that were coming from the cylindrical shapes towards the center. I saw nothing resembling anything I’d ever seen on earth or even on TV. Nothing appeared shiny or metallic. This object made no noise at all. I looked at this object for seconds at the most and then turned in my seat and started my car and began driving away as quickly as I could. I said the words out loud ""no I don’t want to go."" The object did not follow me and I don’t know where it went. I did not see it in my rear view mirror when I looked back. I did, however, as I continued driving see the lights out in the fields that were traveling down the stationary lights in the field. I stopped again to watch one that was at it’s ""end"" of its ""route"" and tried to communicate with it as it ""hovered"" out in the field. I felt no response to my questions. When it started moving inwards again like the other light, I drove away. The next night, at a hotel where I was staying with my sister in Andrews, TX, I awoke in the middle of the night to my body jerking (much like when you fall asleep) and the bed shaking from side to side underneath me. This has never happened to me before. My sister was not disturbed, nor was my dog in her cage near my bed. I felt an ""energy"" moving over my body and saw a tiny light ""dancing"" over the room that I could not explain. I felt parts of my body tingle throughout this process and at one time felt a ""pressure"" on the left side of my brain. I was able to move, however, I chose to stay still for several minutes since I was not uncomfortable during this experience. Then I got up and went outside and saw nothing out of the ordinary. I went back to sleep and then woke up and felt my bed shaking underneath my body at least 2 more times that night. I was extremely tired and so I immediately went back to sleep each time. I have no unusual marks on my body from this experience. I have noticed a different mental ""awareness"" since the incident and I am remembering all of my dreams so far each night since the event, which is not usual and has not happened to me since childhood. I have felt anxious since the event, however, this I feel is due to my own imagination and choosing to listen to stories my friends have told me they heard or read about abductions. I am choosing not to do the hypnosis, since having listened to some friends who are familiar with the hynotic process, I feel there is a tendency for suggestions to the mind that did not actually occur. I have absolutely no reason to think I was abducted (I have accounted for all time that night) and that whatever beings might have been in that object meant me any harm. I know what I saw was nothing I can describe based upon my experience or TV. I believe whatever technology could create such an object would be able to do whatever they wished to us and so logically to me this means they must be here in peace and even possibly to help us. I am 32 years old and have been a professional in the advertising industry for 10 years. I have traveled quite a bit to several countries and lived overseas in Switzerland during high school. I have never seen anything resembling a UFO before. I have never had hallucinations before. I have not been interested in UFOs prior to this event. In fact, although I believed that there were very likely more evolved beings in the universe, I did not actually think they were showing up here in the numbers people were claiming.

I watched it stay in the apparently same location for about five or more minutes. At this point thought it was two large and very close stars. I then went into the house and told my mother to come see it. We wasn't looking at it very long and then it started to approach us. I could tell it was getting closer because the two large lights was spreading further apart and getting larger. The lights blinked off and on twice and what I thought was going to be a thrid time but instead the two lights just very went dim. Soon it was directly overhead and this is when I looked through my binoculars for a better look. My mom who was talking on the phone heard lots of static on the cordless phone. I could tell that it was triangular except the point of the triangle was the tail instead of what I believe should be the nose. The tail had a very small red light compared to the large front lights. These lights looked as tough they was pointed down at a forty five degree angle. It was flying very low and I could hear the engine. The engine sounded as though it had zero throttle. It did't sound like the planes to day but those in old war movies. As soon as it crossed over my house I went to the front porch and watched it circle over high way about 3000 yards away.

I then instructed her to examine every detail about this ""thing"" so that We could better remember it's design. Imagine,if you will,say a 747 jet without any wings or tail,only gigantical and unpainted,the bare metal design showing no rivets whatsoever.Windows adorned the side from front to back and forms of occupants were hazily seen behind some in the mid-section.It made no noise! It hovered over the ocean as if looking for something in the shallow surf[speculation].I then left Mom and ran to the car and sped away at at least 80m.p.h. in a 20m.p.h. zone to the Phelps' pier at the end of Carolina Ave. North and slung the car around to face the still oncoming slow sailing airship.

Due to thunderstorms in the interior of MA, I was unable to fly northboud to my destination and I was tracking the RI/CT coastline to the west trying to get around the weather.   The Sun had already set below the horizon, but the western sky was still very bright orange and ground detail was still easily identifiable.  At first I saw what I thought was a bird directly in my flight path, it appeared to be writhing in effort to avoid my plane (this is not an uncommon sight).  Very quickly I determined that the bird (object) was not on a collision course, but it would pass very close to my position.  As it drew closer I could see that it was not a bird, but rather an egg shaped object standing on end.  The top and bottom of the ""egg"" was not rounded but spiked with three points each.  Against the bright sky it was just a black silouette and possessed no lights.  It appeared to be moving in an eastbound direction and passed very close to and above the right wing of my aircraft. The first officer was looking for a fix on a navigational chart and did not observe the object.  However, I immediately contacted ATC and inquired about any radar targets on his equipment in my vicinity.  The initial response was no, but shortly thereafter he reported a primary target (no transponder or verifiable altitude info) behind me in trail about a mile.  ATC then informed me that object appeared to be stationary and then began to drift slowly to the east. I had no futher contact with the object.  Shortly before I was handed off to another controller (on a separate frequency) I heard the object called as stationary traffic to an airliner.

At first, I thought it was a star, but it was alittle too large to be one and it was red. Then friend #1 said it might be Venus, and I said it might be Mars. A few seconds later, it just disappeared. I didn't notice it dim at all, it's like the light just turned off. I though maybe a cloud had gone in front of it, but it was pretty clear that night and we kept a look out for it for a half an hour later, and it still didn't appear back.",2000-08-19T00:00:00,33.643359259259256,-84.01227860082305

Since I live in Little Rock, the city lights block out most of the stars. Anyway, Me and my brother were watching the stars when we see an object, more like a star, traveling across the sky. I know it wasn't a meteor, because I commonly watch for those. I also knew it wasn't a satelitte, because they havesome sort of blinking to them. It looked like a star going across the sky. I kept my eye on it until it went behind a tree. I didn't se it come out the other side, so I thought it was wierd. A few minutes later, I see this BRIGHT light (like 50 stars put together) come back the opposite direction from behind the same tree. I saw it and shined my flash light at it and it became dimmer and dimmer until it was the same ""star"" I had seen earlier traveling across the sky. I shined my light at it again, and it faded into nothingness. I guess it became as black as the night sky. It wasn't a helicopter, because there was no noise, or a plane for the same reason. It just traveled across the sky in a straiht line. a white light. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain what it was the witness observed, but it seems reminiscent of an orbitting object.  The fact that it dimmed is characteristic of a satellite as it ""flies"" into the shadow of the Earth, and is no longer illuminated by sunlight.  There are several very large objects in orbit that have a very bright reflection albedo, e.g. Mir, the Space Shuttle, and the I.S.S..  Also, the Iridium satellites can cause some of what the witness describes.  However, we are not certain.  PD))",2000-08-19T00:00:00,34.737536276849646,-92.3631923627685

Oval shaped black object spotted.  Flipping over on itself.  Absolutely amazed. It was Summer 1997.  Apart from myself, there were two other witnesses. My son, who was 9 at the time, and an ex - girlfriend.  The sky was cloudless.  The sun was blazing - a really hot day.  We were situated in an old cemetary - which people used to sunbathe when the weather is warm. The main building in front of the cemetary is the famous Anglican Cathedral - Europe's largest Gothic cathedral.  We were just relaxing this particular day when my son noticed something moving toward the cathedral very slowly.  He shouted to me to look up at the weather balloon.  When I peered up toward the sky I noticed that the object was not moving like a balloon should. It was black all over.  Oval in shape.  And it was moving by flipping over on itself - like a coin would move if flipped into the air.  We also noticed that as it flipped, the sun's beams would hit the edge of the object, which produced a bright golden gleam from the edges of this object. We could not believe what we were seeing.  I, myself, had never seen an object like it in my life before.  To this day I still have not got a clue as to what it was.  The sighting lasted about 6 minutes.  It moved toward the cathedral, went behind the cathedral and appeared again in front of the cathedral.  It moved slowly - flipping over on itself as it moved - toward the sun before we lost it in the sun's glare. This sighting has haunted me ever since.  I have checked, since, on any photos, in magazines, books about the type of object that I had witnessed in 1997.  All to no avail.  Not one of them even comes close to what we spotted then.

I saw the craft numerous times after, always hovering near the house at night after dark, and two other witnesses who were in the car claim to have seen it other times afterwards. It was a different shape when it would hover near my house, it would change shapes to the pattern of the moon. If there was a half moon, it too would be a half circle, and if it was a sliver moon, it would be a sliver too, but it changed colors from white, to yellow, to orange, and even red. It would hover very closely, and would wake me up out of a sound sleep. I haven't seen it since August of 1996, and the last time, I was with two other witnesses who saw it zip across the sky. I can count over 10 witnesses in the year of 1996 who have all seen the same object that year in the same area.",2000-09-21T00:00:00,46.0619,-95.2919

On the approximate date at roughly the time indicated.  I was sitting on my back porch with my witness.  The night was very clear and we could see all the stars.  I often watch the skies and plans transporting people from Nashville (I think) to Florida.  I know that they usually are somewhere around 25,000 to 30,000 feet high.  I also fly R/C aircraft, and have flown small aircraft (as a student pilot). We were looking to the east when suddenly two lights appeared on the horizon, apparently side-by-side. We both saw them at the same time, and they were on a westerly path.. right over my home.  They were coming VERY FAST at (I estimated about 10,000 feet).  As they went over our heads, we tried to see the shape of the objects, but it was simply too dark to determine anything.  There was a trail behind them, like fire (guessing), and they were only in view (because of my house roof) for about 3-4 seconds.  At that altitude, I expected to hear something (it was a quiet night) but neither of us heard any sound whatsoever.  I don't know of any military aircraft that can travel (estimated) from horizon to horizon in less than 8 seconds.  The speed would be much faster than anything I know of at that altitude.  I do know that we have helicopters with silent running features, but certainly they are not nearly capable of speeds like that. My witness and I thought maybe they could have been two meteorites, although they did not appear to be losing altitude to either of us.  In any case, I watched the newspapers and television news for several days to see if a couple meteors may have hit somewhere far west of us.. but no reports. It really bothered both of us that we didn't hear anything, not even a sonic boom (which I thought was not posssible for an object traveling at speeds far above speed of sound at that altitude).  We waited patiently to hear it, but nothing at all! I'm not a physicist, and could be wrong what it takes to create a sonic boom. Wish I had more to share with you, but that's all there was to it. In a nutshell, they were very very fast, about (maybe) 300 feet apart going the same speed, with no sound at all, and far exceeding the speed of sound.  My best guess is that they were at about 10,000 feet (much lower than commercial aircraft, and far higher than small aircraft fly).",2000-07-11T00:00:00,35.6418,-86.6907

It had blinking colored lights, green, blue, but still copper orange like flames surrounding. I pulled the jeep over and said "" Is that a plane on fire?"" to the two girls that were with me. Then the 'dot' turned bright white reflecting a path of light on the water tward shore. The moon was out and was reflecting on the water as well, though it was candle yellow and very dim compared to this thing. I then thought it was spotlights from a helicopter, because the object was moving to slowly to be a plane. It had reached the shore, at the most 150 yards away from us, about 75 feet off the ground. I shut the jeep off and unrolled my window to listen, expecting to hear the sound of a helicopter. The girls got nervous exclaiming, ""What are you doing?!"" The object was silent aproching from the left, up a treeline forming the edge of the feild, close to the tree tops. We sat silent as the object crossed the road directly in front of us, just above the powerlines. It was close enough that I had to lean forward and look up in my seat to see it. It was bright white like oncomming car headlights, as it crossed and went out of sight in the trees to our right. We didn't really say much, we were just bewilderd. I started the jeep and we drove about two miles up the road to drop one of the girls off at her house. The house was directly beside the road. As she was getting out of the car she said "" Youguys, get out and look at this."" The object we had just seen cross the road was right above, and behind us so we couldn't see it while driving. It was as close to the trees as it could be. We stood in the road, as it aproached, then was directly above, going very slow. I could have hit it throwing a rock. Bright white from the front, underside, and rear. I may have been able to see up through the center of the craft, as though it were a doughnut shape, but I'm not shure. The object appeared to have ""geometric framing"", or narrow beams connecting in weird patterns around the perimeter. I walked with it 100 feet down the road, looking back at the girls, which shone no light on them. I was still nearly under the thing holding out my bare arm showing no light, yet it was so bright that when you looked at it, it was shrouded in light. The craft went down the road above me making no noise. I was holding my breath, and turning my head to listen, and I might have heard the slight wirring of machinery, or hum of electricity. But it was to insignifigant to say. The craft went down the road 100 yards and turned back tward the water.

This is kind of old as told to me by my nephew.  He was working as a ranchhand with a migrant in Hondo, TX.  The migrant told him of a experience he had while working down in La Joya, TX for a rancher. La Joya is a very small town in a rural area near the Mexican border. One morning he went deer hunting.  As he was sitting in his deer blind he notice a ""flying disk"" coming from his right view and moving away from him very slowly. It stopped a few hundered feet from the blind and ""stood still"" a little bit, and then hid behind a small hill covered with brush.  He was very excited since he had never seen anything of this sort.  (He was a poor 50ish migrant worker that had never heard of ufos or aliens)  He jumped out of the blind and ran over to the area where he thought the disk had hid itself. He found nothing.  This went on for the next two days at nearly the same time of the morning. [ I don't know the exact time but deer hunting is done in the very early morning hours when the sun is just coming up 5am - 9am. ]  He never saw where it came from since a blind has only 2 to 3 openings about 3"" by 12"" on either side.  He mentioned to his boss, the ranch owner what he had been seeing.  The next morning to prove his story he invited his boss to go deer hunting with him.  As expected the disk flew by the blind and hid behind the same brushy hill.  They both got out of the blind.  His boss was scared stiff and white faced. He asked his boss to accompany him to find the disk. He said no and got into his truck and left. He, the migrant told my nephew this story because the disk reminded him of a plowing disk the type you would see at the end of a plowing tractor.  He never mentioned how big or small the disk was other than it flew just a few feet above the brushy ground. He also never mentioned if it made any sounds or if it had any colors or lights. There aren't to many hills in south Texas and if there are, there're very small. As I mentioned before this story is a little old but I thought it was very interesting.

At first I thought they must've been airplanes flying to LAX or wherever that were reflecting light from the sun. If you were to place your middle finger & index finger in a ""peace sign"" formation and held them against the sky, that is the distance that these two bright ""stars"" seemed to be apart from each other. If you drew a line between these two objects, you would have a perfect horizontal line. At first, the left ""star"" which was bright started to dim a little bit, like an airplane flying away from you. Then it regained its original brightness. Then I saw the right ""star"", which originally wasn't as bright as the left ""star"" start to become brighter also. So I knew then that these were not airplanes. Immediately I saw the left ""star"" dim slightly. When this happened, it appeared to reveal it's shape which was like a slim disc. It all of a sudden started to zig zag downward very rapidly. After that, it zig zagged upward back to its original position. Immediately after that, the right ""star"" also revealed its disc-like shape and did a zig zag motion downward as well but diagonally to the right. This right object revealed its shape in better detail. It sort of resembled , if you're familiar with the movie ""Star Wars"", the rear end of the Millenium Falcon ship as it would launch of any given surface. What I mean is it resembled the orange glow given off by the rear rockets and the exact detail of the rear end of the Millenium Falcon. Anyway, when this was apparent, it appeared to dive slightly to the left going downward. It looked exactly like the Millenium Falcon when it would change direction and dive left. It did this motion at the speed that an airplane would. Then it quickly jumped back to its original position. Then, the left ""star"", which now appeared as a disc, also somewhat resembling the millenium falcon, zig zagged rapidly downward diagonally left, staye! d there for a moment, the zig zagged back to its original position.

It stayed there for about 65-70 seconds.  It then started to move to the east in a very strange pattern. First, it moved perfectly vertical, then perfectly horizontal, and then vertical, and so on, until it moved a great deal across the sky.  While this light was flying in this strange pattern, another bright yellow light appeared in the same spot that the original one had.  This started moving in the same pattern as the first one, but it did not travel as far neither vertically nor horizontally.  After a few seconds, it completly dissapeared.  After about a minute, another bright yellow light appeared in the same place.  Immediatly, it started move in the same direction as the other two, in a similar pattern, but this time more erratically.  It moved rapidly, and moved in the direction of other, stationary, flashing white lights.  It seemed to be flying in the direction of one light, then would change direction towards another light.  After about another minute, an airplane appeared over the horizon in the north west, and began to turn in order to alter it's course to follow the light.  After several minutes of the plane flying after the light, more airplanes began coming over the horizon from the north east in fairly regular intervals.  I saw about 10 or 12 planes fly in the direction of the light.  While these planes were flying, there were many more flashing white lights in the sky, which flickered for a couple minutes, then stopped. All of the planes had flown away, and then nothing more happened.",2000-09-17T00:00:00,33.605613043478265,-117.71710434782608

Although I was quite young, and the event occured over 20 years ago, what I saw is as vivid in my mind as if it occured yesterday.  I have shared this information with family and friends, but not with any ""official"" agency or group. My family had recently moved into a new home in a development in the suburbs.  The area was still fairly undeveloped, and so without the interference of city lights, the night time sky could often be quite spectacular.  For this reason, I had become quite fond of stargazing.  On one particular evening in the spring of 1979, my mother had left to make a shopping trip.  She promised my brother and me that if we were on our best behavior she would buy us a surprise.  Eagerly anticipating her return, my brother and I knelt on our couch staring out our large picture window while we waited for her. As was my habit at the time, I was gazing up at the sky through our window when I noticed a brightly lit object in the sky, appearing to be at a fairly low altitude, heading in the general direction of our house.  As the object came closer, I noticed that it was roughly triangular in shape, and had a ""silvery"" appearance.  It looked to be illuminated, that is, it was plain to see and fairly bright in the sky, but didn't appear to have any ""lights"" on its exterior surface.  Despite its relatively low altitude (about 1000 feet or so) it made no noise that I could hear.  I say this with some confidence because the object flew almost directly overhead. Almost immediately after the first object passed overhead, I noticed several more heading in the same direction.  Within maybe 15 seconds several objects, all similar in appearance to the one described previously, passed overhead following the same path as the first object.  The objects flew in what was basically a ""single file"" type flight pattern, with one directly following the other.  I was in awe, not sure of what I was seeing.  I didn't count the total number, but several passed overhead in approximately a 30 second period.  The objects came as quickly as they went, and my brother and I yelled for my father, who was in the other room.  When we explained what we'd seen, he quickly dismissed it, telling us we'd probably seen reflections of light in the sky or something else.  However, I remember the sky being clear that night so I doubt this could have simply been lights reflecting on clouds.  Moreover, as this was a new development, there were very few sources of light that could have caused this.  Furthermore, I know what I saw.  The objects where silver colored, and triangular in shape.  I have never since seen anything in the sky that I could discribe as similar.",2000-07-23T00:00:00,41.254851796008865,-96.06482784922395

This encounter occurred in 1971, while aboard the aircraft carrier, USS John F. Kennedy CVA-67 (now CV-67) in the Bermuda Triangle, southeast of Florida. I was assigned to the communications department of the Kennedy and had been in this section about a year. The ship was returning to Norfolk, VA after completing a two week operational readiness exercise (ORE) in the Caribbean. We were to stand down for 30 days, after arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, to allow the crew to take leave and visit family before deploying to the Mediterranean for six months. I was on duty in the communications center. My task was to monitor eight teletypes printing the ""Fleet Broadcasts"". On the top row were four teletypes each printing messages from four different channels. On the bottom row were four more doing the exact same thing except the signal was carried on different frequencies. If one of the primary receivers started taking ""hits"" I would be able to retrieve the message from the bottom one. I also notified Facilities Control of any hits so they could tune the receivers. On the other side of the compartment(room) was the NAVCOMMOPNET (Naval Communications Operations Network). This was the Ship to Shore circuit with the top teletype being the receive and the bottom as the send (known as a duplex circuit). Next to this was the Task Group Circuit for ship to ship communications (task group operations or TGO). It was in the evening, about 20:30 (8:30 PM) and the ship had just completed an eighteen hour ""Flight Ops"".  I had just taken a message off one of the broadcasts and turned around to file it on a clip board. When I turned back to the teletypes the primaries were typing garbage. I looked down to the alternates which were doing the same. I walked a few feet to the intercom between us and the Facilities Control. I called them and informed them of the broadcasts being out. A voice replied that all communications were out. I then turned  and looked in the direction of the NAVCOMMOPNET and saw that the operator was having a problem. I then heard the Task Group operator tell the watch officer that his circuit was out also. In the far corner of the compartment was the pneumatic tubes going to the Signal bridge (where the flashing light and signal flag messages are sent/receive). There is an intercom there to communicate with the Signal Bridge and over this intercom we heard someone yelling  ""IT IS GOD! IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD!"". A moment later we heard another voice yelling. ""There is something hovering over the ship!"" As we looked up, we saw a large, glowing sphere. Well it seemed large, however, there was no point of reference. That is to say, if the sphere were low; say 100 feet above the ship, then it would have been about two to three hundred feet in diameter. If it were say 500 feet about the ship then it would have been larger. At arms length it was the size of a beach ball. It made no sound that I could hear. The light coming from it wasn't too bright, about half of what the sun would be. It pulsated from yellow to orange slowly. We didn't get to looked at for more than about 20 seconds because General Quarters (Battle stations) was sounding and the Communication Officer was in the passageway telling us to get back into the Comm Center. We returned and stayed there (that was out battle station). We didn't have much to do because all the communication was still out. After about 20 minutes, the teletypes started printing correctly again. We stayed at General Quarters for about  another hour, then secured. I didn't see or hear of any messages going out about the incident. Over the next few hours, I talked to a good friend that was in CIC (combat information center) who was a radar operator. He told me that all the radar screens were just glowing during the time of the incident. I also talked to a guy I knew that worked on the Navigational Bridge. He told me that none of the compasses were working and that the medics had to sedate a boatswains mate that was a lookout on the signal bridge. I figured this was the one yelling it was God. It was ironic that of the 5,000 men on a carrier, that only a handful actually saw this phnomenon. This was due to the fact that flight Ops had just be completed a short time before this all started and all the flight deck personnel were below resting. It should be noted that there are very few places where you can go to be out in the open air aboard a carrier. From what I could learn, virtually all electronic components stopped functioning during the 20 minutes or so that what ever it was hovered over the ship. The two Ready CAPs (Combat Air Patrol), which were two F-4 Phantoms that are always ready to be launched, would not start. I heard from the scuttlebut (slang - rumor mill) that three or four ""men in trenchcoats"" had landed, and were interviewing the personnel that had seen this phenomena. I was never interviewed, maybe because no one knew that I had seen it. A few days latter, as we were approaching Norfolk, the Commanding and Executive Officers came on the closed circuit TV system that we had. They did this regularly to address the crew and pass on information. During this particular session the Captain told us how well we did on the ORE and about our upcoming deployment to the Mediterranean. At the very end of his spiel, he said ""I would like to remind the crew, that certain events that take place aboard a Naval Combatant Ship, are classified and are not to be discussed with anyone without a need to know"". This was all the official word I ever received or heard of the incident.",2000-07-23T00:00:00,,

Then it flew  low over my house and I heard the UFO. Off in the distance, north/west a jarting lighted object was seen. Stop, jart forward then stop. In a back and forth movement. This object was observed by my 2 children for 3 days. I wouldn't look until the 3rd day because I thought the kids were making it up. They watched it and kept yelling for me to look. Finally on the 3rd night, I looked and saw it jarting back and forth. Then the shock! It flew right over my house. I could HEAR IT. It whooshed, quiet sound, just like that a whoose. It was right over the house, it looked like a bonnet, the top was flattened and where it flatted to meet the brim, were the lights. All around the brim were individual lights, yellow, blues, and whitish yellow. The lights seemed to go from low beam to high beam constantly, like pulsing lights. When it flew towards my house, I was in shock and got scared. When it was above the house, it was hard to tell the size,it was more than 3 houses long and a block wide, and I could hear it. I called the police when I saw it off in the distance, but they treated me like a moron. This siting was never in the news or the papers. 8 years later in the local paper, someone asked about seeing it, and the reporter said, yes the whole town had reported it. So, maybe you have other reports of it. I have for years been trying to find someplace to report it and hope to god, I have found the right spot. This was definately, a UFO, and hearing it is something I have not heard anyone else report hearing, only seeing. The sound of this UFO was a whoooooosh, a quiet sound, no motor sound, not an airplane sound. More like waving a stick in the air, but this was quiet, hugh sound. It's speed was fast, it moved from the distance to over my house in a split second. Yet, slow enough for me to see the lights, and hear it. All my windows were closed, not double paned windows, so sounds can be heard. Amazing, frightening and I am very angry at this city repressing the sighting. If you were to question this city, I know you would hear from everyone that saw it. I saw it in the north/west and when it came toward me and flew over my house that would have been south.",2000-07-23T00:00:00,38.22604202898551,-122.65297500000001

I could see fairly well up and down river. ( No details, it was dark.)  At about 3:00 am I was reclined low in a blind, facing north. (upriver) I heard a noise coming from  the north. I did not really take notice if it at first until it started gradually getting louder and louder. The sound was just like hellicopter blades . (Not at full flying speed but rather landed and idled down to a speed of one blade pass per second.) And absolutely no other sound. No engines, turbines or anything. Just the sound of the blades. The sound came from the north and went right over me and continued on down stream behind me to the south. The blade noise was so loud it was deafening. It never missed a beat as it came, pass over and continued south. When it seemed directly overhead I pulled my head down even further mostly as a reflex, for it seemed that low. I knew exactly where the noise was (just like a jet passing in clouds) but I could not see anything.  It really scared me and I just froze there waiting. As I sat there about five minutes later I heard the blade noise on the other side of the river heading north above the treetops.

Exact location from where I had the sighting was in the parking lot of plaza located on the Northwest corner of Reseda and Nordhoff in the city of Northridge CA. about 25 miles North of Hollywood.   There is a grocery store hooked to a chain of other stores in the shape of an L. In the corner of the plaza is a resturaunt called the Hot Wok Cafe.  I was walking through the parking lot towards the Hot Wok cafe which means that I was walking towards the Northwest, just before I got to the resturaunt I looked just above the roofline of the plaza and saw perhaps a few hundred feet above the ground  maybe two or three hundred feet away what looked like a plastic bag being carried around by the wind. The first thing to come to mind was a scene in a movie called American Beauty that focused on a plastic bag dancing in the wind that seemed to have a life of it's own.  I thought it was interesting that a plastic bag could be carried so far in the air even though I could not really tell if it was actually a plastic bag or not, ot only behaved like a plastic bag being spun and carried slightly back and forth in the air.  I was about to dismiss the sight alltogether since I was meeting a friend in the resturaunt and did not want to keep them waiting when I realized that this ""bag"" had pretty much stayed in a very small area.  If it was a bag then the wind that kept the bag in the air also caused it to flutter in float in the same spot for about three minutes.  At this time I couldn't take my eyes off of it, I had to see it either fall or flutter away but it stayed in pretty much the exact spot. After a couple of minutes I decided I need to go into the resturaunt and meet my friend, nothing was happening with the ""bag"" and I only had an hour for lunch.  I went in and looked around and saw that I had been stood up, or my friend had not arrived yet so I ran back into the parking lot and resumed my examination of this object in the sky that was still there in the same spot, fluttering in the exact same manner. Only now there was a small, fuzzy, light colored sspherical object right next to it.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me since I don't have the best eyesight in the world and I have to stare at a computer screen all day.  I looked away and looked back again and the little dot was still there right next to the ""bag"".  I watched for maybe about three or four minutes and noticed that the new object, the ""dot"" was very slowly moving out of sight.  It took about a minute before I couldn't see it anymore.  The ""bag"" remained in the same place.  I watched maybe anothe rminute and decided to inquire in the resturaunt if there had been anyone in there within the past 30 minutes meeting the description of my friend.  The attendant at the front said no so I gave up and decided to get some cheaper food across the parking lot and walked back out.  I looked into the sky again and saw that the object was gone.  I scanned the sky and saw nothing else.  This occured on what I remember to be a clear and hot day.  I would be very interested to read reports from any other witnesses that might have seen something similar in the same area that same day and time.",2000-08-19T00:00:00,,

It made no sound and there were no aircraft in the sky.  It was perfectly round.  The edges were very distinct.  It appeared to be a light, but it did not have a beam of light or any rays around it.  The color wasn't gold like glitter gold, but a muted golden color. This is the third sphere I've seen.  The first one was in the fall of 1995.  That happened on a cloudy day and the globe/sphere was below the cloud deck.  It performed the typical slipping through the atmosphere with the zig zag motion of a saucer (if there is anything typical about a saucer).   I was on a hill and was a little above this object when I observed it around 7 pm. The second time I saw a sphere/globe was January 4, 1996.  I was watching for meteors because that is supposed to be a peak day for a meteor shower.  This one was exactly as the first description, except closer.  There was no tail and no flame. It was doing that slipping through the atmosphere, well air.  It wasn't that far away and again I wasn't looking up.  I was level with it. It did that zig zag movement,also.  At the time I thought it was just a strange meteor, because I didn't know better.  Soon afterwards I got online and began my own personal investigation of UFOs.

The speed was that of a typical satellite (about 2-4 minutes to cross the sky). The shortest side faced approx. NW-WNW, the longest side faced approx. SW-SSW. (The obtuse angle was between these two sides). It traveled in a direction between it's longest side and southern most tip(it's tip would have been at a SE position, whereas it headed SSE). They were a large formation, at least 1 and a quarter inches at arm's length (about half the big dipper's pot). They were at different magnitudes, the southern most tip was the brightest. They disappeared into the earth's shadow which confirmed that they weren't self illuminating, there was also no sound, it's highly unlikely that they were jets.

They moved approximately south to north, with no sound, and were of equal color, size, and luminosity as the stars in the background. They moved at about the speed of an ordinary jet aircraft at relatively close range, and I observed them briefly before my line of sight was obscured by trees. I thought it unusual that there were no blinking or colored lights that you would expect to see on ordinary aircraft. My only guess is that they were a formation of stealth fighters, or a single stealth bomber from Canon AFB. My initial impression however, was that the lights represented a single object that was larger than a single fighter and relatively close based on it's speed.",2000-07-11T00:00:00,34.0697,-103.33060000000002

I have no outstanding credentials that might account for what i saw but here it is. One sunny clear afternoon in Charlotte, North Carolina, I was driving in my car. I was on my way home from my ex-girlfriend's house. She lives in a town close to Charlotte. So I'm traveling on the outskirts of Charlotte on a rural road. There are farms and fields all around. I'm driving along and I notice a formation of what appear to be F-16 fighter pilots. It's not everyday you see a squadron over a populated area. And at such a low altitude. I'm no pilot, but i would have guessed their altitude to be approximately 5000 feet. Anyway, i'm watching these pilots fly off to the west and out of my view. I drive a few more miles down the road, thinking of what they could possibly be doing out of charlotte and then i see them again. Only this time they're flying back from the west heading east. By this time I'm thinking, ""Hey wouldn't it be cool if there was a UFO in the area.""  Well by now I'm getting really close to my neighborhood (about 3 miles). I approach the crest of this hill and on my way down the other side of the hill, I look a few miles down the road. There it was. I huge cigar-shaped craft. This craft resembled the fuselage of a regular passenger aircraft but it was much bigger and longer than your average airplane. At first i thought i was seeing things, thinking that it may be a blimp, but this was no blimp. Blimps are oblonged shaped, looking much like an egg in shape. So now I'm about 2 miles from my neighborhood. Keep in mind this is a very populated area of south Charlotte. At this point I'm driving like moron trying to avoid an accident while watching this craft.. I watch it ( at first it was motionless) but it starts to head east very slowly. i watch it until it disappears over the into the trees. I continue driving, trying to look for it as i approach the aboretum (a.k.a. a very large shpping area). I turn right onto Highway 51 in the direction the craft disappeared to and i was thinking, ""Okay, I'm goi! ng to se e it again."" But to my reluctance i did not. Finally I get to my neighborhood. I immediately called my ex to tell her what i saw. After i told her about it she said she saw those fighter pilots for a while flying over her town of Monroe, NC. Now I'm stading outside, talking to her on the phone. Suddenly i hear what sounds like thunder(even louder). I look up to see an F-16 doing an intense maneuver directly over my neighborhood. I waited 5 more minutes to see it again. But i never did see the cigar shaped craft again that day. Later that night, I talked to some of my friends. After i told them what had happened they said that earlier in the day some people had called a one of the local rock stations to and were reporting UFOS over Charlotte. To this day I wonder about UFOS and after what I saw would like to know what the military was doing over the skies of my town.",2000-07-11T00:00:00,35.20580084001527,-80.82639156166476

At first, we thought that what we saw was simply a star until it moved in a triangular pattern.  It was a red/blue light that was about 4-5 miles away, high above the city below.  Scared, we ran to our car for shelter.  Our two dogs that we had with us suddenly became silent....and believe me they had been fussing most of the night until this light appeared. Once inside the car, another light, yellow and green hovered to the west of where we were looking.  This was about 500 yards away.  It hovered behind the treeline and then above it.  It moved in the same triangle pattern as the other light.  We locked the doors and watched for about 3-4 hours more before passing out of exhaustion.

As they looked directly above they also saw exactly what I was seeing for two more rotations that lasted for three second. Then the two obects broke formation and travelled in opposite directions , the object on the left slowed down coming to a stand still staying the same size and brightness. But the object on the right appeared to accend in alttitude reducing in size and brightness to a star of magnitude 5 , then pairing up with a third object of identical size and brightness . These two objects then performed the same manuver of rotating clockwise for about five seconds then broke formation in opposite directions to slowly come to a halt in what I would call a slighly off center triangle .

UFO SIGHTING  Date:           Tuesday 29th August  Place:          Hannover, Germany  Time:           1.30 am  I am prompted to write down my sighting of strange lights in the sky, firstly before I forget all the details and secondly as a result of a programme I watched here in the UK a few days ago.  Whilst on holiday in Hannover last month visiting a penpal and also to see EXPO 2000, after a tiring day I went to bed on Monday 28th August.  At about 1.30 am I was suddenly awoken by a bright white light that only lasted a second, rather like the flash of lightening.  I lay in bed listening for the thunder to follow but this did not happen.  Within a minute there was another flash of white followed closely by a third.  Now I could have been dreaming the first but I was wide awake by now so the second and third were not my imagination.  Wanting to visit the bathroom at this point I went through to the en-suite bathroom which has a skylight and looking through the glass I saw that the stars were out and there was some cloud also.  In the distance quite high up I saw 4 circular shapes and as I looked they all moved together into the centre to form one circle of light, then moved out to become four again.  This happened repeatedly.  I thought that perhaps there was a reflection on the glass of the skylight so I opened it to look directly at the sky but the circular shapes were still there and doing the same thing.  Moving into the centre, becoming one shape then moving out again to become four.  The lights were not bright and glaring but more a dull ""white"".  I stood and watched this for maybe 15 minutes then went to bed.  Next morning I questioned my friends to ask if they had seen the white flashes but they had not.  We then checked to see if any reports had come through on the radio or later in the newspapers, again nothing had been reported.  In an effort to explain logically what I had seen we wondered if the lights had come from EXPO ie maybe laser lights but EXPO does not run that late into the morning and the distance was too far away.  There is a radio mast not far away which is lit up at night and I wondered if this had somehow caused the lights but the size of the lights made this explanation unlikely.  Regarding the television programme the other evening about UFO's, there was extensive coverage on the different sightings over the years including video footage of what people had seen.  The commentator then said ""In Germany there has frequently been reported that circular shapes have been seen"" and they showed examples identical to what I have just described.

Hi, I wish to report a sighting. It occurred on August 20th, 2000. To begin with I wanted to go for a walk at 2:30 PM, so I decided to walk to a supermarket that was about a half hour walk! I got to the store at 2:55 PM bought coffee and left. On the way home I noticed the sky was very clear, yet there were some small white clouds! I was amazed there wasn't any chemtrails today! Then at 3:01 PM, I noticed a long chrome colored rod or bar shaped craft slowly moving from the east to the west. I kept looking at it and didn't see any wings on it! It then looked as if it disappeared. I kept walking home. Then when I was almost home at 3:21 PM, I saw the chrome rod again! I don't know if it was the same one, but it was the same as the one I saw at 3:01 PM. I noticed it was moving in the same direction again, from the east to the west, but this time I noticed there was a faint chemtrail cloud over the mountains in the west! I saw the chrome rod shaped craft go through this very this cloud and it vanished! Yet I could see it cutting a trail through this very thin almost clear cloud! It cut a path through it like an ice cutter does in frozen waters! Then at 3:27 PM, when I was only one block away from my house, near a funeral home parking lot, I notice the chrome rod one more time! This time it was moving from the west to the east! I also noticed that there was a cloud in the sky that looked sort of fake, for it looked like the edge of it was oily! Then to the lower left of that cloud there was a very tiny white cloud. Well the chrome rod shaped craft headed slowly toward this cloud, yet while it was heading there I saw the craft vanish and re-appear about 3 times against a background of clear blue sky! When it got near the big fake looking cloud it passed under it, but went into the very tiny white cloud and vanished! It never came out of it! Then when I got to my house, my sister came out and I told her about it! She didn't believe me. I showed her the cloud and we watched but we didn't see the chrome bar shaped craft anymore. But then, from the fake looking cloud a black flat object dropped from it, then flew quickly into the west! She said it looked like a bird, but it wasn't! I ran to get my dad's video recorder, but both batteries were completely dead! Well that ends this sighting report! If your interested, I had more sightings I never reported. They are below. In the winter of 1994, I got up in the middle of the night because I couldn't sleep. For some reason I looked out the window and saw a very bright amber colored light heading from out of the south to the north. It was heading towards my house! The amber color is beyond explanation, for it pulsed from bright amber to complete darkness, and inside the amber was a reddish color! When it got closer it instantly turned to the east and looked like it was following the Lackawanna river that is near my house! When it turned I could see how the side of this craft looked! It had a very flat thin dark black bottom, and it's top part was amber with red in the middle and was pulsing off and on slowly! Then as it followed the river, something happened! It's hard to explain this but here goes! It was ejecting things from the craft, but you couldn't see them until it got away from the craft! They then looked like sparks falling to the Earth! I notice it did that until I couldn't see it any more! End of that sighting. Then this one is the best of all sightings! It happened in late March or early April of 1997! It was around then because Passover was approaching! Well the sun just set and it was still bright out! I always lay on my couch and look out the window towards the mountains in the south. Then I noticed the stars were becoming noticeable. It was then, just above the mountain range to the south I noticed what I thought was a star. But to my surprise it jumped from about 1 inch over the mountain, to about 2 feet above the mountain! When I say 1 inch and 2 feet, that's just how it looks from my window! Then when it jumped higher in the sky, it got extremely bright, then went back to it's normal brightness! It did that 3 times, then I almost fainted, for what I saw I couldn't believe my eyes! I guess that craft that looked like a star signaled another craft that the coast was clear, for as soon as it pulsed 3 times this happened! The exact, and I repeat the exact craft that Bob Lazar calls the sport model came from out of the east, and went to the west! It was so close over the house tops I couldn't believe it! It was bronze in color, and had towards the bottom, light spinning just like on the Jupiter II of the original Lost in Space series! I saw it's lighted interior, but I couldn't see any beings or men in the windows! I watched it until I couldn't see it any more form my window, then I ran downstairs and outside, but it was gone! It didn't move fast, yet it was silent and very stable! It was so sleek and awesome! When I saw that craft, I knew Bob Lazar was telling the truth! That craft was his sports model UFO! Yet to this day, no one reported this! Not one! I saw it but couldn't believe my eyes! I always listen to Jeff Rense and I used to listen to the Art Bell show, and from one show that Art Bell had on I think I found out something! I remember Art had on a guest named Victor that had a clip called the alien interview! Well he said this, "" From what I understand, all the alien craft have been moved into the northeast! "" Well I think they have moved into the mountains near my house! For some strange reason they have built a highway atop of southern mountain range in which I have seen Bob Lazars sports model UFO! During the night about 3:00 AM I see lights in the clearings of the mountains, I don't think they are vehicles! Yet I don't know! I also hear many nights the droning noise of turbine engines coming from the mountains! I see craft that are very dark flying ultra fast towards the mountains! They move so fast they look like your seeing things! Well that's it for me. End of this report!",2000-09-21T00:00:00,41.4636,-75.6291

Mr. R. called the MUFON-SB UFO Sighting Hotline to report that approx. 11:30 PM (PDT)on August 9th, his wife looked out the window and noticed one or two very bright white lights swooping back and forth in the sky and alerted him to the lights.  At that time he went outside his front door and was met by a blinding white light that illuminated his house and street.  The light suddenly went out and he noticed both his outdoor mercury vapor lights and street lights were out.  As he stood in the total darkness, he was again surrounded by the intensely bright light that lasted about a minute then once again blinked out to sudden darkness.  About a minute and a half later he heard a rumbling sound like a sonic boom but said it sounded more seismic, like the noise that sometimes precedes an earthquake, and his windows in his house rattled but the ground never shook.  Following the vibration, he looked towards the NE sky and saw what appeared to be two faint white ""falling stars"" that were ""falling"" side by side and disappeared at the same moment.  Mr. R. reported that there were no visual observations of normal aircraft or helicopters in the sky during the event and no sound was heard, with the exception of the rumbling. Additional Case Info: A few minutes later there was a small M2.4 earthquake about 30 miles away at 23:43 PM (PDT - 06:43UT), but due to the low magnitude of the quake, the sonic effects are not thought to be connected with the earthquake.  It is unknown whether or not the earthquake is coincidental or is somehow connected to the original event, as the two ""falling stars"" fell in the direction of the location of the succeeding earthquake.

From my position in west central Ohio, a bright light appreared approx 35 degrees from horizon due north. Light appreared from pin point to become a very bright light. Brighter than any star visible. The light lasted for approx 30-40 seconds the faded away to a pin point, then vanished. On Monday the 28th I noted it, and thought hard about making a report.

The description is not entirely consistent with a sighting of an Iridium satellite, but we cite the coincidence of the two events.  Our thanks to Lexy.

My self and another guy said we did not know.At first the 3 of us  thought it was a ballon,but we agreed that ballons don't hovverThen we went through the usual supects,a plane, helicopter. At that point others begin to become interested in the object .We were in San Franciso close to downtown.We were in a backyard of a rec center,facing the bay. To the left of us if we're facing the bay was  the south part of downtown SF. This is where we saw this object sitting still in the sky.It was really high up in the sky so i decided to go and get my binoculars.I zoomed in as close as i could.It looked  like a shining egg just sitting there by this time some 5 mintues had past.Other witnesses started to use the binoculars,they describe a similar sighting. Older kids maybe ages 12 -15 took a look.I knew their eyes was better than mine .They reported seeing a red fireball.I was stunned.We all Begin to take looks, by this time the damn thing begin to move slowly toward the direction of the Bay Bridge. It was still pretty high because i remember first thinking it was a star in the daytime.Anyway I was looking but i did not really see it move, it was like you know it move but when?Next thing we know it had change locations.This is about 15 minutes into this sighting.Once it took another location i took another look and i swear it had lights on the outside of the object flashing.I must confess that i am a Peter Davenport and Art Bell fan but i did'nt expect to see this.At arms length i could not cover this object up.By this time most everyone knew  something special was going on.Then all of a sudden there were 2 objects.It was like it had split into. All concerned were amazed. This was about 20 mintues into the ordeal.Of course out of all the years we've been doing family events this is maybe th! e first time no one had a video camera at the party.At this the second object started to curise right above our heads.One little girl started to say this is scareing me.If it was it 1oclock over the Bay Bridge it headed  toward 4or 5oclock over our heads.When it was right over our heads i took a look in the binoculars and i saw a red plusating craft.I felt really strange. It really hit me that we could be witnessing other dimensions.Most people had that feeling.Anyway the 2nd object headed our way pasted over and went about what seem to be another 2 miles away hovvering over some trees.While the 1st object is still over the direction of the Bay Bridge.The 2nd object over the trees is just there and then it seems the 2nd object spilt into 3rd object but only briefly,maybe once or twice. After about  5mintues or so the 2nd just vanished.Now with our breath taken away, we focused our attention on the first object.It was still there but one weird thing was . We could see the object with our naked eyes as before but now when we tried to see the object in the binoculars we could not find it.It seemed transparent,strange. Then we looked away for a few seconds and looked back and it was gone.We were lost for words.30 mintues is a long time to witness a sighting.We just wonder did anyone else see it. All the people at this party were just regular folks,bringing their kids to a party.WHAT A PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2000-09-21T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

As I got closer to the object, I noticed it was larger than the normal size of aircraft for that airport, and it was stationary.  As I approached the object, instead of making a left turn into the airport, it remained stationary and became larger.  The object appeared as a cylinder with conical ends ending in very sharp points, and large red lights before the apex of the point on each end.  The object appeared to be tilted downward 10 degrees to the west.  As I faced the object, above the red light on the right side was a dimly lit dome.  On the left side above the other red light appeared to be a bright blue-white light similar to a spot light. The object looked  to be dark in color.  As I approched the object, my view was obscured as I passed under the vehicle. The size of the ufo was 150 feet in length and 15 to 20 feet in height.  It was one and one half times the size of a full moon.

It was September 8th, 2000 and we first saw a police helicopter circling around and we concluded that the helicopter was there because of the UN 2000 conference/meeting of world leaders. Then, I saw a reddish/amber object which seems stationary at first but then seems to move very slowly, I then asked my workmate ""what's that red thing there in the skies?"" he replied, ""oh, its one of those baloons."" But, for some reason I kept on looking and the object now was showing a bright white color also, so I pointed that out to him and we decided to focus on the object and the helicopter. It was'nt long before we noticed that this thing was acutally moving in a circular fashion, that is, it was traveling and spinning, this was evident because we would see the bright white color and the reddish/amber, sometimes it appears that this was a two-colored object sometimes one. We became more curious when we realised that this thing was really moving upwards and getting smaller and that we now would only recognise the bright white color. By this time we knew it was not a baloon, nor a helicopter, nor any other object that we can recognise. In the midst of the whole scene we would look at each other and ask ""what da hell is that thing?""  Then one of us suggested it might be one of those flying saucers, we both laughed as if to say ""yeah right."" The object mounted so high that had it not been for the bright white light we would not be able to recognise it with our natural eyes. It disappeared when it mounted beyond some clouds so to us the clouds covered or blocked our view but it had gone so high already. I must say that it seems to pick up in speed as it climbed higher. Although maths is my favorite subject I am not good at estimating distances and sizes so I will not attempt to estimate either at any point in this experience. All i can say is that when I first saw this thing it was probably a little above the distance the helicopter was and at that point it was quite visable; by the time it disappeared it became as the size of a miniature baseball. What is interesting is that there were other people(about 12-15) in the same cafeteria at the same time but we really never thought that we should bring it to anyone's attention because we were'nt sure what this thing was. There was a plane which was traveling ( in the opposite direction) high above the helicopter but this object was high above the plane. I am not going to conclude precisely that this was indeed an UFO for I still do not know what the heck this thing was but I know for certain that this was something like I aint never seen before. And the movement and awe startled me. If there's anyone who had a similar experience I would sure like to know what this was, maybe some expert can contact me or even someone who is a doubter. I know we were'nt dreaming, we had no strong drink, I dont smoke and i dont think my workmate does. Let me say one other thing, the direction in which the object move is as if it made a sideways V.",2000-09-17T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

This covered the distance from horizon to horizon about three times faster than any sattelite that I have witnessed yet. Almost too fast to track with a tripod. It definitely wasn't ours. I live by Selfridge Airbase and have seen doughnuts on a rope stuff before, this left no signature, and it's not the first sighting that I have had. I had previously seen a U.F.O. through my 13"" aperture scope. You would have to ask me about that one!",2000-07-23T00:00:00,42.6376,-82.58229999999999

On one side of the street there were lots of pine trees, but I could see through their tops. I live near the airport so I know there is constant air traffic, so I glanced up twice at an aircraft before finally taking a longer look.  The craft was like a triangle shape but each of the three sides were a different length, and the bottom of the craft was covered with blue-white lights, so it must be a UFO. I was looking at it through the trees but couldn't tell how big it was.  I started running towards a clearing to get a better look and it was like it read my mind.  As I started running all the lights on the craft went out and it was no longer in view.  Everything around was still and quiet.",2000-07-23T00:00:00,30.44264888888889,-89.12384592592592

It traveled at a constant speed, which was slow enough that when we followed it, we stayed with it easily without breaking the speed limit. We followed it on US Hwy 183 heading north to 2243 E. We then traveled on 2243 E. and pulled off the road. It passed over us. We used binoculars to again observe it. We then commenced east again intending to go to IH 35 and intercept it again.

I was traveling north on Hwy. 27 in Baldwin County, Al on my way in to work on the graveyard shift. I had just passed the Texaco Station on my left and as I made it through the intersection I could clearly see a craft of some sort at what I would guess would be a distance of about 1/2 mile. From that distance it appeared to maintain it's altitude and I continued driving toward it not wanting to believe my eyes. As I closed on the craft I realized that although at first it appeared to be approaching from a direct right angle ( from the east to west) it actually crossed the Hwy heading in what appeared to be a southwest direction using the hiway as true north. In reality I was actually beginning to slow my vehicle as I approached the craft. I remembered looking in my rearview mirror to see if any other cars were behind me and witnessing the same. But I only at best remember possibly seeing other headlights ( of other vehicles). My attention was strictly focused on the large craft that was now beginning to cross the hiway at what appeared to be an altitude of about 100-140 feet. It appeared to be disk shaped from the side view but as it passed over the road I could detect a V-design to the rear. At first sighting, what was so obvious were the sequential lights that appeared to be flashing aroung the edge of the the disk. What seemed odd were the almost sci-fi quality to the movement of lights and the colors. Seemed like yellow, green, red. Can't fully recall exactly. As it passed over the road I could tell by the outline of sequential lights looking from a rear angle that there was a V-design of sorts. By now (the time that the craft passed over the road) I had stopped my vehicle and pulled over on the narrow shoulder of the road and had the window down, with my head out the window in awe of what I was witnessing. I remember briefly looking back again for other vehicles but my attention was quickly returned. As I watched, it continued across the road and over a stretch of tall pines. I don't remember ever! hearing any sounds like conventional aircraft would be making at that altitude and no more than 300-500 feet away from me. I had a camera in my backpack but I could not reach it so I noticed a driveway about 1/8 mile north of my position whereby I could turn around and retrieve my camera so as it disappeared over the tree tops, I sped up to the driveway and got my camera only to be obscured from view by the tall pines. It obviously did not alter course and I lost sight due to trees. But it passed within 500 feet of a residence in this farmland, tyoe  open setting. The night was clear and so was my mind as I was rested and heading in to work. No drugs, booze. Sober as a judge. The craft I approximate was about 80 to 100 feet across the beam and about the same length wise. This event changed my life. I had always, as most people, been a skeptic regarding UFO sightings. But now I know that what I saw I have never seen before and probably never again. I wish I knew what it was. I remember thinking why would something that big and silent have such highly visible lights. Thinking that a higher intelligence would have some cloaking or camoflauge to it. This thing was highly visible, but like I stated earlier, I could detect no sound over the idle of my own engine.",2000-07-23T00:00:00,30.5282,-87.7632

On 28 June 1999, I was Pilot in Command of a 3 man flight crew flying a radar patrol in the Gulf of Mexico. The weather was hazy with only a few clouds at several altitudes. We were at 22,000 feet when our radar facility called and informed us that they had a primary target south bound at 350 knots approximaely 150 miles west of Tampa Bay. We were vectored to the target as we decended out of altitude. The radar center informed us that they had checked with all the military bases along the coast in Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana and noone could identify the unknown target. My aircraft is equiped with an F-16 fighter radar and FLIR (Forward Looking Infared) sensors. Shortly after being given vectors we locked up a south bound target at 390 knots, 300 feet off the water. We were established on a head on intercept with the target at 55 miles. As we closed and off set the target, it made a 90 degree left turn east bound and exited our scope in a matter of seconds. I turned right to reaquire the target and again locked it up at 25 miles heading east at now 670 knots. I initally thouhgt it was a radar glitch but every turn, speed change, and heading change was verified by 3 different radars. My aircraft radar, and 2 other radar systems. The target slowed and we closed to within 15 miles of it, it then stopped, reversed course 180 degrees and then made an imediate 90 degree right turn north bound again and accelerated to 1100 knots. It stopped made a 120 degree heading change and accelerated again to close to 900 knots coming at us. I tried to manuver our aircraft to keep it on radar as much as possible and to get a flir image on tape but due to a haze layer it was impossible. The radar image taping system was non operational on this aircraft at the time of the incident. This chasing around the gulf went on for 25 minutes or so and the last call I got from radar was that the target was heading east bound accelerating. I turned and locked up the target east bound accelerating through 1100 knots and climbing! at a ve ry high rate of speed till it just blew off the aircraft scope. That was the last time I saw it on radar. We never got close enough to get a visual on the object. There was never a mode squak from the target and the manuvers were something like I had never seen.

I later realized instead of it moving from top to bottom, it was actually moving from north to south. I pointed this out to my friends who were outside with me and they were very skeptical at first but realized that this was something quite extrodinary.  One believed it could be the space station or three satellites traveling in the same orbit, but this was dismissed when one of the ""stars"" moved out of formation and then sped up to regroup with the other two to form the triangle again.

However, this was something that really surprised my friends though I have been aware of UFO possibilities since I was a child in Indiana. The three lights were white/pink in color and traveled at a relatively slow rate of speed, yet when one veered off course then sped up to catch the others - my suspicion grew deeper.  These were traveling at a relatively high, but other stars were blocked when the object moved towards them...hence indicating that the object was lower in the sky than I originally thought.

I don't know if we heard nothing because it made no sound or because it was so high up, but the white lights on the bottom were very bright. We had to walk to the street to continue to see it because of the roof top and because of the brightness we were able to watch it for about 10 minutes, until we lost it.  I wanted to tell people at work the next day but didn't want people to think I was strange.  Then tonight 8/7/00 when my husband went outside around 9:45pm I followed him we saw 2 objects comming from the north east heading in a straight line south east, like the night before just as high in the sky but moving fast.  There were two airplanes with one of the objects in back and it moved so fast it passed the airplane like it was standing still.  The objects lights have a different look than a plane.  We watched them and the planes until the tree got in the way.  Then about 5 min later there were 3 more comming from the same direction moving very fast faster than a jet and flashing only red lights.  At one point one disappeared (no lights) then they all disappeared (lights gone) then reappeared (lights on all at the same time).  They were in an -l pattern (like a backwards L). It took only a few min maybe 1-3 to pass from the north to the south then out of sight because of the tree.  I saw no white lights tonight. We have a reserve base in Fresno and we see alot of jets fly. We also ha! ve an ai rport and can see the planes take off.  These objects including the planes did not take off from Fresno due to the high altitude they were flying and the proximiaty of the airport to my home. The objects were flying faster than any jet I have seen take off from Fresno. We do not live in the airports flight path, planes don't usually fly over our house. The objects tonight were in the same flight path as we see the big jets fly. Tomorrow night I plan on looking for them between 9-10pm hopefully the sky will be clear again. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness is describing, but she states that the object had a red light and a green light on it.  These colors are suggestive to us  of an aircraft.  Any vessel, either a ship or an aircraft, must have a red light on its left side, and a green light on its right side, in order to facilitate avoidance during navigation at night.

I'm a video technician presently employed at the D.A. s office. My duties are to document crime scene evidence and statements from defendents.This is actually my second UFO sighting,in June 1982 on a clear sunny day I was walking with my older brother who is also an ameteur  astronomer. We  saw a large cylinder shaped metallic object approximately  150 ft in length hovering about 10,000 ft. The UFO made no sound, it just floated for about 2 minutes, it then became smaller in size and began moving north. We lost sight of it. On 6/3/00 at about 11:30pm my wife returned from having dinner. I stood at the window  looking out at the harbor and the New York skyline. We have a pretty good view from our top floor apartment and could see for miles. The evening was cool and the night sky was clear. I looked up at the big dipper and  saw a small object like a star moving north to south across the big dipper. I thought it could have been a satellite and I wanted my wife to see it, however the object vanished. About 15 minutes later a second object appears inthe same area also moving north to south. At this point I was already on the fire escape with my binoculars. Unfortunately for my wife she was already in the shower. I sat patiently looking up at the night sky for about another 15 minutes, then saw 2 chevron shaped UFO's circuling next to the dipper.They stopped and faced eachother then continued circuling. I remember thinking  that these had to be birds flying around at night but when I looked at them through my binoculars I saw 2 boomerangs slowly circuling in the sky. I immediately became exited and had to rub my eyes to make sure I was not seeing things. I watched these objects for a few seconds, they were a dull biege color with a soft brownish glow or haze, One of the UFO'S was wider then the other and looked more like a large hand glider while the other object had a much more alien appearance to it. They had no lights  or windows though they appeared to reflect some light. It was difficult to determine s! ize beca use they were dull however when looking at them through my binoculars I could tell that they large objects, probably 100 to 150 ft wide and hovering about 10,000 ft up.I realized that I had to get my wife to see this. I began knocking on the bathroom door pleading for her to come out and see these things. she came out but  they had  already dissappeared. Together we continued watching for about another 15 -20 minutes.Then we observed a third satellite moving in the opposite direction across the dipper. That night I couldn't sleep thinking about what I saw. The next morning we talked about it and decided that what we saw were either real extraterrestrial crafts coming in from space circuling over the city and then moving back out to space or military satellites trying to track the two chevron UFO's. What's also strange is that this incident occurred exactly 18 years after the first one and for the past few weeks prior to the second sighting I've been getting this feeling that I was going to see something again. Could we be right about what we saw and have other people had similar feelings prior to seeing a UFO?",2000-07-11T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

As they topped a small rise, the women saw what at first they thought was an accident scene, with ambulance and police car lights flashing red in the night.  As they approached the scene, Mrs. X became frightened and crouched down in the front floorboard area of the passenger side of the car.  Mrs. Y stopped her car opposite the scene in the brush.  The circular object, which appeared to be hovering just above tree-top level (about 15 feet).  The object was round, aluminum in color and was circumvented with flashing red and green lights.  There was a spike on the top of the object with another red and green flashing light.  Mrs. Y said the object, which she estimated to be at least 50 feet in diameter, made absolutely no sound at all.  She flashed her car lights in an attempt to see better and at that time the object began an upward movement, slowly at first, giving Mrs. Y the opportunity to see a large, black ""spot"" in the center of the bottom of the object.  The object then shot out of sight at a high rate of speed.  Mrs. Y continued her trip into Freer, dropping off her friend (who refuses to speak about the incident at all) and arriving home about 03:15 CDT.  It was at this time that Mrs. Y became frightened, realizing that she had seen something totally unknown to her.  Her daughter, a woman in her mid-twenties, became concerned at seeing her mother's pale, wide-eyed appearance and asked her was wrong, thinking the older lady had been in a wreck.  When Mrs. Y related the sighting to her daughter, who insisted they call her brother in Arizona. The brother, Mr. Y, is a retired AF Lt. Col. interested in the ufo question and a lay astronomer.  He was awake, star-gazing, when the call came. When the 'phone rang, Mr. Y was afraid there was trouble at home.  He was relieved to learn there wasn't, and excited to learn of his mother's UFO sighting.  Later that morning he contacted NUFORC, who contacted me.  I am Doris Upchurch, Asst. State Director (for S.Tex) for MUFON.  I called Mr. Y, verifying his excitement and obtaining his mother's 'phone number.  I then contacted the Y household, talking to the daughter, who related to me the appearance of her mother upon her arrival.  It was agreed that I should contact them again when I reached Freer, approximately 3 hours later.  I called Susanna Washburn, a MUFON field investigator, and we left within the hour.  We could not contact the Ys by 'phone when we reached Freer, so returned home to Corpus Christi.  I talked again to Mr. Y, who told me that his friend, R, had visited the sight and believed there to be some physical evidence of a landing, although this did not agree with the report from his mother.  R had also e-mailed Mr. Y a drawing made by Mrs. Y of the object she had  witnessed.  I talked again to Mrs. Y, who told me the same story as had originally been related to me by her children, stating that she believed God had allowed her to see something special.  Mrs. Y is a quiet woman, who neither reads nor writes English, learning to speak (quite well) the language when her children entered public school. To satisfy the investigative attempts, the Live Oak County State Section Director, Connie Churchill, was asked to do a follow-up investigation.  She was in contact with Mr. Y by 'phone and was told that Mrs. Y was expecting her call about 15:00 CDT on Thursday, June 15, 2000.  She was equipped with map co-ordinates and descriptions of the area which had been received from Mr. Y.  Again, there was no response from the Y household when our investigator got to Freer.  She proceeded to the intersection of Tx Hwy 44 and FM 3196, near where the sighting took place.  She found nothing to indicate a landing had occurred. During the following week, I received another excited e-mail from Mr. Y, stating that his friend R had found an alien face etched into a rock outcropping in the dry creek bed at the site.  I asked our newest field investigator trainee to accompany me back to Freer, arranging this time to meet with R upon our arrival.  When we reached the intersection of 44 and 3196, I called R, who came right out, leading us west for 4/10 of a mile.  We examimed the area carefully, noting the natural flood water drainage area, the dark, clay rock bed and the high voltage power lines (main supply lines between Freer and Laredo, Tx).  Neither myself nor my trainee John Richardson found anything that looked remotely like an alien face etched into the clay.  As we prepared to leave the aarea, Mrs. Y and her daughter drove by, stopped and talked to us.  Mrs. Y again related the same story she had told me on the 'phone, pointing out where the object had been hovering and re-affirming the fact that it had not been on the ground. She said that the dark area on the bottom of the craft looked like a hole.  (Mr. Y had told her he thought it was a doorway, but she didn't know if it was or not.  Just that it looked like a hole.)",2000-07-11T00:00:00,27.911199999999997,-98.5865

Mention was made of it and I went out and still found it in the sky but located approximately 3 feet (held at arms length) north of original position which was just next to the moon in the eastern sky. My view was looking north with Mt. Lemmon in the background (a 9,000 ft mt.)and up at about a 45 degree angle in the sky. Object was moving further away in height and distance from my vantage point. Binoculars revealed an odd shaped object much like a balloon but not round at all. Rough estimates of the shape are difficult but it was not aerodynamic in nature. My thoughts were like a balloon that they attach to car lots of a gorilla etc. Maybe this floated away. The only problem with this theory is that it was not a recognizable shape except for a rectangular portion at one end and 2 pieces sticking out from it to another irregular mass. Object made no noise, shape changed as you watched and was estimated at between 2000-3000 feet high and rising somewhat. Object moved slowly and had strange grey shadowing on white, no other color (such as advertising balloons would have). Upon looking at object for some 10 min. I went inside and returned to have another look about 2 min. later. Object had disappeared. This is what caused me to report the incident. Being in the aviation field and familiar with aircraft types I would have to say it possibly was a balloon except that through the use of logic and common understanding of gravity I cannot see how an object of approx. 30-60 feet in size(estimated) could have ""deflated"" and fallen out of the sky in such a short time period .I believe the object could have been a balloon but it gave chills to view from binoculars as it was a very odd shape and in the sunlight you could see a grey mist around the object as you viewed it,perhaps an occular trick due to binocular magnific! ation an d the eye straining to understand what was being viewed.

I've never seen a UFO, but may have one better than that.  In 1959 I was visiting my grandfather at his house on the mountainous outskirts of Superior, Montana (this was the old railroad signal maintainer's house).  I made this visit every summer for 2 weeks - in this case I stayed three weeks, but for the last time.  The 1st or 2nd morning I awoke early and noticed that the bedroom door was ajar an inch.  But this was impossible as my grandfather was religious about closing and locking doors, especially at night.  Nor was there any possible way anyone could have gotten into the house. So I kept myself awake all the next night, and, oddly, the door did pop open roughly after midnight.  It also appeared that the hall light was on, because I could easily see the light from the opened door.  But the door did not open much more than an inch, unless, that is, I was extremely still and relaxed over several minutes, then it would gently open to 4-6 inches.  If I allowed myself to approach sleep, but not quite, 6 inches could be pretty well assured.  During all this, my grandfather slept in the same bed between myself and the door.  He had a bad case of apnea and made thunderous snoring noises and had violent nightmares all night. After about six nights, I asked him if we could swap - this would put my head only about 3 feet from the door and facing just a little into the hall.  Still, I could see very little all night and the door never opened over about 4 inches.  Finally, I coaxed myself into a half-sleep, a drifting sort of awareness and readiness to prod myself into a quick alert if disturbed.  Remember, it seemed as if I was safe enough as long as I was awake, but it was also fairly obvious that whatever was watching was not human and could be a serious threat.  ""It"" had something in mind, obviously, and it planned to come closer at the first opportunity. I first entered that half awake state on about the sixth day and was in it perhaps only 30-40 seconds.  The thought that my privacy might already have ! been inv aded or I might be in danger came suddenly, and I abruptly opened my eyes.  Yes, the door was open a good 9-12 inches.  There were five creatures peeking in the opening.  They looked exactly like the classic Grey, except that I could only see their heads as they leaned over each other.  I thought they looked like little circus men, but had never heard of Greys or space aliens in 1959, and I was only 11. Now, after they'd been caught in this way, the door was kept much tighter.  I thought perhaps they'd been frightened completely away, but no, they came again each night, but the door never again opened more than an inch.  Their boldness had been diminished.  But I was still very curious myself, so I stayed.  In fact, I decided to stay longer than my two week plan.  I was not frightened too much, but quite frightened at the thought of going to sleep, because I didn't know what they might then do.  But staying awake all night every night for 20+ days can be difficult, so I ended up drifting off again.  Again, I abruptly opened my eyes.  This time the door remained nearly shut as usual, but something else was happening.  There was a column, or zone, of vibrating light, highly energetic, but without sound.  It appeared that the creatures were ""transporting"" into the room with some sort of energy field.  I've heard of abductees reporting a bluish light.  I don't remember any actual color, but I do remember the strong, twitching movements and concentrated light about a foot wide and roughly four foot high. This is my big story.  It is quite true, not exaggerated one iota, and I am therefore fully convinced of the Greys' reality.  I got very bored with the game after that, was a bit frightened, and so I went home.  I didn't tell the old folks about it because I did not expect to be believed. ((NUFORC Note:  Although we believe that some interaction takes place between humans and otherworldly creatures, this may be the first time we have ever heard of twenty straight nights of visitation.  Moreover, it allegedly occurred in 1959, which raises the question of how the witness could remember the number of nights of visitation, and other details, so precisely.

The date and time information is only approximate since I didn't record that information at the time. However, the weather was calm and the night sky was clear. A white light came in from the horizon rather rapidly, however, no quicker than a jet. The light wasn't spectacular or anything; something you'd expect from an aircraft. It then slowed down once above the camp area and continued along until it went out of site. There were no sounds heard from the object. A few minutes later, another light came in rapidly from the horizon just as the first. My first thought was that it was an Air Force interceptor investigating the original object. However, it gradually stopped and hovered above the camp area. It was fairly high up, perhaps 500 feet (it was difficult to know exactly). There were no sounds from this object as well. It hovered for a short while until the next event occurred. The original object came back from where it went out of site. It stopped and hovered fairly close to the most recent object; perhaps within 50-100 feet. This went on for about 20 seconds or so. The 2 objects then went off together and went out of site to where the first object did. About 5 minutes later, the two objects came back and hovered above the camp ground again. Suddenly, one object moved out of the way a bit and carefully adjusted it's position. It then accelerated vertically. I could follow it for about a second. Then it suddenly picked up tremendous speed and literally bolted into the heavens. At that moment, I knew I witnessed a very special technology in action. I didn't know what it was, but I knew it was very special. The other object went to the same takeoff position about 5 seconds later. It then took off in an identical fashion.

I was out in my backyard, relaxing after a long day lifeguarding-- listening to music and enjoying the view of the evening stars (laying on a picnic table).  Actually, the stars were out directly overhead, but the horizon was still in that twilight blue phase.  I became aware of a movement in the sky in the west horizon, moving slowly in my direction.  I sat up to get a better view, and noticed that the movement simply seemed to block out the sky where it passed . . . there were no lights of any kind.  I was able to figure the shape of the object by observing the omission of sky/stars as it moved.  It was roughly in the shape of a chevron (or boomerang), but seemed to be filled in as well, which aproximates the shape of a triangle.  It was only after a few seconds that I realized that the ""craft"" was not a distant object, but was actually VERY close.  It was flying over the neighborhood.  By the time it was over the nearest house to my backyard, I was able to estimate height,size and speed.  It was aproximately 50 feet wide, gliding silently at about the height of two telephone poles, and traveling at only 30 mph.  As it went directly over me, I heard a very faint mechanical sound, somewhat akin to squeaky wet rubber.  It was at that point that I became extremely uncomfortable-- sensing that something was defintely ""off"" in the normal scheme of things.  As the object passed out of my sight over my house, I felt the overwhelming need to run into the house, but was petrified that the ""thing"" might have landed in the front yard!  I banged on the back door, but realized that everyone was downstairs and couldn't hear.  I ran around to the front in spite of my fear, and rushed into the house.  I was trembling as I ran downstairs.  I could hardly recount what I had experienced.  Having adequately frightened my younger brothers (unintentionally . . . this time!), we locked the doors to the house, and closed the blinds (like THAT would help).

We were near the intersection of Bell Rd. and Mufreesboro Rd. travelling south, when we noticed a very large object that looked like a giant dumbbell in the sky.  I saw on the dash radio when we got out it was 9:42pm as immediately prior to the beginning of the incident I was changing the radio station.  The object came in very slow from the NE, and then turned paralell to the road we were on.  It came to a stop.  As it came to a stop another vehicle, a station wagon, stopped with us.  Out of it got a man, a woman, a boy, and a oyung girl. We estimated it to be about a half of a mile to a mile away.  It appeared to hover.  There was no sound of any type eminating from it.  About five minutes or so after it stopped in the air, three triangular ships approached it from the NE also at a high rate of speed, and took up positions rotating about it.  This relationship was maintained by all the ships with the three triangular ships were rotating horizontally, with their apparent noses pointing towards the dumbbell shaped craft in a counter clockwise manner.   We maintained this observation for some ten minutes, until the dumbell craft moved SSE about three ship lengths of itself, abruptly turned to a 60 degree upward pitch, and literally went up instantly.  The starfield around the ship seemed to bend towards it.  Almost as quickly, the three triangular ships turned upward, as if in pursuit of it.  They seemed to be reacting to the dumbbell ships actions, and were visibly slower in their acceleration towards it. When we got in the car it was 10:24pm, and we seemed disturbed by the incident because the amount of time we spent outside the vehicle seemed to be no more than 15 to 20 minutes.

Spotted them as they  approached the Colorado River from the Bullhead side.  There were about 8 or 9 of them in a chevron formation. Then from the Chevron formation they formed 2 separate circles and still moved at the same steady - fast speed. The individual craft (I'm assuming) rotated around into circles for about 10 seconds then quickly reverted back to the chevron formation.  I told my mother to look at it and she saw it at the moment that they were moving back into the Chevron formation.   I would say that they were flying at a higher altitude than jets and it took them only about 40 to 60 seconds to leave our line of sight.

At approx 39,000 ft i noticed on the l/h/s of the plane a formation of red and blue lights about 10 feet apart,  later i witnessed red and white lights going under the plane and pinkish red lights that turned to glowing red at the side of the plane.  They formed a triangle of lights before merging into a straight line. Then later in the flight flourescent orange/amber  shapes, in the shape of a sofa.  The object was in front then adjacent to the plane. before i lost sight of it.  I got out of my seat to see the object appearing to be going backwards slowly. I went back to my seat and continued to see triangular formations mimiking the plane, copying the lights and appearing playfull.  later i saw an orange shape very low over a village. All others on the flight were reading, sleeping or watching the inflight movie.  An orange sphere moved towards the plane, i asked a fellow passenger to look but it dropped suddenly out of view, the passenger was female and French, she said she saw nothing,but i felt she had.  I felt scared an isolated.  I asked the pilots after the flight did he see weird lights..he asked me what i saw, then said no.",2000-07-23T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

It was to my right (east) and I saw it through my windshield for about 1.5 seconds.  (I have a compact '92 Mazda pick-up).   My first impression was a very fast aircraft, which I rejected because the nav light should have been red and, given the brightness of the light, an aircraft with such a nav light would have been flying too low for such a fast speed.  I looked at the vehicles over in the northbound express lanes to my immediate left but there were none which could have been going so fast as to cause such a reflection on the interior of my windshield, nor did I see any obvious green lights on the vehicles.   To me, the object was decidedly green.  I also had the impression of a flat trajectory, and it left no trail.  I also had the impression that it was wider than just a point of light.  This incident was tucked away in my mind until I heard a portion of Mr. Davenport's interview last Monday night on the radio and he mentioned this incident.

Only this was maybe 2 miles out over the ocean and were way too high in the sky to be confused for a boat on the horizon or a flare. The light would turn on, and start to dim and fade out. It would be dark again, and a few minutes would pass and all of the sudden it would turn on again, and begin to fade out again. We managed to capture this on video the second night with houses in front of us along with cars going by just to prove it was real. At one time, two lights would turn on at once and begin to fade out. I ruled it out that these could be natural occuring phenomon because there had to be thought behind it. There was a pattern that would keep occuring. The way the would light up one right after the other and fade out definitly showed that this could not have been any kind of ball lightning(no clouds) or a flare because a flare would be much brighter and would move.

I grabbed a pair of binoculars I had handy in order to observe it more closely.  It was a single craft in a disk or saucer shape.  It appeared to be moving very slowly and at a low altitude in a north by northeast direction.  Because of this movement, I had to switch to a northerly facing window at the front of my living room through which to continue to observe it.  My being on a 3rd floor lifted me above the surrounding houses and gave me an unobstructed view of this object in the sky.  It appeared to glow and was luminous tan in color.  Tiny lights red, green, yellow, white, etc. in color flashed on & off all over the surface of this moving object.  This reminded me of the random flashing of a Christmas tree light array.  The disk of this craft did not appear to be rotating.  It was majestically beautiful in its polychromatic luminousness and surreal slow motion in the night sky.  At one point a jet or propeller airplane appeared through my binoculars in the same field of vision, but its white light was far more distant than the UFO and moved much more rapidly.

To Whom This May Concern:  I would like to report an unidentified flying object  I personally witnessed on June 21, 2000 between 4:30-4:50 pm in Glendale, Colorado.  The weather conditions at the time of my sighting were superb, with clear skies, only a small amount of visible haze, and high temperatures. I am currently a taxi driver living and working here in Denver.  (Although I am currently a taxi driver, I hold a master's degree in the humanities from the University of Denver and worked for several years in the counseling field.)  Having driven the city most of the day (Wednesday June 21), I was somewhat tired and pulled into a Glendale city park located one block west of E. Virginia Ave. and S. Cherry St. I reclined back in the grass to cool myself in the shade of a small tree. (Although I was tired, I certainly was not sleepy and stayed fully awake and alert.) I was facing slightly northeast. At this time (about 4:30 pm) I noticed a gold object in the northeast sky almost directly above my position. The object appeared to be at an extremely high altitude (this was confirmed about ten minutes later when a passenger jet passed below it. I could then determine that the object was more than likely in the high atmosphere, or, a space object of some sort). The object was approximately twice the size of the brightest of night stars and it seemed, at first, to be spherical in nature.  However, occasionally it would seem to ""turn"" and take on more of an oblong dimension. During this time, the object changed from gold to red and then white, making no eccentric movements whatsoever. Colors seemed to change (sequentially, I believe) in this manner for the duration of my observation. Furthermore, its movement to the east/southeast was gradual and directional, and, although not hurried, still quite noticeable (traversing approximately 20 degrees east/southeast through the sky). I observed its movement for approximately 20 minutes until it literally ""disappeared"" at about 4:45-4:50 pm. Is your organization aware of any man-made objects (communication satellites, Hubble Telescope, the International Space Station, Mir Station, etc.) which would have occupied that area of sky during this time of the day on Wednesday June 21? My inital thoughts were of comsats, etc., although I have never before witnessed such an object (especially in such a bright sky as the sun was high and just after its zenith).

When it got about one lane away from an 18 wheeler, it went straight up and we could, at that point, tell it was not a normal plane. We heard no engine. The object then ""teased"" all the cars on the freeway by flying back and forth across the highway. We know others saw it because the trucks were swerving and slowing down. The object would fly real close to a vehicle then suddenly go the other direction. Because of the agility, we were unable to tell which direction was straight for the vehicle, it would turn vertical then fly up, over, or back. Then do the same thing in a horizontal position. There were head lamps on it that were not on all the time that were so bright, we ruled out the possibility of a remote controlled model airplane. It seemed as though the vehicle was flying directly at something then when it reached a certain distance away, it would go another direction, immediately. The other side had 2 colums of flashing colored lights which helped to determine at what angle we were seeing the vehicle. We were somewhere on highway 5 about an hour north of Coalinga, California (that is where we stopped to spend the night-about an hour after we saw the object). The object looked about the size of an RV although there were no street lamps so it was difficult to detect. It looked like two platforms parallel to each other with a few columns connecting the platforms. It was too dark to see in between the columns and the lights were so bright, we were unable to see the full vehicle when they were shining in our direction.

Occasionally looking up from her reading, she noticed a stationary light, which she assumed to be a star, that was getting brighter, over a period of approximately 2 hours, by which time the star's magnitude was similar to that of Venus.  Slowly then, the light began moving south at a speed of approximately one degree per minute.  My mother called my father into the front room to see the strange light.  They were so shocked by its rapid increase in speed (up to 10-15 degrees per minute), that they went outside and watched it move across the sky.  After only a few minutes, my mother became so unsettled that they went back inside, locked the doors, and had a good, nervous laugh.

From east side of ferry boat spotted string of brilliant red balls that apeared to be diving into the sea far away.   My first inpression was that a plane had fired a string of red rockets, but the things didn't trail smoke, didn't explode or fade out.  My impression now, almost fifty years later was that another such string followed the first.  There were no aircraft in sight in the area. Rather simple observation it seems, but I came across letters to home describing the unique event.   Being a sailor and stationed on a ship, I was not at all aware that this sighting coincided with the great defense alert along the coast, especially around Washington that night until I read in the Book of Lists of the report by an airliner coming in from over the Atantic that red lights approached him at ""thousands of miles per hour"".   If those strings of lights were the ones I saw at that same time and date, what I saw were not diving into the sea, but passing over the very distant horizon.",,36.889383361064894,-76.26208236272879

It was early evening and I said to myself that perhaps its a ballon.  I looked just above the object, but there were several stars above the object. I left and went into the barracks. Several months later I took a course in communications.  The person teaching the course used the UFO as an example of an incident that percipitated the use of a ""Flash priority"" message to the Pentagon. He stated that flash priority is used only in cases of national emergency and that it was the first time that flash priority had been used at Ramey AFB since WWII.  It is my understanding that aircraft, in this case the B-36 had not been able to land and aircraft had been diverted to LA. The person giving the course did not explain.  He talked about it as if everyone in the class was familiar with the incident.  I take from that that the whole base was familiar with this UFO.

When I returned, the object was still moving slowly in the same direction, but was nearing the crest of the hill beside my house.  Before I could find it in the telescope it had disappeared over the hill.

The upper light was a white light where as the lower lights had a slight yellow or amber tint, not dark, however. The lower lights traveled from left to right. They cycled in a line or revolved and seemed to go faster as the craft increased in speed. When I observed it as it moved away it took about 8 - 10 seconds for the lights to make a revolution. It came from north to south traveling about 40 mph. It went south towards the south hill area towards the radio towers. Then I observed it going west when it became lost from view. I first observed it with the naked eye then with 7-21x35 power binoculars. I first saw it as it came into my line of sight above my head. It was about 100 yards away. This distance was easy to verify as I had an office building and telephone poles of known size to compare the craft to. The cycling lights were most impressive, giving me the errie feeling in that I have never seen anything like it before, this close, having seen unexplainable lights while living in Alaska many years ago. The next thing that was more impressive was how slow it was moving and still being able to remain airborne. But most impressiive was the total lack of noise usually associated with aircraft.

Appproximately 5-6 nm south of Jefferson County Airport (10-11 nm south of the town of Port Townsend), directly ahead approximately 1 nm ahead and at about my altitude I saw what I immediately thought was a WW II barrage balloon, like those used in the Battle of Britain--it was so like that that no other thought or association came to my mind. It was brown or olive drab in color and seemed too small to be a modern blimp. The ""balloon"" was stationary, as if tethered in the fields below, though I saw no tethering lines; it had no airfoils or control surfaces except the fin-like empennage typical of barrage ballons and blimps, and it had no engine, propellor or other visible source of power. I saw no lights anytime during the episode.  It was pointed in a westerly direction.  My immediate thought was to wonder why anyone would tether a barrage balloon in at this point.  I altered my heading to pass behind (east of) the balloon and take a closer look. When I was approximately 1/4 nm from it, the balloon suddenly accelerated at a very high rate of speed to the west, toward the Olympic Mountains; I turned to follow it;  in a few seconds it had gone from my sight.  There was no visible exhaust or other indication of power or motion.  I have been a certified flight instructor for approximately 30 years and was in instructor in the Strategic Air Command.

I also looked at it with 60x28Mc field glasses. It was round 3d and very shiny or spinning possibly. It moved very smoothly, not in a jerking fashion.

While sitting outside on a deck at an approximate elevation of 400-500 feet above the Wilamette river looking to the East, 4 adults including myself witnessed an object crossing over head slightly South of our position. It moved at rapid speed from west to East toward the river. We discussed it's speed and at first thought it to be a satellite however as we watched it pass without sound we agreed it was too close to be a satellite. At this point the object slowed considerably to what looked looked like a stop and apeared to have some color qualities. At this point approximately 45 seconds after our first sighting, I became more puzzled as to what the object might be. It was too fast for conventional aircraft, made no noise and now had stopped. The sky was overcast but the object was visible the entire time. It had stopped approximately over Mt Scott at which time I asked my brother in law if he had binoculars, he said ther was a telescope inside. It was just inside and on a tripod. I quickly brought it outside to the edge of the deck. The object was still stationary and as i began to look it apeared to turn brightlights directly our direction. I was able to get approximately a 4 to 7 second clear look at the object. I was actually  shocked to see see the object through the telescope so clearly. It was not an airplane. It had a bright red light at the top of a triangular shape with many smaller lights running at angles down the sides creating the shape of a triangle. It actually looked more like a cone with small strings of lights running from the top point of the triangle down to the base. It was not moving very much toward the north so my brief vision was amazingly clear. When a actually realized what I was looking at was not an aircraft, I simply said to the group just that, ""that's not a plane"", it then moved to a point where it was obstructed by the house in front of us. I ran with the telescope 1 short block to a view spot at the end of the street where there was a 180 degree view looking East, bu! t was un able to find the object again. I could see however all the incoming aircraft to Portland international. There is actually a good deal of aircraft activity visible from both the deck and from the end of the block. It was easy to compare what I had seen to the other aircraft and I became even more clear the differences between what I saw and the aircraft in the area, both looking through the telescope and to the naked eye.

We couldn't figure for the life of us what it was and could only think it maybe was a satelite until it dead stopped and changed direction - to go south. Considering  how far away it was, it had to be moving REALLY fast, and there was no trail.  Then it stopped dead again for about a minute.

At 8:45 pm, I was looking at stars in south sky. A number of BRIGHT (almost phosphoresant) little lights rose above a tree south of us. They were very close together, and I thought they were residual fireworks from the Fourth. It rose a little higher in the sky, and I realized it was a craft of some kind. We live in the LAx and Ontario flight paths, so we are used to crafts of all kinds. This thing was a bunch of little blinking (random) very white, almost tranluscent lights. It came north toward where I was sitting. It got close enough that I could vaguely determine that it was almost like an octagonal shaped cylinder. The funny thing was that it was very hard to get a depth perception on. It made NO SOUND at all. I was able to determine that it was lower than the planes to LAX and higher than the ones to Ontario. It came north and then made an exact right angle turn to the west. It rose higher in the sky,as it proceded west. A plane going to LAX was coming up behind it, but it was very, very difficult to judge the height or depth of this thing. It was eery. As I was trying to figure out exactly how high above the plane it was, the jet turned on all of it's lights right behind it!!!!  It followed it for about five seconds, and then the thing just disappeared, leaving only the jet to LAX in the sky. I called LAX, but of course got nothing. As I stated, we live in the flight paths for two major airports and have for fifteen years. We are used to seeing and being able to identify just about anything that goes over-head. We have seen everything from the Stealth to the Concord, to trial aircraft flying out of Miro Airport in Rialto, Calif, to every kind of blimp and helicopter you can imagine.

My wife then agreed on that choice of words. The most significant part of the experience for me, was the speed at which it went away; it neither sped off like in the films, nor did it just disappear - it actually receded (so that it appeared at about a tenth of its previous size) within about 5 seconds. I would say it could have been a few miles away, but it's difficult when you don't know the size involved. My wife reckons it was a lot further than that, possibly celestial.

Pilot spotted object and asked us passengers, ""Do you see that?"" ...In front, to the right and below the plane, we see a shiny metallic coffee can shaped object - no wings, no strings or wrinkles like a mylar balloon -- just a shiny silver colored object reflecting sunlight (It was a clear day with haze only in distant horizon). Object appeared only as big as a pencil eraser at arms length. Object traveled steadily, but not speedily in nearly straight beeline north, passing us on right, but rose slightly to our plane's altitude as it passed. Definitely was not being carried the wind like a balloon. Object NAVIGATED north. Pilot radioed to air traffic control for radar identification of target. ATC said ""Showing no traffic in your area"". Pilot explained to me later that before he pointed it out to us, it came in swiftly from the ocean - from the front left - above the plane, then moved swiftly from left to right above and in front of the plane at a distance before descending to the right below the plane. Then he pointed the object out to us. ATC was tracking other targets, like parasailers, at other points on this flight from Atlantic City to Cape May. It was very odd. Distance was difficult to determine, but I haven't had a chance to discuss those details with my pilot cousin yet. He keeps detailed flight notes, so the exact altitude, position and his estimated distance of the object should be obtainable.",2000-07-23T00:00:00,,

It first appeared to me to be an airplane leaving behind a smog trail. However, I then noticed that the trail was not getting longer as the object moved significantly towards the ocean. Then I realized that it was not a trail at all, but rather a single object with a light in the front, wich I originally thought was an airplane. This could not have been a conventional aircraft first and foremost because of its size. The object would only be covered from my eyes' view if I would hold out a pen a few inches from my face. This is too large for any conventional aircraft, considering that the object was pretty high in the sky. It was also NOT making any noise.

The weather was calm, 70 degrees, clear skies. We were looking at a few pink clouds just after sunset when suddenly a very bright cylinder-shaped object appeared at about 30 degrees above the horizon, at the 1 0'clock position above us. I observed the object for about 30 minutes through bioculars.  There were no wings, no windows, no markings, no sound, no contrail. The object had no lights, except for one moments when a reflection from the sun, I assume, beamed out from the side nearest the sun, 9by now set). This bright reflection lasted only a moment, and was replaced by a black line on the leading edge and bottom surface. The object was lilted down and to the left. After a moment, it started to move very slowly from right to left and down toward the horizon. It took 30 minutes to move from its original position  of one o'clock down to the horizon, or seven o'clock, a position a few miles north of Marinette, WI. That was about one degree per minute, way too slow for an airliner, etc. By the time it went over the horizon, it had become pink as well, as it was heading toward and beyond where the sunset position had been. This event was witness by my wife, and was observed in daylight to dusk. It did not vary in speed or direction, and held to its slow, downward tilted descent and speed without change or variation.

There was no noise.  The lights came on one at atime from left to right.  They hovered and faded out rather quickly and reappeared.  We called a friend so he could go outside and observe these lights because we knew he would never believe us.  After the lights went out two friends went down to my dock on the lake to continue to watch the sky.  They (the two friends) had seen three lights appear in the sky 45 minutes before these lights appeared but didn't think they were much of anything.  After a few minutes the three lights appeared again but they had shifted to the south ever so slightly but still hovering above the tree line.  I was rather frightened but I continued to look and then six lights came on sequentially from left to right this time.  Again whitish in a horizontal line and it looked as though those lights were turning, lifting up somewhat and then the lights vanished.  A few minutes later my two friends on the dock spotted a very very bright light over Buck Mountain and they observed this light shooting straight down.  AFter that no more lights were seen.  The next day I talked to two campers that also observed the lights.  I also found out that I had two friends at the South End of the lake see simalar lights that night, but they had also seen the lights on Monday August 7th.  They saw 6 lights and then another row of 6 lights in a V formation after having seen three lights (looking at drawings we saw very similar formation)  They didn't want to tell anyone because they figured no one would believe them.  A few kids saw lights two days before I did in Minerva and chased the lights with their car but the lights disappeared.  A witness also saw lights on his drive from Indian Lake to Blue Mt. Lake on Thurs, Aug 10th at approx 9:30pm.  So we know we were not the only ones to see the lights. ! We made calls to the Air Force and apparently they were doing manoevuers that night but two of my friends spotted two aircraft much farther north and they spotted the aircraft several minutes after we saw the light formation.  We also speculated Fort Drum because it is to the west of us but upon contacting The Adirondack Daily Enterprise after a story on the lights appeared there this weekend Fort Drum was ruled out.  Are we the chosen ones?  We were rejected and you know what that is okay with me because it scared the pants off me.  Where I condsider myself a cynical non-believer at heart, this definitely altered my mind. Peter, Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.  First of all the area where the  lights were spotted were in a remote area of the Adirondack Mountains.  In  fact where I was staying at the time there is no electricity on either side  of the lake at that point.  There would definitely not have been a blimp  there at the time.  In fact the posting from New York State from a location  near Watertown on the same day is most likely the same thing that I spotted  with my group of friends.  The description is pretty accurate.  As far as  having others post for you, I'll give it a try but most of the folks aren't  into the computer thing.  I'll have my one friend that was with me at the  time submit his version because he started to see a light formation about 45  minutes before the rest of us.  My cousin contacted an air force base  southwest of the Adirondacks and they confirmed that they were doing  manoevures that night but I feel pretty confident that this was definitely  not anything that was related to air craft activities.  The Adirondack Daily  Enterprise is doing a story on the sightings and you can reach the reporter  if you want to at 518-891-2600, her first name is Victoria (sorry I can't  remember her last name) ((NUFORC Note:  we intentionally leave the newspaper contact information in this report.))  I'm sure she would be interested in talking to you  for her story and she can maybe put something in the article about posting  submissions.    She has been contacting people around the area because many  people have called her because there was a published report in Sat August  12th's paper.   How would I send a map to you?  If you get a map of New York State, Long Lake  is in the center of the Adirondack Park, south of Lake Placid, North of Lake  George...  Sightings were also made from Saranac Lake (info from newspaper  article)   I also read a posting from a person that works at the prison north of LL in  Malone that described the UFO on Monday August 7th, my friends saw it on Aug.  7th too so I have the feeling these sightings are also related.   It's very interesting, have you ever spotted a UFO, do you have any thoughts  on UFO's?  All I know was that it was extremely creepy and I ran in to grab  the children because I was totally afraid.   So yes the area was remote, full of wilderness.  The Adirondack Park is 6  million acres large public/privately owned.  I hope this sparks your  interest.  Also I checked and someone in Massachusetts also saw a similar  formation (these are all from your website) so we want to know what it  was..... Thanks again ((name deleted))",2000-08-19T00:00:00,43.9541,-74.5551

We were sitting around the fire after dinner.  It had been dark for about an hour.  My friend called my attention to some lights in the West that he had been watching for perhaps 20 seconds.  I turned around and saw perhaps 8 bright lights just above the horizon to the West.  They looked like aircraft landing lights on a plane within 5 miles as they were lined up horizontally, but they jsut hung there and I had never heard of an airplane with that many landing lights and they went out after perhaps 10 seconds which is also not typical of landing lights.  My friend said that he had watched it for about 20 seconds before he thought to tell me and that the lights had been bright as ""welding arc"" and had maintained the same formation.  We also noticed that there were three columns of diffuse light coming from ground level and pointing straight up, also in the West.  Other members of our party witnessed these and thought they looked like Northern Lights except they did not waver at all and seemed to be more like beams coming from the ground like weal search lights.  These remained for maybe 10 minutes.  Perhaps a minute or two after the formation disappeared, it reappeared in about the same place although in a more red to yellow color and not so much in line.  They again stayed put. This lasted maybe 20 seconds before going out.  We watched closely after that and soon saw very tiny reddish dots, again in the West, that were zipping about in what seemed to be a random pattern.  My guess is about 10 of these.  We watched for quite a while and didn't see anything after that. This incident really spooked my wife as she had, without any provocation (such as UFO stories, sightings, or anything at all related) reported to me early Wednesday morning that she had a ""dream"" that seemed incredibly real that at about 5AM she heard a low pulsing sound above the tent and subsequent to that felt some kind of ""beam"" pass through her body.  It scared her to death and she tried to call out to me but could not move or make a noise.  She reported that all she remembers after that is waking and remembering the experience and she was VERY frightened.  Nobody else saw or heard anything and we all joked with her about it and asked if the spacemen ""did anything sexual to her"" (ala the movie ""Independence Day"").  In retrospect the coincidence gave us pause. Fueling at the boat dock Thursday morning, my friend asked the kid pumping gas if anyone saw anything strange in the sky the prior night.  He siad that he was in the Village of Indian Lake and saw the same formation to the West over the golf course. On Sunday, I mentioned the incident to my uncle who lives in Indian Lake and he said that the same thing was seen in the West by his friends that lived on the lake.  He's going to talk with them and get more detail to send to me. I don't have any idea what the lights were, but Rome Air Force base does manuevers in the area of the Lake and I know we have a big year for solar activity.

They were flying toward us at first as if they were flying side by side and then they turned abruptly to the east (their left) and when they did it looked as if they picked up speed then the lights were gone. Unless they were closer than we think, it appeared as if they were accelerating faster than any helicopter. I say helicopter because that is my only explanation for lights at night in this wild area. There is a large wilderness area beneath where these lights were. It is known as the Tug Hill Plateau which is a large blank area on most maps of New York State to the South and slightly east of the city of Watertown. If it wasn't a group of 10th Mountain Division troops from Fort Drum conducting some kind of night exercise then I have no explanation. We have lived here all of our lives 45 years and have never seen any 10th Mountain Division helicopters flying at night. I also should mention that there was no noise at all, either because of the distance or that the craft didn't make any noise. The night was still and quiet as there are few active people around here that time of night and no traffic at all. We wanted to call an air traffic control center in Syracuse at Hancock Airport but there is no number to call and we couldn't find any Fort Drum numbers.

On 8-11-00 at 2240 hrs, I along with approximately 10 other witnesses, observed an unusual formation of high altitude lights. I am a licensed pilot,an aviation historian,a UFO/paranormal researcher and am extremely well versed in the area of aircraft identification. Other witnesses included an engineer and several school teachers. All of us were attending a cave restoration camp sponsored by the park service. During a nightly stargazing session, we observed a triangular formation of three pale white lights moving at an apparent extreme high altitude at a high rate of speed. These lights gave the appearance of a dim, moving constellation or a formation of satallites. Their intensity was a little less than the surrounding stars.The lights were arranged in a perfect triangle, but moved sideways against the starfield. (imagine a flying wing moving sideways, with one wingtip as the leading edge). The objects were in view approximately 3-4 minutes, moving in a continuous arc directly overhead from north to south at the approximate same rate of speed as other man-made satellites I have observed. The formation did not waiver, change position, change color or move erratically and stars were clearly visible through the formation, giving the appearance of three vehicles, as opposed to a single solid object.I observed one object with binoculars before it was lost in the moon's glow. It appeared as a single point of light, with no apparent structure. The whole formation appeared slightly smaller than a business card held at arms length. No sounds were heard, although there were several commercial airliners in the area at the time at a much lower altitude. I am convinced that what I saw was probably unassembled U.S. space station components, the Mir Space Station , or some other type of orbital debris. However, since there was a meteor shower on the night of the observation, I am curious to know whether anyone else observed the same objects, as there were probably many people sky watching on this particular evening. Thank you for this opportunity to comment. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that this may be yet another sighting of what we assume to be the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellites that are reported to us from time to time.  They were first reported during the summer of 1995 or 1996, and they seem to reappear every year or two.  Mr. Terence Dickerson, journalist for the Toronto Star, investigated the phenomenon several years ago, and was perhaps the first to link the sightings to the U. S. Navy project.

I was in a plane heading for Vancouver, B.C. from San Francisco International Airport and just as we took off I looked out the window on the starboard side and saw in the water that surrounds the airport a dark circular shape on or just under the water. What made me focus on it was that it was moving towards a long bridge structure and it was moving pretty fast.(I have since found out that the only bridge that it could be was the San Mateo Bridge) The dark object had a diameter of about 100 feet and naturally as the plane I was in was climbing it got smaller in size. Unfortunately, I was not able to see what transpired when the object approached the bride as the wing impeded my view. No turbulence was notice in front of the object nor behind it as it moved swiftly. Therefore, I concluded that it had to be underwater but how could an object move that quickly underwater without churning up water and leaving a trail. I also considered at the time it was happening that it was a shadow but it was moving perpendicular to our flight path. ((NUFORC Note:  A second, slightly different version of report was submitted by the same witness.  PD)) I was in a plane just seconds after take-off from SFO for Canada when I looked out from my window seat onto the water below and saw a dark circular object moving rapidly at right angles to our flight path. It was headed for the San Mateo Bridge coming from the northwest direction. (I have since looked on the internet what bridge is closest to SFO as I am not familiar with San Francisco at all). The object caught my attention as it was moving rather quickly for something on the water though it did not have any turbulence associated with it. My initial immpression was that it was a shadow somehow created by the airplane however, I have been in enough airplanes and seen the shadow of the plane I have been in to know that this was not the case (usually wings and tailfin are recognizable). During the experience of watching it I concluded it that had to be an underwater object. Looking at what direction it was going in I could see that the eastern end of the bridge was in its way; it had to either change direction, slow down or emerge from the water and hop over the bridge structure as this end of the bridge is solid underneath. Unfortunately, I was not able to witness what happened as the wing of the plane blocked my view. The reason why I am logging this sighting is to find out if anyone on the bridge at that time saw something emerge out of water.",2000-07-11T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

Ten-yr-old daughter and I were relaxing in hot tub, just off back porch.  Sighting area:  to immediate west, a medium sized metal tool shed, backed by elm trees; directly overhead, some limbs from those trees; immediately north and northeast, the two-story house's southern eaves; to southeast, a huge elm tree; to east, at least 60 feet away, neighbor's house.  That left only a relatively small area of open sky visible almost directly above and to the west, framed by our house eaves, the elm tree, and the neighbor's house.  A lighted object came into view from among the elm branches, headed at a fairly slow speed to the north.  The object appeared to be quite high and displayed three separate lights in a triangular arrangement:  red, blue, and white.  If it had a ""nose,"" the blue light was at the ""front,"" with the red light on the west side and white on the east. No actual shape of the object could be discerned.  The object moved northward for several seconds, then slowed to a complete stop, where it hovered for perhaps 10-15 seconds.  Then it ""turned"" or arced to the east for a short distance and stopped again.  (Blue light pointed eastward.)  It hovered for perhaps 10-12 seconds, then appeared to ""back up"" a short distance, then stopped again.  After a few seconds it moved slowly northward for a short distance, then stopped completely again.  After another few seconds of hovering, it began to oscillate, or ""rock"" back and forth, but a shallow or short-distance arc, moving no more than three times its maximum width or diameter.  It then moved to the northwest a very short distance, stopped and hovered again.  Then, it began to move northward, visibly accelerting, but still only to a very slow speed.  After a northward distance of perhaps 20 to 30 times its width (that is, between lights), the three lights coalesced into a single, brighter white light for only a second or two, then the light simply ""went out"" or disappeared while the object was accelerating northward.  I am 60 years old, am an Air Force! veteran , and have loved aircraft and watched the skies all my life. In my opinion, this was not an airplane (hovering and backing up)  or helicopter (too high), nor of course was it space junk, meteors, comets, balloons, birds, swamp gas.  My daughter agrees with my descriptions and her descriptions of the object, its lights, and its movements concur with mine (with no prompting).  My 16-yr-old daughter and her (moronic) boyfriend were in the front yard at the same time.  It, too, is overshadowed by elms.  When the object disappeared (before reaching the eave of our house), I ran into the house and grabbed a rifle with a 9X scope and went to the front yard -- time about 40 seconds.  I scanned the sky and wasw only a rather bright star.  Without prompting,I asked my daughter and boyfriend to scan the sky and tell me if they saw anything unusual.  My daughter immediately pointed to a bright ""star"" to the east, moving very slowly eastward along the north eaves of the neighbor's house.  To me, it looked like a single light, but she said it was ""three lights,"" one red, one blue, and one ""pale yellow.""  We all looked through the rifle scope and both kids, with ttenaged eyes, confirmed three lights, equidistance and of equal brightness.  I could still see only one light, but I could detect that the object was moving slowly eastward.  It quickly disappeared into elm branches in the next block.  No other unusual lights could be seen anywhere.  Lighting conditions:  None in back yard to interfere with view; a single street light in the front yard, catacorner and to the northeast -- overshadowed by taller elms.  No clouds whatever.  No haze.  Stars and planets sharply defined.  The occasional airliner easy to see and identify.  Length of sighting:  back yard, about 1.5 minutes; front yard, perhaps 1 minute maximum.  Still am not 100% sure the object seen from front yard moving east was the same object.  Don't doubt my daughter's flat, immediate and unprompted statement that the object had three lights, but boyfriend could! have mi micked her (he's not too bright).  Note:  Amarillo is 18 miles north and is one of the places where the Osprey aircraft is made.  However, I do not believe what we saw was an Osprey on stop-and-go maneuvers.  For one thing, no sound whatever; for another, too high; for yet another, it backed up, and I don't think the Osprey can do that.  Younger daughter is writing a report of her experience for one of her favorite teachers.  She did not consult me for input.  When I read her story, the details coincided almost exactly with my memories of the incident.  She, however, thinks she saw a round or disc-shaped outlined with the 3 lights in a triangular arrangement on its ""bottom.""  I do not see how she could have seen the object itself. Again, no sound, no contrails, no ""tail"" of any kind.",2000-07-11T00:00:00,34.95147631578947,-101.89716578947368

While I was attending the University of New Mexico, in October 1966 my first wife and I were returning to our apartment at 346 57th Street in Albuquerque, NM, at about 2:00 AM (approx).  This apartment was adjacent to a house in a residential neighborhood, 3 blocks north of Central Avenue.  The moon was either full or nearly so.  This area of the city more or less overlooks the city, at least the beautiful Sandia Mountains can be seen from this address, and on a moonlit night, appear as a clear and distinct outline.  We had exited the car and were walking to the house when we saw the disk or saucer shaped craft traveling completely silently from west to east in a straight line, at a constant speed, and without pause.  As we observed the craft, us looking directly south, the craft was probably 30 to 35 degrees from our zenith, and was rotating counter clockwise looking from underneath.  I would estimate that the time required for a complete rotation was about 7 to 8 seconds.  The craft bottom was flat or a rounded form close to flat with no light. As a matter of fact, there was no lights on the craft with the exception of the port holes.  The sides seem to rise from the bottom at an angle of about 60 degrees to the horizontal and were the same around the circumference of the of the craft.  I would estimate that there were about 12 port around the circumference of the craft.  The distance was approximately 1/4 mile or perhaps a little more.  If there had been someone looking out of the port hole, we would have been able to clearly see them and wave to them.  We are not talking some distant light in the sky.  Top 1/3rd to 1/4th of the side seemed to rise to the top of the craft at an angle of about 45 degrees from the vertical.  I could not see the top of the craft.  In the early morning hours, at this location in the city, things were very quiet.  We heard no noise whatsoever. It floated quietly by and into the distance, over the Sandia Mountains. Some time later we were spending an evening with another couple and we shared this experience with them.  As it turns out, the wife had been leaving work at a nursing home on the east side of Albuquerque, and had seen this same craft on the same night.  So, there you have it, my one and only definite experience with a UFO.  None of us shared this experience with anyone; not police, government, air force, nor anyone else, except occasionally with friends, when conversation would drift into this area.  I have always felt very fortunate to have had this experience, and I remember it almost as clearly now, as I did the next day after it happened.  I just heard Peter Davenport on Art Bell's show( the very end),  and I felt inspired to share this experience. I just felt that this experience was ""my experience"", and it was never important that anyone verify it, or agree with me, or even know that it happened.",,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

I looked out the window as we flew through bright gaps in the clouds. The day was otherwise bright, despite the clouds. I observed a circular object, totally metallic with a rim completely around it, a mini silver Saturn, if you will. It was approx. 20-30 ft. in diameter and hovering near the the fuselage, between the wing and tail. It rotated, and it reflected our airliner on its--the UF0's--own surface. It was silent. I motioned to my father, who momentarily looked grim. He dismissed it as something, but sounded suspiciously evasive. I don't recall a reaction from my mother or anyone else aboard. The craft was silent and remained in view for several minutes. My parents have been deceased for more than 30 years and thus can't add more to what I have stated. There was only one object. It appeared to tilt and spin as it hovered by the fuselage of the United Airlines' prop airliner. The sky was a bright blue. I viewed the object as our a/c passed through an expanse of clouds. I was excited; my father was uncharacteristically quiet, subdued. We never spoke of the incident ever again, though my father later in life evinced a belief in UFO's. My mother thoroughly dismissed the phenomenon. I sighted the object as a child. I am now 45 years of age. I am a teacher, with a Master's in English. I am currently working on my Ph.D in psychology.

Ill be brief in describing what I saw.  3rd incident: I was sleeping in the back our station wagon (car) that was parked in the same camp mentioned in incident #2-cigar. Our camp was located under some large ash trees and adjacent to the creek bed. I woke up during the night and was looking at all the stars of which I could see through the trees...there was a row of trees near the car and then a large clearing. Anyway...I saw what I'll describe as a large fireball. I saw it fly from my extreme right-hand view. It swooped down near our camp, but far enough away that I couldn't really estimate size. It was, however, fairly large. Maybe as big as a small house....anyway...It crossed my field-of-view and flew to my extreme left-hand view. I lost sight of it through the trees. After a wait of several minutes I saw it further away gaining altitude and heading more west. I lost sight of it after that and didn't see it again.

This event happened in the hot summer months. We had been to a family function. Our car at that time had no air conditioning and we had the windows down. My father was in a rather foul mood and had the radio off. We were approx 3 miles away from a small city on a rural paved 2 lane highway travelling East. We came to a T intersection and turned south. This road was the Fremont road. There were houses on either side of the road. The moon was out bright that evening. As we started south my sister sitting in the back seat drivers side asked what is that in a startling tone.. We all looked and my father immediately stopped the vechicle. Less than 300 feet away at tree top level we observers a black cylinder traveling very slowly north to south paralleling the road. The object traveled approx 100 ft to the left and front of our vehicle and stopped. No remember it was a hot evening no wind and quiet not a sound could be heard except the car motor. The object only stopped for approx 10 seconds and then made a 90 degree turn on it's axis and started moving again east to west it crossed approx 100 feet in front of the car. I was in the right hand back seat. I lost site of it for a moment and then it appeared on my side of the car. It stopped again approx 200 feet on the west side of the road made another 90 degree turn and started heading south again very slowly. My father must have been really terrified as at this point he acclerated very quickly we reached speeds of up to 100 mph trying to outrun the object. After he had accelerated the object kept pace with our vehicle for approx 4-5 miles. Not a word was said in the car during this whole encounter. Finally after what seemed forever the object climbed and turned at a incredible rate. I quicly left our viewpoint. I have seen high speed jet aircraft make 600 knot passes and this object left the area by probably a multiplier of 5. My family talked only that evening of the encounter and for nearly 22 years it has bugged me. Recently we talked about that encounter and agreed to test our memories Each one of us took turns and made a tape. We then all reviewed them together and our story lines stayed pretty well true even though it has been 20+ years. Other generations of our family have had encounters and one was even interviewed by the world famous blue book team. My grandmother who is now in here 90's has black and white photo's of pictures she took in the early 60's. What ever we saw that night was no way from this world. Why we were choosen to observer the object and why it played a cat and mouse game with us while my father was trying to win the indy 500 is beyond me. But I would like to hear from anyone else in the Southern Michigan area that has had a similar encounter.,2000-02-16T00:00:00,41.9015,-85.0346

As we neared exit 107, near monticello (at the top of a Mountain), I saw a large bright object streak across the sky at about a 15 degree inclination to the horizon.   I first saw the object in my right side of vision and I followed it until it passed over the horizon on my left side of vision.  The object took about 4 seconds to traverse this entire distance. The object appeared to move at a constant velocity without acceleration.   The object was emanating bright light of a strange blue-green tint.  It was not as bright as a car's headlights.  The object appeared to have a precise circular cross section.  (I was struck by, and focused on, the object's precise edges.)  The object did not trail a plume or any other meteor-like scatter.  The object was dark at the top and near the center, and I could discern various precise geometric structures in these darker area, as if they were mechanical or machine-like.  The object displaced abou 1/2 steradian, equivalent to that displaced by the moon:  therefore, the object appeared to be the size of the moon.   I believe the object was quite distant from me.  Just before the object reached the left-hand horizon, it emitted what we physicists call an S-wave.  That is, a spherical ""bubble of light"" emanated from the object.   This spherical ""bubble of light"" obviously was not travelling at the velocity of light, but it was moving very fast, possibly faster than the velocity of sound.  I talked to several knowledgeable physicists about this phenomenon, and so far, nobody was able to give an adequate explanation.

EVENT ON 8/19/2000 @ approx. 8:30 am As I began my ride that Saturday morning, I decided to turn right and head up towards the small hills just North of me.  After going around the new home construction, the road turned left into Baxter Road and headed west towards the 15 freeway.   While traveling down Baxter Road approaching the 15 overpass, I noticed an object in the sky due North of my location.  I began to observe it trying to figure out exactly what it might be.  The most obvious to me was some kind of new kite? since I could not make out any contours or distinct edges.  It was dark, almost black, oval with what appeared to be a very short, wide tail. I continued to observe it for another 10-15 seconds or so wondering where the person was and trying to make out the string.   Suddenly, the object started to move quite quickly in short abrupt movements back and forth (possibly in a triangular shape?).  My thoughts went to that there was possibly two strings attached which could pull it in different directions.   As I strained to see the strings attached, the object suddenly, and without warning accelerated away from me to the southeast.  It accelerated so quickly that it turned into a blur and disappeared into thin air.  In trying to follow its movement, I turned while standing on my bicycle and ended up on the other side of the road as a result of my left arm overcompensating to my abrupt turn to the right.  I stopped and placed my foot on the ground turning completely around so that I might be able to bring it back into vision.  However, the object was completely gone from my view and could not be found anywhere in the sky. At that point, I realized what I had possibly witnessed and I continued to search for it in the sky.  I began to realize that the reason I couldn’t see any distinct edges was that the object was actually quite far from me.  That probably was also the reason why I didn’t hear anything (over the freeway noise).  Finally I got back onto my bicycle and continued my ride wondering if what I had just witnessed had been for real.  No matter how hard I tried to dismiss it, I kept on realizing that I HAD indeed witnessed something extraordinary, something that could in fact change the way I viewed things for the rest of my life. I am a 41 year old male with an electrical engineering degree currently employed in my field.  Married with three children, with interests in outdoor activities.  I did not have any previous experiences nor did I have any concrete belief's in UFO's...until now.

We talked for 15 min. about the shower and best locations to watch it when I finally got off the highway from a work trip to Gold hill, OR. that day. Suddenly they in Boise started seeing lights shining from the north and it seemed to resemble manifestations of the ""Northern Lights"". The lights started shooting out beams of light from the north over the horizon seemingly up over our heads and to the south as we all in both cities looked to the north. WE started noticing rings or bands or pulses of glowing fiant lights bands roling down from the north. They seemed to have no end in sight either east or to the west and were seem exactly at the same time in Boise as in Portland. It was 1:00 AM by now and my wife and I went down to an industral area of east Multnomah county. My wife by the way has had 1-1/2 months of coughing and resporitory distress and is now or antibiotics and getting worse all since the past months Chem-trails. Anyway we watched through the smog and days sun evaporated moisture haze lit up by all the 1:30 AM street and shopping center lights and could see clearly the pulses or waves iregularly but seemingly with some pattern radiate out fromm the north. My son and wife in Boise, ID. clearly confirmed at the same time on cell phone the pulses of faintly glowing tubes or bands of 1/2 a knuckle wide light rushing south ovewr all our heads to the south. My son Zeb and Tim my daughter-in-law have tried to record with a quality Sony digital camera and got some weak images. They are trying again Sunday morning in the clear S.W. Idaho skies and better adjust the camera to get better images of the waves. The waves or pulses sweep the full arc of the sky from north to south in 1/2 to 1 second but yet their glow was distinctly visible as they rushed across the sky in multiple patterns of waves like a code or maybe just totaly random yet it seemed to have a pattern. So going out now to check the sky. One never knows what might happen, do one? Always, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several reports that appear to us to address the same phenomenon.  Our best guess is that the witnesses were observing the particularly dramatic Aurora Borrealis that occurred on this morning, and which was reportedly seen as far south as Los Angeles.  Since the solar wind, which causes the ""Northern Lights"" travels at hundreds of kilometers per second, one might expect the phenomenon to propagate very quickly across the sky when the charged particles encounter the Earth's magnetic field.

This was higher in elevation than I've seen before. I was just outside 2 minutes before the phone rang and saw nothing. The surveilance camera had the area videotaped were it should of came from. So I guess it just appears in the sky. Again I shot more 80x to 100x video of this object. It was extremely red in color, you could see a double red lights in the viewfinder. With the naked eye could see 1 brightly lite light and a dimmer one just above it. It didn't seem to move much while looking at it directly but the videocamera revealed alot of movement. I was looking due east when I first sighted it at 8:57 pm Angle of view about 45 degrees. At the end of the sighting I was looking SE. The object was heading south and slightly ascending for about 10 minutes. Then it changed direction and started going straight up. When it got close to the cloud bank, it stopped for about 2 minutes. Hovered and moved around incredibly. Then it went up into the clouds and disappeared. The next day after talking to other spotters we determined that the object was in Chandler, about 2 miles from my house and less than 1 mile for the 3 commercial jets seen flying around it. This was one of the best sightings I had so far because it was closer to my house than any of the others so the video is much better. Tom King ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report is for August 12.

It was moving straight across the sky very slowly. Slow from our perspective, but probably traveling extremely fast, just far away. My friends instantly saw this as well. We decided it was a satellite and continued to watch it when suddenly, it changed course and headed downward, completely about face from the course it was heading. At this point about ten seconds had passed. then it began to move horizontally in a jerky start-stop motion. coming to complete stops with no gradual slow downs. next it began to make jerky half circle motions, clockwise then counterclockwise visa-versa etc as it travelled on its path. it made occasional complete circles. it continued these unpredictable course changes periodically and  continued its bizzare loops and dashes. untill it appeared to become almost stationary far on the opposite side of the sky from where it had started. nearly five minutes had passed...that is an agreed upon esitmate. we watched for about ten more minutes or so...occasionally it moved...we were more or less freaking out trying to rationalize what we had just seen and at the same time trying to calm down one of my friends who was already 10 minutes late for her curfew. the two girls I was with were basically hysterical as they fed off eachother's fear. i really wanted to stay and watch in case something else happened but my friend had to be home for her curfew( it was now about 2:40 am) and she was the one driving us around so i had to go. I was dropped of at my car where i raced to my home 20 minutes away and woke up my parents to come look for what i had seen. They were not amused. I watched the sky from my backyard for about another hour and gave up. this was no airplane or meteo! rite. it was a faint, blue dot in the sky doing the most amazing maneuvers i have ever seen. once again i emphasize how it changed course directions instantly and jumped about in the sky. what would do this i ask? i have never been a believer nor skeptic towards UFOS. I am convinced someone else out there besides my friends and I saw this, for it couldnt have happened on a more observed night than a meteor shower like this one. I wish I wish i could give points of reference like constellations, stars and directional coordiantes..but im totally clueless when it comes to those types of things.

Last night, I was on my way home from a friend's house.  I was driving down one of the major roads that connects Ft Oglethorpe to Ringgold.  I noticed a ball of light moving across the sky...it was too fast and low to be a plane, and too slow to be a falling star. I watched the light move across the sky, it started to disappear behind some tree tops, but made a huge U-turn back toward me. As it turned, I noticed it had 2 lights on it, so I thought maybe it was some kind of plane. I ignored it and kept going, I had to yield to change roads, so I watched the sky again to see if it was still there. When I looked at it again, I saw it alot closer and it had 3 white colored lights, two larger ones on the sides, and one in the middle, a little higher up than the side ones, it also had a small red flashing light in between the three white ones. It was hovering in the air above a house while I was stopped. I turned onto the other road and hightailed it home.  I kept looking back to see if it was anywhere to be seen...but I didn't see it.  As I neared my driveway, I put my turn signal on,and came to a stop, I looked up and the aircraft was directly above my driveway. I could clearly see the three lights and the flashing light at that time, and it looked as if it had some kind of reflective checkerboard pattern on the bottom if it, it was a blue and red reflective kind of pattern. I stopped my car at the top of my driveway and watched the craft as it made it's way across the sky.....directly over my driveway, slowing at the top of my car, and creeping off over my house until it disappeared into the darkness. I waited in my car for a few minutes to make sure it was gone, and ran inside... haven't seen it since then...

Driving home from town, I observed what I thought were landing lights from Air Force planes.  I lived within probally a mile or so of the landing pattern for Seymour Johnson AFB and have seen their planes numerous times. Also, my father was career Air Force and I have been around planes all of my life. To the point that I was able to identify certain types of planes just by hearing them, the distinct sounds they made. (Ex. F4's, C5A, C141's, F104 & 105's to name a few) This particular evening I was about a mile from home, when I noticed ""these"" lights.  Being familiar with the area and what SJ landing pattern was, when I saw these lights, I thought to myself , ""these guys are really low"".  I watched for about 30-45 seconds.  The lights appeared right at tree top level.  The closer I got to the lights, the lower the seemed to drop, now visibly seeing trees pass in front of these lights, evern at a distance. My thought at that point was, these guys are not going to make the runway.  From where I lived and where I saw these light and knowing where the runway was, they were just too low.  The runway was at least another mile to the east and they were at tree top level.  The first part of the road I was traveling on a straight away.  After about 30-45 seconds of watching this, the road turns to the right. No one on the roads at all that night. As I bear to the right towards my home, which is about 1/4 mile away now, I am now looking to my left, out of the drivers window, watching these light, which seem to bop from tree top level to below that and back up again.  At this point, I am really thinking that this plane is going to crash, these guys are in trouble and they are way too low.  Again, after I bear right and I'm watching what I thought was an Air Force plane, I'm only going about 20 mph, hardly taking my eyes off of this thing.  Also, there is a small wheat field off to my left on the other side of the road before the tree line. The tree line at this point where I am at is about 220-250 yards from the! road. As I'm watching this thing, I use the term ""thing or lights"", I notice something strange which at first I concluded was just some kind of optical illusion, because of the direction I am traveling now and the direction of the lights are traveling. I think SJ planes usually land in a west to easterly direction. I am now traveling west. As I'm driving, I'm glancing out of my window, the lights look like they are going in the same direction I am traveling.  I have my window down in the car as well, and after 150 or so feet, I begin thinking to myself, I should be hearing this thing as large as it is and it's seems to be going the same direction as me, this is really strange. So I pull my car to a stop. A complete stop in the middle of the road. I look out of my window and there slightly below tree top level is this huge craft of some type, now also, like me, stopped, not making a sound, no engine sound whatsoever, not moving, but clearly airborne and clearly a very large craft.  My best estimates on size were 300 ft long and about 40 foot high, multiple row of lights straight across for looked like each tier, three tiers. Anyway, I panicked after about 6-7 seconds of sitting there looking at this thing, punched the gas and flew home. I have had 2 other encounters/observations/sightings, one the very next night, at my house which was stange in itself and another about 10 years earlier when I lived in Alaska.

I had used some distant city lights from his hilltop ome, and had then turned the telescope East to run a test against the brightest object in the Eastern sky.  The brightest star (I could probably figure it out on sky charts) visible through the city lights stood about 30-35 degrees above the horizon, due East. As I positioned the scope so that the target came into the cross-hairs of the sighting scope, my son exited the house and stated that it was 9:23, and he needed to get home to study.  At that precise moment, two faint lights, similar to stars traversed the field of view, due North to due South, of the sighting scope above and below the target star.  Using the moon as a reference of 5%, I would estimate that the two lights were about 2 - 3% apart, with the leading light about 1% below the trailing light.  When they passed above and below the target star, the target star did not blink out. I looked around the sighting scope to see if I could pick up the stars with my naked eye.  I was not wearing my glasses, but could make out a slight, dull blur about where the two lights should be.  I returned to the sighting scope and picked the lights back up once again.  They continued to travel in the same direction and at the same speed.  I called my son over and pointed up to the are where the lights should be, hoping to take advantage of his better eyesight.  He could not find the objects before they disappeared behind the roofline. This house sits right amidst the approach lanes into John Wayne Airport in Orange County.  At the same time, about 6 airplanes were in the sky for comparison.  If these were aircraft lights, the aircraft would have to be at 30,000 feet  (not the couple of thousand that is typical for that close to the airport), be two planes flying in locked formation (to maintain position with respect to one another) and not one (because the target star was not obscured by their passing), and each would have to have a single warning light (white) in operation.

The lights were no bigger than a match head at arms length, and were spaced an inch apart (at arms length).  There was no way to tell whether the lights were connected to the same object, but they always maintained the exact same distance from each other. The oddest thing about the lights was:  A) how quickly, and silently, they were moving across the sky   B) the light(s) would momentarily (lasting one or two seconds)and quite distinctly, yet gently, ""pinwheel"" or ""vibrate"" in tandem, and then smooth back out. This is the toughest part to describe  This motion did not appear to affect the velocity or direction of the object(s). The object never changed it's long arcing across the sky in the directions I mentioned above.  This slight movement happened maybe three or four times during the total viewing time. I watched the object(s) for at least 15 seconds as it moved across the sky.  The weather at this time was cool and relatively clear.  There were no clouds in the sky, the stars were out.  There was some light pollution, Silverlake is on the Eastern edge of the Los Angeles Basin. And in the direction of the sighting I'm sure there was some low coastal haziness in the air.  This may account for the slightly luminous quality of the lights?  I couldnt estimate the height or distance, but they were at LEAST a hands width above the horizon line from my viewing position.  At the time of my sighting I noticed no other aircraft from my view. This was the only object in this part of the sky at the time. I went inside to note the time and started a sketch of the lights themselves. Maybe between 3 and 5 minutes later I stepped back out onto my porch and observed at least 3 or 4 airplanes puttering around the Los Angele! s Basin. None of them seemed to be trying to track or follow the object I had seen a few minutes earlier.  The flights were local police/news copters, commercial/delivery planes heading towards LAX, small private planes...etc.  3, maybe 4 in the sky.  They were all much closer than the object I had seen.  As my eye caught the object my first thought was shooting star, a high altitude jet, or satellite.  But when I noticed the other light right next to it I was a bit thrown. And then it did the tight pinwheel movement.... It really seemed to be quite a distance away.  I wish I could make a fair guess....  It had the type of high altitude depth you associate with the possible explanations I mentioned above: star, jet, or satellite.  It wasn't traveling as briskly as a shooting star, or as 'deep' as a satellite, this was more like a high speed jet.  Another very odd almost-unrelated occurence is the fact that I just happened to be making an audio recording while I had the sighting.  I haven't listened back to this exact portion of the tape yet, but I think I will be able to get a much better estimate-guess as to the length of the sighting based on me clomping around the porch once I saw it.... That's about all I can recall right now.  By the way, I do not claim to be educated in aeronautical devices of any nature.  I could easily believe this was an airplane of sorts just tearing across the sky, at a distance that made it appear to be silent. I will admit that I have been fascinated by the UFO phenom since my first trip to the public library in 3rd grade, so I have done my fair share of watching the skies above ever since,  but I have never claimed to see anything that falls into the category of what I consider to be a UFO until this morning. I'm curious to know if anybody else happened to see the same thing I did.  I was VERY CLOSE to calling my friend in Northern California to get up and take a look in the same part of the sky, just in the wildest chance that he saw anything like it, but that seemed a bit too hasty and kinda' kooky, I guess.  I flipped on the local all news radio stations and listened for any mention, but there was nothing.  I also did some quick sketches of the overall view while it was still fresh in my head. So that's that on that.... I'm proud to have done my reporting duty, and maybe this small tidbit will help complete a bigger picture for someone else.

I saw a small, blue-green light, similar to what might be on an aircraft, steady and unblinking, traveling from north to south.  I was driving westbound on HWY 52 and was nearing the interchange with I-5.  It was shortly after 9:30p.m. and I was heading to work.  There was some patchy fog along the coast, on the other side of Mt. Soledad.  I live near Miramar Marine Corps Air Base, which does have frequent military aircraft and helicopters that fly out to the ocean, and turn southward before flying back to the east.  I have grown up as a Navy dependent, and I also served in the Navy for some time, so I am used to seeing aircraft maneuvers and flybys.  What struck me was the incredible speed of this object.  I did not see any shape of the aircraft itself, only the light, which looked like a beacon.  I did not hear any jet noise either.  The object, or light, did not appear to be circling south and then east, as I would expect having seen other aircraft use this flight path.  Instead, it continued southward, and I lost it as it passed behind Mt. Soledad, which would make the object appear to be somewhere over the ocean, and even further away.  Unfortunately, I can not give a fair approximation of the distance it covered, due to it being dark, and initially when I saw the light, I didn't have a point of reference to place it near, but due to the incredible speed that the object moved in the 3 seconds that I saw it, I believe that this was not normal, whenever I have seen an jet fly this fast, I have expected to hear a sonic boom with it.  There was none.  I have tried to reconcile that an illusion brought on by the fog, may be part of this, but it still does not make sense.

We live on the Cascade Head, west of Hwy 101, north of interchange, Ha! with Hwy 18 from Salem, mountainous by the coast northwest of Salem river estuary, excellent visibility, virtually no city lights except to the south. Walked out of rear of house made turn then facing ene, looked up, bright object caught my eye at about 15 degrees ene of top dead center if you were to draw a perpendicular line straight up from my position. Object at first appeared brighter than any star normally would and then intensified to 10 to 20 times greater in magnitude than any normal stellar object other than moon or sun. Light was not awesomely brilliant or unpleasant but bright. Intensity similar to moon at about 70% full. Not certain about definition until object appeared to reach brightest point and then either roll, turn to se, or accelerate rapidly away from my position. I first thought it might be a satellite or nortorious space junk as the time of night and season would probably be about right as this was just nearing total darkness and something at that altitude might be catching the last reflections of the sun prior to moving into termination however I am left with the stongest impression that it banked or rotated to the east and acclerated out of view in less than a second. The impression was similar to the way ""starships reach warp drive on Star Trek"" just with a less distinct tail or trailer. I did not get an errie feeling. I have seen satellites react similarly before but not with a sense that they have accelerated away from my position but more that they have continued on the path much fainter having lost the benefit of the sun's reflection.I could not pick the object up again. It gave me the impression of being a luminated disk not in definitive outline but in manner of the luminous area dispacing the normal dark background of the sky. Although not able to see more than perhaps 40-60% of the sky from our position due to mountains and trees the star just a bit(1-2 degrees) to the north of object appears to b! e one of the 5 brightest in this nights sky.

The sky was clear, with not many stars visible, because it was not very dark yet. This light was moving from south to north, in a fairly slow speed. I never saw any blinking lights, as I would on an airplane. I went in for my binoculars,to see better. I could not get a clear picture of the flying light, just bigger. I went in to log in your Reporting Center, to see if there had been any sightings in our area recently. The most recent reported was on my birthday 4/28. However, I found that close enough in time, if there has been any others reported, or if there is some activity going on in the Pacific Northwest.

In the latter part of June 1980, my wife, 9 months pregnant, myself, and two other couples took a ride to a local hilltop to watch lightning storms over the Owyhee mountains approximately 100 to 150 miles to the south of us. Seven o'clock in the evening during June the sun is still quite high in the sky, but due to the thunder storms it was light, but not bright sunlight. Above us was clear blue sky for miles, so I discount the chance of any lightning strike any where near us. We were all sitting on a picnic table when all of a sudden we experienced a bright flash of light. All except my wife saw different colors, myself saw red, the brightest red I've ever seen. The others saw blue and red. My wife remembers seeing bright white light. Thats all any of us can recall, except my wife, which was sitting right next to me, was getting up off the ground about 30 feet away to my right (west) of our position. We were all extremely bewildered at what had just happend. It all happened in a split second. We looked around for possible scorching on the ground in case of lightning, there was nothing. We left the area immediately. Later that evening we all experienced a painful neck. My wife had severe pain in her pelvic area, hips and lower back. My wife went on to carry our first born for 10 months with no problems during delivery. The baby was dehyderated but was healthy. She is currently a sophmore in college.

I was about to comment on its shape and how shiny it was.  I couldn't make out any craters.  It was just white. Then I noticed that I had to many shadows. One shadow from the street lamp, one shadow from what I thought was the moon, and another. When I traced this third shadow back to its source I saw the moon almost directly overhead. I was about to yell at this discovery when I noticed the bright object begin to move.  I had to watch. I was nervous, but not frightend. My family by this time where in the mobile home we lived in at the time. I flattend my body against the trailor and watched by peeking around the corner as the object moved in a northern direction. The object moved till it seemed directly above me, then it stopped.  It seemed extremely large and high in altitude. I wondered if it where even in atmosphere. Then, wish it flew up and away into the out-there and was gone. I looked around the corner to where I had first seen it.  I saw something else.  I became filled with terror and dread. There, from one end of the horizon to the other were lights.  Red,Orange,Green.  Each one spaced evenly like many objects all in formation, or one huge object. It followed the same course as the other object and stopped over me just as the other object had. In the glare of the lights, and the blockage of the stars, it becaame aparent that these lights where all connected to one object.  The outline of the lights was striking.
