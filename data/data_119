I was on my boyfriend's sister's boat, we were towing my boyfriend's boat behind us, my friend was present, my boyfriends sister and her son were on her boat, my boyfriend was behind us on his boat.  Her navigational lights were out, so she had her son shining a mag light in front of us.   The sky was fairly clear but there were some clouds ahead of us.  We were all vigilantly looking in front and around us, but almost back to the dock, I was looking up at the clouds, and then I saw two bright white circular forward facing lights sort of emerge out of the cloud, like it had been inside the cloud then turned on the lights as it rose above the cloud.   The lights didn't light up any part of the plane or really anything in front of it, the were just bright circles that were far apart, almost like they were on the wings, but didn't see any wings.  We all saw it, my boyfriend's sister at first said maybe it was a coast guard helicopter because of how it rose straight up, but then it started moving forward slowly over us.  I almost thought it was a drone because it was totally silent, it was super eerie, we all were going what the hell is that, then she told her son not to shine the light at the plane, which kind of freaked me out.  As it moved very slowly over us we were sort of able to see how low and big it was, I could make out what looked like a flat grey shape, but couldn't really tell what shape it was, I want to say triangular, but it was like the lights were so bright it seemed weird not to be able to see more of the plane.  The plane was maybe 300-500 feet in the air and was big, definitely not a drone.  It flew silently over us, I looked back at the boat we were towing behind us and my boyfriend was also looking straight up at it. I was telling my two siblings about it the next day and they freaked out, they both said ""oh my god, that's that boat we saw,"" apparently they had seen what they thought was a boat with two bright white circular wide set ""headlights"" probably 30 minutes before our sighting traveling very quickly over the water at my parents house, which is approximately 8-9 miles as the crow flies.  They said they saw the lights moving over the water but didn't see a wake.

Jet-like roaring craft over Rhode Island...no true explanation from media.,West Warwick,RI,2017-08-03T21:30:00,unknown,45 minutes,"Occurred : 8/3/2017 21:30  (Entered as : 08/03/2017 21:30) Reported: 8/7/2017 8:04:42 PM 20:04 Posted: 8/11/2017 Location: West Warwick, RI Shape: Unknown Duration:45 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/135/S135596.html,"Jet-like roaring craft over Rhode Island...no true explanation from media. I am reporting a recent local event.  This event happened here in Rhode Island on the above date and time.  It was reported by local news channel WJAR, channel 10.  The 'event' centered around loud jet-like roars by craft flying at roof top height in Kent County, Rhode Island, and specifically West Warwick and Coventry.  Local residents were startled to hear these 'jets' flying low over their homes at night.  FAA regulations prohibit jets from flying that low...below radar, I would assume.   The concerned citizens were scared, understandably.  Several called in to WJAR news to report this event as it was occurring.    The report by WJAR Channel 10 on their website was as follows: residents called the news room.  The newsroom said they called 'the police' (vague), the police called the 'airport' (vague again)...we can assume Greene Airport in Warwick.  The 'police' were told by 'officials' (more vagueness), that the 'jets' were 'F-16s heading for Quonset Pt. National Guard airport and that 'concerned citizens' anxiety was put to rest.' (my paraphrase of actual words used).  That was the end of story.   Oddly, residents reportedly heard these loud low flying jets for a full 45 minutes..21:30 to 22:00.  If they were landing at Quonset Pt. why would they be flying around for 45 minutes in one area?  My curiosity was aroused.   Next morning, Friday, Aug. 4th, I called the Quonset Pt. airport and asked if F-16s or any jets landed at their facility last night....the woman who answered the phone said, 'negative.'  She was a bit nervous in answering my questions but my main question was answered.   I then called WJAR's newsroom.  A young man, who couldn't understand my question, gave the phone to an older man.  I asked him if he had checked the accuracy of their report about the 'jets.'  He stammered, then said, 'yes.'  I said, well I just called Quonset Pt. airport and no jets of any kind landed there.  So, it seems they did not check anything but just took for truth the report of the 'police.'  Was it state pol! ice, loc al police, airport police..he couldn't say.  This is another example of news reporting being dictated by state and federal officials for the sole purpose of allaying the fears of people who may suspect other things.  I told the news room guy to further check his contacts and find out more specifics.  He was very quiet as I explained how poorly their 'professional' reporting was.  He said he would further investigate and get back to me.  Of course, he didn't.  Who really knows what these so called 'jets' were.  Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one around with a brain who questions events in the news.   The main reason this particular event rang a bell with me is that several years ago a very similar event occurred in my southern part of Rhode Island, called Washington County.  This even occurred in January, about 2010.  At that time jet-like craft flew over my house at roof top level, displaying non traditional light patterns (flashing red and white lights), with a deep, bass roar (that sounded more 'broadcast' than from any internal engine) and doing impossible maneuvers (turning on a dime, stopping, bobbing up and down, etc.  This event occurred two nights in a row at exactly the same time...17:45. The craft I best viewed was on the second night.  It roared 75 feet over my house and displayed two huge round blood red lights on the underside of the fuselage.  The craft was either crescent or triangular in shape, though it was so dark that I could not be sure.  It was like they were imitating our jets.  No after burner was seen, which I feel it should have been.  The weirdest part was as this craft flew low to the east, toward the Bay and the open ocean, a bright ball of light, smaller than the craft, came out of nowhere to fly beside the craft, until the ball of light continued straight east and the 'craft' went SE, both toward the open ocean.  While this craft was flying overhead I called the local South Kingstown police dispatcher and held my cell phone up so he could here the deep bass roar of this thing overhead.  He asked me what it looked like..I told him it looked like a UFO.  He said, 'UFO?""...I'm calling the State Police', and hung up.  So many residents called the police and the WJAR news room that on the next night a report was on TV.  Again, I believe, a cover up, as the announcer, Dan Jahning, who still works there, nervously said the craft were 'just F-16s' flying to Hyannis (MA) airport.  Then he said, 'well, mystery solved' and showed a file photo of an F-16.  He quickly went on to the next news item.  I called Otis AFB in Mashpee, MA, near Hyannis, as Hyannis is a commercial airport on the Cape, the only airport capable of jet landings, and they said the F-16 is no longer in use and no jets landed there at that time!  Sound familiar?  More mysteriously, on the following Tuesday morning at 11:00, while I was with a cable TV installer outside, I hear the now familiar deep base roar that I heard the previous time...this time, to my amazement, an unmarked F-18 flies 100 feet over my house, flips on its side (so I could not see the cockpit), rights itself as it leaves, and roars off!  Oddly, a small Cessna type plane flies above it.   I get on the phone to the South Kingstown police again to report this.  This time, the dispatcher puts me a hold for a full four minutes, then comes back to me to say he can give me no information about this.  I asked him if this was being 'hushed up' by higher authorities, and he hesitantly said, 'yes.'  So, that was it. I called Senator Reeds' office here in RI about this and was told someone would 'get back to me,' but of course, didn't.  This type of event reporting and clamming up by officials goes on all over the US, I would suspect.  The reports on NUFORC are the tip of the iceberg, so to speak.  I would never have known about the West Warwick event had not so many local people called the WJAR newsroom (as happened here in my area before) and WJAR reporting this as a  poor excuse for sound journalism.  Can we blame the media?  Yes.  If they  had guts they would report the truth by investigation, but they just seem to be an arm of the  government.  As a private citizen I can only do so much.  News agencies have more reach but they have no guts.  These events will continue.  The  'Phoenix lights' of 1997 perhaps is a famous example of this.  Anyway, you can use this info as you wish,  Peter. I will keep doing what I do...search for the truth and question authority.",2017-08-11T00:00:00,41.697,-71.5254

This is the second time I have seen these lights in a 5 days.  The first sighting was on 7/31/17 at approximately the same time.  I will start with that sighting but, am using this date because it was the most recent. On the night of July 31, I went out and sat on the side steps of my house to have a cigarette, my steps face to the east.  The sky was clear and just beginning to get dark.  There were whispy clouds very high up and a light breeze from the south.  The moon and stars were visible. I looked to the southeast and noticed a very bright, dark, red, light coming from that direction.  I watched it cross the sky and it went behind a tree that is in my neighbor's yard that is about 25 ft. high. when it came out the other side of the tree, I could still see the red light and it headed off to the north.  When it was just about out of view, the light was no longer visible but, it looked at that time to be a very black cylindrical shape.   About a minute later, I saw another, and called for my brother to come out and look. It was  identical to the first.  He thought at first it was a plane but, there was no noise at all, no contrails and absolutely no sound.  The light was steady, not flashing.  It too moved on the exact path and looked to be a very black cylindrical shape as it went out of view.  About another minute passed and we saw another of these lights come from the same direction only it looked a little more pinkish red.  It, too, flew the same course and at about the same altitude which, I estimate to be about 1 to 2 thousand feet.  I am not good at distance so this may be incorrect.  As we watched, 4 more came, spaced about the same time apart. Some seemed to be further to the east and some coming closer to where they were almost directly overhead.  Most of them blinked out when they were parallel to us or when they had gone a little further north.   Since we could not see the red light  on the first two, as they went out of view,  it is possible that they turned if the lights were attached to some kind of craft,  or, they just blinked out. I got my video camera but, I was shaking and that video did not turn out well.  The lights through the camera looked orange instead of red but, to the naked eye, they were red. My brother thought they might be Chinese lanterns, fireworks but, they seemed too high and some flew faster and some slower. 8/4/17--Again, I went out to have a cigarette before bed.  I happened to look to the southeast and was amazed to see the same lights as the previous sighting, again coming from the southeast.  This time, two came at once and the one that was furthest to the east all of a sudden made a 90 degree turn and went straight east.   I hollered for my brother but, he was upstairs and didn't hear me.  I continued to watch and witnessed 4 more of these lights, one flew almost directly overhead.   I got my video camera again and this time the video wasn't quite so shaky.  I tried to zoom in full but, it only caused the light to look like a diamond shape which, I know to be something with the camera and not the correct shape of the light.  These were identical in every way to the ones I had witnessed previously.  The conditions of the sky were the same also.  Again, there was no sound, no smoke like flares would have, no contrails, nothing. I could not see a shape to these, only  the very bright lights.   I have no idea what they were but, the one making the 90 degree turn to the east was what really made me wonder what it was that I saw.",2017-08-11T00:00:00,44.0369,-97.6104

August 4, 2017 approx. 21:15 Phoenix, AZ   It was a clear sky, the moon was out and almost full, the temperature was in the mid to upper 90s. I was swimming in the pool, floating on my back looking at the night sky, when I saw what I thought was a falling star streak from the East-Southeast towards the West-Northwest, stopping short of the Big Dipper.  It struck me as odd right away, as it left behind a glowing trail; something similar to what an old CRT TV would do when you turned it off in a darkened room.   Then, within 3 to 4 seconds, a bright light flashed, just outside of where the streak that was left by the “falling star” had ended.  That’s when I realized this was not a falling star.   For the next 5 minutes I watched, as this object and possibly two others, flashed intermittently with varying intensity from very bright quick flashes of white, to a dull slowly growing intensity, culminating in bright white, then instantly dark. During this time, the objects started moving to the East very slowly.  There was no pattern or timing to the flashing or the intensity.  The light was mostly white, but there was a bluish tinge to it at times.  It seemed to be 3 objects in close proximity to one another.  After about 5 minutes, the activity was no longer visible.",2017-08-11T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

This morning, Friday, July 28, 2017, around 11 am, I was sitting at my computer in my back bedroom.  I could hear this strange noise far off and I was wondering what it was.   At first, I thought maybe it was an airplane, but the sound was just so odd, I remain sitting as the sound became louder, I wanted to get up and go look out my sunroom window (like I usually do}, but for some reason, I just couldn't move!  As the noise got louder, I could tell that it was coming closer to my location and it was moving fast.   Finally I jumped up and ran into my living room and looked out my sunroom window, by the time I reached my window I could tell that it was passing over my apartments and moving fast.  Once I pulled back my blinds I notice that the sky was hazy and there were 2 Gwinnett County Police Officers facing in my direction and looking in the sky.   First, I was surprised because I had no idea that the Police was outside, and secondly I immediately notice them looking up in th! e sky with a shocked look on their faces.  They seems shocked and confused and one of them had his mouth open like WTH is that!!   I noticed that the noise had all of a sudden stopped and I could no longer hear it.  I tried to scan the limited amount of sky in my view and that's when I noticed how ""Hazy"" the sky was.  I watched the Police for a few minutes to see what they was going to do.  They both stayed focus on the sky and finally turn to one another and started talking, after a few more minutes of talking, one got into his car and left and went to another locations by the security gates.   The second Police officer stayed behind for a few more minutes, and then they both followed each other out the complex.  I have no idea what they were looking at, but I'm certain that whatever that weird loud noise was in the sky, they saw it!  No doubt in my mind because I can't forget the shocked look on their faces!!   After they left, I called my cousin, who had gone to Publix grocery store to see if he heard that strange LOUD noise because I cou!d tell that it was coming from that direction (141& Holcomb bridge) toward me (Holcomb bridge Rd toward Peachtree Corners).  He immediately said that they could hear it, but no one knew what it was!!  There is a lot of strange objects in the sky in the Peachtree Corners area, on any day at any time you can witness them.  I noticed that if you have sunglasses on, you will be able to see them clearly,  I have taken my sunglasses off and I could barely see them, but once I put them back on, I can plainly see them.  They do disappear, which makes it hard to capture them on video or take pics.  I don't worry too much because I know I will see them again because they are ALWAYS flying around.  I was able to capture one on video on July 10, however this particular object has been around for years so I wasn't too concern about getting the video but I decided to take it anyway before it disappeared because it will disappear on you and reappear somewhere else.",2017-08-04T00:00:00,33.9407777335984,-84.20881809145129

It was much too bright to be a star as you could see stars up above where this object was and the contrast between the stars and this object was very obvious.  It was definitely not a plane either as this object would hover then make jolted type movements.  At one point I watched this object completely disappear gradually, and about 45 seconds later reappeared closer to my home.  It had a pulsating light that would change from red to blue, then to white but with no distinct pattern.  I couldn’t figure out what this thing was and I started to get a bit nervous. Living near the San Jose airport, I’m fairly good at spotting the objects, even in the night sky, but for the life of me I couldn’t figure out what this thing was.  If it had been a helicopter we would have easily heard it and would have recognized the flight patterns.  At about 10:20pm this object was! still hovering in the night sky, only moving once in a while, and very quickly.  I called for my mother-in-law to come to outside so I could get another perspective on what this object was.  Immediately my mother-in-law was also convinced this was much to close to be a star, as the pulsating red and blue lights were fairly obvious.  That’s when my mother-in-law noticed there was a second object as well.  It was further away than the one I had been watching but as we watched this other object it too looked as if it was making similar movements and color changes, and coming closer to our home.  I even pulled up a star chart on my phone and this object was appearing on the star view camera but not registering as a star, nor was it close enough to any star that it would be mistaken as such.  Normally if it’s a satellite, this star map app will tell you.  I tried to take photos and videos but my phone’s camera isn’t the best quality.  I just want to know what this thing was, and if anyone else in the Cupertino / San Jose area also witnessed this object? ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr Davenport, Thanks for your response.  I’m sorry to bother you guys, but yes I believe you’re right that it was Sirius.  I guess I just never realized how bright it can be at times!  I must have stared a bit too long as well because I could swear it was moving.  I’ve since read that that can happen if you’re focusing on an object too long in the night sky?  The night I saw it, it wasn’t registering on the star map app I was using, but I know those apps can be faulty on exact gps locations because last night when I looked, it did register as Sirius.  Thanks again for your response!  ((END ADDENDUM))",2017-12-08T00:00:00,37.30442117647059,-122.09386588235293

The zoo puts on a ""Howl-o-ween"" event where thousands of kids, parents are members are invited to walk about and participate in themed mazes, see animals eating etc.  We'd been to the zoo a dozen times in the last year and know it well.   Tonight they illuminated the adjacent fenced off rocky hill for the visitors to view the resident rams.  Shortly after I took a photo of the hill with moonlight clouds above, I saw the end of the cloud cover was nearly directly overhead and that the stars were peaking through. It was only 10 seconds after gazing upward that I saw what looked like two faint stars flying from the clear SW sky, travelling parallel to each other but not in an exact straight line.  One of them was pulsing slowly a bright white color, the other appeared to fade in and out, they could have been mistaken for satellites or planes if they had not drifted and slowed to a standstill almost directly overheard.  At this point I called to my wife, got out my smartphone (which couldn't capture anything of course) and we both saw the orbs slowly stop.   At this point another orb slowly appeared and then the three balls of light seemed to ""align"" themselves into a classic UFO triangle.   At this point, shocked, I looked around to see how others were reacting and their were dozens of people all around us but, as expected, they were completely engaged with their costumed kids. The triangles altitude was not much higher than the low-hanging clouds yet their appearance was inconspicuous enough to just appear as other faint stars.  We could see that they weren't exactly still but hovered in place, not pulsing or fading in or out, but just staying still as if ""pretending"" to be stars.   After 3 or 5 minutes staring up at the floating triangle, we had to get going, reluctantly.  It felt like winning the jackpot then having to leave your lotto ticket behind.  I was not too surprised by any of this behavior as I have researched many other UFO cases that are nearly exact replicas of this, yet the sheer euphoria and shock of seeing it right before your eyes, out in the open in front of thousands is a power emotion I'll never forget. Researchers and witness have concurred over the years that whatever intelligence these orbs have, it is probably aware of how humans think, and show themselves only just enough for a few to see them, but rarely make an appearance big enough or at the right time for a full-scale sighting with any real earth-shattering consequences. This being my second sighting, and my first in what must be the most populated public outdoor place for the next hundred miles, I believe the UFO definitely knew it could act with impunity.",2017-11-03T00:00:00,33.73731449275362,-116.3779536231884

Dear Peter, this is the strangest UFO? incident I have ever encountered.  I saw what I thought was a star in the northern sky,  I may have seen the same thing a few days earlier but I thought it was just a bright star.  This time I took a look at it with a Nikon 9x25 binocular and saw that it was not a helicopter and also not a star, it was a sphere with the brightest light coming from its center but it did not radiate out.  Not knowing now what it was I took my 10 W. 450nm laser and pointed it at this strange object, I noticed that it started to get dimmer, I took the binoculars again and noticed how the light became dimmer as if it was being sucked back in towards the center and then it went out completely and the whole thing changed into a quite large dark ball of something and started to descend quite rapidly in a straight line towards the ground.  I heard no sound, since I have not heard anything falling on to some bodies roof or something,  I assume it may have fallen into the ocean-inlet between, East-Vancouver and North-Vancouver.  Shortly there after, the whole thing repeated itself, a new star-like object appeared at the very same location and for some strange reason, I did the same thing again, and the same thing happened and the dark ball thing fell down at the exact same place because I could see it through the almost leaf less tree across the street.

It came to a full bobbed left, right and backward then continued to a position almost directly above me then an abrupt stop again.  Now a fast pulsing green light appeared on its left and the second red light came around from behind and dodged around a bit on the right side then disappeared behind it.  There was a wispy cloud around it and I could see light reflecting from the cloud as if a search light was employed an moved as if it was looking for something around and above it.  I didn’t observe the source of the light.  But could see the beam coming from the top of the object.  The object itself was obscured by the brightness of the red and green lights.  It then staggered back toward where it came from and disappeared over the horizon.  Again in 300 degrees WNW.  My location was close to Briggs and Kettle View park and perhaps 5 miles from the local airp! ort.  At first I believed it was going to turn and make an approach for landing and was just a high flying plane.  I did notice it was absolutely silent but while it was above me I heard the roar of two jets on about after the second.  Sounded like F15s.  I have seen the Gov’s Lear jet come and go from this vantage point but never hear it power up or down unless it’s right above me.  I grew up near Elmendorf AFB and that roar is unmistakable.  my locale BTW is Olympia, WA.

I looked up and through the neighbor’s trees I saw what I thought was the moon only orange-ish...like it was smoked covered.  I was facing east.  I then noticed this was not the moon but an orange light.  It looked like an orange ball of fire.  This ‘light’ started to move slowly, like at small plane speed, going north.  It stayed on a fairly horizontal course, just quite slow.  I kept listening for the sound of an airplane engine but it was dead silent.  I followed the light (still at my back door) until it went out of my range of sight and behind more trees on our street, so I ran to the front of my house and looked out the front window – now facing north.  The light appeared to be going even slower now – I could see it through the tree tops for about a minute, then it came into plain sight.  It appeared to just hover, then move slowly, then hover...I couldn’t tell if it was the ! atmosphere that made it look like it was moving oddly, or if it actually was moving oddly.  A few times it looked like it was getting larger, like an object on fire gets larger.  I was expecting it to fall to the ground and crash, but it just slowly moved, hovering oddly. The light then seemed to move upward in elevation, like it was moving north, and slowed a few times in its ascent.  It became smaller and a few times disappeared, showed again, and then finally faded out.  The oddest thing was there was absolutely no sound.  This all lasted about 7 minutes.  I went back to bed and a few minutes later I did hear a small plane fly overhead – this made the absence of sound with this ‘light’ all the more obvious.  I was going to ask a friend who was in the Air Force if he knew of drones or something that would explain this, but I haven’t had the chance yet.",2017-11-22T00:00:00,38.39,-121.818

It was larger than any visible planet.  As I watched it, I noticed it was moving.  With the help of the leaves, I could tell the pace of the movement more easily, because it disappeared behind the leaves.  It moved faster than stars in the sky, but much slower than airplanes, satellites, etc. So, I grabbed my good camera and tripod and ran to my back porch.  I found openings between leaves and branches by standing, kneeling and in between then adjusted my tripod, zoomed in 30x, and began snapping pictures.  It seemed to first be moving upwards in the sky. So I would have to adjust my tripod higher up.  Then it started on a slow path downward on what I believe was about a 150-160 degree angle.  Eventually it seemed to stop and go straight downward, at a 90 degree angle, for the remainder of the sighting.  I ended up having my tripod go from all the way down, to all the way up, then all the way down again. I almost felt like the object wanted to observe something on the ground, maybe the nearby airport, or maybe the NASA Glenn Research Center, within 5-7 miles south of the objects.  It moved slowly enough for most to not think twice when seeing it, maybe thinking it is just a large bright star.  Although it was definitely larger and closer than even the largest star that can ever be observed in the sky, from the ground that is.  I have been studying UFOs and E.T.s  for a year now, since my first sighting.  So I definitely noticed that I was seeing something different here.  I see things all of the time but this is by far one of the coolest sightings I have had. I focused on this object that usually remained red and blue in the pictures pulsating fast in a pattern of red, white, blue.  What I found very strange, were these smaller copper/silver colored objects that appeared only in the photos near the main object. I did not see these objects myself at all, but they were obviously there.  Then I noticed another object very similar to the main one I was already snapping photos of.  This one however, seemed to be blinking fast between the main colors of orange/red, white and yellow rather than red, white and blue.  The last photo attached is of the orange object. I observed these objects between 2-3am. I do not know of a man made or known space object that moves the speed and direction that it did and looks like the pictures I have attached.  The whole time I felt that I was witnessing something really special.",2017-09-28T00:00:00,41.47117691601652,-81.65460330426801

Took my eyes off the sky and walk to get my son from a music lesson, but in just 3 or 4 steps, I stop and want to take a look at this group of bright stars again with some puzzles and scan through the sky for some reference to other stars but the moon is too bright to see other stars.  Now my eyes are back with all these bright stars and studied them a little bit with fascination even with some thin clouds passed by I can still saw through it, they are that bright.   Now with the cloud’s motion, I felt like I wanted to look at the moon to my left to see which way the clouds were moving.  It looked like the clouds moved West-East direction.  Now I was back at these stars, I started to realize they were slightly moving south-east (farer away from me).  Now I heard my son and his teacher at the front door to my left, so I walked there and had a few quick conversations with the teacher and got back to my son and pulled him out to see those stars, but by now they are even further south and just above the electric light pole.   I tried to relocate our position, but it was too late and they were gone.  I felt bad because my son missed it, and I really want him to see it.   I did try to send a drawing picture with this report, too. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite seriou-minded.

I was sitting in my car talking to my buddy who was facing me.  As I looked up at his face to respond to him I saw a super bright electric blue perfect circle go flying by in the sky way above the cloud shelf.  It was flying faster than anything I've ever seen in my life and I am 30 years old.  I've seen plenty of shooting stars some in person and meteors in video.  It was not like those at all.   I am having a hard time describing what I saw, but I would say it was a perfect circle, it was electric blue very bright possibly the brightest thing I've ever seen.  It flew faster than any man made object.  It was flying at a million miles an hour, it was that fast and it had absolutely no trail behind it and no rays coming from it and it did not flash or flicker it stayed lit.  It was flying from the north towards the direction of the moon.  The only reason I lost sight of it was because of very thick cloud cover and then it was gone.   I hope this is descriptive enough for others to envision what I saw.  I am not a huge believer of UFOS but I'm not closed minded either.  I don't know why we are so special that we are the only things that exist.  But I can say this is the first and only time I have witnessed anything like this.

It was bright and sunny without any clouds in sight, and I noticed a single, extremely bright, but small, white to pale yellowish light at very high altitude.   At first I assumed it was a high flying plane that was reflecting sunlight.  I thought it was odd but didn't think much of it really.

We were near Yelm, a town on a prairie plateau in the South Puget Sound area, with a big sky view. The color was silver white, with a long bright white needle like tail much longer than I have ever seen with a meteor.  It had inside the small super bright oval shape a small faint green color to the core with a very short green tinting into the beginning of the tail.  The green was only by the object itself, it did not bleed into the tail more than about 5% of the overall length with its full tail. This is more conducive of a missile, than a meteor, in that its magnitude never changed.  The light was identical to the light of small missiles, such as patriot missiles, but much faster, and much longer.  As for the flare of missiles right at the front of the propulsion fire we couldn't see well, it was too far off, but it appeared to have a faint flare to it, not quite doubling it thickness at that point only, it didn't trail at all, almost like just a blur around the start of the burn area. This did not look at all like a meteor after initially seeing it, and it appeared to be about 40,000 to 70,000 alt., and if so, would put the speed about mach 10.  I flew flight test in Lear's, and I know what I saw.  It did not appear to change altitude in the least. Furthermore, EVERY meteor I have seen acted identically the same.  This was only fast and bright, no other similarities to meteors. It DID NOT flare up and fade off as meteors do.  It DID NOT have the orange and particulates that flare off meteors in about the middle of their entry to our atmosphere.  There were no sparks or glittering. I did not have a compass with me last night, but looking at the map I put the direction of travel near 350 degrees. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report is a very experienced pilot.  During a telephone conversation with the witness, he reported that the object was approximately 12-15 degrees to the east of overhead, and that it traversed approximately 140-150 degrees, from south to north, in approximately 7-8 seconds.

The light was steady and barely moving and was immediately unusual.  The light then began to move to the west quite quickly and steadily.  It continued like this, but in an unusual flight pattern, not like the normal ballistic trajectory of commercial aircraft.  My immediate thought was that it was a helicopter.  It would move west, then appear to pause (perhaps moving away or towards me) and then continue moving again.  It was hard to gauge its distance, but I’d say it was 10-15 miles away.  If that is true, then it was moving far faster than any helicopter I’ve seen fly at that distance. As it approached the western horizon, the red light changed to a white blinking light.  This light was blinking regularly, so once again I thought it must be a helicopter.  But at the speed it was going I began to think it was a fighter jet.  It was just about at the horizon when it nearly disappeared and immediately another separate red light appeared just to the right of it.   This red light was steady and even brighter than the first.   The second red light began to move to the north as the first was nearly gone. The second red light was moving toward the north and just suddenly, what I presume to be the first light, reappeared now as a red light with a white blinking light.  The two began to make their way northeast irregularly; sometimes moving steadily, sometimes pausing or moving away from me.  The first red light seemed to now be following the second, and when they were moving laterally, they were moving quite fast.  The only thing I know of that could move that fast at that distance is a jet fighter.  But the maneuvers between steady lateral movements were far too acrobatic for a jet fighter.    In less than thirty seconds, the two lights—both with a steady red light at what I perceived to be the front, and a white blinking light at the rear—cruised to the northeast and then quickly approached the northern horizon.  Through trees I saw them pausing at the horizon as red lights and then disappearing below the horizon, not to reemerge again.",2017-09-21T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

I saw a bright orange star that was different, and I watched it to see if it was an airplane or possibly a satellite.  As I watched it, I noticed a smaller ball of light drop out of the ""orb"" or what ever it was.  It was like a ball of fire dropped straight out of the ""mother craft"" and went to the ground.  I half expected an explosion, but heard and saw nothing.   Then it dropped another ball of  fire, which also seemed to drop straight down for a while.  It seems it may have veered to the left before dropping out of sight.  Several seconds elapsed when it began to drop fire balls on a more rapid succession.  The larger orb/star/satellite/ began to move slowly towards the south into a more westerly direction and began to be obscured by trees.  I actually checked the news for reports of explosions or other witnesses, but haven't found any yet.  The idea that it was an airplane fighting fires is debunked, as there are no fires burning to the west, and it wasn't an airplane, as it stayed stationary for quite a while.  It wasn't fireworks, though it kind of reminded me of some upside down fireworks.  It was way too high to have been fireworks, and again, no sound was heard. I researched some other photos and it looks exactly like what some describe as an orange Orb, however, I haven't seen anyone else report it dropping smaller balls of fire from its center.  These smaller balls all went straight down towards the ground, but it seems some veered off as they got closer to the ground.

We were at the crossing of S Eads Street and 20th Street S (38.855640, -77.053176) between two large buildings.   At approximately 00:56 EST we observed a large fireball or flash rapidly move East to West between in the Northern horizon.  Note we were facing North as we observed the object moving East to West.  If facing North from out vantage point it would have been at a 45 degree angle in the sky and close enough to where it looked as if it flew over the George Washington Memorial Highway, approximately .4 to .5 miles from our location.  Note, this is in the flight path of the DCA Ronald Reagan National Airport, however checking flight records there were no arrival or departure flights during the time period of the sighting. Furthermore, this would have been directly over the airport and we would suspect it would be normal to not see aircraft from our vantage point as this was in direct path of the airport and craft would be taking off and landing from fields of view not within our sight path.  Also the object was so bright it illuminated the buildings and ground that were around us, where a plane light would have not provided sufficient illumination.  No noise was heard coming from the object either, it was a very quiet night, even for the relatively busy area we were in, and no aircraft noise or anything else affiliated with the craft could be heard.  Using basic trigonometry with estimations for the angle of object (tangent) and perceived distance (adjacent) I would estimate the object was approximately 4,000 feet in the air (2,500 * tan(45) = height).  In summary, I observed an unusually bright large blue/green rapidly moving fireball in the northern horizon above the George Washington Memorial Highway/DCA Reagan Airport moving East to West at approximately 4,000 feet.  I believe an obvious explanation for the sighting would likely include a fireball meteor event, however, after observing multiple examples from youtube of meteors and fireballs each of these have a significant trail and are very high in the sky and rapidly fizzle out.  This object was not fizzling out and was cruising along with a minimal haze or trail (I hesitate to say there was a trail) behind the object and was very low.   I do realize the Southern Taurids meteor shower is technical active during the time period of the sighting, but it is not at its height of activity until October.  I was unable to locate a database to identify whether any fireballs or meteor events were observable from my location during the time period of the sighting.

Our background:  My apologies for the long report, but these things seemed to be related from our perspective.  I am a Business Analyst, age 47, from the United States, and I have lived in this area of NC most of my life while working in South America, Europe and the United States.  I worked in Lima Peru from 1998-2000, where I met my wife.  She is also 47, and she left her profession as a Human Resources manager for the Peruvian government to come live with me here in 2015.  My education is in Business Administration and hers is in Art History and Contract Law. We both became amateur archaeologists while living in and visiting Peru over the years, so we have seen numerous unexplained things in our lives, mostly surrounding ancient ruins and paranormal activity associated with them.  We have separately seen UFOs once or twice in our lives, excluding one event at Lake Titicaca in Puno, Peru, where we discovered that a UFO was captured in one of our photographs near some pre-Incan ruins close to the Bolivian border.  It was just a silver sphere in the background, over a small lake. When she came to live with me here in 2015 we had a short period of odd events in and around our home, mostly paranormal in nature.  We tend to shrug off things like that as we are somewhat accustomed to it, but we did have one event while remodeling the house.  An unseen force moved rapidly through our home while we were sleeping on our living room floor, waking us, disturbing papers and knocking over several boxes and objects around our home.  We adopted a cat in 2016 who also reacted to unseen things in our home, but such activity seems to have ceased, mostly, since January of 2017. In January of 2017 we had a series of unexplained explosions or booming sounds in our area which are well documented online and by local authorities.  The last one that we recall was January 19, 2017 when a huge fireball streamed over our area accompanied by a violent sonic boom that shook the entire area.  This is also well documented in the media and online. Our ‘UFO’ Sighting on September 24, 2017:  About 18:00, we were at my parents’ home at Lake Norman, NC.  My mother and I took her dog out for a walk and noticed three passenger jets overhead.  The sky was clear and blue.  Two of the jets had heavy parallel contrails and one had none.  We didn’t notice additional planes but more contrails appeared within minutes, perpendicular to the others.  Within 15 minutes, the entire sky had become overcast with clouds that seemed to build from the contrails.  The clouds were unusual in shape, having a sort of saw-tooth appearance.  We joked about “chemtrails” a bit and went back into the house.  My wife and I left to go home about 20:10. While travelling on Highway 16 East from Lake Norman to Mount Holly, about 20:40, we noticed an evenly spaced line of 4 bright yellow-orange lights with a larger similar light above them, in the direction of Charlotte, NC.  We initially thought they were helicopters or planes, but a passing jet overhead looked completely different and had flashing lights.  The formation we saw was not blinking and apparently did not move.  I used my cell phone to call my mother and asked if there were any reports of an emergency or other activity in Charlotte, and she replied that she hadn’t seen anything on the news.  I noted that my phone had an 81% charge after the call.  My wife attempted to photograph the lights but the image was very washed out on her phone due to headlights from oncoming traffic. Approaching the junction of Highway 273 we noticed flashing yellow warning lights had been placed on both sides of Highway 16 for some reason, as if there was a hazard in the road ahead.  Turning onto Highway 273 South toward Mount Holly we noticed several cars parked on the side of Highway 16 with no lights, maybe abandoned. Shortly after turning onto Highway 273, we lost sight of the lights due to trees obstructing our view, but both of our cell phones went dead and street lights went out for about ¼ mile around us.  We both noticed a drastic temperature change and we became very warm in the car even with the a/c on.  We arrived at our home about 10 minutes later and confirmed that both phones had zero charge, and we could not see the lights from our house, again due to trees. I plugged my phone into the charger and called my mother again, but her phone was apparently busy for the next half hour.  I learned later that she had not been using the phone, so that remains unexplained.  My wife and I discussed the possibility that the parked cars we saw had experienced a similar electrical issue earlier in the evening.  We continued to experience hot flashes the rest of the evening in spite of a steady temperature in our home.  We both began to feel nauseous around midnight, but it passed.  This morning and afternoon (September 25) my wife has been vomiting and I seem to be fine, but we both stayed home as she is preparing to fly to Peru tomorrow to visit our relatives in Lima.  My mother encouraged us to report our sighting after we had searched for any news of an event and found nothing. This may have been 5 objects or one really huge triangle with 5 lights.

This is going to be one of the more unremarkable sighting reported to you, but I felt it worthy of sharing just the same. On Sunday evening, 24 September, at about 8:30 PM, my wife and I were returning home from a restaurant when we observed an object in the sky traveling from approximately west, 15 degrees south toward the east, approximately 15 degrees north. The object appeared to be comprised of two white lights connected to one another and moving at a speed of approximately 5 arc degrees per second.  I have no idea as to its actual speed since I was unable to determine its altitude. What I am reasonably certain of is the object was not an aircraft since there were no blinking lights, no red or green lights marking the wing tips, just a solid white light. There were high clouds present in the sky and our view of the object was blocked as it moved over the clouds.  I would estimate the altitude of the clouds to be approximately 15,000 feet. The object emitted no audible sound as it passed us overhead. We did observe an aircraft to our east, moving from the south, approximately 15 degrees west, toward the north, approximately 15 degrees north, which is the direction we would surmise as an aircraft going from Atlanta, to New York City.  Given the aircraft we observed at the same time was likely traveling at ~30,000’, the object we observed also appeared to be moving at the same rate—5 arc degrees per second. My first inclination is to surmise the object we saw was the international space station, but I hadn’t heard any announcements of its presence in our area, which is the usual case on our local TV stations, but if it were the space station there is one curious matter remaining unsolved:  When the object we observed reached a point where it was some 30 degrees above the horizon, it was no longer visible to us.  It seems to have disappeared at that point. While I will not discount the possibility that the object was blocked by some clouds we could not see, or that it might have been blocked by some other atmospheric phenomenon, the fact that it disappeared from our view is what has prompted this communication. If you do think we were looking at the international space station, I would appreciate your letting us know. Thank you!",2017-09-28T00:00:00,35.5003,-85.00309999999999

I was in Lancaster, Kentucky at that time.   I called my brother in neighboring Lincoln County and asked him to go out to observe the object.  He was about 3 miles south of my location.  While on the phone the object became very bright.  This was caused by the angle from the sun.  I have seen this occur when planes fly toward the western horizon after sunset.  The object and the plane were moving east to west.  They appeared to move about the same speed.  However, the plane did not reflect any sunlight. My brother did not see the object  brighten.  It lasted a few seconds.  Finally he was able to get outside and find the object with binoculars.  His description is as follows:  The object appeared to have a large, low dome above an undefined structure below.  The ""dome"" reflected a yellow glow from the setting sun.  I followed the object with binoculars for a minute or so until it just vanished from view.  I'm not sure if the object just ceased reflecting sunlight, or if it moved off at a very high rate of speed.  Total time of my observation was about two minutes. Finally, I tracked the object from the Lancaster location until it became a pale white dot on the western horizon and vanished.  My observation was naked eye and lasted about 5 minutes.  It did not appear to be a plane.  Hopefully someone else saw it and can identify it. My brother and I are amateur astronomers and have been for 45 years.  It was not a plane.

I asked my husband did he see those lights crossing the night sky ,he said he thought they were three small planes  but he was busy unloading the car off the roll back he had not really looked at the lights till they were further away from us ,I told him planes don't fly in a straight line and that close to each other without moving some ,these lights did not move like small planes would ,he th! en said its Jets , but the lights were moving across the sky really slow and low and Jets move fast cause we have seen Jets flying at night and their lights blink,the lights were moving from North to South ,there is a  airport for small planes and lear jets in Smithfield NC on business 70hwy ,but these lights were further down from where the airport is moving toward Raleigh.Not sure if they were planes or not but can't rule that out.just strange the way they were flying so low and with no blinking lights.

It's a private beach, so there is little to no light pollution.  My friend pointed out two yellowish lights in formation to our left (north).  I simply dismissed them as being airliners in a pattern to land.  But after about five seconds of looking away she yelled, ""They fused together!"".  I look back over and cofirmed there was just one light just stationary that lasted for about 5 minutes, until fading out.   Shortly after she points in front of us (East), over an anchored ship another light that was red, blue and white changing colors and shapes.  This one was different not only because of the changing colors and shapes but this one had a very erratic movement.  It wasn't stationary not moving in a certain direction.  It would do small erratic movements in almost every direction with occasional drops in altitude.  No conventional aircraft to my knowledge could have performed these movements that, being that high in the air, would equal to 50-100 foot instantaneous movements.  At one point we witnessed a light, almost like a strobe or lighting very near where we were sitting and my friend said she felt a presence and it was eerie so we decided to head back to our car.  As we walked we kept tracking the object that seemed to move North with us as we walked since it wasn't hovering over the ship anymore (that was our marker).  We stopped one last time to observe it and to confirm with each other that we were seeing the same thing and, sure enough, it was directly East of us at this point a half mile walk from our original position.  It continued to do the same erratic movements and even reacting to passing aircraft.  We left and were not able to see the object again.",2017-11-09T00:00:00,,

On the evening of Monday, October 2nd, at approximately 20:05 (8:05 pm) Eastern Time, I was in the yard putting up some tools.  I had been doing yard work until sunset and as the light was fading, I was putting away the last items and enjoying the near full moon.  The international space station was going to make an observable pass at 8:14 in the northwest, and I wanted to have everything put up and be in position to take advantage of the overflight.   I saw the first ‘orb’ in the south east, just under the moon at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  (Just over the roof tops and about level with the star ‘I PSA’ (the upper right star in the constellation Pisces).  The weather was clear without any clouds in the sky.  The orb appeared to be orange in color and was moving at a diagonal to the usual air traffic.   Because of this, I grabbed a pair of binoculars and saw that it was not a plane, but a solid ball of orange light. 	At that point, I ran inside and called for my girlfriend to come see and then ran back outside and over to the neighbors (husband and wife) that were sitting on their front porch.  There was just enough light from the setting sun and the near full moon to see the ground while I ran.   At this point the first orb had crossed into the south east and faded out of view.  The second was almost due south and about 1/4 the size of the nearby moon.  By this time I could see in the binoculars that this was not a Chinese lantern, their was never any flickering (like from a candle) in any of the five orbs observed, rather, the light remained constant during the observational period.  The orbs were circular and a solid shade of glowing orange.   The second orb passed to from south east to west, almost overhead of us, then changed course and headed upward, into (what appeared to be) the atmosphere, fading out of sight.  The path the first three orbs took lasted about a minute to transit from southeast toward the west, this second orb shot off in a sort of southerly angle going up into the sky before disappearing. 	I was using my phone to verify that there were no satellites in the area as I have an app to identify stars, planets, and satellites.  Oddly, I did not think to take a picture with the phone until someone suggested it.  However, the camera (for the first time since I bought the phone 10 months ago) did not work very well and ‘refused’ to take video, it only allowed one picture which is of limited quality.  The other adults present had difficulty getting their cameras to work also, although they were able to eventually have some success. 	The third orb appeared in the distance, just over the houses in the same area as the first two (Southeast).  From my point of view this was just ‘left’ of the moon and geographically would be (approximately) in the direction of Versailles, Kentucky.  The third orb followed the same path as the first two and drifted behind some trees before disappearing.  Being that the fourth orb was approaching, we focused on it rather than trying to change locations to reacquire the third orb.  Again, the third matched the description of the previous two orbs. 	The fourth orb appeared to change direction to travel west, south-west, it then performed a quick circular maneuver and resumed heading south and away and out of sight behind trees.  The fifth orb appeared to dance in the starting location moving around in circles and up and down (similar to watching a child jumping up and down on a trampoline).  This fifth and final orb faded from view kind of like ’winking out’ the ways the way stars do in the morning when the sun is rising. 	Distance is difficult to judge in the fading sunlight and with a target that is of unknown size.  I will estimate that the orbs starting point was approximately ten miles away and that at their closest point (of the first three orbs) that they were between a 1/2 mile and 1 mile away.  Based on these assumptions, I would suggest that their ‘cruising speed’ was approximately 480 mph.  However, when the second orb accelerated into the atmosphere is appeared to streak out of sight within a second. 	As an amateur astronomer of 40 years, and as a disabled veteran (4 years US Navy, 9 years US Army) that served on the aircraft carrier Midway (CV-41)  I am very familiar with terrestrial aircraft, satellites, and other celestial bodies.  Further, I have experimented with Chinese lanterns and am familiar with how they look and act in the night sky.  Finally, as a trained weather spotter, I stay abreast of local weather conditions.  The wind was out of the south at 2 mph.  Although the wind direction roughly correlates to the direction of the first three orbs (they were moving in a north westerly direction) the 2mph wind would not allow lanterns to fly at anywhere near the speeds observed!",2017-10-05T00:00:00,38.0052,-84.983

It was 2040 hours and I was on a 25 minute layover and was outside.  I was looking toward the West in the sky and i see a bright light approaching me high up.  How high I am not sure.  It seemed to be cloud level perhaps higher.  But when i see the light it is very bright.  This time it flies almost directly over me, but not quite, from a West to East direction. I see the light and zoom in on it with a powerful monocular I purchased.  I see it is the same light orb I have seen previously.  I take out my phone camera and start filming it.  I get about 1 minute or so then my phone goes dead.  I revert back to my monocular and watch the orb continue from West to East.   After a few minutes the orb dims somewhat.  On previous occasions, the orb has traversed the sky till out of sight or veer in a different direction and on 2 occasions it disappeared as I watched it.  This time it did something it has not done before.  It stopped.  The orb came to a stop and ! sat in the same spot for at least 50 minutes.  While I was watching it with the monocular as the orb was still, another light travelled past it perpendicular to the direction the stopped orb was travelling.  The moving light moved south to north just below the stopped orb. 5 minutes later another light did the same thing.  I don't know what those lights were.  If you were to look at the orb that stopped it would appear as a star had you not seen it cross the sky.

Our street is dark though, it's a small road leading into our neighborhood and it sits up high on a hill overlooking the rest of the town.   I turned left into the subdivision we can see down a large hill and lots of sky.  It is a great spot, very open and expansive.  The reason I explain all of this is to show that I have a great view of alot of sky at this vantage point.  It was very dark at this time, no moon there is airplane and helicopter traffic out in the distance, that is normal so I didn't at first think to much of it.   But what caught my eye that made me stop in the middle of the street was two round very super bright lights in the sky to my left.  They were just sitting there at a strange angle.  Not a normal angle though, not a star or plane, they two were completely stationary.  My daughter is 17, I said don't those lights look super odd.  She agreed and added that it almost looked like there was a circle around them.  I am now kicking myself for not grabbing my phone, we both were almost frozen looking at these lights.   I scanned the sky nothing was moving around it.  Then all of a sudden the best way I can describe this is the two anglular lights moved away from us.  Like they slowly disappeared into the sky.  As to explain like it took off slowly but was enveloped by the sky.  It did not go left or right or at any angle but forward into the dark.  I hope I have described what I saw well.  Was it quick? but felt like an eternity.  We both were screaming how it was disappearing.  Then it was gone.  We sat there for another minute and I looked all over the sky, but didn't see anything else.  I will never forget it!   Thank you for letting me share.

As I approached Club One at 6325 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15206, I noticed initially 2 red balls in the sky, as if a group of helicopters were approaching.  Then I noticed 2 more.  There appeared to be 1 leading and the other 3 following.  But, they made no noise.   I pulled over in the parking lot that adjoins the gym near the McDonald's.  As I parked, I noticed them flying towards the townhomes across the street toward the Shadyside area.  I took a few pictures.  I was upset I couldn't get video because I just returned from vacation and didn't have enough space for video.   Then a larger one appeared which was about 2.5x's there size.  But I didn't think I captured it because of the lights from the McDonald's sign.   I also captured the 4 smaller ones, and unbeknownst to me, in the 1 picture with the illuminated McDonald's sign, if you enlarge it, you can see the shape of the actual object and the red going from back to front in a wave like  design.  But behind it, a few days later I noticed a blue glow.   When I enlarged the picture there appears to be a blue circular craft. And between the 1st one in that picture and blue craft their appears to be an irregular, rectangular shaped object that is not illuminated.  So there were possibly 7 total objects.   I have attached the 3 photos.  Please magnify for detail.

I could not say how far away it was, but it was definitely farther than a mile, if not more than that.  I pointed it out, and she thought it was the moon.   We continued to watch as the object got wider (to about the width of your thumb at arm's length).   There were clouds off in the distance, but no clouds that appeared thick enough to hide the moon.  It maintained a fairly symmetrical shape.  It almost looked like the ""angel decoy"" flare release from an AC-130 gunship, except if these were flares, they didn't fall, and it looked like a solid object.  The object would periodically appear to change size, and hue/brightness, shrinking to a small point, but it was seen to grow in size again, at least once.   Eventually, another object of similar color appeared next to the first (or appeared to split off from the first).   We continued watching and eventually went in, as the object was moving to the left and became obscured by trees and houses in the neighborhood.

My memory on the date is the only thing that is foggy, it was either 2009 or 2010, making me either 19 or 20.  The sighting occurred at approximately at coordinates 30.741037, -86.987174 on Steel Bridge Rd. in Milton, FL, which is right beside Whiting Field Nas-South.  2 of my friends and I had arrived to the area in the afternoon, maybe 2-3 pm, to set up a campsite for some other friends that were joining us there later that evening.  Steel Bridge Rd. itself is used mostly by the local canoe rental company as a drop off point into Blackwater River, and isn't really a campsite per say.  There must have been the off season (Fall or Spring) because the road was usually very busy with river goers, but no one was on the road that day.  Seeing as we weren't really sure about the legality of camping at the time, we had parked farther down Steel Bridge Rd. and were walking towards the river (East of where we parked) with a tent, a couple chairs, etc. We were about by said coordinates, when I looked up to the tree line to our right and noticed what could only be described as a stereotypical flying saucer.  It was fairly small only slightly larger than a car or truck, maybe roughly 20-30 ft in diameter, and silver in color.  It was a disk shape, but had a slight dome in the center that could maybe have fit 2 - 3 people.  It was hovering maybe 10-15 feet about the pine trees, and making NO sound whatsoever.  I pointed it out to my friends and we couldn't help but start laughing and pointing at it out of shock as it looked like nothing we had ever seen before.  There was absolutely no way it could have been anything besides a 'flying saucer.'  It was well lit outside and we could clearly see the craft as it was only 100 - 200 ft from us.  As we were pointing at it, it must have noticed us as well because it went from a totally stationary position to moving towards the river, where we were also heading (Eastward).  It moved under 5! mph in a seemingly straight line, staying about the treetops, and not venturing over the road.  I looked down for maybe a split second (probably to see where my phone was to take a pic) and looked back up and it was already about 300 feet away.  And then it was across the river and out of our sight over the tree line in a matter of a couple seconds. It was in the middle of the day so it really didn't feel creepy to us at the time.  We were more astounded than anything. The next morning, we woke up to the sounds of ""Reveille"" being played on horns, and it sounded like it was coming from the east side of the river which was the direction the UFO flew (we were camping on the west bank).  The Naval Air Station however was about 5 miles southwest of where we were camping.  I make this note because at the time I thought the horns were just from the Naval Air Station, but as I've thought about it, this really doesn't make any sense.  Not only did the horns sound MUCH closer than 5 miles away, they sounded like they came in from the direction where the UFO flew, which was in the opposite direction of the base.  Maybe they were camping out in the woods experimenting with with the aircraft? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

These are two separate events and the date is approximate. I was about 16 at the time, and my mom worked nights as a private hospice worker, leaving me alone for the evening.  I remember waking up, feeling calm and rather peaceful as several (I would say about 5) small beings stood beside my bed to my left.  I remember thinking, I don't sleep on my back and that's why I woke up, being in a different position and needing to move.  The hall light was on, and therefore behind the beings and eclipsed their faces, but still details were visible:  lack of coloration to their skin giving a gray appearance, and large almond-shaped black eyes, smallish mouth.  They also seemed to be wearing medium to dark blue suits with a triangle on their left breast (with the tip pointing down). I didn't feel fear or pain, not drugged, as I was quite clear in the head, but the experience was a bit like waking up from anesthesia.  I felt like I overheard conversation, but I can't remember a voice.  It said ""she's unfit"" or something to that effect.  (Years later, I was diagnosed with poly cystic ovarian syndrome, whose symptoms I had been displaying since I was 13 or 14 and nearly made me infertile). I haven't been able to speak about it until recently, or even think about it, as going there in my memory makes me very, very frightened - even now my palms are cold and sweaty and my heartbeat is elevated. The next experience had less to do with them than what I believe could have been a MIB encounter after my visitation - maybe a month or two. We lived on East Drive in Princeton, in an apartment block that has now been demolished. My mom was away for the evening and it was in the dead of night.  I was a night owl and fully awake, speaking to my now husband on the internet. It must have been between 2-3am and there was a sudden, loud knock on the front door (which happened to be right under me). I looked out of the window and saw a black car with chrome trim in the driveway, but not pulled into the parking lot (therefore effectively blocking cars that may come in or out--not like there was a lot of traffic this time of the morning, however).  There were footprints in the snow (single pair) heading right up to my front door. I called my mother, who was working.  She told me to call 911 (we were paranoid and my uncle was a police officer).  I did.  I told the 911 operator what was going on and she said she would send an officer out.  I told her I had to call my mother back or she would freak out, so I did and I remember being on the phone with her very briefly and reassuring her that everything would be ok, a policeman was on his way.  I kept looking out for him. As soon as I put down the phone, it rang.  It was the 911 operator. ""Where have you been? I've been trying to call you for hours.  We sent an officer out and you didn't answer the door or the phone.""  I assured her I was just on the phone with my mother for a few minutes but everything was okay.

Moving star stopped and then another star appeared right next to it and they started moving.,Chisinau (Moldova),,1992-09-10T21:00:00,light,15 minutes,"Occurred : 9/10/1992 21:00  (Entered as : 09/10/1992 21:00) Reported: 8/16/2017 8:48:12 AM 08:48 Posted: 8/17/2017 Location: Chisinau (Moldova),  Shape: Light Duration:15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/135/S135741.html,"Moving star stopped and then another star appeared right next to it and they started moving. I was a kid back then and I don't remember what year it was, but it should be between 1990 and 1995. I was watching a night sky from the balcony on the 5th floor. I'd guess the time should have been between 19:00 and 22:00 when I noticed a ""falling star"" as I was watching a dark starry sky. The location of the building and my approximate position is here:  https://www.google.com/maps/place/47%C2%B002'57.5%22N+28%C2%B051'35.5%22E/@47.0493128,28.8587608,388m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d47.049311!4d28.859857   Using that Google map image as a point of reference, I was looking in the top left direction with roughly this spot in the center of my view:  https://www.google.com/maps/place/47%C2%B002'59.8%22N+28%C2%B051'33.7%22E/@47.0499478,28.8582568,388m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d47.049946!4d28.859353   The “star” slowly moved from top-right corner of the visible portion of the sky to the center.  At first, there were nothing that seemed too unusual – I've seen “falling stars” before and was told those are satellites and this one didn't look too different.  Until it started weirdly changing its trajectory, which no longer looked like a straight like, although it was a slight change anyway. It then stopped around the center of visible portion of the sky for a few seconds or maybe a 1-1.5 minute.  Then another star appeared right next to that one.  It didn't fully appear immediately – it was slowly increasing its brightness.  It is also interesting that while gaining brightness it become too bright compared to the first star and then decreased its brightness, ending up looking just like it.  It was like when you start the car engine it initially operates at a higher rpm and then calms down and uses it's idle-mode rpm. Overall it took ~ 0.6 seconds to appear, with 0.1 of that time spent to decrease brightness.  After that they didn't move for some time (I'd guess 2-3 minutes) and then started moving roughly in the same direction where the first star came from.  I don't remember how exactly did they disappear, maybe they've moved out of my sight or a building blocked my view.   I'm going to send an email with a gif animation of those movements.

The craft made no sound and flew extremely fast. This happened many years ago, while stationed at Grand Forks AFB.  I was archery hunting on the Forest River colony land. I am not 100% certain of the date and time.  I hunted on the colony land frequently.  At that time, what is now shown as 36th Avenue on a map was actually not much more than a tractor path.  I always parked at the top of the hill above the forest river.  The location is North of the colony buildings.  I would usually not get back to the truck until after dark.  I was loading my gear into the truck and noticed some flashing lights North of my location.  At first, I didn't really pay attention because the craft had flashing lights similar to typical aircraft.  It was hovering at around 5,000 ft. and my first thought was a Huey from the base.  I quickly realized the craft was not making any sound.  I watched it for a few minutes and it hovered closer to my location.  I cannot remember if the altitude changed any, but i was never able to make out a silhouette or shape of the craft.  I could only see the lights.  I started to drive east on 36th Avenue to get to the main road.  I had the window down and continued to watch the craft as it followed me.  36 Avenue made a 90 degree turn straight south toward the main road near the colony buildings.  I was driving very slow and kept watching out the window.   As I got to the main road, the craft started heading toward the direction of the Air Force base as I headed east again.  I started to think maybe it was a classified or experimental aircraft, as I had never seen any that were totally silent.  After I drove about a mile, the craft suddenly accelerated faster than anything I had ever seen.  It was so fast, the lights were streaking in the sky and it left eyesight maybe less than a second.  It appeared to gain altitude as a fast as it gained distance.  I remember thinking how incredible....  I have no idea what it was, but it made no sound and was faster than any aircraft or rocket I had ever seen to this day.  The interesting aspects is that the craft! was abl e to hover. It made no sound at all, and flew extremely fast.  I never discussed the incident with anyone back then.  I spent a lot of time outdoors and never saw the craft again.

When I saw it I thought it I might have had an optical problem from being tired or a twinkle from a distant star.   Continuing my stellular gaze, I definitely saw the distinct single bright strobe.  Knowing that this was not something normal.  Too close for a distant star and no other lights to not be an airplane.  I flashed my powerful LED flashlight at area.  The response was an immediate strobe of light back. WOW.  What was that.  I responded again.  An immediate pulse of light back again.  I walked to darker area to try and see what was the source.  I flashed my light again.  Another response.  I could not see what was the light was coming from.  I went three flights of stairs up to the roof where our cooling towers are and the darkest spot I knew of when the lights were off.  I flashed my light in the general area and was immediately signal back.  This went on for 20 more minutes.  I was dumbfounded to what was happening.  I had to leave and resume my normal operations.  I had a very hard time trying to understand what had just happened and to this day still cannot!  This has gone on and off all this time until 3 months ago.   I went on vacation for three weeks, and when I came back, the phenome has just stopped.  There is so much more to the story.  I had recruited other individuals to witness the strobe.  They were able to verify that I had not completely gone mad by also witnessing the light.  What or who is actually in the night sky is an exciting mystery.

Almost directly overhead, at a distance that made the objects resemble satellite flares.  The objects moved into the field of view from south to north, at first appearing as if they were satellites.  They then stopped, and proceeded to move about in changing directions as if they were searching an area of the sky.  This continued for more than 30 minutes and in fact had not yet stopped when I simply stopped watching.  I frequently watch the stars and enjoy watching satellites and meteors on clear nights.  I definitely know the difference between satellite movement, aircraft (I'm a private pilot), and stars/planets. At times it appeared as if the objects 'released' other very faint objects.  This is hard to be certain of, given the distance and very faint nature of the secondary objects.  Also, at times it appeared as if a perfectly concentric circle of blackness enveloped the objects; again, given the distance this feature was hard to discern at all times. Overall distance covered is best estimated as follows:  I noticed the objects coming past about 230 degrees on the compass and they stopped and ""searched"" at about 300 degrees moving around an area encompassing roughly 290-310.",2017-08-11T00:00:00,,

Now, about the light:  It was warm white and steady, moving slightly faster than I imagine an airplane would.  It didn’t seem to blink in any other colors, such as the wings in an airplane tend to do.  Bear in mind that the sky was clear enough for me to observe the Doppler effect in the other stars.

We went to the deck in our backyard and she pointed out an object to the northeast in the sky.  My first impressions were that it was changing colors and appeared to have multiple lights stacked in a vertical line. I suggested we get binoculars to try to get a better look at the object.  I used a pair of 8-16x magnification binoculars; my mother used a set of old Navy ship binoculars (magnification unknown).  My mother was the first to find the object in the sky and stated the object was moving in seemingly random directions for very short distances.  She also noted it was changing shape and left a ""tail"" as it moved.  I was able to find the object in my binoculars also and made the same observation.  We watched the object for a period of time. We deduced it was not a star because of its movements and shape changes.  The object was much brighter than the surrounding stars.  We also assumed it was not a meteor because it did not follow a linear path.  A plane was also ruled out for the same reason as a meteor. After a period of observation with binoculars I decided to try to video tape the object with my cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S6).  I was able to do so and attached one of three videos I took.  I also took 13 photos, one of which was attached.  I tried to file this report last night, but the MUFON server because non-responsive (probably because of the size of the attachments.

My brother decided to drive over and observe the object.  He arrived around 12:25 a.m. and left around 1:34 a.m.  He observed the object the entire time.  My mother and I both went into the house before my brother arrived. I came out to talk to him briefly before retiring to bed. We have seen UFOs on 2 other occasions from the same location with a number of witnesses. The previous sightings were of a clearly visible disc object (seen twice).

It was quite high in altitude, lower than an airplane, about a little higher than what helicopters fly at... It looked like a human, almost ""demonic"" creature--bony arms hanging down with claw like hands it was very silent but I felt like it knew of my looking at it and I was quite struck with fear, but awe as well.  I told my spouse and he said indifferently it must have been a fruit bat... I looked up fruit bat, flying fox fruit bat and the like, and this did not match the description.   Now just a few minutes ago my spouse and I saw a very strange (what he considers to be a drone)and huge black winged creature now this had to be more like 40+ feet wing span very thick wings, very thick body- but like an airplane body... this first creatur! e was thin, almost transparent and clearly had a human like body attached a head, legs, and arms with claw like hands like 3 fingers and a thumb... well this object we just saw was huge, flying south and veered off to the east. we grabbed the binoculars and followed it but lost sight of it.

What I saw:  It was a clear night, the moon was below the horizon to the east and I was laying outside in Superior, CO, on our patio furniture star gazing above.  At 10:55PM, I was astonished to see a rather faint chevron shaped craft come into view from the east and continue to disappear to the west in only 3 seconds time.  If I hadn’t been looking in the exact location I was, then I never would have seen it, as it wasn’t particularly bright and was moving extremely fast.  It was visible to me within 90 degrees, or half the sky, and then faded away.  Before it disappeared the lights seemed to move or deform in relation to one another, each getting closer/further away from one another.  For a moment I thought maybe it was 5 separate craft flying in perfect formation, but I had noticed a body structure so this couldn’t have been the case. Odd side note - as I’m writing this the following evening, a large black military helicopter has decided to visit our neighborhood several times. Here are some details about the craft: It made no noise and it was very faint. It was the fastest thing I have ever seen.  There were no flashing lights but instead five good sized lights on the underside, two on each side leading to one at the front. I didn’t see the details of the front or the ends of the chevron.  The lights or something else partially illuminated the edges of the craft.  The color of the lights were whitish-yellow or that of a warm colored light bulb.  I could not denote any color to the craft so I assumed it was black like the sky.  After it passed, I estimated it to be four fingers wide when I held out my fingers to measure its width.  For me, thats about 3 inches wide at 21” from my face. My thoughts after this happened: I thought maybe some kind of cloaking technology was used, as before it disappeared there was a weird distortion of its appearance. The lights seemed to ride an invisible wave, almost like when you look at the sun or bright light when under water - like a pool. I couldn’t specifically tell the altitude of it, but it seemed to be at least as high as the commercial jets, I can’t fathom what the size of this thing could be if it was higher. For what it’s worth: I’m used to seeing a wide variety of aircraft fly overhead while looking at the stars, as DIA is 35 miles away so we get a lot of jets flying over.  The commercial jets seem to take about 30 seconds to cover the same area of whatever I saw.  I live next to a small airport, and we’ve had every kind of aircraft from Cessnas to Slurry Bombers and F-16s at the local air shows, they are all audible, even the very high altitude jets. ((NUFORC Not:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-mided and sincere.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, I’m a Coast Insider and knew to come to your site as I hear you on the show all the time. Great work by the way, I love hearing your reports! Oddly enough, I was actually listening to Sundays show on aliens and ufos.  Not too unlikely I suppose, but it made me think of when George says, “Everything happens for a reason."" It was hard to not file this report while I was working, I’ve been thinking about this thing all day long.  Also, thanks for taking the time to put together such a great database of reports. So in terms of distance, beginning to end :  If I were to lay on my back and hold my arms straight up to the sky and measure the angle of my arms, they would be 90 degrees or a right angle.  Now that distance that was visible was almost directly over me (it was actually offset), so 45 degrees left from straight up to 45 degrees right of straight up.  Not sure if this makes total sense, I tried to find a website with details of how to explain the arc and other details in astronomical terms.  It was also almost travelling perfectly east to west, but I estimated that was also off by a few degrees when looking at Google Maps.  I’d say it was slightly SE to NW, but almost true West… again not sure how to best explain it. I did have one thought I forgot to add to my  ‘For what it’s worth section’.  It doesn’t have to get appended to the report, but I thought you might find this interesting.  This morning I told a coworker you never know what this thing could have been, an alien craft or a high tech military craft, one that’s probably headed to North Korea.  Five minutes later I thought to myself… 'why would it have lights on the bottom of it then!’  Anyhow, food for thought I suppose. Thanks again,",2017-09-21T00:00:00,,

I hurried up and grabbed my high powered spotting scope to get a better view and saw a disk shaped bright craft traveling about the same speed as an aircraft except the entire craft was light up with only one red no blinking light.  It made no sound and normal airplanes at the same distance in the same spot make a noticeable sound.   That's when I ran and grabbed my stepson that enjoys UFOs as much as I do just to make sure I was seeing things correctly and he saw the same thing.  We have both witnessed multiple UFOs before and knew that it was the only explanation.  Truly a sight to see and it never gets old just like buck fever.

I observed what looked like sunlight reflecting off of a plane very high up, probably at least 100,000 feet altitude.  It was above the wispy cloud layer.  I observed that the  object  that appeared to be reflecting was not moving and just hanging in the  sky. I notified another guard and he also witnessed the object in the sky.  I notified an additional guard, and at least three employees also were notified and observed the object. I checked my star and planet finder app on my phone and there were no stars or planets in that section of the sky.  I attempted to look at the object with binoculars and could see it since it wasn’t moving, but it just appeared to be a white light. The object stayed in the same location in the sky for roughly 30 minutes, then when checked periodically appeared to drift very slowly to the north.  The object was in the sky in fairly geosynchronous orbit for over an hour.  From 0830-0930. I took several photographs of the object with my phone. I notified another guard at a different facility, approximately 10 miles to the Northeast of my facility and asked him if he could see it.  He later advised me that he and at least one other guard at his facility did see the object, but not until 1300.  This guard advised me that he saw the object to the NorthEast of my location, and possibly higher since it was harder to see than the photo I’d sent him.  This guard advised me that he’d seen the object  for about 30 seconds before it  did a “J loop” and shot off to the Southeast.  This guard advised me that when the object left it appeared as if a shooting star or a comet, similar to the objects photographed and video-taped over  Salt Lake City between 09/15/17 and 09/17/17. I had work to do inside the building so I wasn’t able to observe the object after 0930.  When I was next able to check at approximately 1020, I could no longer see the object, apparently because it had moved to the north and east of my location.  This means the object remained in the sky over the valley for 4.5 hours. A little about my background.  I was a police officer for 9 years prior to becoming a security guard.  I also have a military background.  I do consider myself to be a trained observer with a lot of experience.  The other guards who witnessed have varying levels of experience, one has military experience, the others are experienced security officers and also trained observers.",2017-09-28T00:00:00,40.704464857813726,-111.88213884685625

I exit from the I 10 and I continue on the 347, a stretch of highway that enters into Maricopa City.  Between Riggs road and Maricopa city,  I will see these glowing lights in the sky directly above Maricopa or maybe further south but its in plain view as they are directly over the 347.  I am positive other drivers heading home can see them also. The 1st time I witnessed, it looked like a Military flare, this caused for me to take my eyes from the road to the horizon, but then the  orange color got brighter, hotter and pulsated. The light then disappears, a second later I saw that light to the east, it looked to be maybe over Queencreek?, the light was faint and then it started to glow brighter till it disappeard again. 2nd event was the day before Halloween, all the conditions are the same excepts the time was maybe 30 mins early around 730pm.  I saw the orange  fireball, but this time I can see it transfer a small amount of light into and another orange ball.  This went across a large portion of the sky till 5 orange balls were attached to each other. Maybe the length of a few miles, then all the lights together increased in brightness then went out. Tonight at @845pm I saw the same 5 lights off to the east they flashed and them disappeared. Most people never see anything  crazy in the sky.  I am now seeing them on the reg.

On 10-04-17, my daughter and I saw some strange lights in the sky and couldn't figure them out.  My daughter and I are both adults who enjoy watching the sky at night.  We are both detail oriented and I am a voracious reader. At approximately 6:10 AM, we were sitting on our covered patio.  It was still dark, the sky was clear, and stars were very visible.  The outside temperature was 51 degrees F.  We noticed a very bright ""star"" stationary in the southern sky and our first thought was that the north star should not be in the southern sky.  We located the north star, right where it should have been.  We then realized that the light in the sky was much brighter than the north star. We noticed that the light had begun moving in a westerly direction.  We have a lot of air traffic in our area, so we're familiar with the speed airliner lights appear to move in the night sky.  This light was moving faster than an airliner. All of a sudden the bright light winked out.  A few seconds later there were red and white blinking lights where the bright light had been.  The lights would move west, pause for a second or two, then move west again.  The lights paused and moved west 5 times.  After the final pause, the lights then began moving straight up.  They stopped long enough to blink twice, then began moving east at an even faster rate than the bright light had moved.  We followed the blinking lights for nearly a minute, then they disappeared. We have witnessed strange lights in the southern sky on several occasions over the last few years.  I finally decided to see if there could be an explanation for them. Summer of 2013, around the 4th of July, about 10 PM, I was on our patio, when I saw a bright light in the southern sky arc from the treeline.  It reached what would have been the apex of the arc and simply winked out.  Two seconds later another bright light followed the same trajectory from the treeline to the apex and winked out.  Two seconds after that a third bright light followed the same path as the other two and winked out. Initially, since it was fireworks season, I assumed they were just fireworks.  Then I realized that there was no noise, no flash, nothing.  The lights just winked out.  The lights were puzzling because fireworks, by their very nature, cannot maintain such precise trajectories, especially along an identical path.",2017-10-05T00:00:00,41.2279,-79.5465

I was standing alone looking up at the moon.  It was quiet except for the distant muffled sound of the freeway.  Suddenly, I heard an extremely loud, low pitched pulsing sound to my right.  As I turned towards it two very large, dark rectangular objects appeared abruptly over the nearby tree tops. They were identical.  Each one had a large red light and a few smaller white lights. Each was approximately the size of 2 RVS together.  There were no propellers.  I was standing in a wide open space and they flew right over it, lower than a helicopter would.  As soon as they passed over me, I ran into the shadows of the trees and waited for my heart to calm down.  I was shaken enough I needed to talk to someone and went to speak to a man who lives next door in a tiny house he has converted from a former MRI truck.  It weighs 34,000 pounds!  Why am I emphasizing the weight?  Because this man was on the phone with his mother when he heard a loud pulsing sound and his entire tiny house truck began to shake.  Not just vibrate, it shook.  He came out and we discussed it at length. My ex-husband served in the Marine Corps for 21 years.  I have lived on bases all over the world.

It was a clear night and an almost full moon, which was in the eastern sky.  What made this encounter interesting enough to report was not just the helicopter.   We are somewhat in the flight path of PDX and have planes flying over, so I know how fast they go.  When we went out, the helicopter was just flying over our house in a NNW direction.  In front of it, also flying NNW, was a small bright white light -- low on the horizon and flying VERY fast.  No sound could be heard other than the helicopter. Interestingly, there were two airplanes flying south higher then the light and the helicopter.  They had typical airplane lights and followed the normal flight pattern we usually see from planes flying over. Again, what was noteworthy about this experience was the speed and low altitude at which the white light was traveling, plus the military helicopter following it (I don't know if I would say pursuing it).  I don't know if the light was ET, but we would definitely call it a UFO because of the nature of the encounter.  Maybe something military?",2017-10-05T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

There were trees around the edge of the field and the city lights beyond that.  Suddenly we saw a disk like shape coming over the trees. Slow, no sound.

He suddenly said, ""Look up!"" as he leaned forward over the steering wheel.  When I leaned forward and looked up I saw what I estimated to be a dozen or so twinkling/blinking/phasing objects flying in a close V-formation.   He pulled over immediately, and I turned on my phone's camera to record video. (Due to technical error on my part, I missed recording most of the sighting.)  Initially, they were overhead.  I had difficulty understanding what I was seeing, as the twinkling was disorienting, especially that if one blinked out completely, it might reappear elsewhere suddenly.  They did not maintain formation for very long, due to the leap-frog-like blinking in and out.  (The objects both twinkled and blinked out completely.)  The color of the lights/ objects was a light amber color.  There was no sound beyond traffic (we were near an interstate on-ramp).  The shape was basically spherical. The twinkling sometimes gave the hint of an egg-shape, but I believe that to be an optical illusion. I witnessed the objects seeming to disappear and reappear from the V-formation, some of them failing to reappear.  They were moving from the western suburbs of Birmingham toward the city of Birmingham.  Eventually, the lights were either too far away to see or they had just disappeared.  I was able to get a fairly poor quality video (33 seconds of one or two of them in the distance) that demonstrates the ""twinkling.""  Sometimes the lights moved toward their destination before blinking out.  That's how I was able to comprehend they were reappearing elsewhere after they blinked out. My fiancé said he did not see as many ibjects as I did.  He saw about half as many, but he was driving in traffic, and I was completely focused on the sighting from the moment he pointed out lights in the sky. The objects were flying far too close together to be any manned craft of which I am aware.  Initially, I had assumed it was military exercise, then I thought it was helicopters.  Logically, it could not have been helicopters.  Not only was the light-color wrong for any aircraft I've seen, but - beyond Blue Angels, I've never seen aircraft fly so closely in formation. The number of lights dwindled to two, then one, and I lost sight.  I didn't get the impression that they were moving especially fast, but I don't know how low they were flying.  I had an overwhelming sense of disorientation which certainly contributed to guessing at their altitude.  They flew over radio towers, but before I saw that, I would have said they were flying very low overhead. To be clear, it was dark and I saw no physical objects beyond the lights.  I have spoken about them assuming that the twinkling was somehow a part of a physical object.  I can't conceive of how the twinkling wouldn't be attatched to a physical object of some sort.",2017-08-17T00:00:00,33.48091579651941,-86.77946934404284

I was located down by the big Darby Creek at the main park area (volley ball court, ranger station is located -- between Alkire and st. rt. 70).   While I was enjoying my hike down along the creek, I also just happened to look up in the sky and saw a slow approaching ""orange"" craft of sorts.  It approached from the southwest and directionally moving West toward the Dayton area (my own conclusion).  Naturally, I was trying to listen to it since it was a low flying, blurry-orange, circular craft of sorts,  The craft was approximately 200-feet above the tree tops.  Conversely, however, there was NO SOUND.  Speed was that of a commercial jet aircraft descending slowly in altitude just before a landing.   However, this craft just stayed at an even altitude just above the trees.  Just as it passed above me it kept flying straight, and then all of a sudden, it decided to ascend rapidly and silently at approximately a 65-degree angle.  The notable part was that it reached peak altitude (that of a typical jet) of approximately 37,000 to 40,000 feet within only a 5-second time frame -- YES, SILENTLY AND VERY VERY FAST!  This is the first time I've ever seen a craft like this.  As it ascended it also had a mysterious after glow in front of it, and directly behind it, hence the glowing effect with orange color.  Yes, it more or less freaked me out, but then again I still believe it to be terrestrial in nature (of the earth), and perhaps one of those little-hidden high-tech crafts ingeniously created out of some alien-type technology (area 51 stuff).   I have heard that Dayton's Write-Patterson air force base (about 50 miles away from Darby?) has some underground secrets, maybe that craft was one of them.  Yep, this sounds like just another nut-job trying to stir the mystical UFO pot, but I saw what I saw. I had a friend tell me that it was some small space debris burning up in our atmosphere, but I have to say this was not that.  It flew slowly, it had a purpose, and it flew exact and silent.  So I looked it up on youtube and low and behold I saw a craft(s) similar to what I saw -- wow.  Has anyone else on here ever seen such a craft?  I bet someone has.  Even if it's a clear night out (which it was when I saw it) it will still appear as though it's in a foggy cloud, hence, you cannot see any specific details other than a round orange shape, no sound, and definitely a flying craft. Take care. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2017-08-17T00:00:00,,

My friend and I were camping at Fort De Soto.  As we were sitting outside by the campfire, a strange mist started to fall (not quite rain, but definitely could be felt on the skin), we found it strange because there was not a cloud above us.   As we were looking towards the sky to try and find where this mist was coming from we noticed what initially looked to be a plane in the sky that had a strange flight pattern heading towards us.  It was too far away to see much so we thought that maybe it was a plane in distress.  We decided to run past the trees into a field to get a better unobstructed view of it. At this point it was probably two football fields distance away from us and about as high as a helicopter is when they are searching for people on the ground (it was quite low).  A few things became apparent as this was happening…  1.  Both my friend and I got goosebumps all over our bodies (including our cheeks) and the hairs on our bodies stood up at the exact same time.  2.  It was now close enough to see the shape and what jumped out at us first was that it was round in the front with a cigar shaped tail (definitely unlike any plane we'd ever seen before-it had no wings!)  3.  It had absolutely no sound coming from it other than a low hum, and  4.  It was blacker in color than the night sky. It had 4 round white lights around the front which quickly morphed into 1 bright center light and then morphed back into 4 individual lights, again.   It then made a sharp U-turn towards our left, went into some trees for about 5 seconds to where we couldn't see it, and came back out and over us again heading in the opposite direction, only now in an entirely different shape!  It was now in the shape of a 4 engine military looking plane (completely different from its original shape).   It proceeded to head in the opposite direction away from us and into the trees where we could no longer get a visual on it.  About 30 seconds later the mist was completely gone.  The whole incident probably only took about 2-3 minutes.",2017-08-17T00:00:00,27.79451493256262,-82.67515963391138

I noticed a very bright, relatively spherical, light hovering in the same spot for about 5 to 8 minutes due west.  It is difficult to say exactly where it was hovering, because I have no idea how large it actually was, so perhaps somewhere between Adelanto and Lancaster.   It was not especially high in the sky, appearing just over the view of the homes across the street from us, no higher than an average helicopter height, but it did not move at all like a helicopter, nor did it have any sound.  If it had been a helicopter it would have been closer to where we sat based on the perspective of its position and relative size to the homes and we would have heard a sound, seen its lights and the manner that it moved.   It began to slowly change directions and altitude getting higher and heading north. As it did, the light extended out looking more like a rocket's contrail; however you could faintly see a dark elongated shape in front of the contrail.  It did not accelerate quickly or move in an exaggerated way, rather it steadily gained altitude, steadily moved in a north-easterly direction, and the contrail continued to elongate and stayed quite bright almost white.  In other words although it resembled a rocket's contrail it never had a fiery look.  As it reached a zenith height of what I estimate to be approximately 10 to 15 miles its contrail began to fade until it simply faded out and vanished.  There were no clouds to obscure it, no darkness to cover it, it simply disappeared, but slowly as if it were erased bit by bit.   I know of no known rocket that can hover and then proceed to leave the atmosphere at such a relatively slow controlled pace, let alone disappear or fade out.",2017-08-11T00:00:00,34.520175916230365,-117.3407392670157

My friend and I were swimming at night and having a good time, while my dad was on the steps of my back porch, trying to replace a step.  We were talking, being slightly loud.  I looked behind some trees, over a few houses and saw two extremely bright lights, in the shape of car headlights.   For a few seconds, I brushed it off as an airplane type I had never seen before.  I calmly pointed at the aircraft, telling my friend to look.  When she turned around, the aircraft suddenly started moving to the right.  Not like a normal plane, it wasn't at a steady pace.  It looked like a car that was breaking down, but it was level to where it was before.  Then it started moving faster and faster to the right.  I screamed and told my dad and friend to get inside.   My friend and I struggled to get out of the pool, but I kept my eyes on the aircraft.  It turned to the side, the lights then faced away from me, and went behind some trees.  Two other lights, seemingly on the a! ircraft appeared.  They were purple and green, much smaller and nowhere near as bright as the lights before.  I waited for the aircraft to come out from the other side of the trees, but it didn't.  I kept a close eye on it.  My dad calmed us down, and we went back into the pool.   Jets and planes fly over my house a lot, but this one had an unfamiliar route and was too close to the ground to be an airplane trying to land, there were no airports close enough.  Jets in my area have a square light  formation, of white, red, and sometimes yellowish lights.  Planes, however, with my airport, typically have red and/or blue lights.  Pretty much any lights besides green and purple.  Not to mention, the two brightest lights on planes typically are on the front, and are white.   Yes, that matched the discription, but how exactly did the plane remain still, and move to the right when it's front was facing us?  If it was a plane, the lights on it's front would've been facing us, so I understand why it would appear still, but that doesn't really explain why it moved sideways, with no hesitation or normal movement of any other planes.   Anyway, we were back in the pool.  Trying to have a good time, and ignore what we saw.  I kept a close eye on the spot between the trees the entire time.  I turned to talk to my friend, then spun back around and saw the lights again... in the exact same spot.  I screamed my friend's name as I rushed out of the pool.  The aircraft did the exact same thing once again.   When I was talking to my dad about it, who was trying to convince me it wasn't a UFO, for my good night sleep's sake, I pointed behind him and there it was again.  It then, moved to the right, and disappeared behind the trees.   I feel as if we were being spied on.  Every time I pointed at it, or started screaming, it left, then returned when I wasn't looking.  It's incredible, but I've been followed by too many things like this.  Also, no noise followed it.  It was completely quiet.",2017-08-11T00:00:00,,

Being as how I live in the city it is very rare to see stars.  So when I recognize something that reminds me of a star I stare at it (I love stars.)  Every time I see an unidentified glowing object or “flying object"" I stare at them to make sure I’m not crazy and or to validate the realness.  I went out to smoke and I noticed the “star” I was looking at was indeed not a star.  And it was seemingly moving against the laws of physics. As if it could go through time or something.  As I noticed that one I had noticed 2 others doing the same thing.  These bluish glowing orbs were moving short distances at breakneck speeds.  I have noticed these same phenomena in the past.  Even having intelligent adults look in wonderment.  That is all that happened in this instance.  The other must tell story is about a year ago during the late summer to fall months.

I was drawn to the movement and although there were no lights, per se, there was a faint light emanating from it.

It seemed to be somewhat transparent, as I could see the clouds above it through the craft.  It was flying faster than a plane in a very smooth and unrestricted fashion unlike a plane which is kind of forcing its way through the atmosphere and is very loud.  This object was completely smooth and made no sound at all.  As it moved through the air it became more transparent until I couldn’t see it anymore.  The whole sighting only lasted about 5 seconds.

Same colored and shaped smaller lights continued to randomly hover in sparadic movements near orange light, until eventually speeding off in whatever directions or disappearing.  9/27 1am I see that large orange light is moving in circle formation and can also see an odd rectangular shape to light, or at a certain angle seemed like 2 lights determining shape to still be rectangular.  I have also noticed that orange light has rocket some small white light from top of light, and moving like a missle (straight in sky) has also left some sort! of chem trail looking cloud for a considerable distance about 5 seconds. At 3:55am I became uncomfortable and sit in a chair on the opposite side of the window, and notice a floating green, white, and blue light that was quickly spinning and moving sporadically different directions. 4:08 green light has now moved South West toward my home in a bobbing or jumping formation.  Light continues to weave forward and backward as if trying to hide behind clouds.  4:15am light is stationary every time I look at it, but within 2 secs begins to climb sky in much too fast a speed to be anything considered average.  These occurrences are extremely frequent here, and I have spotted them on average 6:7 times per week since 2014 along with many other different descriptions.  I can occasionally hear strange humming noise as well when lights come close enough, unlike any aircraft I have heard before.  9/27 absolutely zero stars out due to cloudy and overcast night.",2017-09-28T00:00:00,36.38391818181818,-121.84402222222222

At appx 9:47pm CDT, I was outside on our east facing porch, just watching for satellites and meteors, as I like to do on weekend nights like the one that night:  no clouds and no moon.   I was scanning the sky, when I saw an exceptionally bright light in the SSW sky appx 40 degrees above the horizon.  This light was as much as a magnitude brighter than the planet Venus at that planet's brightest.  This light was moving to the NE and likely took 2-3 minutes to cross from the point of first sighting until it crossed the whole of the sky before disappearing behind some trees to my ENE.   I then moved to another part of the yard and was able to watch the light past the trees until it was lost to sight on the far ENE horizon.  I believe that it passed to the north of both Antares, and then Saturn, but to the east of Altair.  I don't believe that it got any higher than maybe 50 degrees above the horizon, maybe less.  The light was silent the entire time.  The light was solid the e! ntire time, neither blinking nor dimming.  I say it was solid to say that it did not blink or waver.  But it was so bright that it caused it to be more of a Venus-like glare, rather than a simple point of light.  It only dimmed as any light does as it moved farther away into the distance. In a single sentence it was as if Venus was moving across the sky. Over the years I have seen dozens if not hundreds of satellites.  I have seen many that seem to appear from nowhere and become very bright before quickly dimming to nothing.  In the moments just after spotting this light and seeing that it was not blinking (like an airplane) I assumed that it must be a satellite and expected it to very soon dim.  It never did to any extent.  I also felt that it was moving erratically, slowing then speeding up and wavering very slightly from side to side.  I say this because it was what I felt I was seeing.  I can NOT say that I am certain it was acting oddly.  Realizing that this was like nothing I had seen before I went to the door and asked my wife to come outside. She agreed that it was much brighter than what we had seen before. Without my prodding she said that it seemed to be moving in the same odd manner that I have described. Another point I want to make is that we live appx 7-8 miles NE of Tulsa International Airport and see many low flying aircraft near our home either just after takeoff or turning west toward a landing.   Just as my wife was coming to the door, I began hearing sounds of an airplane, and started to feel that was the explanation.  But when I looked up I saw the airplane lights moving from the S to N but beginning a turn to the west that would take it behind our house towards the airport flight lanes.  The bright light in question was already well to the east. When the plane was lost to sight the sound went away.  Again I did not hear any sound that I would associate with the passing light.   There is a National Guard Center about 5-6 miles to our south and they house a number of military helicopters.  I have seen them flying in the area many times.  Later, I considered that if this were a helicopter, for its lights to have been that bright, it would have to be flying rather low, and I would certainly have heard that familiar chop chop sound. My wife and I also considered the idea that it could have been a drone of some kind.  I don't know much about them but will say that other than the possible side to side waver I was feeling, this light traveled in a very straight line from one end of the flight to when it disappeared on the far horizon. To me this was an object that I could not identify with any certainty and since it was moving, flying in the sky it was a UFO.  I EXPECT that you will determine that it was indeed likely a satellite.  I expect that you have satellite information at your disposal and you will end this mystery quickly.

From my prospective, they appeared to be glowing green orbs with a barely noticeable silver edge around one edge of the green glowing circle; as if a sliver of the side of the object was observable.  The silver part seemed solid like it was metal. It is clear that they were several miles away.  They were also very high up.  It was a hot hazy day with hazy clouds high in the sky.  The objects were clearly observed being obscured by the clouds at times.  The two orbs stayed the same distance from each other throughout the observation.  They moved much quicker than an airplane but the movement was steady; not jerking around like perhaps a laser pointer might look. The orbs were heading towards us and the closer they got, the more obvious the details became.  It also was more obvious that the objects were very high up.  Once overhead, my perception was that they were not very big, maybe the size of a car.  At no time did we hear any sound coming from them.

I had already cleared the city, and was well on my way through the back country of the US 60 when the siting occurred.  It was roughly 20:15 and the sun was still setting to the west.  However, to the east, the sky was already dark.   As I came around a bend on the highway, I glanced towards a dark empty part of the sky.   The bearing of my sight was roughly 120 degrees SSE.  I noticed a light in the sky that appeared to have a reddish orange glow.  Upon further inspection, I noticed this light was more of an orb positioned just over the horizon, but close enough to tell that it was not a star in the sky.   The orb was so odd looking that I could not focus on anything but the light, only taking my eyes off it to glance back at the road.  Having a background in aviation communications I was quick to make the judgement that this was not an anti-collision light of any sort and not an aircraft light that I had seen in the past.  The glow was almost incandescent as opposed to having an LED appearance.  The orb did not waver at all.  It held its position, and that’s what I found so odd about it.   About 15-20 seconds in, the orb shot out an additional orb to the east of it.  The second orb maintained the same position once it shot out from the first orb.  Both orbs now were the same exact size and luminosity.  If I were to guess they were about 100 feet away from each other in the sky.   It was also apparent that the second orb traveled from the first orb to its position because a slight tracer of light was visible; the second orb did not just appear.  It traveled from the first orb to its position.  At this point, there were two identical orbs in the sky and just as I thought that was crazy enough, a third orb shot out from the second orb.  Now 3 identical orbs maintained their positions in the sky.  They did not move or flicker.   Roughly 10-15 seconds after that, they all disappeared rather quick, almost as if they quickly! faded, but it was hard to tell.

Around 3PM to 3:15 PM on 8/11/2017, I was watching lightning from outside a casino in North Las Vegas. I noticed in the SW a tiny black dot slowly going upward a little to the left and right.  I thought it was a Mylar balloon that someone had let go of. Then it just stopped mid air, and then it started moving NE slowly just outside a storm cell I was watching.  It appeared to be entering just inside and outside of the Cloud Cell. As it got closer, it appeared to be just near Stratosphere Casino but much higher in the sky like ½ mile higher in the sky.  It was well defined at this point, black, flat on the bottom with a small point on the top center of it. At around Stratosphere Casino, it stopped again, and then started increasing speed, and in a matter of maybe 3 to 4 seconds, it went from Stratosphere Casino, to just left of Nellis AFB.  It looked like it was on a collision course with the mountains, when I lost sight of it as it went under my line of site as trees were to the East of me and the mountains. I heard no noise, no sonic booms, and did not hear any impact and did not see any visible signs of debris flying up as if it impacted something. From my vantage point, I can see Stratosphere to Nellis AFB, I guess that’s maybe what 25 miles between the two of them?

It was traveling much faster than the fighter jets that pass by here every day.

When I walked out side and went behind our shop I saw a ring of lights that appeared to go around this extremely large dark object,  The lights flashed one at a time and went around the object clockwise.  What really was amazing was the size, it seemed to take up a third of the western sky.   The other thing that we noticed was the noise it was producing,  It sounded like a steady thrum and was vibrating things around us.   It slowly moved of to the west and faded from sight.  The sky was fairly dark due to smoke from fire and the light was subdued from the smoke.  Stars were visible were the object wasn't but we were awed by the area it occupied.

On 08/02/2017, at approximately 1143 pm, I went outside my house to turn my sprinkler off for the night.  After I had done so I could hear a very loud hum.  I looked to the sky facing southwest and I could see 20 to 25 white lights going in a clockwise motion across the sky.  The lights were attached to something very large and were blinking in the clockwise sequence around an object.   The area that these lights covered took up most of the horizon.  The area around the lights was totally blacked out, you could see no stars or the moon at all.   While I watched the object and lights, it did not appear to be moving.  If it was moving it appeared to be doing so very slowly.  The loud humming sound was definitely coming from the direction of the lights.  It was a very odd sound, not like an airplane.  The sound was more like a pulsing hum, but very loud.  In fact, you could feel the vibration from the sound.   After watching the object for a couple of minutes, I ran and got my Dad out of bed so he could see this as well.  My dad brought his cell phone with him so we could try to film this. I have uploaded that video to youtube.  My dad also was able to witness the object as well.   We watched this thing for another minute or two as it began to travel to the Northwest away from us.  We were able to see the lights still going in a clockwise sequence around the object until it faded out of our view.   The youtube video, which is too dark for me to see anything, is more of an audio clip, if the volume is up you can hear the hum though.

I was watching television in my family room when I noticed some strange, bright red orange lights in the distance.  I went out on my patio to see what they were. I then saw four glowing somewhat egg shaped orbs move into a formation of two in a row over the other two and hover.   As I watched, another one began to rise from a little further west, and slowly move into the same area as the other four began to move away, in single file.  Several more followed suit, and there were probably at least ten of them in all. The objects made no noise, and the entire body of them glowed red orange.  The top of the orbs gave somewhat of a handle look over the lower part.  The tops were lighter in color and a little blurrier than the lower parts.  I could not see any flashing lights, or obvious external lights. The objects flew off in a slight ""S"" pattern, first coming from the west, then stopping and hovering, and then flying northwest, and finally north.  They appeared to be moving very slowly and gracefully, but in a matter of seconds, the lights became very tiny, seeming to have moved fast, though it didn't seem so.  Very odd. I lost sight of the objects when they just disappeared.  It was like a candle being blown out, not darting away or a sudden light going out.  They dimmed and went out.  The entire event was probably less than 5 minutes and I didn't have time to grab a camera.  Just before the last of the objects moved out of view, a small plane began heading in their direction. I could barely hear its engine.  The objects, however, made no sound.  The plane had blinking lights, whereas the objects appeared to be glowing, orb like things, with no external lights detectable.  I live near the Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, so I am used to seeing all kinds of aircraft.  These things were not planes, helicopters, or drones.",2017-08-04T00:00:00,,

My Mom lives in Lincoln, WA, sometimes shown as Creston, Wa, on the web.  We are about half a mile from a boat launch on Lake Roosevelt.   My mom and I were watching tv at 23:55 or 11:55pm, when my step dad walks inside the house from the porch.  He says to my mom, “Come listen to this noise, I have never heard anything like it.”   So my mom goes outside with him on the porch.  I do not follow him at first because he was so calm.  Then my mom opens the door and frantically calls out to me, “Come out here as fast as you can!”   I run out to the porch and instantly see this long string of lights in the sky, and there is this loud, ominous, deep vibrating sound that I can feel vibrating though my feet on the deck.  The only way I would be able to describe this sound would be if there was a giant wine glass with a mile wide rim, and a wet finger continuously rubbing along the rim to make this deep low hum. The string of lights are white and flashing or pulsating in what appeared to be a sequence running around the perimeter of a disk.  We could not see the definite outline of the craft because it was dark and also very smoky from recent fires.  But we could tell by the pattern that the lights were moving that it was most likely a disk or ring shape.  The craft looked like it was about a mile long, and maybe 1,000 feet above lake Roosevelt.   We first saw the craft to the east, moving very very slowly.  Its path appeared to be following the curves of lake Roosevelt, headed north, then north west.  We could still hear the hum or vibration from the craft about three or four minutes after it was out of view.  I was in such shock that I could not stop crying my eyes out.   My mom tried to calm me down by reminding me that the day before this event, or maybe two days before, the local news station gave a statement from the local air force base, Fairchild Air Force Base, saying that people should expect to see strange aircraft maybe even foreign crafts.  But the broadcast was almost in a joking manner.   This changed my mood from scared and sad to scared and mad.  If this was indeed secret military aircraft, how dare they mock our fear when we discover their dark secret of bizarre advanced technology.

It looked exactly like it was made from some sort of metal, reflecting the bright sunlight.  It looked to be about 20-30 feet above us--relatively close, not off in the distance. I would describe it as a small craft--3 feet wide at most.  It didn’t seem to move, just float. Most certainly NOT a drone.  We both saw the object very clearly, before it disappeared in a second or two.   We immediately pulled the car over and got out, but it was nowhere to be seen.  It was there one second and gone the next.  Either moving too quickly for the human eye to see, cloaking itself, or disappearing completely from that spot. I’ve seen several things out of the ordinary in the desert sky, but nothing as clear as this.   There is no doubt in my mind that the object we saw is not from Earth.  Both myself and the other observer have excellent eyesight, open minds, and are very good a picking up on details that others often overlook.  I believe we were both looking in the right direction at the right time and ended up witnessing something that was hiding in plain sight.

On the night of July 22nd, 2017, around 2215 hours, I was a gunner on a .50 Cal machine gun on a Stryker armored vehicle, supporting a platoon live fire training event on a Polish military range just outside Bemowo Piskie.  We had pull off to the side of one of the roads leading into the range waiting for a call to provide support.  What happened next, I cannot explain.  While adjusting my night time optics which consisted of a PSQ-20 mono style helmet mounted thermal and night vision device, a ball like light appeared in the night vision setting currently set on my optic.  The object appeared just atop the tree line possibly 700 meters to my exact front, however since my optic only covers one eye my depth proception was off and an exact distance is very hard to gauge.  The ball appeared to what could have been maybe 10 feet across and the light it was giving off in my night vision optics was blinding.  But despite all this, that’s not the strange part.  What got me was that when I closed my optic aided eye to look with my unaided eye, this object was completely invisible against the clear night sky.  I was baffled that I couldn’t see this bright light that had just blinded me with my naked eye and looked through my optic again.  The object was still there but the intensity of the light had dimmed.  It hovered in the break of the tree line for about 90 seconds before it began to descend to the left slowly.   Now when all this was going on I had simply figured that this was just an infrared flare on a parachute fired from one of the mortar teams that were training that same night.  But when the ball of light finally dipped below the tree line and faded out of site, a second object of the same description appeared in the same break in the trees.  At this point I flipped my optics over to their thermal setting and observed.  The object was ball shaped again and was bright red hot in my thermals.  I changed over to night vison again.  Once again, the object was blinding bright.  And when I closed my optic covered eye to observe with my unaided eye, the object couldn’t be see. 	When IR motors are fired they go up and release their flare at about a thousand feet and begin to float down to earth.  However, while these flares are meant to give off intense illumination viewable through night vison they also have a dull red visible light that can be seen with the naked eye simply for the purposes of being able to track where the flare is drifting. 	The objects I was witnessing gave off no visible light, nor did I hear any mortars being fired.  And trust me even if the mortar is a distance away, they a very audible.  The now second ball of light seem to follow the same flight path as the first object that I had seen.  It hovered in place for about 90 second in place.  I felt like it was watching me, observing my weapons and my armored vehicle.  After 90 seconds, it began to descend down to the left just as the first.  Then it vanished.  “It must have been a flare” I thought to myself.  It was gone for only a moment when from behind the trees it rose directly up, not violently, but by no means was it slow.  This was the moment I knew that it was not man made.  Once again it hovered above the tree line.  It had to have been watching all the military activity in the area.  Without warning like when the first object appeared its brightness in my night vison increased dramatically.  To a point where it felt like someone was shining an IR l! aser in my night vison.  Then after the intense brightness it vanished.  I would only see the one object leave I cannot account for what happened to the other object I witnessed. 	I’ve served as a scout in the army for over three years now.  One of the fundamentals of reconnaissance is to report all information rapidly and accurately.  When all this was going on, I took note of my surroundings.  There was no disruption to my equipment and radios, my weapons were functioning and in good shape.  The surrounding wild life wasn’t disturbed and other than wracked nerves I felt ok.  I decided to keep quiet about my entire experience.  How could I explain to my Sergant that I had witnessed multiple objects only visible to thermals and the IR spectrum but was invisible to the naked eye.  I’m charged with several million dollars of government equipment and weapons, they would have lost confidence in me.  This is why I’m reporting this to you.  I want someone to listen to my story and tell me what it was I was witnessing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD)",2017-08-24T00:00:00,,

Reporting an UFO sighting on July 24, 2017 around 3:00 am. On July 24, 2017, both my wife and I woke up around 2:30 am with loud thunders from lightning.  As we tried to sleep, we heard a few more thunders around the Drummond North area.   Then, suddenly, we heard a loud sound and the intensity of that sound was increasing and decreasing periodically with a time period of 2 or 3 seconds.  Our ears were able to detect that periodic nature of the sound.  Then a bright orange beam of light entered our room through a window.  The intensity of that orange light became brighter and darker in synchronization with ups and downs of the loudness of the sound.  As this event was unfolding, we both thought that lightning might have started fire at a power transformer somewhere.  So, I asked my wife to call 911, and I ran to the window. After removing the curtain of a window, I saw that a cylindrical structure hanging between our house and a neighbor’s house at a height of about 40 to 50 feet above my window.  The approximate size of that cylindrical structure could be about 5 feet in height and 2 feet in diameter.  That structure was generating both the sound and the light beams, and their intensities were modulated synchronously.  The sound had the characteristics of running a huge blower whose speed was changing periodically in a very controlled manner.  The light was so intense that at its peak value that I was getting blinded by it.  Our backward was lighted up as if the sun’s rays on a clear midday have become orange and pulsing. As I tried to look directly at that cylindrical surface, I could only see some window-like features on that structure when the light intensity was low.  The beam of light was practically coming from all over the structure.  Instead of calling 911, my wife was so puzzled by the event that she unknowingly ran to another window and witnessed that bewildering event. Suddenly, the whole thing stopped.  That cylindrical structure just disappeared in front of my eyes, and the world around us appeared to be the same as before.  Approximately, whole event took probably between 15 to 20 seconds to unfold. I realized later that while that event was progressing, not a single dog barked in our area. We do not have a dog, but all of our neighbors do, and their dogs will bark even if a moderately loud car enters our area at night. In the morning when I was looking up and tried to identify the area where I saw that cylindrical structure, I realized that there is no electrical or any other overhead line has gone through that area or close to that area.  The trees around that area have no burning sign, at all.   As if nothing has happened last night.",2017-07-27T00:00:00,39.65195779310345,-75.71214262068966

On July 25th, 2017, at approximately 2:20am, I went out on our back deck to smoke a cigarette. I went to the far end of the deck which faces east.  As I looked toward the tree line I noticed a strange multicolored light.  I was intrigued by the light so I continued to look at it.  I soon realized that the light was moving erratically.  Unsure I continued to watch. It began to move well above the tree line still moving up, down, side to side, and even in circular motions. I was awe struck, and knew no one would believe what I was seeing, so I went and woke my niece.  She witnessed the object, but went back to bed.  I was too captivated to stop watching. Not long after I seen the first object, I noticed that there was another moving light in the sky.  Both moving in the same manner with the same red, green, and white flashing lights.  Before long I had spotted five of these objects.  None of which could have been of natural occurrence. Around 4:18am one of these strange lights appeared just  on the other side of the tree line.  This one seemed very close.  It's light was a steady white, and it's movement was the same as the other objects.  It appeared so close that I went inside and grabbed a flashlight.  I could be mistaken, but it seemed as though the light would respond to the blinking of the flash light. At one point I counted as many as 11 of these lights, two of which seemed to inspect passing airplanes by approaching them closely. Something else that was strange during this event was that I witnessed what I believe to have been a total of nine meteors, but given what I witnessed and the way these lights would appear, I am unsure if they were meteors, or the objects joining the others. I am certain that someone else had to see the near, low flying, object I mentioned, because it hoovered above a state highway just behind our home.  It was too low, bright, and moving in such a manner to be mistaken for a star, and I could hear morning work traffic on the highway. This is true and accurate as I can tell it.  My witness will confirm the sighting of the first object.  This event took place for nearly three hours.",2017-07-27T00:00:00,38.9273,-90.8819

When they stopped appearing, the halo was gone, and it started getting cloudy.

The spheres did not leave any kind of trail, and would sometimes zig-zag their flight paths. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello again. I just spoke to someone at the NWS who stated a couple of things.  There was a high Cirrus overcast (I assume thats what was causing the halo around the sun), and lower sparse clouds moving in another direction.  I can’t tell you the exact altitude of the orbs/lights I saw, but they seemed to be a bit higher than the lower clouds.  Also, I don’t think I made it clear that the objects were not just in one spot in the sky like a flightpath or a line, but rather spread out in the entire sky, and as far as I could see.  They were just as visible from a distance, or directly above me.  If this was a weather phenomena, then what a sight!  Very cool indeed!

I am a 56 year old female, with two years of college education and I have worked in county government for 36 years.  My friend is 57 years old and an elementary school teacher.  She has a Bachelor’s and two Master’s degrees in the field of education.  Her husband is 72 years old and retired.  He Is a US Navy veteran of the Vietnam War, is also a college graduate.  He returned to this area and retired from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.  We are all from Fulton County originally and have lived in this area most of our lives. We were enjoying an evening campfire on their property which is located approximately 2 ½ miles southwest of Lewistown, IL.  Around 8:30 pm, I was kicked back in a zero gravity chair, when I noticed a mostly red light moving horizontally across the sky.  The way we were sitting, my friends had their backs to it, and so, I immediately started yelling for them to look!  We like to go to this same spot to enjoy the yearly Perseid or Leonid meteor showers and at first, I thought we were being treated to a rather large random meteor.  However, that was not the case.  It continued to move slowly across the sky in a southwest to northeast direction.  While we were focused on it as it moved away from us, I noticed another one coming from the same area!  It was the same thing, a solid, mostly red light, moving slowly and in a southwest to northeasterly direction.  When I say mostly red, it is because it did appear to have some white with it or around it.  My friend was able to get ! some video of it using her iPhone. Needless to say, this sparked some very lively discussion for a while as we speculated on a possible explanation for them.  There was no noise of any kind associated with them, they were not huge and we guessed they were flying at 500’ or less.  We almost immediately thought of them as drones of some sort, but, then wondered about the logistics and legalities of flying them at night?  We also thought it might be some sort of study being conducted by the Department of Natural Resources or some other such agency, perhaps studying animal activity at night?  Along those lines, we concluded that they were traversing the area in a grid like pattern.  We came to that conclusion because the trailing one, while appearing to follow the first, was offset, so to speak, flying at the same altitude, but, parallel to the first and not directly behind it. We were still in the same location, I was again kicked back in the zero gravity lawn chair and at 9:20 or so, when another one appeared!!  Same size, same color, everything.  It was much farther offset than the first two, but, traveling in the same general direction and at the same altitude and speed as the first two.  We waited and watched the sky for quite some time, thinking another “trailer” might be behind it, but, we didn’t see anymore.  We wondered, if perhaps, we had missed the lead one and the one we saw this time was the second one?  Again, there was no noise associated with it, nothing that would have made you look up, I just happened to be looking up. All three of them just moved steadily across the sky until they appeared to blink in and out until you couldn’t see them anymore.  We didn’t feel like they “disappeared.”  It was more like, they just got far away and probably went behind the cloud cover.  We left probably 40 minutes after the second sighting and went back to town.  None of us had seen anything like them before.",2017-09-05T00:00:00,40.3804,-90.13289999999999

The sky was mostly clear with a few stray clouds and contrails, with no thunderstorm activity within a hundred miles of the area.   At approximately 21:40 on 12 August, 2017, I observed a bright white flash of light in the north, northeast portion of the sky at approximately 45 degrees.    It appeared as if a star had flashed on and off and the size comparison of the light was the same if not marginally larger than a star.   As I continued to look in the sky I observed a couple of more flashes over the course of a minute, or so.  I walked back into the house and told my wife what I had seen.  I asked her and my 3 children to join me on the front porch to see if it continued and, if possible, to record and hypothesize what it could be.   At approximately 21:45 the light flashes had moved from the original point in the sky to nearly directly ov! erhead.  As we watched the flashes continued in intervals of several seconds.  A couple of the flashes appeared as strobes or camera flashes.  At one point a streak of light appeared in what I could only explain as a bluish white laser or fluorescent bulb in the sky in the same vicinity.  The entire event lasted only about six or seven minutes from start to finish.   My twelve year old tried to record our observations, but nothing of substance, other than our conversation about what we were seeing, was on the video. This is not the first time that I had observed an occurrence like this.  Approximately a year ago in the same general area and the same time of year, I saw what appeared as a star flashing on and off every few seconds.  A short time before this I saw a similar event take place on the southwest horizon from our property.  Researching several videos on the internet to find a reasonable explanation for what I had witnessed, here is what I found:  1.  	Iridium flare – While a solid hypothesis at first, upon reviewing videos online and reading the description of what it is and how this appears, this does not look at all like what we witnessed.  The flashes we witnessed were brighter, crisper, and strobed, while the iridium flare “warmed up and cooled down” over the course of a few seconds.  The lights we saw literally were like camera flashes. 2.	  Air traffic – We witnessed several air craft traversing the sky while this was occurring, and since we are in the flight path of traffic in and out of Nashville International Airport, it was another good hypothesis.  However, the aircraft lighting, many of which are now LED, did not appear the same as the lights we saw nor did they have the same characteristics as the lights we observed. 3.	  Lightning – There was no lightning in the area, and no thunderstorm activity.  The sky was mostly clear and mild with good visibility. 4.  	Meteor – While this was the reason that I was outside watching the sky in the first place, this was not meteor activity.  The flashes were predictable and were easily distinguishable from meteors. As I continued to research other UFO reporting sites, I came across a few others who observed similar flashes.  These reports were from Michigan and Louisiana.  Interestingly, the location where we saw the lights is nearly at (within a thousand feet of) the line of totality for the upcoming eclipse.  Coincidence or not, this was very strange.   We are very curious to know what this was and to know if more saw the same thing.  Meanwhile, we will continue to watch the sky for more examples of this, and will report our findings.",2017-08-17T00:00:00,36.4948,-86.5969

Multiple flashes of light of varying intensities and duration in random locations overhead,La Rue,OH,2017-08-10T22:30:00,flash,4 minutes,"Occurred : 8/10/2017 22:30  (Entered as : 081017 22:30) Reported: 8/11/2017 12:38:03 AM 00:38 Posted: 8/11/2017 Location: La Rue, OH Shape: Flash Duration:4 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/135/S135649.html,"Multiple flashes of light of varying intensities and duration in random locations overhead (The first 4 seconds of the video are stars.)  I have an extensive aviation and aerospace background enough to know the differences in airborne craft and their flight peculiarities, if any. I was a pilot in the past.  I know all about Wright-Patterson as per Roswell, as my gramps used to work there in the 1950's-1980's.  I know what satellites and space junk in orbit look like, too.  This is not a spent Soviet rocket booster. I've seen this thing in multiple states since around 2012 at least.  It makes no sound.  This thing follows no linear path and has only one light that shines and/or flashes at irregular intervals at varying intensities.  The flashes look like fireflys as the flashes occur in random positions, but are much too bright, and I can tell they are way higher up than firefly altitude. Often, the light flashes bright-enough to rival Venus or Sirius, or perhaps even brighter. If it were a small, kit aircraft, it would have to be low enough to be able to hear, like around 5000' AGL.  If a small kit aircraft managed to get up to 14000' or higher, air would run thin. Maybe the pilot is on oxygen.  But at those altitudes the angular separation between each flash is far enough apart, that speed required to be in the following flash position would greatly exceed that of a single-engine prop. There is no reason why some pilot would be up above this country area in rural Ohio with no wingtip navigation (green/red) lights (against FAA regulations) flashing a single light in a strange manner. I thought it may be an experimental military craft, or some kind of exercise going on, as often when I see this thing, there is a commercial airliner nearby at cruising altitude (above 18000').  But I have seen these flashes with multiple witnesses who multiple times from coast to coast for about the last seven or eight years, often in parts of the country where there are no fireflys. I will edit a video of this, also. I suspect that I will be able to film them again soon. I am almost scared to admit to the general public that I believe I can see the flash and ""talk"" to it.  I will say ""can I see another, please?"" and it will flash brightly. I wait ten or fifteen seconds and I say ""gimmie another one!"" and it will flash again very brightly right after I ask. I sh*t you not. I am of very scientific mind and I don't generally believe in such a thing, so it is kind of concerning me that I seem to be able to request a flash, and then have it shine or flash very brightly.  It's kinda creeping me out. Like I said, I will try to do this more in the future.  This is the first time I have filmed it on hi-def or at all for that matter, and the first time I have ever had a camera good enough to even film anything at night, and I hope to improve my filming skills in the coming nights. I have seen it so many times over the years and made it flash by asking, that I am pretty sure I can get the same result again.  As I was filming this, I held the camera still as possible. I zoomed in 50% at some point about half-way through and left it there.  Only once did I quickly move it a few degrees to show an airliner as you can hear me say on the video.  I moved it back to the general vicinity.  So if you see a flash in the bottom right corner, for instance, and then one in the center, this is not due to me moving the camera.  The flashes actually occurred in separate spots relative to each other. Some flashes were quite faint, others were longer than a flash, increasing in brightness slowly over the course of a couple seconds, peaking in brightness, and then slowly dropping off.  Some moved when flashing slowly.  Others were stationary quick flashes.  The next flash would be very bright and quick, for instance.  Each flash was somewhat different.  When you hear me say, there's a bright one, the camera did not do it justice.  It was actually much brighter than the camera reveals. My guess is maybe a drone(s), or perhaps it is above the atmosphere (over 100km), which would make it huge, and fast.  I'm not sure of the altitude.  If I had to bet my life on it, I would guess between 20000'-50000' AGL maybe?  But it certainly could have been at orbital altitude, even. I'm not sure. Maybe it's a drone that can listen in through a cellphone, to explain why it flashes when I ask it to?  Maybe just some government employees messing with me, maybe? :D  I've been tricked before on more than one occasion by perspective regarding UFOs, so I believe I am more careful to discern this, these days.  I'm not saying it's ETs or anything, I'm saying I don't have a clue and I want to know.  I will search for similar sightings by others after typing this. Thanks.",2017-08-11T00:00:00,40.6072,-83.3701

It immediately grabbed my attention.  I traced the object across the sky for over 10 minutes.  It moved in an irregular pathway at an inconsistent speed, flashing at irregular intervals.  Sometimes it appeared to stay in one place for a few seconds.  Some flashes were very bright—brighter than a satellite or planet, some flashes were very faint, and many of the flashes were brighter than the stars and comparable with a planet or satellite.  All the flashes were white light and of varying durations, the longest being about half a second.  The flashing object moved in an unpredictable, zig-zag pathway across the sky, moving from the Northeast towards the West/Northwest.  After about 10 t! o 15 minutes, I lost it through the trees.

Its irregular speed and pathway rules out the possibility of it being an orbiting satellite or high flying aircraft.  No civilian aircraft or space craft could fly like that.  I do not believe it was any space debris falling back down to earth, as it would have left a trail and been a consistent glow.  I suppose it could have been some piece of highly-reflective material being tossed around in the upper atmosphere (but what and how did it get there?).  There’s no way it was a coincidental set of meteors. Something that is also possibly related.  Around 9:30 PM, my cat went completely nuts.  Chasing none existent beings around the room like she went crazy.  As soon as I opened the door to go outside and look for meteors, she abruptly burst outside and ran around the yard.  A few minutes after I had lost sight of the object, she ran up to the door perfectly normal again. I am a person of science, but I cannot logically explain what I saw to any degree of certainty.  The entire event freaked me out, along with two other co-witnesses.  None of my colleagues have believed my account of what I saw.  I know what I saw, and I know it was not normal or something that will be easy to throw aside.  I know that this was in the most literal sense: an Unidentified Flying Object.",2017-08-24T00:00:00,,
Bright repetitive flashes during 2017 Perseid meteor showers.,Grass Valley,CA,2017-08-13T22:00:00,flash,1.5 hours,"Occurred : 8/13/2017 22:00  (Entered as : 08/13/2017 22:00) Reported: 8/18/2017 11:37:45 AM 11:37 Posted: 8/24/2017 Location: Grass Valley, CA Shape: Flash Duration:1.5 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/135/S135774.html,"Bright repetitive flashes during 2017 Perseid meteor showers. Following a similar sighting on the previous evening of Saturday, August 12, 2017, I accepted an invitation on Sunday, August 13, 2017, from a former pastor friend and his wife to have dinner and then go outside and watch the Perseid meteor showers before the moon rose.  After seeing a couple of very large ones, at about 10:00 PM the 3 of us witnessed a very similar repeat of the bright blue-white flash event at the same elevation and direction as I’d seen the previous night (as reported separately).  This was also followed by perhaps 6 or 7 less intense flashes at irregular intervals, but their location kept randomly shifting slightly to the left or up or down.  As the flashes became fainter, they moved slowly down and to the ESE for a considerable distance, finally becoming too faint to follow although by this time my pastor friend was tracking them with binoculars trying to see any detail (to no avail).  My friends then told me that they’d seen similar fl! ashes in the same location at about the same time the night before. Then, at around 11:30 PM there was a reoccurrence of the flash at exactly the same position in the sky and just as brightly, followed by a couple of irregular but fainter ones, all with no apparent change in position and this time not followed by the receding movement of fainter flashes. After solidly dismissing the idea of any sort of aircraft we speculated that it might be flashes from a reflective panel on a rotating satellite or space station.  But the irregularity of the flashes and the extreme brightness of the initial flash or two seemed to discount any sort of regular rotational cause.  It left us clueless but not at all alarmed, thinking it might just be some sort of optical illusion that would find explanation later.  But there was no mention of any similar sighting in Monday’s local newspaper. My companions have an amateur interest in astronomy and night sky viewing.  My own background includes a lifetime amateur interest in the biological sciences, and later in the hard sciences (esp. quantum physics, astrophysics, cosmology, topology, etc.), but not UFO’s.  Since 1965 have been a professional fine woodworker (luthier), spec. stringed musical instruments, involving fine measurements, close tolerances, good observational skills, and a good ear.

My parents have lived in that house for the past 21 years, and I grew up there, these were NOT normal lights.  So, I immediately told my husband to look, and we quickly drove down the street to investigate the right/yellow blinking, yet stationary lights. That's when I took the first picture, it was too dark for my iPhone to get a good picture, so I circled the 3 dots in red because my phone couldn't focus.  We decided to go home the long way so we could follow the UFOs, we made it just down John Dodd Rd out of my parents neighborhood and we BOTH saw a white colored lighted object fall out of the bottom of the red/yellow blinking object.  We were flabbergasted!  We drove a little further and parked at the intersection of John Dodd Rd and New Cut Rd where I took the next picture and video that I attached. The red/yellow blinking objects were now coming very far apart in a single file path following one another.  They were headed West towards us, then the one coming closest dropped out another white lighted object out of the bottom, then waited a second and dropped another, it then turn right, and started heading N..  As soon as it began heading N, it disappeared from our sight VERY quickly. It was followed by 4 other red/yellow blinking UFOs.  They all followed the same path, and as soon as they all began to head N they disappeared so fast, but only the first one we saw after we stopped at the intersection dropped out two lit objects. As they were headed towards us, which was west, so we were looking east, they did not seem to be moving fast at all, and they definitely had the ability to hover in a stationary position as when we first saw them, and then they were stationary momentarily as they dropped things out of the bottom of their ship. It should also be noted that a jet flew above us during the sighting and was MUCH higher in the air than these objects were. I wouldn't put it past the government to be testing some random aerospace stuff, but the part that is seriously throwing us for a loop were the following things: 1 - Stationary first 2- Glowing objects released from the bottom 3 - Speed in which they disappeared after turning N, because they were not moving that quickly as they were headed west towards us 4 - They were fairly low to the ground, way below the jet that flew above us. I would be glad to answer any more questions that you may have.  Thanks for listening.  This is my second UFO sighting in my lifetime of 31 years, the other was in the Austrian Alps when I was 15 with my best friend, but we were young and never reported it.

By the time I got off and flipped around at state St. they where gone.  They all had a depth to the lights as opposed to being just firefly's or aircraft.  The lights did not flicker or change color.

I looked up to check out the full moon and over the next block I saw a brightly lit object moving overhead. (My house faces east and there are tall trees with two-story houses on the next block.  I have a clear view of the sky in front of my house about 3 properties wide on the other side.  I am located in the center of a small town about 2-3 miles wide)  It was completely calm out with no wind or clouds and there was no noticeable noise coming from the object.  The object was brightly lit, about 1-200 feet up and moving over the houses on the next block.  I continued to watch its movement and noticed another similarly lit object that cleared the tree line into my view a few seconds later.  It had the same bright redish/orange light and was following in the same line as the first object.  This continued for a few minutes with multiple objects (6 or so) coming into view and spread apart a few seconds.  The objects travelled in this straight line formation from south to north, turned east heading away from me, and then travelled another few seconds to turn north and moved out of my sight. During this group of objects, I heard my son coming down the stairs in the house so I called him out to see it.  The temperature was cool and we had all the doors/windows open in the house.  He thought it was weird and started getting all panicky since he didn’t know what it was. There was break of about a minute or two and we thought it was over.  Then another bright object cleared the trees from the south in the same line as the original group.  Over the next few minutes we saw another “group” of 6 or so objects travel the same path from south to north, make a turn to the east and turn north out of our view.  There was a break of another minute or two and a third group of 6 or so objects followed the same pattern.  After the third group, we waited 5-10 minutes but there was no reoccurrence of these objects. I have no idea what these were and I have not witnessed any similar event in the past.  15 to 20 brightly lit objects, in 3 groups travelling in the same formation, on the same path with multiple turns.

I'm a 59-year old male pharmaceutical scientist, living just north of Indianapolis, Indiana.  My daughter is 20 years old and is a student at Ball State University, living at home this summer.   On Saturday August 12 we drove about 10 miles north of our house to get away away from city lights and watch the Perseid meteor shower.  We ended up in Rosston, on East 100 North about a mile east of US 421.  It's a gravel road.  We arrived about 10:30 pm and set up chairs on the south side of the road, facing north. Over the next 2 hours we saw about 2 dozen shooting stars.  At about 12:30 am (Sunday, August 13) I noticed a faint point of light to the north of us, about 60 degrees up from the northern horizon, traveling slowly south.  It was white and didn't blink.  I was watching it trying to think of what it might be when my daughter pointed it out to me, so she'd noticed it independently.  After watching it for another 20-30 seconds, a strange thing happened.  An image began to appear over it.  It went from invisible to brightly lit over the course of about 5 seconds, was at full brightness for about 5 seconds, and then faded back to invisibility over the course of about 5 seconds.  When I could no longer see the image, I could still see the faint dot which continued to travel slowly south. The image that appeared was shaped like a traditional 4-sided kite, but with the top and bottom truncated.  I could clearly see the left and right borders, but couldn't see a border on the top or bottom.  The left and right borders were brightly lit with white light along their edges, and the area between the borders was illuminated with white light, but not as brightly.  The light filling the area of the shape stayed within the area, it didn't appear to bleed beyond its imputed borders on the top or bottom.  The left and right sides were mirror images of each other, making this symmetrical and giving me the impression of an orderly structure to the object.  If you hold your hand out to arm's length and put your thumb and forefinger about half and inch apart, that's how big the image looked to me. My daughter saw it a little differently.  She also saw the object appear and get brighter, stay at maximum brightness, and then fade, and for the same length of time.  However, she didn't see the structure I did, which surprised me because I saw it clearly.  In addition, after the object was no longer visible and I'd just lost track of the faint white dot that started this story, she suddenly got agitated and started describing to me what she was seeing.  As she describes it, about 30 seconds after the lighted object had faded to nothingness and she was watching the faint white light, she saw a second dot of light suddenly appear next to it, and then saw 2 more dots suddenly appear above the first 2.  They then started undulating up and down, the upper row and lower row moving toward each other and then away from each other, but along a path that she described as part of an arc.  The movement wasn't vertical, it was angled.  She saw this for 15-20 seconds, and then they disa! ppeared.  As it was happening she was pointing to where she was looking as she described it, but I couldn't see it. We left just after that, mainly because this incident had scared her and she wanted to get out of there.",2017-08-17T00:00:00,,

This is difficult to describe...the lights were fading in and out, it almost looked as if the tiny lights on this massive object were pulsing or something.  Every few seconds a very faint orangish yellow light would sweep across it, almost like a spotlight.  I kept rubbing my eyes because I was so boggled by this sight and just couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I tried to take pictures but my phone camera wouldn't suffice. I went back in to my house to do a search online to see if someone might have reported this, or even better if I could find a video of it.  I went back outside to look again and it was still there.  It was stationary and this is really blowing my mind.  Many nights I've noticed the color-changing orbs flashing in random areas amongst the stars, they come and go frequently, but I've never been alarmed by them, as I am so used to seeing them. And no, they aren't stars or satellites.  This thing with the green lights was definitely a massive object sitting way up in the sky.  It also seems a lot further away than the pulsating orbs, seeing that the lights were like pinpoints up there.

My husband asked what it was, I thought it was a helicopter but it made no sound, and as it passed over our house, there were no blinking lights, and it appeared to be oval in shape.   A few seconds later, another light appeared, this time green.  This repeated over a 20 minute period when another red light appeared then a white light appeared then another red.  These lights moved in the same way a helicopter would and seemed about the same distance from the ground.  Again, all lights were silent.

The objects appeared to be moving from west to east with a local flight pattern.  They  seemed to be about the size of a helicopter.  There were no noticeable winds or changes as they went by and they were silent.  I will try to get further information.  They were bright like LED lights but they were not moving like balloons or anything.  They moved similarly like a helicopter would and at about the same altitude.  Very consistent. I hope this helps.  I will forward further information as it is obtained. ((END ADDENDUM))",2017-08-17T00:00:00,37.98853003802281,-121.7887855513308

Then, my eyes were drawn to the source of the light streaming through the slats of the wooden shudders that were closed almost completely but leaving a ½ inch gap at the top.   I jumped out of bed and ran around the bed to get to the window, opened the top shudder and saw a roundish shaped, rotating flying object emitting an extremely bright, white strobe-like light.  It was blinking.  The object was rotating in a counterclockwise fashion and was traveling West to East. I was looking up through a 2nd story window at the back of the house, and it appeared to be so close, just at or above the tree line.  I quickly ran to turn off the house alarm and ran outside to see if I could see it, but it was gone.  When I saw it through the window, it was above a clearing in the center of the backyard.  To the sides and towards the back end of the yard there are tall, skinny trees. When I came back into the house,  I looked at the kitchen clock to note the time, and it was 2:36 am.  I don’t know how I will ever be able to go back to sleep now.  I wish I didn’t have a fan on next to me so I could have heard any sounds if there were any.  I got online and researched to see if anyone else living in the vicinity had seen it as well, and found this site.  I decided to report it because I know what I saw, and there is no other logical explanation for this.  I can still see the object in my mind’s eye and it amazes me, but it frightens me at the same time.  I was skeptical before but after witnessing this, I am a believer now.

While enjoying a brief stay at East Beach in Charlestown, RI, and lying on my back looking up at the clear blue sky, I spotted what looked like an airliner or B-52 shaped plane with fuselage, two wings, and four jet pods (2 on each wing).  I didn't notice the 'plane' approach but only noticed it as it materialized over head.  I would guess the altitude to be 15k feet up.   The craft caught my attention by virtue of 'bright lights' attached to the ends of the four 'jet pods'...the fuselage and wings had a translucent texture about it.  It seemed, some how, 'fake' to me.  The four bright, silvery lights at the ends of the pods changed as I observed it (I had binoculars with me, having viewed an old B-17, B-24, and a spitfire of WWII vintage earlier pass over the shoreline next to me, in prep for a local airshow over Labor Day weekend.).   Through the binoculars I had a good close up view of the 'plane.'  It's speed was slow for a jet, in my opinion.  As I looked at it close up, the far left 'light' went out and was replaced by the same type light at the end of the tail section.  Now, there were 3 wing lights and one tail light.  All were very bright and prominent.   As I continued to watch, the craft just faded out..it became dimmer and then just gone.  No sound was heard.   About 3 minutes later as I continued my sky search another similar 'plane' appeared in the same general area but  higher in elevation.  It, too, had the same lights but only two that I saw..one on each side of respective wing pods.  It was also translucent in substance as was the first.  It also faded quickly as if de-materializing as I watched.   The first craft sighting was in view for about 10 seconds but the second craft for only 5 seconds.  Both were going in the same Westward direction.  It was the lights on these 'planes' and their translucence that I deemed very odd and not normal.   I thought about the sun's reflective aspect on metal as an explanation but dismissed the idea as there was no consistency to it and the craft continued straight and not  deviating.   Another mystery, but possibly UFOs that can mimic our air craft and go unnoticed by the public. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter..I'll try to answer some questions...the object's lights were brilliant even in the bright sunlight...brilliant and silver-white...that's what really caught my attention initially.  The lights changing position suddenly was also odd to me. Math is my worst subject, so as far as degrees traveled in those 10 seconds, I would guess, maybe, five or so...it was not moving very fast.  I see many airliners coming and going from Greene Airport, in Warwick, RI, heading SW, the usual course.  This craft was a steady due West. I was not clear about the Air Show, Peter.  The low flying WWII planes that passed in front of me along the shoreline earlier could have been a prep for an upcoming show at Quonset Pt. airport in North Kingstown, an old US Navy airport, now home to some vintage planes, or from a show over Labor Day weekend, but I'll have to call Quonset to find out for sure.  C-130s fly out of there daily on routine practice flights for the Air National Guard who use that airport. The size of the 'plane' relative to the size of the bright sun was consistent with a 707 or similar, though the craft reminded me more of the B-52 with more swept back wings  There were two 'jet pods' per wing. The report you forwarded to me makes me think of a sighting I had earlier this summer while aboard the Block Island ferry heading to Block Island, RI (also known as New Shoreham, about 12 miles off of Pt. Judith harbor).  That morning this past June while the boat was half way out I noticed an egg shaped 'thing' drifting about 500 ft above the water.  It seemed fluid and changed shape, but not dramatically.  I was about a quarter mile from it, observing it behind the boat.  I dismissed the para sail idea as no boats were anywhere near it.  It was white-grey and translucent..like a blob, or parachute folding and unfolding.  I had no idea what it could be but no one else near me said anything (most people don't notice these things).  I said nothing, but wished I'd had my camera with me.  I watched it until it just seemed to disappear.  I saw no 'spikes' on it but it was egg shaped but fluid.  It was windy but the wind didn't seem to shift it...it just hung there in one space just above the ocean.  I didn't report it since i thought there was some good explanation, but I perhaps should have. This occurred on a bright sunny morning about 11:30.  I will continue to be observant and questioning about these things, even if no else is.    Thanks, Peter,  ((name deleted)), South Kingstown, RI",2017-09-14T00:00:00,41.396,-71.6631

On 2 separate occasions now I have observed an unidentified flashing object in the night sky.  The first incident happened approximately 2 weeks before the date of this report, and this recent incident is what prompted me to file this report. The description of the object is as follows:  A single white flashing light that is similar to a standard aircraft landing light in size, shape, color, and intensity.  I often see standard aircraft in the area turn on their landing lights as they enter the airspace of the Austin and Georgetown area.  Their color, as was the color of this object, is different than the light of the stars, and they appear much larger than any of the larger stars, like Vega, or planets you can see, like Jupiter. The activity of the object is as follows:  The first incident appeared in the northwestern sky sometime after midnight around the first of August, 2017, as a white flash that I saw out of the corner of my eye, and that I initially thought was a standard aircraft.  However, when I looked in the area where I saw the light, I could see no standard aircraft marking or navigation lights, no strobes, and no shape of any aircraft.   I diverted my attention from the area, and then it appeared again, so I focused on the area and began to count to see if I could pick up some kind of regular interval.  After about 19 seconds, I saw the flash, and measured the distance it had traversed to be approximately 4 fingers/125 mils/7 degrees from the southwest to the northeast.  I continued to count, and the flash appeared again at 14 seconds, then at 16 seconds, and then seemed to lose intensity and disappear.  I was only able to observe this object flash approximately 4 to 5 times, and it traversed approximately 600 mils / 33 degrees! of sky before it simply disappeared. The second incident happened around 0030 and was similar to the first, however, it occurred in the northeastern part of the sky, was only visible for 4 flashes, and only traversed approximately 125 mils / 7 degrees of sky before it disappeared. The location of the object was as follows:  I observed these objects from Jarrell, TX, which is approximately 12 miles north of Georgetown, TX.  The first incident in the western sky appeared approximately 540 mils/30 degrees above the line of the horizon in a northeasterly direction.  The second, and most recent incident appeared in the eastern sky approximately 720 mils/40 degrees above the horizon in a eastern/northeastern direction.  The objects appeared and disappeared instantaneously, and could not be tracked from horizon to horizon, as can the standard aircraft that fly through the area. Final thoughts:  I would like to think it was a standard aircraft, but it exhibited none of the standard lights visible on most aircraft, nor could any shape or sound be identified, which is usually common, and the flight characteristics and intermittent use of light is completely out of character for any of the aircraft I observe operating in this area, or any rotary or fixed-wing aircraft I observed while serving as a jumpmaster for more than 10 years in the U.S. Army.  I simply don't know what it was that I observed, or why it behaved in that manner. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.

First, because my husband and I had traveled to Turkey in early 2016 for a tour of the early Christian churches.  The second reason the report grabbed my attention was because I think I saw a very similar flickering light around the same timeframe - only I live north east of Cincinnati, Ohio. My husband was out of town the nights of August 9th and 10th.  We usually stargaze together so I rarely go out without him but because the night was clear (not sure which of the two nights)  I stepped out onto the deck for a few moments to look up.  It was likely around 11pm as well… I knew I should have documented it because it was so odd, but not drastic enough to think it was report worthy. I was only going to take a quick look because being outside alone is a bit creepy but a bright flash similar to what the Turkish man described caught my eye.  This single flash was strobe-like in intensity and hit my peripheral vision.  My father, a naval photographer, taught me to look above a light in the night sky to see it better.  When I did that I located a slow blinking light in the North-West sky similar to the Turkish man. As I watched the slow blinking object, I discerned it was not moving much… maybe a tiny bit to the left. It definitely was not moving as fast as other objects my husband and I have seen.  Over the years multitudes of red blinking lights have been observed and sometimes are close enough to see a white or green light …we have assumed they are planes or drones… they are all silent. But this light, also silent, was different because of the strobe effect that happened one more time when I was about to turn away and go inside. Studying it again, I realized it was definitely not moving and so I began counting seconds between blinks.  Sometimes it was three seconds, other times it was five and once I counted seven seconds.  This was definitely an interesting phenomenon.  I wondered if it was a planet, star or meteor that was so far away the atmosphere may have obscured its light intermittently. It was notable enough for me to tell my husband when he returned home.  I wished he had witnessed it too because I was second-guessing the strobe effect that happened twice.  But when I heard the report from Turkey, I knew it wasn’t my imagination.  I suspect we saw the same thing… but probably on different nights. Thanks for your reports on Coast to Coast.  It’s interesting to hear what other people are seeing. My husband and I are age 55, college graduates and entrepreneurs.  We don’t believe in aliens from other planets.  We believe there are government black op programs and entities from other dimensions.  We have no desire to make contact with these entities, but recognize we  have authority over them through faith in Jesus Christ.  So no fear, worry or concerns… just reporting a curiosity in the night sky.  Bless you!",2017-08-24T00:00:00,39.4792,-84.713

I was driving into my neighborhood last night at approximately 9:30, and was preparing to park my car in my garage, when I glanced up in the southeast sky at my roofline and noticed three glowing, pulsating, orange orbs flying slowly in a northwesterly direction in a large triangular formation.  As far as size perspective goes--they were the size of a typical pearl bead held at arm's length. I estimate they were traveling at a distance of about 10-15,000 feet and were completely silent and their airspeed was approximately 200-300 mph.  The objects’ color never changed. I watched the objects break formation when they were directly overhead and begin moving in a somewhat straight line, as they gradually disappeared into the northwest sky. This part of the sighting lasted about 2-3 minutes. I then saw another of these objects traveling along the same flight path, approaching from the southeast sky, at which point, I ran inside my house to get my wife outside as a witness to what I was observing. We both watched this object through my binoculars as it headed in a straight line into the northwest sky.  Same estimated airspeed, size and distance as the other objects. Also, at this point, I noticed several neighbors down the street from us, standing in their front yards, watching these objects. We were both getting ready to go inside the house, when we noticed yet another of the objects, same size, flight path, speed, color, etc., traveling in exactly the same direction as the previously sighted objects. We watched as it gradually disappeared in the northwest sky. I estimate the total length of this sighting to be approximately 10-15 minutes. We waited outside for another 10 minutes but nothing else unusual was sighted. We are approximately 10 miles from Sanford-Orlando International Airport and are very used to seeing various types of commercial and sometimes military aircraft over the last 17 years.

I saw a group of disks in the sky that appeared rather small to me. I watched them move slowly toward the Milky Way, leaving triangular trails behind them.  They moved for a couple of seconds, and then stopped, the trail faded, and they moved again, though this movement did not seem erratic. It simply seemed odd.  Another thing they seemed to do was vary in number.  Some of the disks faded until the group numbered two, and returned to light until the group numbered seven. 	After several minutes of this, my father said, “Hey, look at that!”  He was drawing my attention to “that bright light,” although what I saw was a fading dark green light that drifted to the right over the eastern horizon. 	I returned my attention to the disks, and noticed that they seemed to restart their path across the sky, back toward the Milky Way.  It appeared no progress had been made by them whatsoever.

Having finished my shift, I was driving east on Otay Mesa Road, when a luminous ball of white light caught my attention.  Given the fact that there are two airports nearby,  Brown Field, which was just behind me to the west, and Tijuana International Airport, two miles south of my location and over the border, I figured it was a commercial aircraft preparing to land. But when my passenger, a co-worker, mentioned that the light wasn’t going to make either field, I decided to pull over, close to the right side of the curb.  Before I could come to a stop, however, the headlights failed and the engine died.  It was just about 12:45 AM when the light glided over SR 125, which was approximately one-eight mile in front of us. As the ball of light approached the vacant field to our right, I became aware of the distinct feeling of pins and needles about my face and in my hands, especially around my mouth and in my fingertips.  That’s when I reached for my phone, only it was dead.  My coworker reached for the pair of sunglasses that he kept in the glove box. I would say the ball was twenty-five feet in diameter, but I couldn’t make out a distinct edge.  At first it remained motionless, about fifteen or twenty feet above the ground, and about forty yards from where our jeep had stalled.  Then, after four or five minutes, there appeared to be a quarter panel of the ball that grew brighter.  Given the detail that became visible, it became apparent that the ball was turning clockwise, about a half turn every minute or so.   I would say eight minutes had elapsed before the ball began to move forward and then climbed smoothly toward the western horizon.  The skies were clear, and at no time did the object make any sound.

After throwing some garbage away in a bag, I placed on the sidewalk next to my vehicle, I looked up at the sky randomly for some odd reason facing North East.  I watched three airplanes fly ahead.  But there was a fourth one…  The fourth one was glowing a golden hue and had a smaller orb of golden light flashing on the upper left side.  This smaller orb of light looked to be detached from the object but followed it in sync.  It was glowing and the golden lights were together in a curved disk shape at the bottom of the object.  It was moving to the right quite slowly, then it stopped dead in its tracks.  I sat there trying to calculate what I was seeing.  Something was off about it.  The other planes passing by had white and red flashing lights flying one direction, but this one stopped above the neighborhood above the tree line, lower in the level of the airplanes flying! past in the sky.

S-shaped black tumbling Rotating UFO.

Middle of the day.  Walked outside, looked up and there it was.  It was floating through the air, a dark S-shaped object, maybe teen feet or so in size - maybe a half mile or less in the sky.  These are guesses to size and distance. It tumbled through the sky, and also, the ends of the S would contract at times, then go back to an S shape - and also I did notice that it would also rotate horizontally, and when it did - it seemed as if it was 2-dimensional on that plane, otherwise tubular. At one time during the horizontal, I noticed a kind of yellow semi-transparent square projection shape go over it, in a flash of time. It strangely enough seemed to go directly over my field of view. I thought about it later, that I was feeling the wind from the opposite direction. As I had plenty of time, time of encounter 30+ seconds, I could not see or identify what it is, even observing it intently, and it did not appear to be a balloon of any kind.  There are no balloons sold in any local stores that match this. I then went on the internet to look for ""s-shaped ufo's"" and I found some others that have had similar sightings:   http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/135/S135145.html https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/s-shaped-ufo.494236/   Something about this seemed...organic, intelligent, and intentional - rather than simply a piece of trash or balloon floating in the wind.  I say this with all skeptical discernment, as it seemed to be tumbling, as it were-as a means of movement or self-propelling, such as the flagella of a cell moves, rather than simply being an object moved by a current. Unfortunately with these kinds of things, it just doesn't sound that impressive - I understand, as it probably would not to me if I read this report of a UFO without experiencing it directly my self. I am relaying this to see if anyone else has ever seen something like this, or has any ideas ... this is all true my story which I share. I do not have any cameras or phone to take a picture, sorry - but the video of the other sighting looks very similar, even exactly - except for the addition of the other details which I had observed.

We took 9 photos over a 5 minutes period, between 11:46 am and 11:51 am Mountain Time.  Our home has an excellent view of Pikes Peak, the mountain range west of the city and we frequently take weather photos. We reviewed the photos a few hours later and first noticed the anomalous dark image in the second picture taken at 11:47 am.  It was taken with a Motorola Droid Turbo 2 smartphone.  What’s ironic is that, when taking the photo, we saw a long cloud formation over the southern flank of mountains and I said aloud in jest “that looks like a mother ship”.   The anomalous dark object is above and to the left of the long cloud formation in the photo.  The dark object is a bit blurry but obvious to the eye.  No other photos taken have shown anything unusual, apart from the small cloud formations which quickly formed in an otherwise clear sky and then dissipated after the solar eclipse. We’re used to seeing large birds, planes, helicopters, even drones, fly the skies in our area.  But the dark object in the photo doesn’t resemble any of these, which I believe we would have readily noticed at the time.",2017-08-24T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

Everybody around me said yeah right that's a UFO whatever, you're crazy, yeah he's in the UFOs and all that, all the mean stuff that people say when they don't believe what they're looking at.I don't believe it to be any normal aviation aircraft as they don't move this fast.  I did happen to click two or three photos of it but it had already gone from bright red to white.  You do see the outline of it in the photos.  Photos are always grainy it seems when you want to get a clear photo. So we were about to see the full eclipse looking south of where we were and up in the sky wants the eclipse took over everything went pretty dark but you could still see a horizon if you turn 360°.  It was absolutely beautiful we saw the eclipse through the eyeglasses and there is nothing like it.  I turned around and was admiring everything else and as the sun started to come back out the area Brighton to back up and as it did I saw a red light in the sky. most red lights we see here in Nashville move around across the sky very slowly and generally are blinking because they're attached to an aircraft they don't move up and down and don't move very quickly at all.  What I saw moved from in the clouds in my perspective about 2 inches down from the cloud area to below The cloud area in a matter of milliseconds.  Absolutely no aircraft can move that fast.  That's to my knowledge at least. Now of course the 10 or 12 people around me I started telling them do y'all see that red light in the sky and as I told them it move down very fast and stopped the red light started to turn white and then it started to sending back to the earth and very slowly disappeared behind the tree line.  Now this craft was not 100 feet away I'm sure it was at least 1 to 5 miles away. In some of the photos that I took I pointed at where it was coming down after everything happened.  So I could document exactly where it was and see if there was some aviation thing that the government may have been tested.  I'd love for someone to check that out and get back to me but I'm pretty sure I know what I saw and it moved extremely fast from one point to the next as many UFOs that are reported do.  And courage everyone to check this out as this is the first one I have ever seen if it is a real UFO and it was very exciting. Kudos to anyone else who catches something like this on video or photographs please always record it so we can all enjoy what just very few of us have seen.

I thought initially it was a strobe from a plane, but it was really bright.  So bright, it made me stop to see if it would do it again.   I tried to predict the path assuming it would be in a straight line as an airplane would fly but it showed up in random locations and distances from its previous location.  It seemed to ""swoop' from one position to another and would flash at each new position.  This happened over 10-15 times moving further away each time over a 3-5 min timeframe.  I was facing east at the time of the initial sighting and was facing south at the last point of visual contact.  It was an incredible distance to travel so quickly and moved like nothing I had ever seen.  At one point a smaller constant light that looked just like a star moved toward the object slowly at one of its stopping points.  The bright light immediately moved to a new position further away.
