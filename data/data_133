My wife and I were traveling south on Route 11 somewhere between Canfield, and Columbiana OH when the sighting first occurred. Time was approximately 12:45AM EST. Not many cars headed in either direction. Traveling at about 65-70mph. We first noticed what looked like a super bright star that was an intense greenish turquoise at our 11 O'Clock (SSE direction from us). Probably between 300-500 yards off the ground.  For about 2-3 minutes the object looked to stay in about the same position, but got slightly closer to us where it passed directly over our car. I was the driver so I wasn't able to accurately see the outline of the vehicle. But I am certain as it got closer there was a bright greenish light on the front, and two red lights parallel at the rear of the craft, with one of them blinking. The green light was VERY brilliant, and ""crisp"" almost like a super bright LED light. Not what I would typically see on a helicopter. We had our windows down without the radio on, and did not hear any type of propeller that you would expect to hear from a helicopter.  A few seconds later my wife was able to see it directly above us slightly to the west. She feels very confident that the craft was a solid triangular shape with rounded edges, as it was silhouetted in front of the cloud. She also saw a greenish light, with a red, and what she believed to be a white light in parallel. But, she said she was more focused on the outline of the craft that color/locations of the light.  For a few more minutes the craft essentially seemed to keep pace with us (approx 65mph) to our west, but getting slightly further in a westerly direction. After a few more minutes it seemed to fall behind us towards the WNW until we lost sight of it as we were driving through a wooded area.  Our thoughts on common craft as an explanation: Airplane: It was traveling/hovering too slowly to remain in the air, but also keep pace with us at 65mph. Helicopter: My wife saw an outline of the vehicle as a triangle, and did not see any propellers. We also did not hear anything that would indicate a helicopter. Drone: Unless there was someone driving in a car near us controlling the drone, we are not sure how it could have kept pace with us over that 5-7 mile distance at 65mph. Balloon: The object came at us from the SSE, then kept pace with us at our west. Which is not a normal jet stream for the area to carry a balloon.  The craft did not make any erratic movements, but what was odd was that it kept pace with us while seemingly remaining silent.  Both observers are in their 30s, and did not have any alcoholic beverages that early morning/previous night.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,40.9512,-80.6529

Was enjoying that first breath of what felt like fall and noticed that the night sky was clear the way it is during autumn.   I noticed a spherical object moving across the night sky.  At first I figured, ""Oh its one of those star-link satellites...I haven't seen one of those in a while.""  So I preceded to observe it.  Then I noticed it wasn't moving in a straight path.  It was moving in a wavy type path.   I thought, ""man it would sure be nice if it got a little brighter,"" as it would be easier to see (it looked like a moving star).  As soon as that thought entered my mind, it began to pulse.  It would brighten up and then dim.  Then something drew my attention away from the sky.  I turned to look behind me and all of a sudden a series of colorful plasma type orbs phased in about 40 yards away from me.  There was one large one followed by two more that were slightly smaller.  They were completely silent and then emitted this rainbow like color with a light purple aura. They traveled completely straight for about 3 seconds and then faded out and disappeared. Several nearby dogs began howling and barking as soon as the plasma orbs faded out.  The whole thing happened too fast for me to whip out my phone and start snapping photos.  I was AWESTRUCK.  The craft in the sky was definitely in space or upper atmosphere while the plasma orbs were no higher than the neighbors cherry tree and no larger than an orange or small melon.  Ten minutes after this happened, I saw 2 black helicopters flying low over a nearby neighborhood.  They looked like black hawk helicopters.  It was night so I can't be certain, but by their size and shape, they were definitely military.  These helicopters were flying in circles around my neighborhood and other nearby neighborhoods.   There were also a couple aircraft flying above my area doing laps.  I live near a local commercial airport so the air traffic control tower could have had them flying in a holding pattern.  Still, it seemed like a strange coincidence that military helicopters, that never fly around here, all of a sudden show up and start circling around the area after this happened.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,33.96188745901639,-84.51021319672131

It was cigar shaped, long, about the length of a Chinook helicopter.  The front end of the aircraft was bright white, body was yellow orange, and the rear was red and yellow. The red and yellow pulsated back and forth. The bottom, as it went over! , had round circular objects on it in a line.

Also, my incident happened last Wednesday (1 week ago) so I know mailing this information would take too long.  I did leave a voicemail message today as well. Here is my story:  I left my sister's house on Castine Way on Wednesday, 10/14/2020 at 11:30 pm EST (23:30 hours).  As I drove down the street, I noticed lights ahead that were hovering over a house and not moving.  I slowed down so I could try to make out what I was seeing.  It was a large object (around 30 FT wide & 20 FT tall) hovering in the sky about roughly 50 feet above the roof of the house directly across the street from the Castine Way stop sign.  Anyone with a good baseball arm could have thrown a stone and hit it. As I approached the stop sign, I realized it was a lot bigger than I thought- jet black and I could only make out the outline of the craft against the night sky...there were no other markings that I saw, only the lights and outline. It also made no sound that I could hear.  I did have my windows up, but the neighborhood was completely silent and no one was outside so if it did display an engine-type sound, I should have been able to hear that considering how close I was to this thing (probably around 150 ft away from me). It had 2 yellow lights on either side of the craft and 3 red lights in the middle. It looked like an upside-down bell but a little wider, more triangle shaped but with rounded edges, and the lights were on the front, not on the side or underneath.  It was very thick...very solid looking--not flat. There was nothing protruding on the craft, no wings or blades. It was very large, as I mentioned before--like the size of my living room w/ vaulted ceilings. My first thought was this must be a VERY expensive military surveillance drone due to its size but why the heck is it hovering in our community this late at night?!? It started moving toward me so I floored the gas and sped away as fast as I could. I wasn't sure if it was following me until I turned left on Zephyr Ct and there it was.  It was on my left moving VERY slowly over the houses on Maria Ct. heading in the direction of Ashley High School. I raced down the road and pulled into my garage, jumped out to take a picture of it and it was already gone. I have to tell you, that was the most frightening thing I've ever encountered.  I made a police report the next day (10/15/2020) and the officer confirmed that “none of their drones were outside at time” and “their drones are only 24 INCHES wide.” I did not take any pics or videos because I was seriously so frightened of being abducted that I could not look away.

The Ojito Wilderness is located in the Zia Pueblo, just west of San Ysidro, New Mexico.  I had been watching a particularly vivid sunset, facing south from the bumper of my truck. As the last remnants of light disappeared over the mountains to the west, I absent-mindedly watched an aircraft crossing my field of vision, traveling SE to NW.  The shape of the aircraft was indistinct in the low light, but it was visible by a blinking red tail-light, or what I assumed at the time was a tail-light. It appeared to be a conventional aircraft. It may have been 5 miles away, although distance was hard to discern.  The craft then stopped on a dime. From beneath it, a dull golden beam flashed out as though a light switch had been flicked. Around the dull golden beam, what looked like an iridescent double helix circled it. This double helix was darker gold in color. It looked almost like suspended molten liquid. Both the dull golden beam and the double helix encircling it hung below the craft (This light extended maybe 100 yards or so beneath the craft) for about 15-20 seconds. They both disappeared in a flash, again as though someone had flicked off  a light switch with the light seemingly receding back up towards its source.  The craft hovered for a moment, identifiable by its blinking red running light, before engaging in point to point travel seemingly randomly in all directions. It continued like this for 30 seconds or so. When it finished ping-ponging around like that, the craft resumed a normal flight path, as it had maintained previously. It continued in a northwesterly direction and I lost sight of it beyond the silhouette of Mesa Prieta.  Conditions that evening were decent. Cloud cover was something like 50%, with a large band of clouds passing through an otherwise clear sky. The clouds were higher than the craft, which at no point was obscured by them. The moon was not quite full.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,,

On Fourth of July, 2018 in northern Indianapolis, near Fox Road, and the Marion-Hamilton County line, and Geist Reservoir, at about 1 p.m., I walked into my wide backyard and glanced up. Small, dense white clouds were traveling in a northeastern direction beneath a beautiful blue sky. I was following them across the sky when I noticed that one very large cloud to the near northwest, the exact same color as the rest, was stationary. The big cloud was gently moving, like bubbling or slowly percolating in place, and was thinner or wispier along the edges. The smaller clouds traveled northward above and beside it. Then I focused on something I wasn’t prepared to see. The big cloud was mostly concealing an enormous craft that was not moving. The first impression was of the nose of a cruise ship peeking out of a cloud. The craft’s skin was smooth with no external appendages. Its color was a pale, washed-out, non-reflective gray. There was no sound. There were no lights or lamps. The vessel was close enough that it felt as though I was looking upward from the bottom of a tall cliff. The part of the craft I could observe looked like a 3-layer cake. The top tier was the smallest and had no openings. The second level was deeper and wider, rounded on the end, and had about four black, vertically rectangular openings or portholes that were wider at the bottom. Other openings were probably cloaked or masked by the cloud. The black openings were the most impressive part of the craft and felt ominous, like windows or observation ports. The third layer was wider still and had no openings that I could see. The bottom of this level, and whatever was below it, was concealed by the bubbling cloud. The craft was immense. I have brainstormed the event and tried to measure the vessel with imaginary football fields. It is at least 300-400 meters across at its widest point, assuming that it is symmetrical. I entered and exited my home twice and can vouch that this thing was there for at least 5 minutes. The second time I left the house, it was gone. For various reasons, I did not take a photograph and kept silent for over two years. I have repeatedly brain-stormed the event in order to flesh out this description and make the most accurate possible drawing.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,39.80764884833982,-86.14221402931499

There was a pyramid shaped UFO slowly descending from the sky.  It was about a football field away.  While it was descending it was shimmering like light over choppy water.  Initially my brother thought it was a black plastic bag stuck on a pole.  It descended behind a two story apartment building across the street from my house.  Only the pointy part of the UFO was now visible. It stopped descending and suddenly 2 bright lights shot out of the top.  The two lights moved very fast swirling in different directions.  This happened for so long that I was fixated on the swirling lights and noticed that the lights were moving in a grid pattern. Suddenly! the two lights stopped in place after 5 minutes of swirling.  After the two lights stopped, the UFO started slowly cartwheeling with the two lights fixed at that one point of the pyramid.  It cartwheeled past the building it was behind showing the whole UFO.  As it was cartwheeling, it was slowing becoming transparent.  It cartwheeled horizontally for half a football field, getting more transparent and disappeared.

A few minutes previously a small plane had passed by, also due west, moving from the NW in a southerly direction, with the usual running lights and strobe. This, however, was a bigger “blob” of light, very orange, basically spherical but not perfectly so, randomly changing in intensity. It drifted from NW to SW, continuing to “pulse” arhythmically. There was no sound at any time. After maybe 10-15 seconds three more lights, very similar, all orange, drifted in from behind the treeline. They all traveled around lazily, with random changes in velocity and slight changes in direction. All orange and very bright, sometimes dimming slightly or appearing to go translucent. They didn’t settle into any particular configuration, and never too close to each other. All remained just a few finger widths abov! e the treeline, then all four began to drift north.

While acting as Captain of a two-pilot crew on a Gulfstream 450 private jet, on May 22nd from Anchorage, Alaska to the southeastern USA, we saw a craft appear on our forward-looking external camera.  It was broad daylight, and we could clearly see the detail of the entire structure of this craft, including what looked like a large antenna protruding upward from the top and one protruding downward from the bottom, both in the center of the craft.  It was in front of us for almost 4 hours, so it was also moving at approximately 550mph in our same flight path for those 4 hours.  It moved left and right slightly and one time it moved upward a little bit.  The shape of this craft is not like anything I’ve ever seen in my 52 years of life.  Its not the typical tic-tac, Tylenol or saucer shaped sightings, or just lights.   This is a well-defined obvious alien craft, that quite frankly looks like the very large alien craft that you see in the movie Independence day ! over cities.  Nobody can explain this away or say it’s a weather balloon or anything made from this planet, no way.   This is undeniable. Approximately 5 minutes before we needed to start our descent over Minnesota, we noticed 4 equally spaced beams of light started to grow downward from the bottom of the aircraft and then stop at all equal lengths.  Then while we prepared for that descent, we looked up minutes later and it was gone. These pictures are simple, they are not the same old tired pictures and videos the Navy has of tic-tacs and formations of lights at night that nobody can see any detail.  This is an alien craft, period. We would like to show the pictures and videos we have to someone, but will not post them or email them to anyone. Contact me via email for now.

It seemed to be soaring, so for a split second  I thought it was a bird but I kept watching, and it appeared to be round and disc shaped, no wings/tail, completely round or possibly ovular, dark colored/probably black, maybe dark chrome colored, and it reflected light as it rotated so I think it was constructed of something reflective/shiny/solid with no markings.  I did not notice any lights. It moved in a steady arc across the sky above me slightly over my left shoulder so not directly overhead but over the south eastern part of the sky. I ran inside to grab my phone (only ! took me a few seconds) and tried to turn my video camera on but didn’t press the start button, only switched it from photo to video (I thought I was video recording it, but I wasn’t unfortunately). The entire sighting lasted somewhere between 30 and 60 seconds approximately. The object was small, smaller than the sun would be, and it seemed to be at a relatively high altitude. When it rotated it did so in a sporadic manner and didn’t change course/trajectory. It sometimes remained stable without spinning (still maintaining the same speed) for a few seconds give or take and then it would rotate in varying directions. The object didn’t emit any sound or trail. It just kept going on it’s course until it was behind the treeline in the NE and I couldn't see it anymore.

I was looking south and from the position that I was sitting I could see very far out into the sky between some houses and trees. Near the sky line, as far away as I could see I saw a dim yellow light that appeared to be getting larger and brighter as it approached me heading from south to north. Something about it grabbed my attention because it wasn’t a light similar to any I had seen on any airplane. It wasn’t blinking and was distinctly yellow rather than the typical white-ish LED color. As the light approached and started to fly overhead I realized that there was an object flying in front of the yellow light. It was a totally black triangle with 3 red lights, one on each corner, that weren’t blinking and were significantly dimmer than the yellow light. The black triangle was approximately 3 times the size of the light. The ship flew almost directly over top of me and as it did I got a pretty detailed look at exactly what it was. The bottom was a perfect triangle with three completely flat sides and what appeared to be a completely flat black bottom with just the three red lights just inside of each corner of the triangle. There was not a single blinking light underneath just the 3 solid red lights. Traveling in formation behind the triangle was a yellow orb of light. This is the light I had originally seen on the horizon. It seemed to be light emanating from nothing. I can only think to describe it as a large orb of yellow light floating very closely behind the triangle but clearly was not attached to it. I could see the sky in between the triangle and orb and nothing was holding them together but they were flying dangerously close to each other. Too close for any airplanes to fly together. The distance between them was maybe half the distance of a side of the triangle and the distance between triangle and orb never change at all. I stepped into my yard to get a better view while it was directly near over top of me and I could clearly see that the back edge of the triangle was totally flat, ruling out any planes that I am aware of. It was a perfect triangle with all equal length sides. It took approximately 45 seconds for it to pass from one horizon to over top of my head and disappeared over top of my house and I could no longer see it. I struggle to say exactly how big or how far away it was but the triangle was similar to the size the top half of your thumb held away from your face in the sky. I debated whether or not to add this next part in because I worry that it could detract from what I’ve said so far but It’s true and possibly relevant so I figured I should include it even though I definitely run the risk of losing credibility for saying this and I realize that but I’m already reporting a UFO so might as well be fully honest. 20 minutes before I first saw it I had a thought that I would see an alien in that exact location in the sky that I first saw it. I’ve never seen anything unfamiliar in the sky before, never had any ghost encounters, never heard anything out of the ordinary, never seen anything that wasn’t ordinary and explainable in my entire life. I didn’t even really believe in aliens until I saw what I saw. But I had a thought that I would see a ship coming from the exact place in the sky that it came from just 20 minutes before I first saw it. When I first saw the light far out in the distance it did not appear to be moving but with it tha! t far away it’s hard to tell. After initially seeing a strange glowing light in the sky exactly where I thought I would, I then began thinking that I hope it comes towards me and it did. I was actively thinking that I hope it comes to me as I began to see it move in my direction. It went from maybe 15 miles away and came almost directly over top of me. I’ve never experienced any sort of hallucination, I’m completely mentally sound, I don’t take any medications, and I wasn’t drinking. I don’t know how my thoughts could possibly have effected whatever flew over top of me but what I saw was certainly real and maybe those strange thoughts were just totally coincidental to what I saw but I’ve never in my life thought that I would see something in the sky until right then in that moment and 20 minutes later there it was, and then immediately after seeing it in the distance I actively thought that I wanted it to come my direction and it came directly over top of me.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,42.7042,-84.4098

The object then moved from west to east not very far and very slowly. Wasn’t a helicopter because it was way too high wasn’t a drone because drones don’t hold up in the wind like that and obviously wasn’t a plane. The object stayed still for another 5 minutes before turning 90 degrees north and slowly moving off before jetting off at what seemed like light speed and was gone. The object flashed lights on and off in the middle of the day so it couldn’t have been a reflection. I have a 30 second video of the object hovering in place and flashing lights.

My first thought was a drone with some weird lights attached. There was no sound. I stared up at it for about 1 min. Then it started moving. The lights started to fade and now I could see at large black rectangle moving slowly to the east. It was a full moon and scattered clouds, but the sky was a gray color with the full moon. A couple white lights winked on this black rectangle then it went completely black. It was such a dark  dark black color. Initially I thought this object was low, maybe 500 ft, but as it glided silently across the sky I saw it went above the the broken clouds. I've never seen anything glide so smoothly. It was the shape of a Hersey bar. It picked move slowly as it glided away completely black but I coul! d clearly see it's shape in the light night sky I watched it until it moved behind clouds. I was really in shock. I thought that's either some very advanced secret aircraft of ours or a UFO. It was amazing. I went inside and told a family member a nd texted a friend. I went on the internet to see if there was any news about this. I even called one of the local news networks to ask them if they had gotten any reports. I also check the weather to see what the cloud layer height was to get an idea of how big this really was. The pilot wether briefing I read said the clouds were scattered at 9500 feet. This object was above them and went through them at times. Based on that altitude Id guess the object was about 100 ft x 50 ft. I'll never forget this sighting. I already believed we are being visited by other planets. Now I can say I know for sure. This had to be a UFO.",2020-02-07T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I had a window seat near the back of the plane on the right side of the plane. I wondered if the object might be a drone at first or a regular plane, especially since when I originally saw it, I only noticed a red and blue flashing light. However, the object maneuvered extremely fast and was ""wiggling"" its way up in the air (still at a very far distance away from the plane and high above the plane I was in). The object started moving extremely fast towards the plane (very fast) and I actually thought it was going to fly right into the plane (which made me nervous). As the object was rapidly moving towards the plane on a collision course, it was a glowing sun light color and just when I ! thought it was going to crash into our plane, it just STOPPED. It hovered there as if looking at the plane (for probably 3-5 seconds) and than it just took off and zipped across the sky up and away. It was a disc shaped object and was a sun like color as it was moving towards the plane I was in. This sun light color appeared to get a little more intense, ""hot"" as it approached the plane.  Like sun colored energy.  I did not share this information with anybody else on the plane as the event happened unexpectedly and quickly and by the time I could have told someone about it, the object was gone, but on my parents souls in heaven, this really happened and I dont think it was a drone because I dont think drones can stop on a dime like that or carve up and cut across the sky like it did and have that type of maneuverability. It was traveling Very fast when it wanted to. I  think it would be illegal for a drone to fly so close to a plane. Furthermore, we were flying ac! ross the ocean so what a drone would be doing out there, I don! t know, but I am convinced I saw a UFO.  We had about 10-20 minutes of the flight left when I saw this object and I was flying back from Medillin Colombia to Fort Lauderdale.

The air was crisp, and the sky was partly cloudy with large parts clear and open. The moon was somewhere to the south of me, and lighted the clouds. I looked up and noticed a solid (not flashing) bright white light, traveling roughly from NE to SW on a straight and steady course which I first took to be a satellite. A few civilian and commercial aircraft were clearly present and visible contrasted against the clear part of the sky as well.  I could not tell how high or how fast the light was moving, but it seemed to be a similar speed to that of satellites I’ve seen on other occasions. As I watched, I noticed two other, smaller lights, which appeared to be keeping station with the larger light. I did not notice these smaller lights at first, as there were clearly visible civilian aircraft in the sky. These other two lights were flashing in a rhythmic fashion, and at first I guessed they were also small civilian aircraft. However, as I focused on the “satellite,” the two smaller lights began to, rapidly “crisscross” each other’s flight path (it seemed to me quite close to each other) and in a fashion I have never see done before by either civilian or military aircraft. While the smaller lights crisscrossed each other, they maintained course and speed with the larger light, neither gaining on nor falling behind the larger light. Though I can’t be clear as to speed, they were clearly moving faster than the aircraf! t I could see in the distance. That is, of course, unless the objects were closer to me than the other aircraft.  The entire event took no longer than perhaps 30 seconds to a minute.

It was cigar shaped, long, about the length of a Chinook helicopter.  The front end of the aircraft was bright white, the body was yellow orange, and the rear was red and yellow.

I never have the urge to do this, and haven't since. There was a strangely bright cloud. It was different from the other clouds. I purposefully compared them all. I had a strange feeling of being mesmerized or unable to move, perplexed by this cloud. I was not afraid until after the event. I felt something was hiding in the cloud.  Suddenly, a metal triangle appeared. I don't recall if it appeared out of thin air, came from the cloud, or appeared from the 2-story house's roof next to me. I'm guessing it was half a mile up in the air if I could see it from that distance, meaning it was possibly 150-200 feet wide. It was horizontal to the ground, likely 1-2 miles away. It measured only a centimeter or less across from where I stood in my home, but it was clearly far away. It can be described as medium-dark metal because it shined and reflected sunlight on its corners as it rotated. There was no exhaust. No sound, no hum. I knew I could not grab a phone because it would be gone. The shape was precisely like an angled ruler.  As I stared at this horizontal metal triangle in the sky, it started to slowly rotate around. Then, to my ultimate surprise, it slowly went vertical and began to TUMBLE north. This was a slow process. Imagine throwing an angled ruler at someone, holding it vertically (not like a frisbee), and recording it, to show it in ultra slow motion. That's how it appeared to disappear into the treeline beyond my vision.  It was not far from the Plant City airport (maybe 4-5 miles east), but this was literally as clear as day and my eyes have never deceived me. It was Absolutely Nothing like an airplane, weather balloon, kite, drone, or anything I can find. It appeared that it was near the post office on East MLK and Kingsway, which is a more rural area than Tampa or Brandon.  I'm not mentally ill and have never suffered hallucinations.

At 11:35pm a friend and I were out having a cigarette on my porch as he was leaving after hanging out for a bit after work. Ironically we were talking about the recent UAP report and I jokingly said I'd been watching the sky suspiciously since then. He responds ""Well at least that light is obviously terrestrial in origin.""  Sure enough there was a bright light in the sky, which got brighter as we were looking at it. He remarked that it must be a helicopter with a search light on. Which admittedly was what I was thinking. Then the light shifted, and was no longer pointed directly at us, which made me realize it was bright enough to be illuminating us a bit, a few lumens at best. He started trying to guess what it was. Guesses included a jet throwing on it's after burners, which we discarded because it wasn't moving fast, and didn't make a sound.  The object appeared to be a ball of light, to me. At this point one side was dimmer than the other which was still extremely bright. Movement was... drifting, moved down a bit, and began heading almost exactly due north. After the incident I confirmed on the Star Map app it had passed almost 1 inch above the M33 star for a reference in the night sky. Then it dimmed to where it was almost non-visible in the light pollution of the city lights (due North of my location is downtown, the sky is much less visible). When it dimmed it rapidly accelerated until it was non visible (less than a second). Up until this acceleration I'd describe it's movement as 'drifting' and it only moved around 5-6in while it was bright.  After it disappeared I thought to check the time and the star it passed nearest to while bright. Hope it helps.  Star was M33, and the location was the address provided. Can't really estimate what distance it was to us. Looked high altitude, but originally when the light was bright we thought it was a lot closer .",2021-08-16T00:00:00,39.73540852059925,-84.16762780898877

I couldn't be sure, but I began to think there were two or three. A few times I was able to spot two at once. They were white pinpoints of light, the size and color of stars, perhaps 10,000 feet altitude.  Eventually the one I observed the longest streaked across the sky. At that point I noticed there were four more hovering in formation in the distance. It joined the group, and they flew off together rapidly in formation.  It was a very unusual and unexpected experience, the first time I've seen anything like this. I could not trust that I was actually seeing them.

So I was able to enjoy the natural beauty of this stretch of road. The visibility was unlimited-crystal clear afternoon desert skies.  Far off in the distance at elevation, a glint of silver caught my eye. My first thought was of an old-style Airstream trailer. But there is no way any type of vehicle could have been up there. It was sitting in an odd spot, not quite at the top of the peak but on a small outcropping just below. It's extremely rugged terrain on foot-let alone for anything heavy.  No windows, no struts, no markings. Just a seamless silver oval-not moving. The driver of the vehicle confirmed that he could see it as well and we both agreed on the description.

The comet was north-northwest of my position and about 10 degrees above the horizon, slightly to the north of the big dipper, which was roughly 25-35 degrees above the horizon.  The sky was cloudless and very clear. At approximately 10:15pm I observed a pinpoint light moving from the horizon, just west of the comet, towards the bowl of the big dipper. This light was white/yellow and brighter than the background stars. To the naked eye it appeared to be slowly pulsing, or varying in brightness. It also was not travelling in a straight line, it meandered a few degrees to the left and to the right. I used trained the binoculars on it which did not further resolve any features but enhanced the pulsing, giving the impression that perhaps the object was tumbling. When it reached the middle of the bowl of the big dipper it changed directions entirely and started moving due east from my position, parallel to the horizon. My impression was that it was moving at the approximate speed of a plane at distance, or of a satellite, which are often easily observed from my location. I checked my plane tracking app and there were no planes flying in the area. Obviously due to the path of the object I knew it was not an artificial satellite. The object dimmed as it moved east but was still easily visible to the naked eye. Though I was tracking it with binoculars. In several minutes it moved about 30 degrees due east, at which point it came to a complete stop and I observed, through the binoculars, a much dimmer and smaller point of light approach it from the north, moving very rapidly. This second light passed “right” in front of the first object and quickly disappeared, and the first light then proceeded due east. At this point, approximately 10:15-10:20 pm I lost visual entirely due to my tree line. I texted an abbreviated version of the above to my wife who was camping with family 120 miles west of my position. She and another family member has observed the same light move in the same path, including going through the bowl of the big dipper.

Prior to the event, between approximately 21:00 – 22:00 hours, 8-10 people sat at the northern end of the runway observing multiple shooting stars and satellites. The night was the clearest we’d seen in years coming to the location. The campground was not empty, there were approximately 300 people staying in tents, RV’s, or car camping. Our group dispersed the airstrip and went to their respective accommodations for the evening.

On January 25th, 2021, I hit the road from Newburgh, NY to Fishkill, NY to pick up my wife. She gets out of work at 11:45 PM. I picked her up and we got back on the road. I was driving the vehicle and she was sitting next to me. We have a Kia SUV. I was driving on the right lane about 50 miles per hour speed. This highway is known as Interstate 84 west. Two lanes going east and two lanes going west. Around 11:55 pm, an object suddenly passed from the right front corner of our vehicle to the left front corner with a tremendous speed. The object looked like tube-shaped, and fluorescent in color. It passed with a tremendous speed and left behind a flutter. It looked like this flutter was the replaced atmosphere that was visible through our headlights. We passed through this flutter. Next, my wife said what was that? She said, “was that a deer?” I said I have never seen a tube-shaped, fluorescent white deer that travels with the speed of light. She said it could! be a bird. I repeated myself and said it was not an animal, plant, or human. My wife and I communicated perfectly up until that point. Next, I looked at my left mirror and what I saw shocked me. There was an object about the size of a dumpster truck if not any bigger, gold like beige in color, disc shaped with a huge majestic platform in the middle was flying at the left rear corner of our vehicle. The object positioned itself over the left lane and was travelling (flying) in the same direction with us. I said "" I see it. There is an object behind us. Oh my God! What is this? This cannot be a bird. It is too big and not flapping wings. "" Later my wife said she never heard me saying this. I clearly remember making this statement out loud. The object got closer and it was almost parallel to the rear seats. So, I said "" It is getting so close! Far too close!"" I said this last statement out loud in panic and shock. My wife later said that I have never said ! that. Apparently, my wife and I were disconnected for some rea! son. In those seconds, I have the following thoughts in my mind: "" I have been put into this situation against my will. Now, I have to deal with it, and manage the situation. I should not do anything wrong. I should pretend nothing is happening."" Next, my thoughts were to pull over to the side of the road and stop. However, my instincts then said not to because the object might stop in front of us and we might end up evacuating our vehicle, and what if they did the same? At this moment, I felt everything like very slow motion. I really could not tell if our tires were on the road and if I was really driving our vehicle. I felt some controlling power was in charge of our vehicle. I wonder if time was really ticking at that point. I felt some kind of calm, peace, and tranquility that were reinforced in me. All I saw from the left mirror was the surface of the object. Therefore, the object totally blocked my left mirror view. The surface of the object was gold (beige) in colo! r, and it looked porous. After these agonizing moments, the object began to distance itself from our vehicle. The object had done this very aesthetically. While the distance between us and the object was increasing gradually, the object was increasing its altitude gradually as well. Finally, there was a rightward curve on the road, and I checked where the object was from my left mirror. In this final moment, it was over the medium at the left of the left lane. It looked like it stopped there in midair. This was the last time I saw the object. I said "" the object disappeared"" out loud. My wife later said that she did not hear it either. We travelled a little bit and I said to my wife "" call police"". She was able to communicate with me at this point. She later said that after the conversation about deer, it was the only statement I made. Of course, this was not true. Because I made numerous statements after I spotted the object behind us till it disappeare! d. In this time frame, my wife claims that I did not say anyth! ing out loud, and she was looking straight ahead. Anyway, my wife said why are we calling the police. She said let it go. I said we cannot let it go. Because there were so many other vehicles on the road and someone might get hurt or even worse. I said we do our share to inform police. Since my wife forgot her phone at home that day (which is very unusual), she tried to use my phone. Next, she said she cannot call because there are no icons on my cell phone, not even a single one. I asked her if she could text message someone, but she said no way. I said forget it. There were only a couple of miles until we got home. Finally, we got home, and I parked our vehicle. After I stopped the engine, I asked my wife if she may try to call the police again. This time all the icons were there. She called Orange County police department. They transferred her to Dutchess , and Dutchess transferred her to NY State police. Finally, we informed NY state police about what happened that night. After ! that I did not want to get out of our vehicle of my fear that what if something was beneath the vehicle. After I said this comment to my wife, she said don't worry. There cannot be anything under the vehicle. Next, she opened the door and stepped out. It was my turn to open the door slowly and step out gently. Next day, my wife googled and found National UFO Research Center. She called them and put the phone on speaker. This gentleman introduced himself, his phone number, and address. He wanted us to write this incident separately including any drawings and mail it to them. The object was able to go in one direction and then the opposite. It was easily changing its altitude and speed. The object managed to come to a full stop in midair over the medium at the left of the left lane. I did not have a chance to see the bottom of it. I did not see any lights either. Apparently, my wife and I were disconnected within the time frame between the conversation about the deer (we both remember) and the conversation about calling the law enforcement (again we both remember). However, anything said between these two time frames were somehow not heard. The disconnection between me and my wife coincides with the time frame the object positioned itself to our left till the object disappeared. One last observation: I did drive there today. I recorded where we got chased. I noticed that the object chased us in some very interesting part of the highway. This part of the highway towards west (From Fishkill to Newburgh) is covered by long and high hills from both s! ides. It is like a corridor with walls at both sides. Therefore, east and west bound vehicles cannot see each other in this part of the highway. We did not see any vehicles ahead of us in this strip that night. Likewise, we did not see any vehicles behind us in the strip that night either. Apparently, we were the only vehicle passing through this part of the highway. An excellent place to hunt. The object disappeared almost where the strip ends. Afterwards, we travelled a couple of minutes where east and west bound vehicles were able to see each other. At this point a semi-truck passed us. That was the first vehicle passing us (I was very nervous when that truck was passing us). I wonder why this object crossed from right to left and then chased us over the left lane? Why it did not stay in right and chase us at the right-hand side? My wife and I will be going for a cat scan. We could not find anyone to check the radiation level of our vehicle yet.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,41.5277,-73.9072

The best explanation I can describe is this: Walking down a street on Cal Poly State University, took a right into a courtyard/grassy area between the Math/Science buildings, and almost immediately I saw what looked like a large drone (although couldn't tell what size or how far away it was), completely covered in bright, LED-like lights traveling at an insane speed (maybe 100-300 mph?), and within split seconds it vanished/faded away.  I had no drugs in my system, had sufficient sleep the night before, and I cannot imagine this was simply a hallucination.  I can't imagine this is simply a drone because what would explain the insane speed, vanishing, and no one else in sight?  It was 6:35 PM and completely dark outside.

My Dad and I pulled into the driveway and got out while my Step Mom was already inside. I was looking up at the the sky because it was a beautiful clear night. I noticed one round dim light that was above me traversing the sky. Object was not blinking and moved at a steady pace in one direction. Object appeared to be higher than a plane and I thought it could be a satellite. Within 10 seconds I noticed two more objects exhibiting the same behavior but moving in different directions. I felt the speed could have been similar to what you would see with a plane but the objects did not appear to be conventional aircraft due to lack of blinking lights and a! ltitude. I witnessed these lights for approximately 1 minute when my step mother came out of the house and noticed a row of approximately 10 to 12 lights, travelling west to east, about 60 degrees from the horizon and north of the front of the house. At this point all 3 of us witnessed these lights and we felt that we were observing something unusual. I watched the lights for about 10 seconds when I attempted to use my phone for video but could not capture the lights so, I went back to watching them. Some audio was captured of our reaction. Lights were dim, white and appeared to be evenly spaced approximately 3 to 4 feet between each one from our perspective. The row of lights did not appear to be one object. They appeared to be the size of small to medium stars.

Heavy landing. .Extremly bright white light.. No sound. Lifted singly off the ground.

No sound. Lifted singly off the ground. Strong pulse on leave that affected my printer. This event happened several months ago but I wrote what happened down at the end of the same week. I am an Army Nursing Officer in the British Army.  This event took place very near to 11 Sig Brigade HQ in Donnington, Telford.  I was alone with our 2 dogs and 2 cats in the house.  I drink very little alcohol and don’t drink in the week and  had consumed no alcohol the evening before this event took place.  I also only drink two coffees a day and was sleeping soundly until this incident occurred.  Early in the morning of 08th Sept 2020 at approx 0350hrs I was woken by a loud solid thud.  Our house is about 50 metres from a road and I thought a large truck must have hit a tree or something similar.  Because the bedroom does not look out towards the road and there are trees along the fence, I knew that if I got up and looked out the window I wouldn’t be able to see anything, so I lay awake anticipating that I would pick up flashing lights of the emergency services after 10 or 20 minutes.  Quite suddenly, after about 15 minutes my room was filled with bright light that was coming from the field just outside our garden on the same side as the bedroom window.  The light was ice white and the room became fully lit like it was daytime.  The unlined curtains were closed but the light was so bright and the experience so frightening and unusual, I didn’t dare get up to go and look out of the curtains for fear of whatever it was that was outside.  I thought it would damage my eyes to look at it.  It felt very abnormal and I was very scared in case I was in danger from whatever it was.  I stayed still in my bed because I was worried that f I moved whatever it was outside would see (and might) hurt me somehow. After about 5 minutes the large light outside started to move upwards – I could see the light rising slowly up to around 20 metres from the ground, not only through the curtains but also through the small gap where the curtains meet at the top of the window.  I ha! ve been in many situations where helicopters are present, however, another odd thing was that whatever this was seemed to make absolutely no sound.  When the thing started to move upwards,  my  dog that sleeps on the bed leapt off the bed, barking hysterically and ran onto the landing.  I followed her but really out of fear and to get away from being able to be seen through a window.  As I followed the dog onto the landing I crouched down to move to the part of the landing where I could peek round the corner and see out onto the field through the large landing window.   Suddenly there was a strong single pulse that passed through the house and right through my body.  Our HP printer sprung to life with its arm moving out in preparation to print and I was frozen by fear momentarily.  My immediate thought was that it was some sort of  pulse created by an explosion of some sort.  I thought a blast wave was going to follow in some way ( and a sudden fear swept through me that the house might collapse)  but it didn’t, in fact right at that point, the light disappeared completely and whatever it was, was suddenly gone.  I moved! slowly to the window and couldn’t see anything unusual other than clouds and stars in the sky.  The next morning when I went into camp, the internet (MODNET) on camp was ‘down’ anddidnt return to normal for 2 days.  I still haven’t got over it. I frequently wake in the very early morning and lay wondering whether it’s going to come back.  Last night for example I got up twice to look out the window to where it landed to see if anything is there. Every time I walk across where it landed I look for signs on the ground…anything at all that indicates it was there. When I think about it my inside are fearful and my eyes well up with tears. This isn’t something I imagined. It did happen – my dog barking and the printer coming to life reassures me of that. It was such an odd event.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,,

I noticed what appeared to be a white line in the sky. Kind of like the contrail of a plane. It was traveling horizontally and seemed little bit unusual. I watched it for a short while then it made an abrupt turn upward. I picked up the binoculars and saw that it became like a rocket with a large plume behind it. As it traveled upward, I watched it as the sun lit up the plume to pink. I could see that at the top it was cone shaped just like a rocket. I watched it until it disappeared into the cloud cover.

I was coming from Maryland on I-495 at about 8:40PM or 20:40, heading towards the Virginia metro area to visit my sister. The sky wasn't completely dark yet, but it was pretty close. It was around the moment National Harbor came into my view that I noticed some strange lights over the center of the bridge.  Three small white lights seemed to be slowly following one another about 50-100 feet above the bridge, right below the landing path for Reagan National Airport. I actually thought two or more planes were about to crash in midair before I realized all the lights were apart of the same moving craft. Instead of going towards Reagan to land, it drifted lazily from one side of the bridge to the other, and eventually began heading towards the VA end of the bridge following I-95, same direction I was going. I actually got pretty close to it (not right under it, but pretty darn close), and could make out a dark triangular silhouette above the bridges street lamps. The craft had a light on each vertex/tip and was about the same size as two SUVs side by side.  It was around this time my sister called me to get an ETA, that's how I'm still able to timestamp this whole thing. I explain to her what I'm seeing and stay on the phone until I eventually lose sight of the craft around 8:46PM or 20:46 when it seems to take an interest in a different road along I-95 and I pass it. I was too busy driving to get a picture.  Other Details: The Triangle (|&gt;) moved ""base"" first (|) with it's third ""vertex"" tailing behind it (&gt;). I couldn't see any features like helicopter blades, airplane wings, or a cabin/fuselage. I rolled down my window and couldn't hear any aircraft engines either. At one point the front ""base"" lifted as the craft gained some altitude (a meter or two maybe) and the back ""vertex"" dipped down before leveling out with the front, giving me a partial view of the top of the craft and an idea about its dimensions, and it almost seemed flat. Average speed I followed at was 60-70MPH, but the craft was going way slower when I first spotted it. Not to mention, it was in some pretty strict airspace with Reagan, Andrews, and D.C. all right there. Not sure what kind of pilot would have the jurisdiction to fly the way this thing did in such a sensitive area.  2020 was weird.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,38.798958214042266,-77.09513265167007

The UAP was observed flying over Hwy 59 in front of the Marriott Marquis Hotel located at: 1777 Walker St, Houston, TX 77010  UAP description: Shape: perfect sphere with metallic finish Lights: glowing or pulsating or brightening/dimming light which seemed to turn on and off or turn away from view while the UAP was perhaps turning. Sound: It emitted no discernable noise. There was background noise heard in the video of traffic 2 blocks away on a raised freeway. Size: I was able to compare the size while it was flying over moving cars just below it on Hwy 59. It was between the size of a small hatchback and a mid-sized SUV or sedan. Acceleration Speed: Silent and high speed acceleration much faster than known aircraft able to hover can move such as a helicopter or a V/STOL fixed wing aircraft like an F-35 or Sea Harrier jet.  What was observed just before the recording started: At about 6 pm, I was in awe trying to decipher what it was I was witnessing. This extremely bright and pulsating/glowing on/off spherical craft making no noise was making uncanny aerobatics, quickly zipping away into the background out of sight beyond even more buidings downtown. At this point the light seemed to go completely off and I was able to observe the perfectly spherical shape with my naked eye. Within only a few seconds, it zipped back into view closer to my position, once again above Hwy 59 at an altitude of approximately 450-600 feet. I estimated this based off of the fact that the craft was slightly to the right of the 28 story Marriott from my vantage point and just above the rooftop. After the 45-60 second aerial demonstration (unrecorded), the UAP moved closer to my position while moving to my left at which point I started recording. Some moments of particular interest in the video are when the light is see! n to get much brighter and when you can see the brown colored elevator shaft of the building I was on in frame with the orb and how it moves rather quickly to the left just before disappearing out of view behind the building.  Observers: Primary observer is myself and I am a 40-year-old male with a degree in marketing who works in sales in the oil and gas business in Houston, TX. Interests include learning to pilot fixed wing aircraft as well as rotary wing aircraft. When I was around 12 years old living in Brisbane, Australia, I saw what seemed to be an airplane flying along the horizon make an instant 90° turn launching straight into space at extremely fast rates. This was my only other UFO experience.  Secondary observer is my wife, a 28-year-old Argentine female who was distracted and editing TikTok videos on her iPhone while listening through her AirPods.  Conclusion: I have always admired aircraft my whole life so I have some good knowledge about helicopters, airplanes, and drones. I cannot identify what it was I saw and the most likely thing it could be is a drone. I have never seen a car-sized drone perfectly shaped sphere able to emit no noise. I am a logical person I can only conclude this is a secret government aircraft or something not of this planet.

Witness: DLT My location: Southeast Shreveport City: Shreveport  The following is my best account of what I saw in the NW of a partially cloudy Shreveport sky as I was walking to my vehicle before leaving to Kroger grocery.  At approximately 10:35 c.s.t. when walking to my vehicle in the parking lot of my apartment complex I observed what at first thought was just another bright star in the Northwestern sky of Shreveport, La. Then I looked back up to give it full attention, but the white star-like orb disappeared, i.e., dimmed out and then another round orb less bright (same shape and color) appeared behind it and appeared to follow the first brighter one and then it disappeared until 1 or 2 other star-like orbs appeared to be following the one prior to each and I could tell all the objects/orbs were circling like a vortex in a sort of holding pattern; again, each light was perfectly round and solid white, whereby, at that time of day I'm having to rule out solar reflection because of the time of day. These objects just emitted their own light.  Further, the entire bunch of orbs/star-like orbs moved slowly in tandem across the Northwest night sky from west southwest to a generally east northeast direction. The orbs seemed to be ""orbiting"" or circling in a slightly non-tangential angle in reference to the ground; meaning if you were to lay an imaginary flat board or planar monolith, so to speak on top of the orbs then the plane resting on the orbiting objects would be tilted 5-10 degrees in reference away from the earth. Enough so, that I could see that these things were spinning in succession in a counter clockwise fashion from my point because of the tilted axis of the vortex. However, I could not see the back 60 -70% of the circle as they would move away, but i could see them reappear fairly quickly when they would return towards me on their little orbit enough so that you could deduce that they were actually spinning on some sort of controlled spin. I could not make out any solid structure where pos! sibly these lights could have been attached to because it was just too dark. I was battling light across from the Tinsel Town Theatre which glared into my smart phone as i did record these lights, but its very diminished in quality because of the phone itself and bright theatre lights.  The lights were there for about 45 seconds to 1 minute of my time since I happened to catch this heading out to the store for a few things. If I had not gone back into my apartment to retrieve my grocery list, then I would have probably missed this incident and, therefore, departed before the occurrence.  I have seen many things in the sky and how they move and/or behave and I have to say that this has me befuddled. I work at an airport so I have a solid foundation of what  airplanes/helicopters look like and how they look in the night sky. There were no navigation lights (red or green) or tail section white lights. I have heard of Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, but these objects didn't move like a standard satellite in reference to the earth. I have personally seen the International Space Station (ISS) and you see a fairly big bright round light (because of solar reflection) break the west horizon if its a high cloud base or clear skies; but it steadily moves overhead in a straight line until you see the ISS disappear over the opposite direction. The ISS sighting is a straight path, horizon to horizon, west to east, southwest to northeast, in reference to where you are. Also, police drones would have to be ruled out because these were at least a couple thousand feet an! d even night searching choppers are closer to the ground when using their searchlights.  I'm going to have to call this my first UFO sighting at age 49. I will report this to MUFON or the National UFO reporting agency to have this on record. Maybe, someone can come forward later and shed some light, no pun intended, on my experience. Maybe someone else saw this, but just didn't think more of it. My jury is still out on what this could have been. I did a screen capture of the google mapped area with a vector line drawn for direction of the approximate sighting. Also, a small private plane crashed into Cross Lake the next day which is in the general NW direction of my prior night's sighting which may have nothing to do with my sighting at all, but is a little peculiar with the timing and general location of my sky sighting and since the crash is an aviation event; just thought I would mention this for people who have lots more time than I have for further investigation.

It flew left to right, headed and flying perpendicular to I95 North, toward a huge yellow Full Moon low on the horizon.  I called my mom and told her to come outside and then my boyfriend who was at my house and they got in the car and we drove looking for it.

I saw what, at first, appeared to be a star / plane-like object (yellowish-orange in color) moving fairly normally downwards in the sky near the 2nd star of the Big Dipper handle at roughly commercial airplane altitude.  But then, a few seconds later, what caught my eye was that this object performed a sudden - albeit slight - turn in direction (no more than 30 degrees).  It wasn't a gradual, arc-like turn but rather a pretty sudden turn on a point in the sky.  A couple seconds later, it repeated a similar turn on another point in the sky.  4-5 such turns were made within the span of 15-20 seconds so that after that time the object had completely changed its direction and was now heading upwards in the sky on the other side of the same star of the Dipper...and then it (g! radually) disappeared.  From a physics standpoint, it was as if something had entered the atmosphere, took this unusual path, and then exited the atmosphere.  I am 43 years old and I had never seen anything like this before.  It became obvious that it was neither a plane nor a meteor.  I thought that it could, perhaps, be some kind of satellite capable of making such sudden turns...but I later discovered that such motion was impossible for satellites as well (unless something catastrophic was happening with the satellite).  Just when I thought I'd seen a one-time unusual event...about 5 minutes later I see a similar yellowish-orange object appear just outside the the far side of the Big Dipper pan and slowly making its way under the pan and towards the handle.  This time, I quickly called attention to the object to both my girlfriend and another guest at the gathering (he was about 60 years old) and they both confirmed that the strange object was neither a plane nor a meteo! r.  The object continued on its trajectory across that part of! the sky making a gradual arc (straighter than the first) in that part of the sky until it had passed the Big Dipper handle.

There was a strange craft that was only a few miles from the tree tops about 2 miles from me. It had strange flashing lights and kept hovering straight up and down. When it got very high in the sky, it would almost look like it was trying to mask itself as a star except that I could tell the lights were flashing and I had been following it since it was close to the tree tops. It kept going up and down and hoovering, and my attention was first brought to it by my dog and many other dogs in the neighborhood barking at it. I do live near naval bases and DC, so it could have been something military related. I did see at least one jet ""flying dark"" above my head with all its lights off except for a blinking red light. I cannot be sure of what the craft was except that it stayed in the sky for a very long time, but at a much higher altitude to mask itself as! a star maybe, but it's not part of our normal night sky. It seemed that it could mask itself to look like a star if no one really looked at it, knew that it isn't part of the night sky, or saw it at a lower altitude like I did. I felt like it might have been a form of camouflaging itself. I take all of that with a grain of salt. What I truly want to report about the incident is that at one point I walked outside and could hear what sounded like whales or dolphins speaking to each other from all around me in the sky. The sounds were not in any pattern or rhythm. It sounded organic and fluid, and it sounded like a beautiful conversation. It felt like it was all around me, just as if I were under water listening for the origin of a sound. The best I can describe it as the sound of whales singing songs, but in the sky.

I walked about 8 paces down my walkway from my front door and looked up at the sky (as I always do). I immediately saw 4 PERFECTLY spaced lights moving slowly. The lights were white, just like the stars, and there was no trail of any kind. I was confused at first as these lights didn't belong to any of the constellations or normal organization of the stars. Then I realized they were moving. The lights were heading North, Northeast. I was watching for about 10 seconds then the lights started to turn off or disappear 1 by 1, starting with the most Northern light (or the light farthest to the right). There was an airplane flying more North of these lights, heading Southeast, at what appeared to be a lower altitude. It was simply extraordinary. I said I saw 1 or 4 craft because at first I thought it was 4 separate crafts since there were 4 lights. However, late! r that evening, I thought it actually could have been 1 large craft with 4 visible lights since the lights were perfectly spaced and moved with perfect synchronization. The lights (or craft) were directly west of the Cassiopeia constellation (through Pegasus, according to Google Sky). The lights were a bit bigger than the rest of the stars in the sky which made them noticeable as well. So amazing.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I was driving east on Burbank Blvd. just west of Van Nuys Blvd. The sky was very clear and it was 3:45 in the afternoon.  I looked up in the sky and saw a white, perhaps metallic white(?) object hovering in the sky, perhaps about 10 to 15 thousand feet up. It was not moving and just floating there.  Something caught my attention far to the left and I realized there was another identical object hovering as well, not moving, seemingly not being buffeted by the wind.  As I drove and kept staring at the first object I noticed, while occasionally looking at the other one to see if it moved (neither of them seemed to be moving) more objects appeared behind the first one.  When I say behind what I mean is that they seemed to be higher up in the atmosphere, perhaps 40 thousand feet? Again they appeared white or metallic white, perfectly round and while some of them were remaining still a couple did seem to be moving.  One seemed to be going up and the other down, then left and right.  Going to state right now I may be wrong on this one as I was craning my neck around and also for whatever reason having a hard time recalling exactly what happened because it felt pretty extraordinary and I am a bit dumbfounded as to why no one seemed to notice these things other me...though I suppose a case could be made that most people when driving keep their eyes on the road, which is the safer choice.  I pulled over into the parking lot of a small strip mall and hopped out of my car to take some photos.  Because of the glare on my phone and the fact that my phones camera isn't great I wasn't quite sure if I was getting photos of anything.  I did end up snapping a few photos of both the original object and the one to its right (my left) and while I could see the other objects behind the original one none seem to have been captured on camera. The photos aren't very good.  I hopped back into my car and it couldn't have been more than 30 to 45 seconds before I was back on Burbank moving east and in that 45 seconds (maximum) all of the objects seem to have vanished except the original one which was still hovering in place and had not moved the entire time.  So honestly I don't think they were drones, because the altitude would mean these were the biggest drones in the world and that they were spherical, definitely not planes. Perhaps weather balloons or some sort of lantern but again the original one never moved just hovered still and I think even if by some miracle there was absolutely no wind up that high the thing would still bob around or something if it was balloon.  One thing that happened that I just don't understand was as I hopped out of my car to take photos I noticed to older men in front of a cafe having coffee and talking. As I took the photos I turned to them and asked them to look and tell me what they think.  They smiled, said nothing and then just went back to talking about golf. I don't understand why someone would simply be curious enough to even look.  So that's it, very odd, no one else seemed to notice it and I'm stumped.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,34.14653157894737,-118.4467076555024

Then I realized the “third star” was not a star at all.  It began to move, and quickly. The white orb moved directly north until it was too small to see anymore.  It was unlike anything I’ve ever seen, and it was not flashing red or any color like a plane or satellite.  I have seen 2 ufos before this in my entire life.

I parked my car in the corner of the lot and looked up at the treeline on the low hill that makes up the far side (east) of the lot. Its a suburban area outside of Milwaukee. Im on a commercial lot on the highway,, lots of fast food and strip malls, i think there's residential further back from the road. Its not the middle of nowhere. At first I thought it was someone with a flashlight either on a walk or maybe looking to break into my building. People walk by on the street occasionally sometimes a car drives through but never up on the hill its wooded theres no road or sidewalk up there.  Appearance: the coloring was off for a flashlight,l like a wierd combination of 2 kinds of bulbs. The color was bright white like LED headlights but had an orange halo glow like old streetlights and the glow slightly lit up the immediate trees. The bright white seemed to face one direction at a time but always perfectly angled the same way like it was staring at something constantly while the orange hue was slight but all directions. it was enough to light up trees behind it. I didn't hear it made any sound, though I was in my patrol car with the engine and air on.  Movement: It moved back and forth too fast for anyone on foot and at either end it would abruptly stop, bounce slightly and reverse direction. The path took about 5 seconds to cover maybe 50-100 yards. I'm not sure how far away it was exactly but this is all within maybe 500 yards of me. Theres just not enough room back there to be any further you run into houses. But then it faded back into the trees out of sight, very slowly, about 20 seconds.  I was trying to write it in my log when it reappeared at the edge of the treeline and shot up and down. Then it zipped southeast along the edge of the lot/treeline when it went behind my building and I lost sight. I added that to my log and drove around to see if I could spot it again but there was nothing. I drove around on patrol and saw nothing.  Time stamp: First sighting was 21:34 and lasted less than 2 minutes, second was maybe 30 seconds with maybe 2 minutes in between but I looked away at times. Lost sight clock said 21:37, just before 21:38 I guess. Again I tried writing in the log as accurate as possible but that meant looking away.  Drone possibility: it could possibly been a drone but it would have yo be an incredible skilled pilot to fly between trees at night. The 'spotlight' was fixed perfectly on one spot no matter how it moved except when it faded away. When it disappeared the spotlight dimmed a lot, like 80% of its brightness. I dont know how a drone has a spotlight that can aim so perfectly. It shot up and down too high too fast for a drone it was like a fireworks rocket for 100 ft up then just as fast down, with the 'spotlight' changing angles perfectly to stay on whatever target.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,43.051744026104416,-87.95998544176706

We’d been outside for about 5 minutes and I was looking at Mars and then looking at Orion when something caught my eye.  It was a blinking strobe-like light like the kind you see on airplanes that are very high in the sky.  I thought to myself, this is a very high flying airplane, so I started watching it.  It was about 70 degrees up and approximately due east and to the left of Orion but higher.  It was headed towards me and I estimated it to be very high (a few miles high – like as high as an airplane that is at cruising altitude).  Then I noticed that the white light was blinking three times, then off for a ½ second then the light was green and again blinking three times and then off and then a solid red light for about one second.  I realized that this was the same pattern each time repeating I believe five times.  I knew now it wasn’t an airplane because the lights just don’t t! urn colors like that – usually you see blinking white lights with a green and red light for each wing.  Now, I’m thinking it’s a helicopter maybe as the police helicopter is usually flying around the area but not way up in the sky like this.  I’ve now been observing this for about a minute.  It seemed to stop now and was about 75 degrees up.  That’s when it freaked me out.  The last time it went through the white, green and then red on sequence, as the light was still red, it suddenly-and to my surprise-shot off to the right and down at about a 120 degree angle at an impossible speed for an airplane or anything else for that matter.  It was now behind the trees that are off to the right and I could not see it. I moved to the right and left about 20 paces to get a clear view and it was simply gone.  Also about this time, my dog started barking very loudly like she would if there was someone at the door.  Now I’m spooked and a little scared.  I’m convinced what I saw was not ! something conventional like a plane or a helicopter because I ! know wha t they look like and how they maneuver in the sky.  This thing darted down and over in a split second.  When I saw this – it didn’t register right away but then I realized my god I’ve just seen something very very weird.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,,

I did not notice the object until I reviewed the videos that I had collected on the sd card in my drone. I was flying my DJI drone over the green belt behind my house when my low battery indicator came on so I lowered the gimbal to look straight down while descending to the takeoff point. The drone was at 300 ft when it captured the fast moving object that looks like white slightly stretched ball although that could be motion blur. The object is only visible in three frames of the 30 FPS I was shooting in. The object is moving much faster then any bird or insect I have captured in hd. I recently watched a show called contact on the discovery network witch aired a segment of a very similar incident. A drone pilot was capturing b roll when he also captures a fast moving object. He also noticed it later when reviewing the vid. I believe have the same thing stored on my laptop and sd card.,2021-05-20T00:00:00,47.29995649484537,-122.18088288659793

I am 70 years old. I have seen a few odd things in the sky in my life but this was the most unusual and unexplained.  I’m reporting this recent sighting because I have seen nothing about it on any news outlet. I was so shocked by what I saw that I thought it would be global news.  This is my account of what I saw in the sky on May 3, 2021 in Brandon, Ms. I was outside in the early evening working on a new front porch addition. I noticed that it was 7:30 pm and looked up to the sky as I was sitting down to see if I could see bats flying overhead. I had noticed bats coming out to eat insects the evening before at that same time and wanted to see if they were out again and they were. As I was looking to the north, I saw a very bright object. I thought maybe it was Venus because it was so bright and big but it was in the wrong place and this object had an odd flare coming out of one side of it almost like a comet trail but very short. It sort of looked like what you would see if you threw paint ball on a flat surface and it splattered a bit in one direction– round with a few rays and a bit smudged.  When I noticed the flare, I ran inside to get my binoculars and lost a minute or two looking. All I could fine was my oversize pair so I grab them and went back outside. The object was still there and had grown larger but the flare was gone. I tried to focus on it. My binoculars are very large and hard to handle without a mount but I was able to focus on it and I was shocked into disbelief. I had no idea what I was looking at.  It looked like miniature moon about 3 or 4 time the size of Venus as observed from earth and just as bright.  It was bright silver with shaded areas and absolutely round.  There was not another light in the sky – no stars, no planets and the sky was still filled with light from the sun as it was setting. There was a storm rolling in, a tornado watch and the sky was a bit hazy. I doubt that there were many people in my area outside looking up at the time.  I put the binoculars down and picked up my phone to bring up my astronomy app to see if I could identify what it was that I was seeing. As I was fiddling with my phone to bring up the app ( I have to take my case off because it has a magnet on it and that destroys the accuracy of the compass and it doesn’t work for positioning)  the object started dimming and shrinking in size as if it was now heading away from my perspective. When I saw it dim, I knew the app wouldn’t recognize this strange object because it was nothing normal about it.  I decided to try to get a picture of it before it was gone and I did snap a few pictures before it disappeared but the contrast between the object and the sky was low for a camera because it was still pretty much daylight. I accidentally took 2 one second videos and they came out better than the pictures. I put the phone down and watched the object as it narrowed down to a point of light and vanished. When the object was heading away it remained perfectly round as shrunk in size and brightness.  In the two short videos you can see the effect of the atmosphere as it distorts the shape of the object. I am an amateur astronomer and I am very familiar with atmospheric distortion and the distortion I see in the videos tells me the object was above our atmosphere. I wish I could have gotten some photos of it when I first saw it because it was much bigger plus it had a flare at first but I was stunned and was kind of wondering if this was doomsday.  My first thought when I saw the object in my binoculars was that something huge was about to hit earth unannounced. It looked like a rouge moon headed directly for us. When it started moving away, I felt relief as it shrunk in size. I knew that it must be traveling at an extreme speed the way it disappeared. The whole event lasted about 5 minutes. The object pretty much stayed in the same location in the sky and did not jump or dart around. I didn’t see it come into view – it was just there when I looked up and it only moved a little in position when it took off. There was no sound, no flashing light and the only colors I saw was sliver and gray. Since it was hazy during the observation, I have to question the detail that I saw on the object. I now assume that maybe I was seeing cloud vapor super imposed on the object and that vapor gave it the darker areas in the disk I viewed that resembled the terrain of the moon. Now my question is – Did anybody else see this object?   My guess was that it was an asteroid making a very close fly-by but the news and the astronomy groups are saying nothing about it.  It’s seems impossible that no one else noticed it. It’s a complete mystery to me.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,32.318232,-89.92468857142858

Good Morning,  Approximately 7:35am to 7:40am I was alerted by my daughter of something strange in the sky. Followed by my son who ran inside to tell me to come outside.  I looked up into the sky to see a strange gray disc like object that was not moving. Just suspended in the air. I saw some of the kids on the bus get out with their phones up and even the bus driver was looking out of his driver side window. I’m not sure if any of the parents present saw it but at the time my phone was on the charger and my kids had theirs in their pocket.  I’m pretty sure if any of the kids with their phones up were recording it’s likely a TikTok by now or some other form of popular media as they’re all middle school to high school students. The object took off straight up until it disappeared. I have flown in airplanes, crop planes, and helicopters. I own two drones and have some expertise in maneuvers concerning aircraft dynamics, not to say I’m a scientist but I know enough to accurately state that with the knowledge I have now that no air craft can move that fast going upwards and disappear in literal seconds.  Also, the way this gray disc was hovering made me think it could be spinning slowly, may had some propulsion from either side. The skies are completely blue with hardly any clouds and the fact it didn’t have wings and remained stationary in the air seems suspect for a craft re-entering Earth’s atmosphere and is not a balloon or other helium or gas powered object. This was perfectly still except for the small side to side swaying that was almost too precise to be called anything other than stabilizing in the jet stream.  The fact the craft or whatever it was had been able to shoot straight up without moving forward, backwards, or to the side seems impractical. I cannot think of anything else that I know about which can achieve rapid acceleration almost as if breaching the stratosphere and into what I can only speculate is outer space.  I called the local non emergency line and was told I’m not the first to report it but it’s likely a military craft or a science project from something.  I don’t know what else to say about this except I am confused and confounded by what I saw.  What all of us witnessed, honestly.

The three I eventually spotted were rather far out over the ocean—a few miles and were arranged in a perfect equilateral triangle with the apex the furthest out over the ocean. On other days I've had different friends who also witnessed the object(s) which have looked very similar—a brightly lit, multi-color orb that hovers and sometimes changes in shape, sometimes expands and contracts. And sometimes it is moving up the coast like a bright light. Before last night, 5/4/21, for the last 10 days, I had noticed only one of these orbs but in the same location, near where the star Sirius in the western night sky, which is also near the constellation Orion. The orb appears planted in the sky at about the same height as the normal flight path of the military he! licopters, or maybe a little higher, (which are out patrolling every single night) but the orbs were unmoving and almost disguised as a star. For a long time I didn’t notice it because it looked just like a brightly lit star but upon videotaping, it clearly is not a star. I've also videotaped it with helicopters flying past it, too, and it is definitely different than the helicopters. I've witnessed these orbs on different occasions off the coast of San Diego over the ocean, infrequently now for about a year, sometimes playing with the military, sometimes being followed by them, and sometimes much closer than they were last night, but haven’t made any reports until now. But now the frequency has changed dramatically as they have shown up every night. Last night the orbs were just planted in the sky and the military helicopters were ignoring them. The strange thing is how long they seem to just be planted there without moving—far longer than a helicopter or a drone can hover! , totally without sound, and the strangest part was that they’! ve been planted there for many days in a row. I start to notice them just as the sky gets dark enough. Unfortunately all of my videos are shaky and don’t show the way the orbs are just planted in the sky but the colors of the objects are dancing and shifting—you can see that much. I’ve ordered a new lens and tripod for my camera phone to continue collecting data which is very shocking to me. I was a big skeptic about all of this until I had other witnesses confirm. I fully expect them to be there again tonight. They have stayed in place without moving until I got tired and went home for the evening all of these nights. Last night I don’t recall missing time but I have had contact experiences in the past. The beach here where I live is very quiet and dark and private with tall hundred foot bluffs behind me. I generally watch the sunset on the beach every night and started seeing strange lights a year ago but for a long time believed it was just the military until some very strange th! ings happened—like the orbs sometimes shoot across the sky. I also saw a recent display of 4 or 5 of them together fading in and out disappearing and have that on video as well.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,33.0468724137931,-117.25621206896552

The light hung directly above the cloud line. At first, I thought it may have been a tall building or another plane, but I saw the city lights below and realized that no building would have been tall enough to reach such heights. I realized it wasn’t another plane as the light stayed consistent and did not move. I watched it for a few moments and saw another plane in the distance fly in front of it.  At that point, I was able to gauge the size of it. The plane that flew in front of the light appeared small compared to the light behind it. At that point, I decided to take a photo.&#8232; 	Moments later, I heard a few other passengers talking about the strange light. I did not engage with them. The light stayed in the same place. If the light had been sitting in the exact same place, it would have moved out of sight of my window. It stayed in the exact same place relative to my window. That’s when I realized the light must have been moving at the same speed that we were flying.

It moved upward and then started to make unnatural movements laterally. Over the course of about 3 minutes it moved higher into the sky and continued to make unnatural movements to the left and right. The light would occasionally pause and remain still for a few moments. &#8232; 	Eventually, the light moved back toward the rear of the plane and I could no longer see it out the window.&#8232;	 The city I listed is an approximate location based on the time and flight path that I looked up after I landed. &#8232; 	Unfortunately, I had fallen asleep at some point during my flight.

On January 14th, 2020 I was driving down the highway, heading home for my lunch break to let my dog out for food and a bio break. I noticed a large dark rectangular object in the sky about a mile down the road that appeared to be floating in the sky. It flew slowly, almost like it was floating, over the highway I was driving on. At first, I didn’t think twice about it as it was heading towards our airport. So, I figured it was an airplane, but I still watched it while I was driving and witnessed it fade away, presumably into a cloud from what I could tell. So, I thought the sighting was over, but it wasn’t. The object faded back into view and floated back across the highway heading to where it first appeared. It kept on moving away from the highway and then stopped about a quarter mile away the highway and descended towards the ground in a straight and steady line with no wavering motion.  I wish I could have gotten a video instead of the picture from my car! . By the time I got video ready on my phone, it had already descended behind the tree line. I looked around the sky for it as I drove down my residential street, where it looked like it might have descended, but I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. A video would have been so much more telling than the photo I took, but I have a before and after picture that shows the object in the sky and one that shows no sign of the flying object. Clearly it wasn’t a normal object on a pole or tower or something and was definitely not an airplane, and too large to be a toy drone. When I returned to work, about an hour later I went deaf for about 30 seconds with a loud ringing in my ears, I couldn't hear the person talking to me. Not saying the two are related, but certainly not ruling it out either. My background is clean, I don't drink alcohol, I have never used any drugs and was not on any prescription drugs at the time of this sighting.

This wasn’t an isolated curiosity however — instead, it was just one more incident among scores seen by Phillips County residents and hundreds more witnessed by other individuals stretching from Omaha to Denver.  So prevalent had the sightings been up to that point that just hours before this particular incident Phillips County Sheriff Charlie Radabaugh issued a public statement saying “They’re not hurting anything. &#8200;They’re annoying.  Is there anything criminal?  Not really.”  The following day, the sheriff’s office followed up by stating “Earlier today, Sheriff Radabaugh was contacted by the FBI inquiring about the drone sightings in the area.  No new information on the situation was received from them.  We ask that since the aircraft are likely being operated by someone near them, that you report any suspicious vehicles you may see so we can attempt to contact and identify them.”  Individuals familiar with regulations regarding the operation of drones point to a requirement to obtain an FAA waiver to operate at night above people.  Speculation has focused on several theories including: 1) A large number of unrelated aircraft received as Christmas presents being put up into the air around the holidays 2) An operation by a government agency hoping to scare up a public reaction forcing regulations requiring privately owned drones to start carrying identifying signals 3) Invaders from Mars  Some tongue-in-cheek humor was discovered in downtown Phillipsburg last week. Courtesy photo Some tongue-in-cheek humor was discovered in downtown Phillipsburg last week. Courtesy photo CNN News, which has picked up the story, notes “The incidents come as the FAA is proposing new rules that will require most drones to use remote ID technology that will allow the FAA, law enforcement and federal security agencies to identify drones flying in their jurisdiction.” If a single entity is involved it would have to be well-heeled.  Heeled to the tune of seven figures for this expansive of an operation, since witnesses have stated these are not hobbyist aircraft, but are at least six-to-ten feet in diameter and have been sighted flying in groups of 10 in Phillips County, and up to 30 in Nebraska and Colorado.  With no one claiming responsibility for what seems to be a high -dollar enterprise encompassing around 150,000 square miles, the FAA and the U.S. Air Force have both taken positions of having no knowledge regarding what’s going on.  Austin Thalheim, Long Island, first noticed the drones around Thursday, Jan. 2.  ""About last Thursday up until now, there’s been anywhere from 15 to 20 flying around at night,"" he said. ""About every night, it seems like people are out driving around, trying to get a better view of them. I’d be interested to know who it is and have them tell us what’s going on.”  Law enforcement in two counties in northeast Colorado put together a task force specifically to look into the reports occurring there. With multiple deputies out in the field on the night of Dec. 20 they were able to track at least 16 drones.  Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner issued a press release earlier this month stating he personally spoke with the administrator of the FAA, who advised him his agency has people on the ground who are working with federal law enforcement to track down the operator of the drones.  One sheriff in Colorado even issued a request for people to be on the lookout “for the command vehicle, a closed box trailer, or van with antennas that look suspicious.”  Within 24 hours, he retracted the request, with other officials engaged in the investigation saying authorities were never looking for any such ground vehicle in the first place.

They appeared about the size that Venus appeared at the same time, and seemed to be a little less bright, or at least more yellow to the color.  No other structure could be seen associated with the lights.  They appeared to be almost perfectly, equally spaced from each other, forming a perfectly straight line staring from lower left to upper right, making roughly a 45 degree angle with the horizon.  This is a rough estimate, but I would say they were located maybe between 15 and 30 degrees above the horizon.  As far as distance from where we were standing, it was very hard to gauge, but my best guess would be between a few miles to maybe 50 miles.  The person I was with pointed them out to me, and we watched them for about a minute, as they appeared to be moving slightly towards us, then slightly north, maintaining the same ! formation the entire time.  Then, just as they appeared to move north, they started to fade out and not be visible anymore, starting with the lights at each end of the line.  It almost appeared that they were turning and the lights were no longer facing us, but they did not reappear as I observed for about 20 minutes afterwards, so I think they just faded/turned off.  The movement was not along the direction of the line, but was perpendicular to the line.  The movement was also very slow, in fact I was not even sure that the line was moving at all until it moved slightly to the north.  I read your requests to not report the SpaceX Starlink satellites, and I don’t believe that is what I saw.  I looked it up afterwards and did find a number of stories referring to people sighting these strings of lights.  However, the ones I saw appeared to be cloud-level, not moving along an orbital path, and the angle in relation to the ground would not make sense for where they were in the sky, but I can not completely discount this possibility.  My friend suggested a group of drones, but I can not really see that as the formation remained equally-spaced and along a line for the entire encounter.  The weather conditions were fairly calm at the ground, but even so they would have to be pretty high-end to keep such a tight formation.  I am generally a skeptic of such sightings (not a non-believer though), but the location in the sky, the formation, and the pattern of movement all leave me with no solid explanation at the moment.  I have a degree in physics, so I am generally aware of the possibilities outside our planetary sphere, and I have spent plenty of time stargazing, so this really did make an impression on me to start looking this far into it.",2020-12-23T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

Cigar-shaped UFO with small UFOs coming out of it that perform amazing aeronautics.,Dove Creek,CO,,cigar,20 minutes,"Occurred : 6/15/1956 09:00  (Entered as : 06/15/56 09:00) Reported: 3/16/2021 12:54:28 PM 12:54 Posted: 3/31/2021 Location: Dove Creek, CO Shape: Cigar Duration:20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/162/S162383.html,"Cigar-shaped UFO with small UFOs coming out of it that perform amazing aeronautics. Background  Just before Christmas in 1955,  when I was seven-years-old, my family moved from a uranium mining camp located on the Dolores River, some 24 miles north of Dove Creek, Colorado, relocating to Moab, Utah.  My Dad told me that most of the guys that worked at the mine were veterans from WWII, but they didn’t talk about the war.  One of them gave me a large model of a navy destroyer, one that matched the ship he had served on.  Audie Murphy had just appeared in ""To Hell and Back,"" and we went to the drive-in at Cortez, Colorado to see the movie. These facts would be important to my perception of what was to happen.  In June 1956, my parents took me back to Colorado, where I spent a week at the home of my friend, Frankie.  We ran all over the hills, playing and when it rained, we did our best to catch a rainbow to see if there really was a pot of gold.  No matter how fast we went, the end of the rainbow kept ahead of us.  On Friday, my parents drove to Colorado to pick me up and to take Frankie back to Moab.  Our elementary school was in Egnar (Range spelled backwards) surrounded by farms, many of which were bean fields.  It was after work on Friday when my parents drove to Colorado and it was dark by the time we headed back toward Moab, probably 9 pm or later.  What We Saw  As we headed west on Highway 491 maybe a mile or two east of the Colorado-Utah border, my Mom spotted what appeared to be a bright light on the north side of the highway, lighting up the field below it.  She asked Frankie, ""Why do they have lights in the bean fields?""  He assured her that they didn’t do that.  The light was very bright and looked like it was just high enough to be at the top of a light pole.  While the road was level, there was a small embankment of varying heights between the road and the fields to the north.  As we drove closer to the light, it was obscured now and then by the high spots of the embankment.  When we got to the point that the light was directly to the north of us, the bright light shot directly up into the sky, stopping at a level that might have been 300 or so feet above the ground.  When we first saw it from a distance, the light looked like a round spot.  When we drove up to it, it was not round at all.  It was shaped like a long cigar, with rounded ends.  My Dad pulled the car over and we parked at the side of the road to watch the light.  It was a bright bluish-white.  Because of the distance we were away, it was difficult to say exactly how long it was, maybe 100 feet or so.  As we watched, several smaller round lights came out of the west (left) end of ship, maybe 8-10 or so.  They lined up under the main ship, in a line parallel to it.  The exception was the 2nd or 3rd light, that was out of line, maybe 10 to 20 feet below the rest.  Then, a larger, brighter round light came out of the main ship.  As it went under the line of smaller lights, the one that was out of line moved up to the line, putting them all into a straight line.  I observed at the time that the bigger ship was acting like a drill sergeant and the lights were the trainees.  He was there to get them into shape and keep them in line.  (My perspective came from the Audie Murphy movie, I suspect.)  Then, they put on a show of dazzling aeronautics that was wonderful.  Each “trainee” would shoot directly toward the ground and make a 90-degree turn just above the ground, go about 100-200 feet then shoot directly upward, and then back to the line where it had started.  Some took diagonal courses, but most were 90-degree course changes.  They did not slow as they made the corners.  They were very, very fast.  We had been to the drive-in movie in Cortez several times, including To Hell and Back and my favorite, Davy Crockett.  There were times when the movie screen went dark and we were invited to visit the snack bar for over-priced food.  Many cars in the 1950’s had spotlights.  During the time when the screen was black, a number of drivers would shine their spotlights on the screen and play tag with each other.  The spotlights dashed right to left, up and down, and every direction, without accelerating or slowing when they made a “corner.”  That is a perfect comparison to what we were seeing in the sky that night.  There were two differences though.  First, when the lights took off or made corners, they would change from blue to a yellowish, almost orange color, then back to blue as they sped straight ahead.  Second, they made a humming sound that we could hear, though we were maybe 100 yards away from them.  I recognized that sound.  When Frankie and I were out playing on the fields that week, I heard a low humming sound.  As we got closer to the high-power lines crossing the fields, it was obvious that they were the source of the hum.  The small lights made the same humming sound as they did their “training exercises.”  We watched the “show” for maybe 15 minutes.  My little sister, aged 6, was totally silent.  Frankie was shaken and began to cry.  My Mom assured him that we were safe.  The objects didn’t do anything to acknowledge that we were watching and had made no moves toward us.  Frankie stopped crying, but wasn’t certain we were safe.  The end of the show came when all of the lights ended their training and the all headed directly north as a small company of recruits, led by a sergeant and the main ship.  My Dad said, “We need to tell someone before they get away!” and drove west to the Highway Patrol Weigh Station, just a few minutes away.  When we got there, we got the trooper to come out and look.  By then, the lights were so far away that they were lost among the stars and their motion was not obvious.  He couldn’t see them.  Then What?  When we got back home to Moab, we told everyone.  Dad was called “flying saucer boy” at work and soon learned to keep his mouth shut.  It was summer, so I couldn’t tell my schoolmates.  Frankie didn’t want to talk about it.  Life went on.  We never saw anything like it again, even though we often searched the skies for moving lights.  I'm 72 now and that is the long version of our short experience.",,37.7062,-109.0199

I hope you take old sightings.  This happened 30 miles east of Cleveland, 3 miles from Lake Erie, around 1963 on a weekend in July.  My house was the second from the end of the road.  Past the end was a young woods that had just been cleared for a housing development.  Nothing drove around out there except bulldozers and dump trucks.  They hadn’t even started the roads yet.  To the far side was a road with no buildings through that stretch.  To the right, about half a mile away, was an elementary school but it was closed for the summer.  To the left was more woods.  On this night, around 2:00 AM, Johnny and I had just finished setting up my telescope in the front yard, all except the lenses, to view Saturn when a light streaked overhead.  I thought it was a meteor and turned around to see where it went.  Out in that construction area was a bright light shaped like a large coke can, or maybe an open door in something?  Johnny said he could see a structure around it.  We talked about going to see it but decided to get the lenses and look at it through the telescope first.  We ran the fifty feet back to the house and as I opened the door I looked back and it was gone.  We went out the next day to look for marks it may have left but it was a large rough construction site so we didn’t find any.  I'm an amateur astronomer and had a friend who taught astronomy at Case Western Reserve  University in Cleveland.  I used to go there to visit him at the Warner Swasey Observatory.  I called my friends there to see if a large meteor or anything had been reported, they said no.  Over the years I’ve gotten together with Johnny a few times.  Every time we would talk about the sighting.  We basically remembered the same thing.  But his story was a little more detailed each time.  The last time he said he could see a large craft, landing struts and creatures walking around outside the door.  I still remember it just as a large bright off white light shaped like a coke can.  I still think it might have been a window or an open door in something.  Added note:  I’ve heard and read that some people think UFOs might be attracted to power plants.  So this might be interesting:  Three miles straight north of where we were, on the shore of Lake Erie, was Cleveland's largest power plant.  It was a problem at that plant that caused the last great power outage that knocked out power for most of the north east US.",,41.6502,-81.4533

NUFORC report  I was abducted a number of times between 1984 and 1990.  The first time was near Salem, Indiana in 1984. My first husband and I were driving home about 10 PM on Hwy 60 between Pekin Indiana and Salem Indiana after visiting his parent’s house. I noticed a flashing light on the side of the road in a field. I told my husband, “Look! A car has gone off the side of the road!”, so he hit the brakes to see if we could help.  As the car slowed down and we got closer to the blinking light in the field I saw small children-like creatures in the road and I screamed, “Watch out! There are children in the road!” We ended up on the shoulder of the road and the children-like creatures came over to the car and looked in the windows. One of our children who were in the backseat woke up and asked, “What’s happening? Are we home?”  I saw one of them – they were the traditional gray creatures with big black eyes. It was looking in our window. I wondered if anyone else driving would come past and see us parked there. I was worried about our children.  Suddenly it was almost 3 AM and we were home in Salem. My first husband had one child, carrying them to bed and I had the other. I was disoriented. I asked Michael how it got so late, and he said he didn’t know. We were exhausted and went to sleep.  1986  This was around the time of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in January 1986. Michael and I were visiting friends near Pekin, Indiana. We were going to sleep over at the Baiocchi house. Dave Baiocchi went outside, it was cold, and called to me, I was in the kitchen. He said, “Michele, come out and see this light in the tree!” so I went out the screen door. He was right, there was a blinding light shining on this tree in his front yard.  We were ten feet from the house. I could see my husband in the kitchen. I looked into the tree and saw something 4 feet tall in the branches of the tree, in this bright light, but I couldn’t see what it was. It was just a silhouette. I asked David, “What is that?” He said, “It’s a giant owl.”  I looked again and it was! It was a giant owl, hovering in the branches of this big tree, looking at us.  Suddenly I was in a field down the hill from the house. It was pitch-black. I stepped forward and I felt like someone hit me in the middle of the chest really hard. The force threw me back and on my butt. David said, “It’s an electric fence. Just stay right there and I’ll come to you.” We were both in the field with this fence between us and the house.  I asked him, “Where are we? How did we get out here?”  David said, “We’re in the field. The lights left us here.”  I said, “What lights?” He turned around and I did too. He said, “They’re gone now. And they were so pretty too.”  He did something to the fence, and we got back to the house. My husband and his wife were in the kitchen and really angry. They said they had been calling for us for over an hour and we were nowhere to be found.  I told them that it couldn’t be that late, but when I looked at the clock, an hour and a half later than when I had gone outside to check the light in the tree. I couldn’t explain where we had been or how we had ended up in the field. My husband thought I was lying but I wasn’t. We all went to bed and never talked about it again.  1987  I saw Whitley Strieber’s book Communion in a bookstore and there was a gray on the front cover. I was shocked and said to myself, “I wonder how he knows what THEY look like.” And then I thought: How do I know what they look like? I read the book and realized that was what had happened to me.  1987  My husband and I were divorced, and I was living in Clarksville, Indiana and I fell in the shower and broke my nose. My boyfriend took me to the Clark County Hospital and they took x-rays of my face. The doctor came in and told my boyfriend to leave and he did. The doctor asked if my boyfriend had broken my nose because the x-rays showed my nose had been broken many times and had healed before. I said no, my boyfriend wasn’t beating me up.  The doctor said, “Good! Because I want to show both of you something that is really odd that showed up in your x-rays.” He called my boyfriend in and put up the x-rays on a lightbox. The doctor said, “Look at this! You have something between your nose and your skull that looks like – well, I haven’t seen anything like it.” We all leaned in to see the x-ray.  The object was square and looked like a cube of Mini-wheat cereal. I could see the thing, it was in back of my nose. My boyfriend laughed and said, “What the hell is that?”  The doctor said, “I don’t know what it is, but maybe someday it’ll just come out when you blow your nose or something. You’re not in pain or anything are you?”  I told him no, not usually – except I had a broken nose right now. He said, “We could try to get it out with surgery, but if it doesn’t bother you, we can leave it till it comes out on its own and get you out of here.” So he put my nose back in place and I went home.  1989  I was living in Bellingham, Washington with my 2nd husband. We lived at the end of Samish Way on a hill. The house was in front of a wooded area with a gravel road that went around the entire area in a triangle. My husband and I were sleeping and suddenly I was awake and knew THEY were in the room. I sat up and saw my husband sleeping and I started screaming at him to wake up that THEY were here. I tried hitting him on the chest, but he wouldn’t wake up. And then I was paralyzed and I laid back down.  Then I was outside with two greys and a tall alien. We were floating over the gravel road, heading back through the trees toward a flashing glowing light in the field on the other side of fence.  The tall alien had peach-colored skin. His head was triangular. He was obviously in charge of the expedition. He was wearing a green checkered, sports coat that was too large for his thin body. He thought to me, “How do you like my new sportscoat?”  I realized that was the tall one was wearing the sportscoat to make me feel more at ease. I looked at the sportscoat and said, “That is ugly.” I started to laugh. One of the greys looked up at the tall alien and said, “She’s coming too close to the top!”  The tall alien seemed disappointed, as if I were a favorite pet and enjoyed talking to me. He raised his right hand and made a motion and thought to me, “Go back under”.  The next day, the radios in both cars wouldn’t work, they never worked again after that night. The cars were parked between the house and the spaceship. The light in the oven was burned out.  I began to have dreams about the incident, especially the sportscoat.  A few weeks later I was watching Phil Donahue and he had an alien researcher on the show. He had drawings of aliens and showed them. In the middle on the bottom was a thin, peach-colored alien wearing a sportscoat. I rushed towards the tv. “That’s my alien!” I screamed. “That’s my alien!” It was during the day and I was alone, of course.  Phil Donahue chuckled and said, “What’s up with this guy? Why is he wearing that silly coat?” The audience all laughed at the alien researcher. I decided there and then that I would never say anything to anyone about what I had seen and what I knew. I couldn’t stand the ridicule that guy had suffered on stage.  1989  I found myself looking out over Samish Way from a great height. It was nighttime. I thought I was in a doctor’s office in a very tall building maybe. The doctor came in but I just heard him talking, I never saw him. He said, “Now we need to give you the eye test. So put your chin here.” There was a contraption there, oval, and I put my chin on the bottom. He said, “This will only hurt a little, so don’t be afraid.”  There was a console of lights and this needle started coming right towards my eye, so I backed out of the oval. The doctor said, “We must do this test. He forced my head forward and made the oval fit around my head so I couldn’t move, and the needle came back out and started heading towards my eye. The doctor said, “Keep your eye open, this won’t hurt.” It was my right eye. I don’t remember anything else about that night.  Years later my son suggested I get an eye test and I said I didn’t want to because they take a needle and stick it in your eye and he laughed and said they never did that.  I went to the eye doctor four years ago and they said I have an anomaly in the back of my right eye, some strange collection of blood vessels. I don’t know if it’s connected or not, but there it is.  1954  I was born in 1954. My father was an army guard at a radar station in Iceland. He came home for a one-day furlough and I was born 10 months later. My mother said I was a child of the devil because I was inside her so long. When I was born, I had calcium deposits on my head that looked like horns and calcium deposits under my nails that looked like half-moons. My father always said I was someone else’s. I got a DNA test, and I don’t match my siblings. I have almost no German (my maiden name was Zollman) and I have Russian DNA too. There are no Russian ancestors in my linage...I’ve checked.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,48.74688634868421,-122.44462006578947

I was a child at the time of the occurrence of the event (approx. 9 years old). Contact with other witnesses was permanently lost following relocation to due to circumstances of the subsequent outbreak of an armed conflict in that region.  What is more or less well known is time of the day of the event (evening, it was dark), season (spring/summer), and the approximate number of witnesses (5-7, possibly more). What is definitely known is the geographical location of the encounter, which, expressed through geographic coordinates, is: 45°02'16.2""N  18°41'37.5""E.  Main witnesses were children (including me), many of them my friends and peers, and several adults (at least one adult person) that happened to be there at the moment of the encounter.  Note: the account of the event is based on my subjective, yet very vivid memory and the experience of the encounter with the strange object. Until this day I seem to be the only witness that has openly given account of this apparently forgotten and (insufficiently) documented case of the CE1 (in the area of former Yugoslavia).  The Encounter: I was hanging out with my friends and peers in the evening and playing with them on the promenade, which is adjacent to the river Sava. At one moment, someone from my group spotted something at treetop level slowly approaching from the direction of West and drew our attention to it. I looked at it from an approximate distance of 20-30 meters (65-100 ft.) and saw it clearly moving towards us along the promenade (at treetop level). It was a disc-shaped, oval object, silvery in appearance. I was looking at the object while it was slowly and noiselessly approaching us.  Looking directly, i.e. frontally, at it, I can't remember whether there were any windows in front of it. My memory is somewhat foggy concerning that detail. If trying hard to remember, there seems to be a fraction of memory of trying to look at the ""windows"" and trying to see whether there are any ""occupants"" inside, but I cannot confirm that with certainty; for some reason that detail remains foggy, and it cannot be entirely ruled out that somehow that detail was subconsciously ""added"" as a ""false memory"" (such details could possibly be more vividly called into memory by hypnotic regression).  What definitely remains certain is the shape and and overall appearance of the object/craft. As it came closer, slowly flying directly over us/me, I could discern more details. It was a perfectly oval craft, a disc (disc-shaped), silvery in color (metallic), size of a smaller car (e.g. Mini Cooper). It had various lights, according to my memory those were rainbow-colors (yellow, red, blue, green, orange), that were constantly blinking in circular pattern. The craft/object was completely noiseless. There was no sound coming from it, there were no physical effects, at least no noticeable effects. As it flew slowly over our heads at a treetop level, several meters above our heads, flying over our heads and practically directly over me, I was looking at it in utter amazement! I couldn't believe my eyes, nor could others. I recall wondering what that thing was. To me, it looked like a large toy, that may be a good way to describe it, and it was surreal.  The whole event/encounter lasted ca. 20-30 seconds, possibly somewhat longer. My subjective experience is that the event/encounter lasted less than a minute. The object/craft did not stop and/or hover. It was a slow ""flyby"". The object/UFO was moving from West to East. It seemed either to not care that we were there or it intentionally flew directly over us (I believe it is the latter).  Physical description of the object/craft/UFO: Shape: oval / disc / saucer-shaped Color: metallic / silvery / stainless steel Size: approx. 3-4 m in length (ca. 12 feet) Lights underneath the craft: yes Type of lights underneath the craft: rainbow colors; in circular pattern Sound (emitted by the craft): no Other details: unknown whether there were any windows or similar openings; unknown whether the craft was domed  Effects on the immediate surrounding: Physical/EM effects: no (not noticeable) Traces left by the craft: no (none were found)  Based on my experience and all information available, this encounter, according to Hynek's scale, can be categorized as CE1 (Close Encounter of the First Kind).  The question of occupants possibly being spotted/seen within the craft by me or any of the other witnesses remains open and would have to be either confirmed by delving deeper into the possibly subconsciously buried memory of it and/or finding other witnesses to corroborate that significant detail. If that were to be the case, this encounter would have to be re-categorized as CE3.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,,

The studio sits above a one car garage and has woods on the backside of it.  The studio is about one hundred yards from the house. So it’s a little walk to and from the studio. I am use to seeing planes flying overhead and normally hear them after they go by. I don’t know what flight path is overhead but the planes are high up.  It’s not like I live near a major airport or anything and the planes are low flying.  The Watertown Airport in Dexter is about ten miles away.  But even then we only see the occasional low flying single engine planes, normally during the day. I am used to seeing Saturn of Mars in the sky as well. It’s like a nightly occurrence. As I got to the backdoor of the house I heard a noise and turned back to face the studio and shined the flashlight around the area. It sounded like an animal so I was expecting to see one, emerging from the woods or something. We have Coy Dogs around the area and I have yet to see one. I noticed an unusual light above the studio. The light was not directly above the studio though. It was in the direction of it. It wasn’t super bright. It looked kind of large. I would say golf ball size or slightly smaller. The color looked sort of orange. Like the orange goldish color of a fire. It was more of a dull looking like. It didn’t reminder of a plane with its lights on or anything like that. It appeared to have very little movement. I went into the house and called over my parents to have them see what I was seeing. They confirmed the light as well. At this point, I tried to use the camera on my Iphone but it did not pick the light up at all. We watched the light for almost four minutes. It looked like it was traveling away from me, toward the town of Cape Vincent. The trees started to block the light out. I decided to jump in the car and get a better look at it. I drove north on county route 8 then turned left onto county route 5. I was now heading toward Three Mile Bay. I thought I saw it while on county route 5 but could not be for sure. Once I arrived in Three mile Bay I turned right onto route 12 heading toward Cape Vincent. I could not find it anywhere. I arrived at Cape Vincent and looked out over the water and saw no sign of the light. I could see the red blinking lights of the windmills across the river clear as day but still no light.

I will never forget all of the experiences I have had since the age of five.  I will start off with the one that’s been the most memorable. I was 28 years old at the time. It was a very dark night when I was looking out of one of the three large windows facing south in our A-Frame home and saw what I thought were 6 airplanes but they went up and down, made circles in the sky and they were SO incredibly fast!  We were living in a rural subdivision (Northfork) outside of Cenntenial, Wyoming. I called my young daughters and asked what they saw and they saw the exact same thing.  I didn’t want to scare them and told them that they were airplanes but I knew in my heart they were UFO’s. Here’s when it got scarey.  After watching I noticed that they seemed to be three distinct objects, with two lights each.  It seemed to look like they were doing acrobatics as they would shoot straight up and then come right back down. They would go forward and backwards and everything was done in complete unison. I then said “I wish they’d come closer” I had no sooner said that and they DID!  Within seconds they traveled from Sheep Mountain to the beginning of our dirt road approximately 300 yards away from our house.  I then said “go away” and they hovered for about 4 seconds and then they just vanished. I called the airport in Laramie and asked if they saw anything on radar.  They did not. I called the Sheriff’s Dept and asked if they knew of any weather balloons or military operations ! that were practicing in our area and he said he said, “No, but you aren’t the only one who saw them”. I have seen flying objects since I was a child. I don’t know if they follow me or if I look at the night sky’s a lot and see things.  My older sister actually saw an oblong shaped saucer land in our pasture.  She heard all the cows bawling by the fence 20 feet from our bedroom window.  She is a big animal lover and looked outside to see what was going on and saw it.  She tried telling our mom but she was too tired and told my sister to go back to sleep. The next day in broad daylight, I looked up to the sky and saw an oblong shaped object in the sky. I called it a “hot dog in the sky”.  No lights and about 100 feet in the air.  It disappeared as more of my family came out of the house.  This happened in Pilot Grove, Missouri. My next sighting happened in Cheyenne Wyoming when my dad was stationed at FE Warren AFB.  I was 15 years old.  It was nighttime around 10pm in the summer.  There were four of us laying flat on a blanket looking up at the stars when a triangular object passed over us and then came back and hovered over us. It was no more than 40 feet in the air.  We started screaming and ran into the house.  Two of the people that saw this were big football players, but, it scared them so much that they left shortly after. My next experience happened south of Cheyenne where we boarded our horses.  It had over 2000 acres of land and a barn.  I was riding Daisy our mare and the yearling and her best friend followed as well as three other horses when all of a sudden we heard a loud noise like I’d never heard before.  It was like a screech, squeal, metal grinding sound that I’d never heard before.  My horse bucked me off and they all started bucking and acting really weird.  They all had their ears up and noses were sniffing in the air.  They took off running for the barn that was over a half of a mile away.  The sound came from over the hill but I was too scared to go look.  I just started running as fast as I could to go tell my dad. He just shook his head and brushed it off until the next day when I made him go out to the site over the hill where we both saw a perfectly round spot burned in the prairie.  He just said “Let’s get out of here”.  So whatever scared the horses also left proof that it had land! ed. I would like to talk with other people who have similar stories to tell.  My sister and I tried once when we attended a UFO Conference at the University of Wyoming but it was full of people that that said things like “I’m a child of the Orian’s”.  It just seemed like a lot of stories that were unbelievable.  We left after the first day and have just kept our stories to ourselves.  My sister is still haunted by things she sees at night.  They’ve moved several times, but she keeps having these very troubling “dreams”.",2020-02-25T00:00:00,,

And some other stuff that I can hardly remember about kgb, boats, and stuff regarding Russia.  Boot long after I said something bad to my mom.  She said she was going to put a bar of soap in my mouth. Took me to the kitchen sink and shoved a bar of soap in my mouth. I was screaming in my head ""mommy no"" then I herd men come behind me saying that "" this is Russia, don't talk and we mean in your head. Or we will kill you."" The voices overlapped, they mentioned they were KGB. They showed me visions of horror. I am at this point already in Witness Protection for a supposed unrelated incident. Regarding a pg&e utility worker.  I heard during the abduction that pg&e would be involved. All these years later I had no recollection of the event because they threatened my mom.  Showed me an image of her grusome death.  At age 9 I screamed so loud I hoped out of my body and woke up on the floor.  Mom woke me up.  I remember telling her that it was Russia.  I am an American Citizen.  There is also something regarding my son.  Who did pass away.  They said they were going to make me kill my own baby.  Showed me the back yard. Said right there in the back yard 30 years that they were going to make me spank him. I got out of prison 2013, had no memory of this incident. I was on parole for a voluntary manslaughter. I spanked my child after my ex-husband made me move up to my property one hot summer. We had the flu my son passed away from dehydration. Did have severe bruising. 2014 I moved to Plearmo to get out of Chico cause I was using drugs. And started talking in my head for some reason. My Grandpa had just passed away. Then the worst torture began. I was being told how many ways they were going to kill me. Shooting me from the sky. I was in terror. They were saying many things about Former President Obama. They told me things about my own Children. The worst torture I incurred. This was mostly voices, and electric fry.The voices were grusom. Some time later after notifying the Secret Service As to what I Witnessed, they notified me that I was in Witness Protection. I also was frayed by PG&E claiming they were cal-wrap. When I remember when I was young and the KGK were threatening! me, they said they were going to Un-Wit me and that PG&E was involved. I am federal Witness Protection. Not state, and pG&E is not cal wrap.i was molested in the bar by the pg&e utility worker. I see visions about 911. I see albkaida suspects in my eyes or brain not sure how. I hear Gladimir Putin's voice constantly. I'm an American Citizen. Mom had electricity coming out out of her ears too one day she put it in my ear, I was being tortured then so my mind weren't all together. I need a interview with federal law enforcement. For prosecution of these individuals. Reported crimes committed against me to The Pentagon, CIA, FBI, Homeland Security, Inspector General.

Across from us was an apartment building and off to the left of that building I saw a dark disc shape hovering and flipping forward, very slowly. It looked like if a paper plate was caught in a strange wind gust. But it had more weight than a plate. It hovered there and started to slowly drift out of sight, in the way that a balloon would when released, but slower.  This thing had to be at least the size of an apartment window. But I couldn't tell if it was low and near the edge of building, or if it was huge, and the angle I viewed it made it seem closer.  This is the only crazy thing to happen in my life. I remember it clear as day. This was before drones or the thought of one, but theres no way this could be that.  My thoughts:  a craft that is like a smooth rounded coin, that can flip in any direction it wants to fly in strange angles or speeds. The key thing is that the fireworks were off to one side and this thing was on another side. I watched it as it floated told my Dad to look and he didn't see it, but I did it and just got further away.  1000% truth this happened exactly as I say it did.

We ran inside the Diner, we all 3 herd the Hamburger Fryer slowly sizzle off.....then we all 3 noticed something horrifying, everyone that was eating & talking, & drinking a coffee or tea suddenly came to a stop!, as if someone had stopped them with a remote control to a Tv. Suddenly I tried to call for help 911 to the Alpa IL Police Dept, but the small Diner's Phone was dead!!!  My 2 grown Kids a daughter & Son broke down crying.  I wanted to hide us all but I felt we would have no luck in doing so. So I told my Son to look outside to see if he could see the UFO, while my daughter i had to calm down she was in a frantic, I had to hug her, & rub her back & I prayed hard. We went outside to see where my Son was, we couldnt see him anywhere!!!! &#128560;which at that point my daughter said she didnt think he was coming back. And it felt like forever while we stood there waiting for him. Finailly we thought we saw him from the distance, we was right it was him, my Son was running back to the Diner to us, he told us as he stood there breathing hard, sorry but I went way down the road, I told him that I didnt send him down the road to look for the UFO, he said, well when I didnt see it, I wanted to see if it was down the road. He simply misunderstood me. We was so relieved he was back. We got over by my Car, a small Car & we went to my Uncles, & he didnt answer the door, so we opened the door in fear of the UFO, I must of been Diabetic back then & didnt know it, because I felt like I was going to swallow my Tongue, so I opened a can of Tuna, I made sandwiches for us all 3. We ate, by time we was all done eating, my Uncle came inside & said he was gonna call the Police, but I told him you dont know what we just wrnt threw I told him, then he didnt believe me, & I told him to ask my Son, my Uncle use to be a Sailer in the Navy, so he asked my Son is that true? And my Son said yes. He listend to my Son, then we left. I will never go back to Alpha IL ever again. It was horrifying. Yrs later I was diagnosed with Diabetes in 2007, & my kids aren't the same living 2 grown kids, they grew to hate & distant from the Lord Jesus Christ. And the 2 disowned my Dad, & me & my Husband Please pray for them.Pastor told me that Saten is making our kids hate & disown us. And Pastor said that Aliens are ""Fallon Angels sent by Saten, to try bringing us all into a place of deception"", to try & kill, steel, & destroy our love for Jesus, & to try & kill, steel & destroy,our love for our familys!!!, and so I think Pastor is exactly right, so I need everyone to Pray for our 2 Kids, that they will grow close to the Lord Jesus Christ, & that they will grow to love one another & grow to love my Husband & Me.

On, or around, December 14th. The events span hours on 287 in the late evening/night until maybe 03:00-05:00.  I was heading south on US-287 from Denver way towards either Cactus TX or Guymon OK to pickup a meat load. Pretty sure it was Cactus due to the date on my most recent freight bills, but i must have passed by Guymon along the way after I left the shipper to end up on Us-412 e/b. I remember Guymon because it was the other load pickup location from Dec 7th or 8th that I keep wanting to confuse this report occurance with.  On the way down 287 I remember watching what looked like sporadic 'meteor'? showers. Not many.. just one here or there within some random span of 10 or 15 minutes, but at least for an hour (if not two) I can vaguely recollect about 5 to 7 meteor fireballs (light in color like a white or light blue).. From their trajectory, distance and speed I assumed at least one was heading towards Santa Fe, the Jicarilla Apache lands, or somewhere around Alamosa by way of looking at my gps when i zoomed out for one in particular. Others seemed more South on my route at what at the time seemed like Amarillo because they were so seemingly far away.  These occurances didnt alarm me at all, especially at first. However, after I received my load and weighed and was heading east on US-412, on the straight stretch from Hardesty, Balko, and May, maybe 20 to 30 minutes past Guymon as I remember it, I seen one of the same colored comets or meteors within 1/2 mile to 2 miles falling at low altitude (maybe as low as 50-100 yards before I lost sight of its impact point) south of US-412, but it was much closer, and now that it was closer I knew its size was much smaller. The only thing that had alarmed me, and still does, is that all night long the others had fell diagonally/slanted approach.. but this one fell straight down. Straight as can be. The otger thing i found odd at the time was sign i passed on 412 for some kind of observatory or scientific study station within 10ish minutes of where I seen it fall straight down.  Upon researching the county today (which is roughly how i found this site) I didnt discover anything super odd except an occurance of numerous elk surrounding a bear at a feeder. Though, to note, there is the Pantex Nuclear Facility south of the area where I had seen at least one of the diagonal comets/meteors going (towards Amarillo).  I hope I didnt waste your time in reporting this, but Ive never seen one fall straight down like that, esoecially in an area with such obscure side road naming conventions; Theyre all numbers. I wish I had more exact times and dates.",2021-01-19T00:00:00,,

There were no red or green directional lights, no red beacons, and no bright landing lights. They kind of had the luminosity of military flares in the night sky.

This is the second telescope  I've owned and have had it since January 2003. I've viewed 6 planets with it, Orion Nebula, star clusters, and at least a dozen total  lunar eclipses. I've seen the ISS and the Space Shuttle Orbiters docked and undocked through binoculars and with the naked eye. I've  watched the Geminid Meteors a half a dozen times and have viewed several comets. I'm familiar with most of the Northern Hemisphere  constellations and the stars in them visible to me. I'd like to think I know what I'm looking at in the night sky. I was viewing the beginning of the umbral phase of the total lunar eclipse through my 6"" Dobsonian, focal ratio f/8. It has a resolution of 0.77 arcseconds. I was using a 25mm Plossl eyepiece which yields AFOV = 1.2° (Actual Field of View) at 48x magnification. The umbral phase of the total eclipse began at 02:44 PDT (local time). I expected overcast skies so I didn't bother to even check conditions until  02:40 PDT. Even though the sky was mostly cloudy the Full Moon was visible through some light haze. I quickly set up on my front yard but then had to move to the driveway. By this time the Moon had already began to move into Earth's shadow (umbra) at about the 8 o'clock position on the Moon's face. I quickly brought the Moon into view through the telescope. The Moon covers about 0.5° in the sky and  fills about half of my field of view with the aforementioned setup. I took a few picture with a digital camera just by holding it up to the eyepiece of the telescope. By now it was about 02:52 PDT. I took another look to see if I had to adjust the telescope to keep the entire Moon in view. This must be done every 1-2 minutes to keep it centered. As I looked with the entire Moon still within the field of view I saw a very small black o! bject travel across my field of view in a straight line from right to left very near where the equator would be. This took about 3-4 seconds. There were no lights on the object and it was only visible when passing in front of the moon. A characteristic of a reflecting telescopes is that they invert the object being viewed 180°. So top is bottom and left is right etc. So in reality it was traveling left to right or east to west. It was in focus and was too small to accurately determine any shape. I continued to view the eclipse, adjust the telescope as needed, and take a few more pictures. Then about 10 minutes later I saw the same thing again. By about 3:15 PDT the sky was completely overcast and the Moon was no longer visible. I did some calculations using the distance the Moon was from the Earth at that time 357,422km and the resolution of my telescope 0.77 arcseconds. The smallest object I can see at that distance would be at least 1,330 meters which is 0.82 miles. I have heard other reports where people said  what they saw was larger than this. The largest object in orbit is the ISS which is 109 meters and orbits at about 400km from Earth. I thought it could possibly be small satellite thousands of miles high but they all orbit in the opposite direction than this did.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,33.9356347266881,-118.13377170418008

DATE/TIME & LOCATION: On May 26,2021 around 9:00pm, on the road 'NorthShore' while heading North. Coming up to the road 'Lake mead' heading to Vegas.   My girlfriend and I were heading back to Las Vegas after a day at Lake Mead. It was dark out and I was looking up at the sky/stars. I noticed a star like light that started to slowly glide across the sky. Regular white color light at first.  SIGHTING: I saw a light gliding across the sky for around 10 seconds. I saw it begin moving to the right then it started to move left really quickly then moved right again, that’s when it looked like it was ascending to the point it looked like a star, it got really small. Then it descended back down and while doing so it flashed so bright with a baby blue looking color and hazy bluish aura around it. For a brief second, it was the brightest looking light in the sky. I then saw it keep gliding across the sky slowly for about 6 seconds then it quickly ascended again and while doing so it flashed 2 times like a camera flash, with a baby blue color. It then seemed to disappear into the dark sky. After about 2 seconds I saw it flash 2 more times with a baby blue color and it went up so high into the sky that it just looked like a star. I kept looking at it and it seemed like it just faded away.  Number of objects: 1  My conclusion: I have came to the conclusion that what I saw was not anything Earth like. Not a satellite, not a plane or helicopter. Not a drone or military training act. The way that it moved left and right seemed like it just moved in the direction it wanted to without any effort, to put an example its as if it was a cursor on a computer, it moved so easily and quickly, side to side then up and down. It also didn’t have the flashing lights that planes and helicopters have. The only times it flashed was when it moved up then down, other than that it just looked like a star in the sky that was gliding. And the fact that in the end of all of it, it looked like it had just faded away into nothing. And it couldn’t have been a comet, its movements and bright flashing several times was nothing like it.",2021-07-31T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

The lights were fast moving but also hovered at times. We pulled over on the residential street. I noticed a white suv had pulled over behind us. A man and his son were playing basketball outside their home and they had stopped and were also observing. The lights were low flying. There was a smaller airplane flying towards us coming from the SW in the distance but he was flying a much higher altitude than the unexplained lights. We got out of the car to view them. Just as the lights got directly in front of us, they begin to vanish one by one starting with the one in the lead, then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th. I yelled to the suv behind us “did you see that”? A woman yelled back “yes, there were 4 of them”. I asked her what was it and she replied UFO’s. I didn’t get to speak to the man and boy who were also watching.

I was on a delivery route in Pflugerville, Texas.  It was 11:15 in the morning, 60 degrees with a beautiful blue sky.  I pulled into an apartment complex off of the 35 freeway and saw something white floating/hovering in the sky to the north.  I stopped in the driveway of the complex to focus on the object.  It looked like a white plastic bag tossing in the wind, morphing in shape the way a bag would morph in the wind, but it was staying in the same spot, at about a 45 degree angle up and what looked like maybe one or two miles away.  Unable to figure out what it was, I pulled the rest of the way into the parking lot and got out, hoping it wouldn’t disappear in the 30 seconds it took to do that.  It was still there, still in the same spot, still morphing or flopping about.  I thought, ‘that can’t be a plastic bag, as it’s too far away for it to be as big as i see it’ (a little smaller than a dime held at arms length) - it would have to be an enormous plastic bag if that were the case.  So i thought, ‘okay, is it a paraglider twisting and turning?’  but it never showed itself to be that.  I can usually get that figured out pretty quickly as they move about.  So no, it wasn’t that.  After a couple of minutes of watching it and wondering what it was, it stopped morphing and became a stable, hovering, oval-shaped white object.  I couldn’t tell if it was a light, or if it was just a bright white object reflecting off the sun against the blue sky.  I got my phone to try to take a video, but after a few seconds I knew I wasn't going to get it (plus I don’t know how to work the zoom on my phone, if there is one), so i gave that up and just observed it.  A couple of apartment complex workers came up to see what i was looking at.  I point it out to them and one of them said, ""It’s a plane.""  I responded, ""No, that’s not a plane"", and they leave.  At this point I noticed that it seemed to be getting further away, like it was receding away from me - it wasn’t moving left or right, and it stayed at the same 45 degree angle up in the sky, but it was getting smaller, like it was moving directly away from me, all the while still a solid white oval.  I thought it must be 10 or so miles away now, so I called my brother in Round Rock, Texas, ten miles north of where I was at, and told him what I was seeing and asked him to go out to see if he also could see it.  He went out but couldn't find it.  I continued to watch it for a few more minutes and watched as it got smaller and smaller, still apparently moving directly away from me, until it looked just like a bright star in the clear daytime sky, far enough away now that I couldn’t see the oval shape to it anymore.  I decided to make the delivery that I was scheduled to make at the apartment complex.  It took about five minutes to do so, and when I finished, I tried to locate the object again, but couldn’t find it.  There was no sound associated with the object that I could hear.  The length of time of my observation was about 7 minutes.  In that amount of time, I think I should have been able to identify what I was looking at, eventually seeing wings, or movement, or a change in course that would have allowed me to see it from a different perspective and know what it was.  That never happened.",2021-03-02T00:00:00,30.441564516129034,-97.59894516129032

It reminded me of the International Space Station and how it passes over head than a few seconds later it's gone. Only problem being it was daytime so it couldn't have been the ISS. I felt like it was at an altitude higher than a commercial airliner can fly. The speed it passed by it must have been going pretty fast depending on the altitude it was traveling at.

My bed was directly beside two large windows and as I looked out them toward the patch of woods (maybe 100-200 yards away from the home) I seen a very large saucer shaped craft hovering above the trees.. it was hovering but moving back and forth, side to side motions and leaving trails of “light” possibly, behind it. That made me believe it was moving very fast. I was immediately shocked and panicked. I watched it for possibly 2-3 minutes before I ran to my brothers room to try and wake him.

While photographing ""Old Sacramento"" and Tower Bridge, I later found a spherical UFO in one of the bridge shots, and also an circular white orb around the bridge. I've included photos of both subjects. All taken within 10 minutes of the 20:50-21:00 timeframe. The first photo, the close-up of the frame showing the sphere is distinctive because of the downward slanting white light. The sphere appears to be across the river in Yolo County. A subsequent frame shows the sphere farther up the Sacramento River, closer to the ""H"" Street Bridge, just north of Tower Bridge.  The second image shows a shot of Tower Bridge looking west (so this is the ""east"" tower). There we see the white orb directly before the east tower. I found this same orb in an earlier shot, looking northwest in a different location but close to the east tower. So to my eye it was ""moving about.""  The 2006 images were taken with my D50 Nikon camera. Finally, I have attached another image of the sphere with slanted downward light. This one taken August 27, 2018 of the Tower Bridge, looking down river (South). I found the sphere to the west of the bridge, over West Sacramento, and another one spotted further south but almost directly between the two towers. This shot (and there are several more from this shoot showing the first sphere) were taken with a Samsung 6 digital camera.  You'll find a total of 4 images in all. If desired, I can send the actual full frame of the shots that were cropped/enlarged.  Final note: light aircraft are frequently seen flying over this section of West Sacramento and downtown Sacramento, as the Sacramento Metropolitan Airport is about three miles north of this downtown area. The downward slanted light suggests this is not a standard aircraft, IMO.

They traveled at a speed similar to a small-engine plane.

On Saturday, September 19, 2021 a group of four individuals were driving on the East side of the Payette Lake in McCall, Idaho.  We entered the Ponderosa State Park (East side of the lake) and drove to the boat ramp in an attempt to capture some scenic photos of the lake.  One of the persons is a professional photographer.  The four of us took some photos of various parts of the lake and of ourselves.  I walked out to the end of the boat dock and took a picture of the lake (looking west), using my IPhone.  Two other individuals walked toward me at the end of the dock.  I then took a picture of them.  They walked out to the end of the dock and the professional photographer began taking various photographs.  As she was taking pictures of the horizon (looking West across the lake), I noticed spots near the sun.  They appeared white (almost like holes) and at first there was only one and then I noticed several (perhap 6-8) small white dots in the distance across! the lake next to the sun.  The clouds behind them were dark so it was clear to me there was something there.  They were in no particular pattern, but they appeared to be close together (clustering). I asked the other two if they saw the dots and one of them did see the dots.  She attempted to zoom in with her high powered camera to see if she could identify the objects, with negative results.  I proceeded to tell them that i thought, based on the oddness of the dots that i thought they were aliens (ufos).  I then told them how Idaho, particularly the McCall area had quite a bit of ufo activity.  I saw the dots for a brief period of time (estimated at 10-20 seconds).  I then proceeded to take more pictures across the lake (West) to catch the sunset off the water.  I took 3 picture seconds apart.  According to my IPhone camera these were all taken at 19:15. We left the dock and took a few more pictures of various areas and then left the area to continue up through the scenic! byway.  We had no other events of this nature during the rema! inder of our drive. At some point that evening I began looking through my pictures on my IPhone.  When I reached the 3 shot sequence ,  the first shot looked normal with no dots (shot at 19:15).  In the second shot I noticed a small spec across the lake amongst the tree line on the left side.  Note: one of my friends had accidently put her hand in the picture, which forced me to take a third shot approximately 5-8 seconds after the second shot.  Upon looking at the third picture I noticed the dot had now moved quite a ways above the tree line (still on the left side).  I went back to the first picture and there was no dot.  So I went to the second photo (with the dot in the treeline) and zoomed in on the dot and noted a green object that appeared disk like and unrecognizable, it was tipped to the bottom right.  I then went to the third picture (above the treeline) and noted  a much clearer object that was green and appeared to have a solid ""A"" shape triangle in the middle (triangle with no bott! om) and a halo of green surrounding it.  It too was slightly tipped to the right. It appeared to be large, as compared with the trees it was double in size.  Also, based on the distance of the shot the ""dot"" could be seen by the human eye, but not bright, green, or moving, which raised no awareness at the time the picture was taken.  I might add none of us saw anything out of the ordinary at the time (other than the previous event i have mentioned.  There was perhaps 1-2 minutes between the white dot sighting (first paragraph) and when the 3 series photo's were shot.  With that said, these were the only pictures any of us took of the objects after checking all photo's. I did not report the event at the time, since we were out of town.

It was around 11:00pm when i got in, i hadn't given the tub enough time to fill up completely so the water only reached about halfway. So i lay down using the seats as support and stare into the night sky. It had just started being dark outside again after the 24/7 sun months and i missed the night sky. as i was looking at the stars i started staring at random stars without blinking for long periods of time and after a few minutes i notice what i think is a satilite and start to follow it with my eyes. It isn't moving fast at all compared to the sky but it is moving erratically, fast short bursts in alternating directions. I knew it was a UFO/UAP and stared and followed it for a about 45 minutes. After a few minutes had passed with me staring at it and my eyes adjusting to the darkness i spot three extremely dim lights moving in unison with the lar! ger light(the UFO) i had been staring at. The movements of the UFO aren't very noticable, so it took some time to confirm that the lights very indeed moving in unison.  The positioning of the all 4 lights combined made up two connected 90degree angles with the brightest light not at the nose, but at one of the round corners to the side. after a little while i notice another two dim lights a considerable distance away the bright light. Both below and behind and also moving in unison. Some minutes later I again notice two dim lights in my peripheral vision this time behind and above. This gives plausible reasoning for it to be one large craft but i not sure as i observed the smaller extremely dim lights to be somewhat unstable. What i mean by this is that they were somewhat shaky compared to the bright light which i could clearly see the  i could never 100% confirm that the dim lights were moving as if it was one structure would compared to the bright light but nonetheless de! finatively at the same time, the uncertainty was with distance! . i cant tell you that it was the EXACT same distance.",2021-10-19T00:00:00,,

We have large cliffs in our backyard with trees on top, so the height of the object was about 200 ft and about 500 ft away. At first, I did not know what I was looking at. I then realized that it was something highly unusual. It had no wings; it was cylindrical and was spinning on its long axis. It was about 10ft long by 5ft wide. It was spinning clockwise. I stepped off the deck and walked into the yard to get a better look of it. What I know now is that it was keeping a consistent height off the ground to the top of the trees, so as it cleared the cliff area it got closer to the ground. I got as close as I could to it and starred at it intensely. It was spinning about one revolution per second and moved i! n a straight line at around five miles per hour. It was completely silent. There was something like a pipe that was on its side that was attached at a slight diagonal. I remember the color as a dark gray and also brown. I watched it as it moved away. Looking at it, I felt a strange sensation of an otherworldly presence.  I noticed a part on top of the object that I did not see from the side. The fact that the entire object was spinning leads me to think that it may have been “morphing” or changing shape. The object moved away in a very strait and precise line. It was moving so steadily that it appeared to be shrinking in size opposed to getting farther away. I have never seen anything in the sky travel in such a precise strait line and so smoothly. It traveled across the valley and over the tops of the trees. That was it.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,41.378,-73.9315

It was a large round matte white circle. It was large. I would say it was about fifty to seventy-five feet in diameter with the distance I saw it at. I turned and walked back into the yard to get a clear view past the bushes. There are some trees at the edge of the yard and were still restricting my view but a good amount of the foliage was gone from them so I could still see. As I got down to the yard the circle of light disappeared. I had a feeling that something significant just happened though. I looked to the sky above the house looking south and two large fuzzy orbs with particle tails! shot through the sky going west down the valley. One was a little in front of the other, but they were side by side. I would say that they were about five hundred feet off the ground and about five hundred feet away from me. They were not that bright. They were dim and almost blended into the peachy colored sunset sky behind. They had tails that looked like particles of light. I would estimate that each orb was about thirty foot in diameter. It looked as if they were on a mission. They were traveling fast and looked like they knew exactly where they were going. This whole occurrence lasted about eight seconds.  So, what I believe I saw was two large orbs exiting a portal. When I noticed the large round light in the valley it immediately caught my eye. I knew in an instant that it was something out of the ordinary. As I mentioned, the round light was a matte white, not so bright but uniform in intensity and had a definite circular boundary to it. The large orbs flying through the air were beautiful. They had such a majestic look to them. These orbs were here on a mission. The way they flew through the valley was fast and in a strait line.

I was driving a moving truck eastward on Highway 389 with my Wife trailing behind in her car.  There were also at least 5 cars behind us because of the slower speeds my rented truck would go.  We were about 12 miles west of Fredonia, Arizona at the time.  We saw traveling toward us three of what appeared to be smaller 4 engine ""T"" tail flat black unmarked aircraft flying less than 200' off the ground.  Okay, so what?  Their air speed was less than 20mph.  I am a retired engineer by trade and am certain of that fact.  I was traveling about 50mph as I approached them. The plane in the lead turned with its wings completely vertical to the ground and crossed N to S over the highway clearing a power pole by less than half the length of the pole.  Then it leveled out and flew back over the highway to the north side of the road flying with the other two parallel to the highway in an east to west direction.  We had all three planes lower in altitude to abo! ut 100' and fly again at less than 20mph directly over the line of cars.  I had heard no sound and could not believe what I was seeing, so I rolled down my window and did not hear even a whisper of a sound from any of them.  I have flown radio control airplanes since I was 18 and my planes would have stalled at the speeds these were going.  The planes shadows covered our cars as they flew over us because they were so low.  I dialed 911 at that time and reported it.  The Sheriff said they had a lot of experimental military aircraft fly that corridor.  I'm reporting this as a UFO experience because there are no conventional aircraft that can fly that slow doing the things I saw them do.  I'm guessing their airspeed from watching the power poles as they passed.  Also the experience took some time.  Let's say their stall speed was 120mph this would have happened in a blur.  This was in slow motion and none of us could believe it.  There were no markings of any kind on them.  I ! had my camera sitting on the seat beside me but was so amazed ! by what I saw I didnt even think of taking a picture.  I looked into the engine of the lead plane and I could see no parts of any kind in it.  I did some contract work for the Military at the Dugway Proving Grounds Ditto Labs and had a small Military jet fly low over my car and I thought it was going to blow my windshield out.  These had no sinsation of wind or sound of any kind at 100' from them.  Why am I reporting this now.  Well I reported it to MUFON a couple of days later and all they would say was there was no plane that matched my description.  Well I finally found a plane that looks a great deal like it.  It's a BAe-146-100-sta British plane minus the stinger on top.  These looked like airplanes but were not subject to gravity.  I'm absolutely convinced that the engine pods were empty.  They did not require an airfoil to fly or move.  Everyone was simply speechless.  They had no identifying marks and were flying objects, as such UFO's.  I remember the details because I was ! fascinated with them.  I've watched Military aircraft since I was 5 years old in Tucson watching them fly into Davis Monthon AFB matching them to a small picture book of Military aircraft my Parents gave me.  As I live I testify that what we saw were not airplanes in the conventional sense of the word.  This has bothered me every day since then.  My perspectives were good and crystal clear to even seeing a flash of two people inside.  I should have included that the planes were casual and floating a little right and left very close to the ground.  They looked like they were having fun and showing off for the cars below.  That's exactly what it seemed like.",2020-02-25T00:00:00,,

Over Long Island. A Piper PA-32R Saratoga (N161MA) was flying over Huntington, Long Island during a trip between Minute Man Airfield in Massachusetts and Old Bridge Airport in New Jersey when the pilot encountered a strange object directly in front of his aircraft. He called air traffic controllers stating ""I have an object in front of me, I don't know what it is."" The controller replies ""You mean like a drone or something?"" The pilot responds: ""I don't know if it's a drone... It's bigger than a drone.""  The controller responds ""Ummmm, I don't show anything on radar.""  The controller then asks if the object is at his same altitude, the pilot responds in the affirmative.  Then the controller asks if the pilot needs to make a turn to avoid the object and the pilot requests a slight change in direction. The controller then queries the pilot to report what he thinks the mysterious craft is as soon as he can. The pilot respond! s that he has no idea what it is and it has since gone behind a cloud. ""Definitely something was there"" the pilot states. The controller seems oddly adamant that they should assume it was a drone, stating ""Ok, I mean, we'll have to assume that it was a drone, that's the only, I mean I don't know if that's the shape assumption or not but I guess that's what we will go by."" The pilot responded, ""Actually, it looked, uh, like it had lights on it."" The controller responds ""That's uh, really interesting, uh again, I show nothing on radar so I don't know what to say."" The pilot then states ""Ok and I know I'm not delusional."" The next transmission we hear is from the controller asking the pilot to call in and make a report with specifics about the incident once he lands. He notes that the request is from his manager. The pilot quips ""this is the first time I'm getting a phone number that I'm not in trouble!."" The controll! er laughs and affirms to him he is not in trouble. He then pas! ses him the number and says they will be awaiting his call. The Piper stayed at about 6,000 feet during the cruise portion of its flight.

I spent several minutes watching it before I began recording what became a 10 minute long video of this object descending.  During the course of the video, the object changed directions twice, maneuvering horizontally while continuing in a vertical descent, as if course-correcting to land. At first the object had a long what I would call a fire tail that moved with the object and was not left trailing in the sky as a NASA Space-shuttle or airplane would leave. However, as the object descended further, the tail became much shorter. I recorded the object until it disappeared behind some trees.

Rather, when I looked at the photographs, (6 were taken), I noticed an odd white light in the image and zoomed into the photo to see what it was.

I looked up to see in the clear night sky, just overtop of the adjacent ocean front home, a single triangle shaped, light orange object a few hundred yards away.  It was alone briefly before being joined by another, then another and so on until there were 4.  My wife and 2 adult sons then saw the objects.  Then they “disappeared” without any discernible sound (although the waves were fairly loud). While we were debating what we saw my son noticed that just off shore there was an amazing spectacle taking place with what appeared to be many separate white lights twinkling off and on- back and forth with other groups.  Above them appeared to be either a solid, very large triangular object or perhaps some that were in a triangle formation.  This continued for some time in the southern sky while a cargo ship was not too far away ( for perspective on the distance from shore- the objects were about as far out as the ship which was just to the east) and what appears to be commercial airline flights which allowed us to estimate the objects were now at around 3-4K ft. As the display continued we could hear what we knew was a military jet coming from the east up the beach towards us. The jet came by just overhead and slightly off shore at a little higher altitude than the objects which were flashing white rapidly among each other and underneath the triangle object. The jet stayed ! straight following the beach and did not attempt to fly towards or engage - or not that we could tell. Then abruptly- it ended and they were gone.My oldest son and I walked onto the beach in hopes of seeing more and at around 10pm the 4 orange colored craft reappeared several hundred yards off shore at what appeared to be 1,000 feet or so above the surface. They “glowed” in unison for a brief moment and then they were gone. We are all professional people. Don’t subscribe to belief in space aliens etc. We took video and when we zoom in it appears at least one craft resembles the “tic tac” shaped object we have seen on the news.

At night there was an engine at the ceiling which would wake us up, but at another night the house walls became completely transparent and could be seen through.

When the strange things were happening in the house I was very scared but when I saw the UFO out there I was not scared at all, just curious. The UFO didn’t do anything to me, it turned off its lights and slowly drifted away. In the spring of 1997 one night I heard a question in my head: ‘’If you are so afraid here, then maybe we can meet elsewhere?’’ I agreed immediately, I knew who was calling for me. What happened next is hard to explain. I knew that I was not going anywhere, I was in my bed in the house but at the same time I was also at the old workshops. There were two men and a woman standing by the fire, they had light skin, light hair and classically beautiful faces – very similar to humans, just very tall (I assume about 3 meters tall) and slightly flatter. I ask: Where have you flown from? The answer: From the Blue Flovdiva. I ask: Why did you fly over? The answer: The earth is very beautiful. Me: Yes, the Earth is very beautiful. They: It is weird that you live in boxes. I understood that they meant houses. When I was back home, I grabbed a paper and a pen and wrote –Blue Flovdiva-, I was afraid that I was going to forget. In the morning I was angry at myself why I did not ask where –Blue Flovdiva was, as if it would just be a neighbouring town.

One morning instead of 3 stars I saw 4, I was looking confused – something was wrong, I compared the fourth star with the rest – it was exactly the same. I look at the fourth star and think: ‘’Where did you come from? You were not there before!’’ It seems that the star starts slowly drifts away, and it really does move away some 1,5m away from the site it was before, and after drawing a letter M in the sky it returns to its original place, afterwards slides away, and on the way back it draws two large pyramids, afterwards one large, one small, four small, then more pyramids follow with varying sizes. When the star is drifting away, it doesn’t draw a line, but upon coming back, it starts to draw with a flaming line. When the star returns to its starting position then the drawing disappears, and the star starts to drift away again to draw next one. The star drifts away not too quickly, there is a little while to wait before it starts to go away again, however, it returns very quickly. What type of technology is it to enable to travel such distances so fast. It is absolutely clear that a highly advanced civilization makes itself known, besides, our laws don’t work there, they read my thoughts momentary, and the answers were given at once as well. The star kept drawing in the sky until it started to get brighter. In the evening and in the following morning I went to look for the fourth star but it was gone.-Is the Blue Flovdiva there?

I spent NYE 2002 on the island of Koh Chang in Thailand. I will be upfront about this: it was a party night, and around 10pm on the 31st me and my friends took some very good ecstasy. Obviously, because of what I'm about to describe, I find it important that I mention that, because although I know I did not hallucinate, I also think the ecstasy helped me perceive something I would not have otherwise. The reason I say this is that my memory of that night, before the sighting, is one of complete awareness of my surroundings, and increased perception generally speaking.  It was a period of heightened sensitivity for sure, but at no point did I hallucinate in any way. We partied, swam in the sea, drank, but at no time was I anything other than hyper-aware of everything around me. At one point I stopped people walking into the path of a lit firework with a sliver of a second to spare, and people congratulated me on a good save and all that, but to me it seemed as though I had plenty of time to process everything. What I'm saying is, yes, my consciousness had been expanded, but I was on point, I was not out of my head. Furthermore, the incident I am about to describe had a clear beginning and end, with a duration of about five minutes. And though those five minutes do sound like a hallucination, they were bordered by, before and after, only hours of clear-headedness where everything looked normal. If what I experienced was a hallucination induced by the E, then it was a very time-specific (5 minutes only!), highly localized hallucination.  After the NY celebrations had wound down a bit, I walked off by myself to find a quiet spot on the beach to look at the stars. The sky was so clear I could see the Milky Way, and more stars than I'd ever seen in my life, or could ever hope to see back home in London. I wanted to take the chance to drink it all in. I estimate it was maybe 1 or 2 in the morning by this time, or maybe even 3. I star-gazed happily for a while, maybe half an hour, with nothing more than what you'd expect to see looking up, when suddenly -very suddenly- these two objects appeared in my field of vision, directly above me. I struggled then and I struggle now to describe them: 'cathedral of light' were the words that came to my mind. The two objects seemed to be changing shape as I watched, with body shapes reminiscent of old TV antennas at time, a criss-crossing of lines, but ever-shifting and changing, although within a boundary pronounced enough for me to make out that there were two separate, dis! tinct objects above me. They seemed to be directly above me, very high up although of course it's impossible to tell. Lights came off them, a light that seemed to emanate from within rather than being affixed onto some outside surface. The objects moved in a very erratic pattern, but something about their movements conveyed to me several things: intelligence, playfulness, determination. They knew what they were doing, and I felt at one point as though they were observing me specifically. I felt a strong sense of recognition, years later, reading about people seeing so-called 'Rods', because a lot about Rods reminded me of what I had seen. The 'crossing but always changing lines' appearance, the super-high speed at which they moved. They played or danced above me for maybe five minutes, and I was able to have a good, long look, but couldn't make any sense of it. Then, without a warning, they took off to the left and crossed the horizon at an incredible speed - a speed that d! id not make sense. I knew nothing man-made could currently mov! e that f ast, then in 2002 and now still in 2021. And in utter silence, to boot! There was never any noise coming from them.  Years later still I was reminded of my sighting by reports of airplanes pilots having seen things that could move at speeds and in ways that just were not possible, by our understanding of the laws of physics anyway. What I saw behaved just like that, disappearing across the sky just like that, instantly going from almost stationary to out of sight. Impossible accelerations.  I stayed and looked up until dawn, but there was nothing more. Everything looked normal once again. The stars, the galaxies, beautiful but expected. I would say the sighting lasted about five minutes, but of course that's just an estimate: I looked around afterwards for anyone on the beach that might have seen it too but there was only me. I remember clearly being unable to look away from the objects once they appeared, almost feeling like I was in a trance looking at them, so maybe those five minutes were shorter, or longer.  This is of course only my opinion, but I believe I saw, not aliens, but organisms that exist within our biosphere, but which we have not yet detected. Like I said, the hyper-awareness from the Ecstasy played a part, I am sure of it. And I know, I  just know for sure, it was no hallucination. It was both too detailed and too confined: why would I have hallucinated only that very brief event that night? There were plenty of other things that could have made me hallucinate during the course of the evening, and I never did. Nor, in my life, have I ever hallucinated on Ecstasy, which I must have taken dozens of time in my younger days.",2021-04-23T00:00:00,,

The speed of my car would have been between 70 and 80 mph. In that instant near the center of the passenger side windshield there was a PERFECTLY spherical impact crater. The size of which was large grapefruit (ish). The impact into the glass was ~ 2-3 inches in but it did not go through the glass. I thought possibly I saw a  glint before the impact but truthfully I am not sure. The force of this impact destroyed my entire windshield. Of course I immediately pulled over. There was not a car on the road and it was perfectly beautiful blue sky morning. If you go to google maps and look at the street view where I described you will see exactly the terrain. But literally there is nothing but scrubby low high desert vegetation. No overpasses no people nothing. ! It is quite barren. After pulling over the 1st thing I did was look and touch lightly touch the inside impacted glass in the car and was amazed the perfect spherical shape. Unfortunately, as I touched it because the glass was so fine it easily started to deform (just a little) and for some odd reason I choose not to take a photo (even though phones then were not the greatest this was dumb). After I got done looking at the inside and pondering what the hell caused this (going through the logical choices (Rock / Stone, bird or possibly debris from an aircraft ?of meteoroid?? in the most logical order. I get out of the car and examine the impact from the outside.. Again it is perfectly spherical, and there is no blood, feathers, dust, debris, moisture .. Nothing. Looking at the area where the incident occurred there is nothing no people no bridges nothing natural that would cause anything like this. In retrospect the force required for that type of incident had to be very grea! t but the fact there was no remnants suggests to me that the o! bject th at hit the windshield would have had to reverse itself in a 180 degree manner ..

Quanto a data, me recordo apenas que foi no segundo semestre de 1999. Eu tinha 14 anos, estava na oitava série. Quanto a duração do evento, eu observei por cerca de meia hora, mas imagino que o ovni já estava lá por mais tempo, e depois destes 30 minutos minha mãe me buscou, entrei no carro e perdi o contato visual.  Relato: Foi o ano de 1999, eu estudava a tarde e as vezes ficava após a aula para jogar vôlei com outros alunos de outras salas, que não eram muito próximos.  Eu havia parado e jogar, e sentei em uma pequena arquibancada para ver os demais treinando enquanto esperava minha mãe ir me buscar.  Depois de um tempo vendo o jogo, olhei para o céu e lá estava o ovni, uma grande luz branca circular, rodeada por outras luzes menores de cor vermelha. As luzes vermelhas eram no máximo umas 10, bem distribuídas em volta da luz branca.  Estava parado, não se deslocava, não girava.  Não fazia nenhum barulho,  não tinha alteração na intensidade das luzes, não havia rastro. Não tive nenhuma sensação estranha, estava bem de saúde e sóbrio.  Porém, talvez o maior problema para a confirmação da veracidade deste relato seja que, eu vi, mas no tempo em que fiquei observando, não vi mais ninguém observar. Eu, tímido na época, sentado sozinho na arquibancada esperando minha mãe, e pouco amigo dos que ali estavam, também não informei a ninguém. Nao comentei nem com a minha mãe quando entrei no carro, mas ainda vi o ovni pela janela um pouco enquanto íamos pra casa.  Porém, como fui embora antes do término do treino de vôlei, imagino que outros alunos tenham visto também. Me recordo de um deles, nome e sobrenome, mas nunca nos encontramos novamente após eu finalizar a oitava série e mudar de escola.  Imagino que era um objeto Grande, e que estava a relativamente próximo do solo, talvez mais baixo do que um avião de grande porte em viagem internacional.  Hoje, com 36 anos, apos 12 trabalhando com um pouco de informações georreferenciadas e SIGs, após uma curta ""carreira"" como piloto de paraglider, e após um curso teórico para piloto privado no aeroclube, com toda certeza afirmo que o objeto que vi não era um satélite, um helicóptero, um balão seja de passeio ou meteorológico, e muito menos um drone.  Após este avistamento, mesmo observando o céu com frequência durante os anos e sendo capaz de distinguir satélites em movimento em meio as estrelas, nunca mais visualizei algo parecido.  Portanto, me sinto privilegiado por ter avistado um verdadeiro ovni.  Por fim, comentei este assunto com dois amigos, já na faculdade, em torno de 2008, e nunca antes disso. Gostaria de ter feito este relato na época, mas salvo engano eu não tinha sequer computador.  Obrigado.",2021-04-23T00:00:00,,

The house is located on a semi-country Road in Ohio. The street is lined with trees that canopy over the road - it is very hilly and heavily wooded. The east side of the street is owned by a private park, which is relevant later in the story.  We checked on the house, everything seemed to be fine and we proceeded to drive down the street towards our home. As we came to the top of a steep hill, a bright white ball of light, about the size of a basketball, was headed straight for our car. Before I could even think, the light hit the car and everything flashed white for what seemed like an eternity.  It was the strangest feeling. Everything was blindingly white, I couldn’t see anything at all. And there was a deafening silence. Then suddenly we were back at the top of the hill but everything went back to normal. The first thought I had was that we lost time. I looked at the clock but it seemed to show the right time. I asked my husband if he was OK and he said yes. We were dumbfounded by this....I also wondered how our eyes weren’t affected. Usually after seeing such a bright light, your eyes would see spots or at least take a second to adjust. But this didn’t happen, we were back and our eyes didn’t seem to be affected.  I fully expected to arrive home and find a burn mark or something on the car, thinking it was some sort of lightning - Although there were no storms or clouds in the sky. Maybe it was heat lightning? But it was clearly a very defined ball of light, not just a flash. To my surprise, the car didn’t show any signs of damage at all.  I don’t have an explanation for what happened that night, only logical conclusion was that it was ball lightning. However, there are a few other events involving white light in that area that would refute the ball lightening theory.  First, my sister in law, lived in a rental property within the privately owned park to the east of my mother-in-law’s street. We were driving past that park when the ball of light hit our car. She lived there with her husband, deep in the wooded area. The house was so deep in the woods that they had to park their car and walk along a wooded trail and over a stream to access the house. One morning, she mentioned to her husband that she had the strangest dream. She dreamt that she woke up and every single window in the house had the brightest white light shining into it. It was a blinding light. Her husband’s face turned pale and he said to her, in utter shock, that he had the same exact dream. Ever since then they are convinced that it was extraterrestrial activity.  In addition to that event, it has been brought to my attention that the owners of the park have also noticed activity in the woods. There have been bright white balls of light moving around in the woods on several occasions. They don’t have an explanation.  Lastly, I run a cleaning company and recently acquired a customer who lives in close vicinity to the park. I explained some of the events and asked her if she’s ever seen anything. Her house sits high at the top of a hill with woods surrounding it. Although she has never seen the things I mentioned to her, she did comment that an unusual thing did happen at one point, and it has stuck with her ever since. One night, as she lay in bed, a very bright light flashed in front of her eyes, so bright she could see it even with her eyes closed. She always wondered about it because the bedroom is on the second floor and the house is so high over the road that car headlights couldn’t shine in.",2021-04-23T00:00:00,41.53125,-81.26941666666666

The drive home was fairly normal, as were listening to music on the radio and talking.  About 10 miles into the drive my radio turned off and went to static.   I didn't think anything of it because our roads are rough. We saw a bright light in the sky and though it may have just been a bright star. We decided to stop and look at the light. I said, ""Wow, look at that star. Isn't it so bright?"" He then said, ""It looks like it's moving closer."" We sat observed for about 10 seconds until it had gotten close enough to see the triangular, black/metallic sides of the craft. I would estimate that the craft was 1.5 miles away. The cows in the field in front of us were startled as they were mooing frantically. Once the craft had gotten close enough we decided to drive off very fast. I was driving about 60 MPH down the gravel road as the craft followed us 1 mile away to the East of us. The craft seemed to have moved along the buttes to the East only 150 feet above them and moving in a motion different than any other craft I have ever seen. When we got home, my brother ran inside and I decided to stay and observe. While I was looking across the road at a butte I could hear a low humming noise. Next, the craft hovered up from behind the butte to reveal itself. I decided to observe the craft and video it. I could see the triangular sides of the craft, and the bright lights on the side of it. The craft stayed hovering above the butte for around 20 seconds before slowly moving downward behind the butte.

Baker, USA. Early evening, still light out, I stepped out to admire the evening. i observed an object at about the speed of a twin engine light aircraft.  Like a piper Seneca II airspeed. Two things got my attention.  1. Its unusual direction of ESE. Living here 28 years  I have not observed an aircraft going in that specific direction.   Just  north and a bit east is Boundary Bay Airport. (CZBB).  Normally aircraft are  southbound from the airport.,  They are about  3/4 -1 mile away from our house, southbound, over the bay. Normal also is northbound to CZBB or  NW bound for Vancouver airport, or jets flying over, on a N or NW direction.. I simply stared at it.  2. Observed a light at its rear end such as I have never seen, and question if anyone else has.  It was a bright white, rotating And  pulsating light.  As object's direction possibly would have made wings imperceptible, I presumed by its speed and altitude of about 5,000’ ASL it had to be an aircraft.  Yet could see no wings. This rotating motion made me believe the entire object was rotating  clockwise as it was moving.  Impossible to know. The brightness of it dimmed then  brightened again about every eight  seconds.  No parts of the object were visible on either side of this light. It was going away from me. No red or green lights were seen.  Conclusion: I presumed it was just an aircraft with a different light, given altitude and speed.  It confused me a lot. Was it really rotating, the object?  I believe it was. Then I questioned its altitude thinking it was much higher as I looked than I initially thought. Also  noticed I did not hear any engine noise. Butt that can happen sometimes.  I just stared at it til it disappeared in distance.  Question:  is this a common light to be seen at the end of an aircraft?  Are there other reports?

Observer is a retired aerospace engineer with a structural test, design and analysis background. Wife and I sitting on outside patio 6:05 pm on cloudless warm summer evening. Heard popping sounds we never heard before coming from trees. I got up to look at the pine tree in our back yard because the patio umbrella obscured my view. I also looked directly overhead at palm tree canopy. My wife heard the popping but remained seated under the umbrella. Later found out noise was the sound of the pine cones opening. One UFO emerged from behind palm tree canopy straight overhead going fast and about the size of ½ a pencil eraser held at arms length. Within .5 to 1.0 second I ruled out it being a bird or a plane due to straight flight path, speed, no sound, it’s oval shape and fuzzy (no hard edge) appearance. I was able to see it for a total of about 3.5 seconds when I lost track of it in the whiteness of the horizon. It was also white with luminosity similar to that of a white fluffy cloud. SPEED / ALTITUDE / SIZE ESTIMATES: We live under Lindbergh field approach path and aircraft are approximately at 1000 ft. elevation near this sighting. The UFO was headed into the approach path of the aircraft. It was 2 to 4 times the height of typical approaching aircraft. Observed at 90 degree elevation and lost sight at 15 degree elevation (measured) making for a 75 degree angle of observation. Using this geometry the speed calculation comes out to be 2,898 m/h if at 4000 foot elevation or 1,447 m/h if at 2000 ft. elevation, again, no sonic boom or sound was heard. Diameter estimates range from 15 to 30 foot in diameter depending on actual altitude.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

After about 2 minutes, I looked at the light and realized that it had lifted above the mountain. It was ascending.  The light was still swinging around but was getting dimmer and dimmer.  When it was at its highest, about 45 degrees above the horizon, it dimmed until it was almost out.  At that point, my husband and I saw two objects eject from the top towards the right and fade.  After that, the object completely faded also.  There was no further activity that evening. It was impossible to estimate how far away and how high the object was but due to its brightness, it seemed relatively close.",2021-03-31T00:00:00,35.661082683982684,-105.95390714285715

I am a teenage boy residing in Souderton, Pennsylvania, and for years I have been taking guitar lessons at a place not far from my house every Tuesday at 7:00 p.m.  This night, I was running just a little late, leaving my house at 7:00. I turned out of my cul-de-sac and onto the same route I take every night. As I was approaching a stop sign ~150 yards from my cul-de-sac, a bright, constant blue-tinted light caught my attention. The clouds were thin, but brights stars were visible through them and had a ""haze"" around them, as bright stars and the moon do when their light passes through thin clouds. The blue light had that same ""haze,"" so I knew that it must be behind the clouds.  Almost instantaneously after looking at it, it seemed to ""fall"" extremely, extremely quickly with no determinable acceleration in the exact direction I was driving. There is a tree line a few hundred feet past the stop sign (it is a 3-way stop sign, so I can either go right of left), and it seemed to almost disappear into the sky just before the tree line rather than disappear behind the trees. I stopped at the stop sign and my eyes began tearing up because I could not believe what I had just seen.  The first thing I thought to do was call my dad who was at our house just hundreds of yards away because I felt that I had to explain to someone what I just saw.  I mention the phone call because this report is being made on February 24, 2020, months after the sighting, and after reading a report from a woman in Vineland, New Jersey (57 miles from Souderton) too similar to what I saw that has the same date (12/03/19) and time stamp (7:00 p.m.) of when I saw whatever I saw, I looked back at every Tuesday going back to September 2019, and determined that the call I made to my dad at 7:03 p.m. on 12/03/19 was the date that I saw it. I feel that even though it is months later, I had to make a report to create a second report of what I believe is this sighting because what I saw is unlike anything I've ever seen, and my reaction of tearing up and almost fear was an uncontrolled emotion I never felt before that I guess must have stemmed from me seeing an unexplainable ""phenomenon.""",2020-02-25T00:00:00,40.295500000000004,-75.3254

At around 9:30pm, looking NE, three lights caught my eye. It was their trajectory, silence, and lack of navigation lights that drew my immediate attention. They were moving west with the wind from the direction of the beach at a fair clip at about 100ft in altitude. Slightly faster than the wind speed (around 10- to 12-knots). They looked to be about 1/8- to 1/4-mile away, but it's hard to say considering I have no scale to attribute them to.  The lights were mottled white and LED-ish with multiple sources each in the general shape of an orb. The three formed an equilateral triangle shape from my perspective and dead silent. I was in a quiet area of the island, and any small airplane traffic (it's pretty common) is easily heard from long distances, and even over the din of the surf. I heard absolutely nothing coming from these things.  I chalked it up as a singular event and an unknown, but then another wave of similar objects appeared coming from the same direction. This grouping included approximately twelve objects much like, but not identical to, the first three. These were circular orb-like objects at various heights. One object was oblong and vertically oriented, and stood out as very different than the others, with the other objects of varying diameters.  I fumbled for my phone to get a pic or a video, but decided otherwise (see below).  As I put my phone down, another small orb at a lower altitude came hustling by from the same direction as the others. It quickly sped westward towards the other disappearing objects. Then - nothing.  I went through a check list of what these things might be. First: birds. Where I was is a major bird flyway, and I've spent a large portion of my scholastic career studying birds: these were not birds. At least not any I've ever seen.  Next: fixed wing aircraft or helicopter. With no sound or visible navigation lights, I ruled them out.  Possibly: drones. That's a solid maybe. Though I've never seen drones move this fast for what looked like miles, I'm not ruling them out. But again - silence. Not a peep, and the drones I've seen use multi colored LEDs. Also, there was a fishing tournament that weekend and drones are a VERY common component of these events. But this many? It's a hard sell.  Military/FAA: there is a naval air station about 30-miles from my sighting location, along with a large military and coast guard presence. The idea that this many airborne objects on various vectors with zero navigation lights strikes me as huge red flag. I heard, nor saw, anything airborne after the objects moved miles west of me over the bay.  Lastly: my phone. What's the point? Yet another digital record of white lights on a black back drop that could easily be CGI or some other manipulation. Bottom line is, I don't know what I saw.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,,

Last night me and my cousin was leaving to walk around and talk, as usual then the  First encounter. The ufo  was unable to be seen but a  blinking blue then white sliver of light was zipping around in the sky it looked like it would go abnormally  fast and the light got longer and  it looked like it would go long ways the sideways. The Ufo disappeared behind a treeline that boarders our Neighborhood. We kept walking to the gas station where  we sit to talk, We then see over by the treeline across the street, from the entrance  of my neighborhood white and red lights, Specifically  White lights flashing around a generally small area. I pointed it out saying its the Military, They've circled my area more since the pandemic. Second encounter, The lights we thought was the military plane was a UFO. It got closer and stayed stationary  in the sky  with flashing red and white lights then disappeared fully with no sign of it anywhere. (I tried to take pictures of ! 2 of the 3 times including this, this one being the one I couldn't capture.) When we got stuff from the gas station, we returned to her house to bring a drink to our grandma  and we saw another ufo. Our third encounter   and last in the night, around the same exact area we first saw the first ufo in the sky. We saw just a light and it got brighter and I tried to take a picture. Youre able to see the marking in the sky with adjusting light exposures, but with doing that with a picture last night shows a almost inhuman face, even I do not believe it but i see it in the picture  but I have no clue what would have happened to make that on the photo. -I need to express im very worried! Ive never reported anything but Ive experienced multiple  Ufos on multiple  occasions, with Different  people who've  all seen it with me. I have pictures of a bruise i woke up with with dots lined down it in a grid pattern. I also have a picture of my Fiance  with gridded dots  down his back with no explanation or Possible way to get them in his sleep. - 2 weeks ago me and my Fiance were driving on Tonkel rd. To see a white dot get bigger towards us it turned red then disappeared.Later about 10 minutes  later, I felt the whole car vibrate and the  glass, i thought it was loose it got loud with the vibrating, I touched  vibrating Glass and my whole chest felt heavy and hard to breathe i started crying and freaking out saying i wanted to go home after and my Fiance saw it all and has never seen me freak out wanting to go home and honestly  in that moment  i dont remember  much but freaking out and the glass vibrating. - March, 2020 last year Me and another  friend was sitting in an Old trailer park in a field, ALSO in the same area (mile up the road) A massive ufo with almost a metallic  black ice look it was dark and almost unreal with still light reflecting off the bottom. It was over head and over a near in construction  hotel but VERY  close to the ground. It zipped forward in an unreal Way. It looked like a big oval/rectangular from bottom  view. -also some time in 2020, with a video, me and my fiance were sitting in the car singing after a wedding  in his car, i sat my phone down  and left it record, you can see Multiple  lights that are bright white turn on above our heads and zip off. Again im very concerned,theres been more occurrences, a couple pictures and a video that  shows what ive been talking about and its provoked  me to reach out",2021-08-16T00:00:00,41.09336991071429,-85.1455725

On the evening of Wednesday, July 14, 2021 I have been driving for approximately four hours on the interstate with intermittent stops, for travel related to family matters. When I arrived at my uncles house at 11:00 PM I paused to look up at the night sky, as I always do because I am an amateur astronomer, and I saw a light at least as bright as Jupiter and probably a little bit brighter in the North, moving from left to right on a flat trajectory to the northeast. It looked very close, but it vanished after about 3 seconds of flight, during which it covered about 20 degrees of arc in the sky. I then went in and visited my uncle for 4 hours.  It just so  happens that my house is also to the north, so after visiting my uncle I drove to my house in the country about a half-mile away. When I arrived at my house, the sky was fully dark, completely clear, and there was no moon that I could see from my vantage point but there are some trees that may have been blocking it.  Upon getting out of the car I looked up to the north and immediately saw the same object at 3:00 AM that I had seen some four hours earlier. Again this object was a single bright point of orange light, about as bright as Jupiter or perhaps a little bit brighter, but not as bright as Venus on an early morning. This object was in the northern sky making what appeared to be huge curves or circles, slowly loitering above our rural town.  I attempted to film it with my iPhone but it was impossible because the quality was too bad. I saw the object move from approximately northwest to approximately north east in a soft curve trajectory that was definitely pronounced enough to be a curve, but there were no sudden movements. Judging from my days of model rocketry, I would estimate the altitude to have been approximately 1500 feet to 2500 feet, and the object appeared to cover approximately 1/4 the sky in the space in a time of maybe six or seven seconds. At no time was there a contrail or a sound of any kind. It just looked like an extremely large, bright orange fireball that was very orange in color and resembled the planet Jupiter burning clearly on a dark night, only it was moving in a curved path.  After curving from approximately Northwest to Northeast, left to right, over six seconds, it doubled back to come in my direction and rapidly grew dim at the same time, then vanished without a trace.  I stayed outside for about an hour looking for this object to return since it had loitered in the area for approximately four hours, but it never came back. This was a rural town that is quite small and there are no airports or drone activity anywhere around here. The only air traffic we get is passenger jets at a very high altitude, and occasionally we get an Osprey Naval aircraft flying through to get to Norfolk Naval base, but they make so much noise you can hear them for nearly a full minute before you ever see them, even in broad daylight.  The object I saw on July 14 at 11:00 PM was unmistakably 100% the same object I saw in the same area of sky on July 15 at 3:00 AM. I have no idea what this was, it remains an extremely intriguing and unexplained sighting for me. I tried to take a video both times, but I was too late the first time, and the second time it was there but I set the camera at max zoom hoping to get a closeup, and I could not aim the camera to get the object in frame the way it was moving, at that zoom level. I’ll be glad to send NUFORC the videos.",2021-08-16T00:00:00,37.8194,-79.7398

Almost a full 45 minutes  it was in the area going from one spot to another and then disappearing  and the crazy thing is  know it was a UFO. I know there are no man made space craft that when going invisible, turn the color Burgundy. I have many pieces of video footage from close up zoomed in video footage of it and am hesitant to upload on social media. The colors it changed was beautiful. While everyone was at home and enjoying Christmas, I was recording something super cool!!!",2021-01-19T00:00:00,33.73561208791208,-118.29940934065934

It looked like it was out of a movie, it took me a while to start taking because I was so nervous, so the camera footage is when we had moved some distance away. It was foggy & windy, but so clearly the shape was an upper circular dome and a lower circular dome then a huge flat circular disk around it. There was lights around the entire disk and then a bright one on the top of the upper dome. The bottom dome had a red light that was explosive & twice the bottom seemed to explode with red light and a strong fat light beam would shoot from the bottom then suck itself back in. Almost like a huge smoke cloud explosion that shoots in a straight beam then back in as if someone was rewinding it back in. It’s! so hard to explain.

It was 10:20 at night going down a little cottonwood canyon on a bicycle in Sandy Utah. We were in the area behind Albion Middle School that's forested on a good view. We looked up and were immediately taken back by what appeared to both of us ""a large object"" to be a very large skinny object. I quoted after that that thing had to be a mile or too long. I can't remember now because the moment has passed at the time however I was very convinced that there was an object in the sky between 2500 and 20,000 ft in the air. The object went across the sky very quickly appearing to be thousands of miles an hour consistent with the SpaceX satellite. Although after it went overhead it vanished within 2 seconds every single light just absolutely disappeared. I find that strange because SpaceX satellites I imagine wouldn't just vanish and you can clearly see them vanishing at the last second or two of the video. Within probably 5 seconds of the video ending The! video is exactly 1 minute long because that's the maximum Snapchat limit. In the video footage the biggest inconsistency with anything rational is at the 8 second mark there is a large flash that would have to be huge if it was in space right next to this formation. The odds of an object re-entering the atmosphere and looking like the way it does on film seems very small. So I checked for potential rational explanations as to what I have seen and filmed and they are saying that there was SpaceX satellites over salt lake City around the time we saw it. I am basically looking for a rational explanation to what that light is at the 8 second mark. Even though I may or may not have seen something more. I uploaded the video to YouTube because I didn't know where else to put it So there it is thank you for your time please look at what I'm looking at and see if you can explain it. https://youtu.be/wrshMqQ7Q9w",2021-07-31T00:00:00,40.5744996996997,-111.84603033033034

Mostly I see the smaller orbs each night. As mentioned I witness them in every direction and all hours of the night. I have attempted to video these sightings and not as successful as I would like. I have only reported these experiences on your website but thinking I should perhaps report to a news agency or law enforcement. I don’t want to be thought of as goofy and absolutely 100% certain what I am seeing is abnormal, unidentified aerial phenomenon and uncertain if these spherical beings/objects are friendly or threatening. I believe they are intelligent. They can appear and vanish suddenly. They often camouflage in the clouds and act as if they are harvesting energy from them as I witness them more ofyen when it is somewhat stormy. This larger orb releasing multiples is out in the open sky at this time. I have witnessed them moving about quite slowly and also with remarkable speed. I am amazed by these experiences and also somewhat frightened. I live alone and so I witness these events by myself. Every time I ask a neighbor to share the experience they behave as if I am losing my mind. I indeed am not. I will continue to report my sightings and this is my third report.

Looking at him I noticed a very soft colored orange light to the left in the sky flying at a unusual speed unlike anything we are aware of that we intentionally have in the skies quickly without moving for fear that it will notice I notice it I tell my boyfriend “please look!” It wasn’t hard to find especially because it was fast and low.

Immediately open my door with fear I didn’t understand and a rush came over me when I saw another light of same color not in motion right above me lower then the first one and I quickly got into my house 25 ft away. I know there isn’t a definitive definition for this because we don’t even know how to communicate with whatever this is.

I must have been approaching mile marker 50, when a bright light appeared in the storm clouds directly ahead of me, brightening––for a moment––the clouds immediately surrounding its source. The source of the light soon emerged from the cloud covering: it was a glowing orb which I saw descending  to earth in a straight path. Within seconds, it had disappeared from view behind a hill.  By my estimate, it must have made impact no more than a mile from my vehicle. Numerous others must have witnessed the event as well, as the highway was heavily trafficked.

A large break in cloud cover above me revealed three bright, pale blue lights moving together in a southward direction. The spacing between the lights remained equidistant, giving the impression of a singular large object with three points of lights on the bottom. I listened for any aircraft or drone noise but there was none and there were no secondary aircraft signal lights. They had a strange quality to them, they didn't flicker but looking at the centre of each one was like looking at a light being shone through ice or crystal and there was a difference in colour around the edges, as though they were sunk into a surface. I began to take my phone out of my pocket to video what I was seeing and as I did so they began to dim, starting with the light nearest me. They dimmed down to just pinpoints of light while still moving and did not go behind any cloud. By the time I could hit record they had disappeared.

Sighting details: At approximately 2130hrs on May 5th, 2021, I was taking a walk through a very dimly lit RV park one mile East of Williams Arizona. I happened to look upwards and was immediately startled to notice a nearly perfect straight line of bright white lights stretched horizontally across the sky. As I stopped to look intently upon them I noticed they were slightly brighter white than the stars that were clearly visible in the dark night sky. These lights emitted a constant stream of light and did not have the “twinkling” effect that stars frequently have. The string of lights seemed to be equally spaced from one another, horizontally, but were slightly higher/lower from one another vertically. The lights appeared to all be attached to the same craft, as I could just barely make out a very faint appearance of a gray object against the black sky background. The moment I first saw the light formation it appeared to be stationary, but within a few seco! nds all the lights began to slowly move to my right, in unison with each other. They continued at the same very slow speed until out of sight. I’m not exactly certain of my directional bearings at the time, but I am fairly certain it was moving from the Southwest towards the Northeast in direction. The string of lights was very long. I looked up at about 30 degrees to my left, and it spanned to about 30 degrees to my right. That was my full field of view, due to some tall Ponderosa Pine trees blocking my view of either end of it. I could clearly see approximately 15 lights in a straight line on the object, but there appeared to be more that were being blocked by the trees. It was a very quiet night outside that evening and there was no audible noise coming from this craft. My background: I am 61 years old. I am retired from the US Air Force. I worked on fighter jets as a maintenance technician. I have a BS degree in Psychology from Grand Canyon University, an Associates Degree in Aerospace Technology, and completed half of the credits needed towards a Masters Degree in Family Counseling from Phoenix Seminary.",2021-05-20T00:00:00,35.356075,-112.25706249999999

Sept. 20, 2015 Sighting in Francestown, NH  Although this report comes some 6 years after the observation, it quite accurately reflects what I observed, since detailed notes were written down the day following the observation (I am a research scientist, so observing and recording details of phenomena are in my ‘DNA’). I believe what I observed, described in detail below, must be evidence of an advanced technology from someone and somewhere other than humans on this planet. I live on a little traveled dirt road and have neighbors only on two sides, east and west along the road, but not directly in view. This is a very rural location and no lights were in view from traffic or other houses that I could have mistaken for what I observed. It was a totally clear evening on Sept. 20, 2015 around 10:30 PM, well past dusk, but enough faint light remained on the horizon (from sun having set in the west) to see things fairly clearly. As I let the dog out in the fenced yard to do her business I noticed at the base of our driveway (~ 120 ft away, going from the house east parallel to the road and then curving down southward to meet the road), a few vehicles moving back and forth periodically on the road. They had yellow flashing lights, so were not just regular vehicles on the road. I watched for a few minutes and then, after letting the dog in, decided to go down the driveway and talk to the drivers to find out what was happening. As I reached the driveway entrance close to the road I glanced to my right and saw something lit up in the sky (westerly direction) and looked at it more closely for a minute. It was not more than 300-400’ (guesstimate) away at most and not high up, maybe 100’; but this was hard to estimate since I did not know the object size I was looking at or have easy reference points in the distance.  What I saw was two horizontal amber orange lights, like long neon tube lights might look, one above the other and they were parallel, but spaced by a distinct distance about the diameter of each light.  One tube light appeared to have a short gap in its illumination . I could not tell the size or shape of what these lights were attached too.  If pressed to estimate, I would say the object was at least the size of an automobile. Suddenly, this being a strange object that was slowly moving toward me, I felt a bit exposed and so decided not to try and talk to the occupants of the vehicles I had seen. They had already withdrawn a distance down the road to the east anyway. I walked back up the driveway to my house and as I did noticed to my left (south) a bright white light maybe 30 ft off the ground but behind trees across the road in the river valley bottom. I could not see the light directly; it was always behind the trees, so I never could estimate the size of the light or the size and shape of what it was attached to. As I got up to my house, the light was now a bit lower and seemed to be above the small river (~ 20’ wide) that runs along the valley floor on the other side (south) of the road from my house. As I got to my house it stopped moving as far as I could tell and remained about 30-40’ above the river and always behind the tall trees about 150’ from my position beside my house, which is situated about 20’ above the river water level. At this time of year in Fall the leaves were still fully on the trees so I had no direct view of the object at any time. I also tried observing the object from the second story windows inside my house! , but got no better view of it. This object made absolutely no sound whatsoever and all was still outside where I continued watching; there was no wind either making any noise. I should mention now that I did not own a cellphone, and my camera was somewhere in the house and not convenient to attempt taking a picture of the obscured object. I decided to continually watch it since I thought it would disappear at any second.  I commenced to watch it (to my surprise) for the next 45 minutes.  Occasionally I would walk 20-30’ closer and move left or right to change views, but got no additional detail of what this object was.  The object seemed to move some and may have moved a few feet in any direction, including up or down, during this entire time, but no substantial change occurred in its position.  Again, I had to infer this from what I saw the light doing indirectly behind the illuminated trees and the limited ground area I could see that was brightly lit.  As far as the light itself, it was white the entire time and it looked as if the directionality of illumination was not consistent, but changed continuously in terms of its illumination intensity of ! the ground areas and different trees surrounding it. I should mention that it would have been very difficult to get close enough to see what this light was, since the river bottom had thick swampy brush to get through (40-50’ of it beyond and below the road level) to be sufficiently under the trees in front of the object to observe it directly. In addition, not knowing what danger might be involved in being too close to the strange object (poisonous gases, radiation), I decided I would go no further than being outside next to or close to my house in case I needed to take shelter. I was excited and somewhat apprehensive, never scared, during this entire time. As to the white light’s relation to the horizontal amber lights originally sighted, I am not sure. They could have been part of the same object or belonged to different objects. I never saw the amber lights again although I looked in that westerly direction again a number of times from my position outside of my house. Another really strange feature was that the white light object appeared to periodically (every few seconds) drop small bits of whitish light or what looked like burning embers that seemed to almost touch the ground but these did not stay illuminated upon reaching the ground; they just disappeared. These I could see clearly as they dropped below the level of the lowest leafy branches. They appeared to be no larger than about a tennis ball size, perhaps smaller. There was no hint of anything catching fire on the ground either, in those portions of the ground that I could see clearly below the lowest branches of the trees in front of and in proximity to the object. During watching the lighted area across the road for about 40 min the vehicles on the road would periodically come into view at the base of my driveway and then back up, as if observing cautiously what was going on with the object. It was light enough out for me to notice that one of the vehicles was a firetruck, but with no emergency or vehicle lights on. I never saw a police vehicle that I could identify. I could only guess that it was the appearance of this object in town that they were there for and maintaining a watchful eye over. After about 40 min these vehicles stopped appearing in view and may have left for good as far as I knew. As all of this happened my wife was asleep in bed, so I decided to wake her to be a witness to these strange events. I did wake her and we both watched the object for the next 30-45 min. without anything significant changing. It now being close to midnight and being tired, we both decided to go to bed. After it seemed a short while in bed (10 min?) there was a crash that I heard (tree limb) and the power went out. This may have happened after longer than 10 min and I may have dozed off before it happened. Very soon (?) after hearing the crash I heard a chainsaw and knew the power company or some road crew was busy dealing with the situation. That is all I remember that evening having fallen asleep again. This limb damage/ power outage event may have been a complete coincidence to the strange light incident I observed; I simply don’t know. When I woke up the next morning the power was restored. When I went out to the road, the object was gone and there was evidence that a limb from a dead tree had indeed come down, probably hit the power line and had been cut up (I could see the cut sections and a blackened branch section a few feet off the road that must have touched the wires and caused the outage?). I do not know if the white object had anything to do with the limb coming down since the fallen limb was from a tree 50’ closer to the house (adjacent to the road) than the object had been as long as I watched it. I decided to make my way across the swampy bottom land to where the light had been above the river. When I got there I could observe no evidence of the object having been there. There were no ground disturbances, no tree limbs or vegetation broken and no scorched areas of vegetation or trees observed at any height. As far as I can tell, in the intervening 6 years, there have been no long term effects o! n trees and vegetation at the site below where this object was levitated. I decided to ask my local fire department a few weeks later if they had responded to any strange occurrences that evening. The person I spoke to said no. Somehow I don’t believe I got the whole story. During this strange incident, I should mention that there were no electrical disturbances I was aware of in the house while I observed the object and no missing time or other anomalies. Other than the power going out as mentioned after going to bed, although there was a plausible explanation for that as I described. I have never had any other strange occurrences at this property before or since in my 30+ years of living here. I did report a previous brief UFO sighting (5-6 seconds long at most) some 6 years earlier at the edge of town (~ 5 miles from my house) while driving home at dusk one evening. It was completely unlike the present object reported and I did submit a report about that in 2009. This 2015 observation occurred before the widespread use of drones (they’re not silent). My closest neighbors to the west did not observe this event, but they may not have been home or awake at that time since I did not talk to them about it until weeks after this incident. I believe I witnessed something extraordinary that is well beyond the current technology of mankind on this planet.",2021-04-23T00:00:00,42.9917,-71.8076

When I looked up, I was confused at what I was looking at. It took about 15 seconds or so for my brain to comprehend what I was looking at was a giant, beige colored, Triangular ""aircraft"".  It was surrounded by 3 balls of light. 2 behind it,  1 out in front.  The balls of light appeared to be metal but it was too bright to see the shape of them.  The triangle sat not far above the tree tops, totally silent. It had 3 massive lights on the bottom.  2 red and 1 white light. They were rotating in sequence. First the red one would come on and get super bright, then dim out. Then the next red light did the same thing, followed by the white one. It kept repeating that sequence.  The light was so memorizing.  ((Sic.  Mesmerizing))  It wasn't light from light bulbs. It was bright like stars. The lights looked like they were coming from inside the aircraft. I was very close and wanted to go look directly under the aircraft. The top of the triangle appeared to be shifting.  It didn't appear to be solid. It looked like it was engulfed by ""boiling clouds"", similar to what boiling water looks like, but instead of water, a cloud was boiling.  As I got closer to the triangle, I suddenly noticed all sound was gone. No traffic, nothing. I also felt like I was 3 feet in the air, even though I was on the ground. I felt as though I was on a pitcher's mound. Best way to describe it. The colors around me were slightly brighter or more vibrant. I felt like I was somewhere else although I appeared to be right where I was standing  Then a man on a bicycle came from behind me and I remember looking at him and he was moving in slow motion. It was so strange. It also was apparent he didn't see me or the massive aircraft in the sky.  I went to yell at him to look up and it felt like he was literally a million miles away.  It literally took him minutes to ride about 50 yds. He was in extreme slow motion.  As I stared at the 4 ""UAPs"", another beige triangle appeared out of the thin air, flashed all 3 of it's lights, and vanished before my eyes. It didn't fly in and fly out, it literally appeared and vanished. It appeared a second time, flashed it's lights at either me or the other triangle, and it just vanished in the blink of an eye. Again, it did not fly away.  After it vanished the second time, I looked at the triangle, and it started going straight up. The 3 balls of light were gone and I could hear traffic again. Colors were back to normal. I felt like I was somewhere else prior.  Very hard to describe  It took the triangle 12 minutes to finally get out of my view. It rose straight up until I could no longer see it.  I could see the rotating lights for almost the entire time.  I realize my story is crazy, you don't need to tell me. I stopped telling people because of how it sounds coming out of my mouth.  I can assure you, it's 100% true. I mean, I came up on a massive Triangle aircraft,  up close, in the middle of a sunny afternoon and I saw aircraft vanish into thin air. You start to question your reality and sanity.

They had and they both described a strange shaped flash of light that just disappeared and made a strange rolling sound ?!?  At that moment my sisters son; from the beach below, pointed in the same direction as my parents and shouted”Oh look, a saucer”. I quickly reached for my phone and realized it was not in my back pocket where it usually was. I had left it up in the truck so I ran as fast as I could back up to the path to the parking lot open the door and grabbed my cell phone and ran back down the path all of which took me probably about one minute. I took out my phone and instead of taking low resolution video I decided to take as high-resolution photographs as I possibly could and started clicking clicking clicking in the direction of which I had seen the pop of light. Aiming at the clouds I had seen the objects near previously. I’m taking these photographs and I’m looking around and I noticed the rest of my family all looking out there as well - seemingly entranced by what they were looking at. Very strange shape; it’s a small silver disc with a little white oval or cigar shaped spark that follows near it darting all around. It seems to shutter or skip across the sky, you get a glimpse of it in one place and then a slight glimpse of it again and then suddenly it’s in the whole new place far far down the length of the sky.  All in the blink of an eye. As we all collectively watch the disc suddenly seems to slow and the white cigar or tic-tac shaped spark seems to stop and fire a white thread like white beam that opens a white square and with it another silver disc seems to pop in or out of the square and then shoot off as the white tic-tac shaped light disappears quickly after them in the same direction.",2021-04-23T00:00:00,47.6476,-122.53639999999999

My friend and I are big outdoor enthusiasts and took a trip out to Olympic National Park back in August 2019. The night of our sighting we were camping at Kalaloch Beach. We walked down close to the water after dinner and were star gazing. We saw a ton of shooting stars, and even a few satellites, but what we saw next was nothing like those. It was a glowing orb that hovered for a couple minutes high in the sky. After staring at it for a couple of minutes it literally shined a directed light specifically at us. It didn't light up the sky or anywhere else but only shined on us. Not like a laser pointer but like a very narrow beam from a flashlight. It wasn't bright enough to hurt our eyes. My friend and I grabbed each other out of fear and disbelief. A few seconds later the orb split into 5 separate orbs. 4 of them flew off at a moderate speed, and the last one hovered for another minute or 2 then zoomed off at a rapid speed in the opposite direction.  I hadn't done much research about it afterwards, but today I saw 2 videos online that were very similar to what we saw. We are both healthy, active, late 20s males. I've always been a skeptic when it comes to UFO's or the supernatural, but there's no denying what we saw.  Another thing to note is that prior to our sighting that night we were blown away by the bioluminescent algae we saw all over the beach. The beach was glowing everywhere we stepped. It was incredible to see, but when we recall that night we hardly even think about the bioluminescent algae because of how incredible our UFO sighting was.",2021-04-23T00:00:00,,

I am not incredibly familiar with astronomy, however, I have been witnessing this same “star” in the same place every night and it flashes rainbow colors, is extra bright (compared to other stars), and appears way closer than other stars. I literally wanted to send this story of my experience to you for a while now, but it’s hard to even explain and I’m sure hard to believe.  Here it goes as it happened...  (Sorry for the extra details. I know this will be long, but please stick with it if you can)  Background: I was in a transitional period (moving, finances, etc) and I had to stay temporarily at a friend’s condo from November to early January. Anyway, my friend only has 2 assigned parking spots. My friend parks in the closest to their unit (3rd floor) and I have to use the other assigned space on the rooftop floor (floor 6).  For the weeks that we were staying there (myself and my 16 year old son), we took note of the “rainbow star” (which we have seen before, however, it is always in the exact same location in direct view from where we park on the rooftop of this condo building). Several times we’ve noted it and talked about how crazy it is that you can see it strobing so many colors. Well, time after time, we keep witnessing it (on clear nights only - seldom in Atlanta with the spraying, but still plenty of nights). So, beings that we didn’t feel comfortable where we were staying (roommate type situation), we would often come home, park, and have personal conversations in the car where we park. After plenty of times doing this, we started to notice that this “star” has a pattern to it. We would notice it there, stationary, then after about 20 some minutes it would move to the left (our left, its right) and then completely vanish only to reappear in the exact same spot approximately 20 minutes l! ater. Other times it would completely dim out (not move at all) and then reappear 20 minutes later. So nonetheless, that completely tripped us out once we saw the pattern and started timing it. Now, fast forward to the last day we spent there....  It was January 1st, 2020 (technically, it was New Years Eve but I had picked my son up and took him home right before midnight). I was upset with him for parent-type stuff (lol) and we drove up to our assigned spot, parked the car, and I was giving him a lecture. We were probably up there for about an hour and a half when he suddenly interrupted and pointed out the “rainbow star”. It was moving again but this time it was slightly moving up and down, left to right, vise-versa, etc. Almost completely unnoticeable unless you were really watching it. So, I stopped what I was saying and looked. We were both sitting there staring at it and it started moving again, but this time, it was moving to the left again fairly far. We were expecting it to do the same thing as the other times and disappear at the same point it normally did. But this time, it didn’t. It just kept moving. At this point we were both kind of like wtf. What we had witnessed before was crazy enough but this time i! t wasn’t doing what it was previously doing so predictably.  So, this is where it gets very weird so, please, bare with me…  As it was moving to the left, it moved seemingly just under a plane/aircraft (from our prospective - not sure how close they were in reality). The plane was an obvious plane because it had the typical blinking lights on the wing tips, etc. Well, as soon as it was parallel with this plane, it literally imitated the plane. It was blinking lights in the same pattern and everything (lights that clearly weren’t ever apart of it - red lights). At that moment we both kind of freaked out and got out of our car in order to look up and follow it. It passed the plane and then changed into 3 orbs (I hate using that word because it sounds so UFO/alien but that’s the best way to describe it). Then as it flew along, it went to 2 orbs, and then back to one solid light orb. The direction it was moving became parallel to the rooftop so we were losing track of it but it was very low and close now - definitely not “star distance”. We both ran to the other side of the parking deck where there’s ! stairs that go up a flight to an open-air tennis court so we could be higher. We still had it insight and it was now curving unnaturally and circling toward us. I feel like my description isn’t giving it much justice because it was incredibly scary and it’s hard to even describe in detail. So, we’re both standing there in the freezing cold watching this thing and saying nothing because we were both fascinated and spooked at the same time, but it was like you couldn’t not watch it. When suddenly, it does a sharp turn toward us and is literally in front/above us but incredibly close, and a bright light comes on facing us and it just hovers -completely non-moving. The light was incredibly bright - almost like the spotlight that police will put on at night facing your car when they pull you over. That’s the best way I can describe it. I literally grabbed my son’s jacket and told him to run but he didn’t move at first. Then I got angry and literally told him to effing run and he! snapped out of it and we ran back down to the car as fast as ! we could I’ve never been so scared in my life. The thing was intimidating. This is going to sound crazy, but it felt like it knew we were watching it and it watched us back.  I’ll try to make this part a summary as much as possible...  We ran to the car and immediately drove down the parking deck as fast as we could (both of us freaking out the entire way down and confirming with each other what we both witnessed). We had no place to go and there was no way we were going back there so we were trying to figure out where to drive to and what we were going to do. I was taking care of this family’s dog at the time while they were out of the country and the only place I could think to go was to stay at their house. So we headed in that direction (approximately 3 miles down the road). We’re almost there and as soon as we turn right onto the main street before their subdivision, a low flying object was hovering right above the trees (tree-top level) and it was the shape of a triangle with lights but with no base to the triangle (if that makes sense). What’s really weird about this is that I heard nothing but my son claimed he heard a helicopter-like sound. I have no clue how we both were there and heard different! things. And again, this sounds like some alien/UFO B.S. and I don’t believe in that so I don’t know what to make of any of this! It was again, hovering (not moving) like it was anticipating us turning on that street and that’s when I completely freaked out and literally was in tears out of fear. We sped under it and kept driving and I don’t even know what we were both yelling to each other but we were freaking out. I just kept driving and literally felt like something bad was about to happen to us. It felt like we were being stalked/not wanted/threatened etc. We got back to where there were streetlights on a main road and I told my son that we will just sleep in our car and find a hotel parking lot (it was the only thing I could think of - if I was even thinking straight). I ended up recalling a hotel that was up ahead off the street we were on and I told him we’d go there (probably 2-ish miles from this recent instance). Again, please believe me because this is going to s! ound so insane. I wish I could take a lie detector test becaus! e I unfo rtunately wouldn’t believe this either. But we pulled right into the parking lot and after you take that right, it’s a sharp left facing this hotel. We both saw it at the same time and I stopped my car. There was this figure in the window of the hotel staring straight out and just standing there right in front of us on the 5th floor. It didn’t move. It wasn’t in a room either, it was in the hallway of the hotel that has glass to the outside. There is nothing to look at (the building isn’t in the city and it’s facing just a parking lot and trees and this was 1 in the morning. We stopped there for about 30 seconds stunned and had that awful feeling where you feel like your blood is draining from your face. We zoom out of the parking lot and the thing turns to its left and is facing the wall (so now it’s a silhouette of a side view and is still standing in place. We take a left back onto the main road and go to the closest gas station when that same aircraft passes over us agai! n. We pull into the gas station panicked and I called my sister but she didn’t answer (only family/friend I have in Georgia) then I called my mom and dad on the west coast (which was super late their time for them on a work night) and told them everything that was happening (I actually thought that something was going to happen to us and if so, I wanted to tell someone what was going on). My parents suggested going to a 24 hour diner so I looked one up that was closest to us and we headed straight there – never been to this diner before, it’s called Landmark Diner in Buckhead. After we arrived, we were handed menus and at the top of the menu they have a big tagline that says, “Where The Stars Meet At Night” – so this was extra creepy as hell! Then when my son went to use the restroom he came out and asked me to come into the men’s bathroom to see the light. There were several recessed light fixtures in the ceiling and they were all white except one that was flashing every c! olor of the rainbow. I went and asked the manager why they had! one lig ht in the bathroom that flashes different colors and he asked me to show him. I did, and he said he never noticed that before and that maybe it needed to be replaced and was about to die. Our evening was an incredibly eerie experience. That’s basically the end. We wound up sleeping in our car in a 24 hr McDonalds parking lot for the following 2 nights because we didn’t want to go back to where we first witnessed this thing.  I don’t know what to think but there is something to this rainbow star that is much more than what I think anyone has experienced or covered. There’s something very wrong. Also, we do have a picture of the man/thing in the window at the hotel, the diner menu with the tagline, and a video of the light in the men’s restroom.  Since this occurrence, we have had several odd experiences - most notably - street lights that turn off and/or start blinking when we pass, but only during certain times. When we are together and when we are in a certain state of awareness - hard to explain. It's like an energy and the lights are like a reminder. It's also happened at home when we discuss it to the point that our dog starts barking and shaking uncontrollably and climbs to the top of the sofa and won't come down.  We also have missing moments of time in our experience that my son and I cannot reconcile. That's a longer story, but incredibly scary.",2021-04-23T00:00:00,33.808705515846256,-84.38988231962239

So I was watching these two vertical light rods is the best way to describe what I was seeing moving slowly together in the sky, just over the tree lines. I drove through two to three lights watching this happen before pulling off into the Bojangles parking lot and coming around the building to see if I can capture some video. It literally disappeared within that two second time frame. I cannot find any natural explanation for it.

I put my thumb over it and closed one eye thinking the light would move past my thumb, but that never happened. Then I thought we’ll maybe that’s Mars. We live out in the country away from city lights, so we can see a lot of stars and planets. I tried to dismiss it but after a few minutes I started to realize that this was something that didn’t make sense to me. I couldn’t process what I was seeing. I knew it wasn’t a planet, star, or plane because there is an overcast tonight and I can only see clouds.

I saw a tiny white dot around zenith of the sky dome, moving south east, approximately from M31's location, moving smoothly and quickly, towards M15's location on the sky dome, and my view of it was quickly blocked by neighbor's roof top. It is not an airplane as I then checked on flight radar website and around the time there is no known aircraft very high above me. and near M15's location there was a cloud trajectory made by another airplane. I moved to another spot trying to pick it up again but failed. I looked around in the blue sky and find no other white dots or aircrafts. About 20min latter, I made another call to the store, while waiting I intentionally looked up in the sky and I saw the white dot again moving in the similar direction. I am not sure if it is the same white dot. I suspect it is a drone doing 3D satellite map survey or so but drone flying that high needs to be registered with FAA.
