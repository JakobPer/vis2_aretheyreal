It looked to be approximatly 500 to 1500 feet up in the sky, and approximatly 1 mile from our current position. At first glance it appeared to be a plane heading in our direction which would be to the southwest. Almost immediatly it was determined by myself and the driver of the car that it was not an ordinary aircraft. At first there were two lights in the front of the craft positioned when an ordinary commercial airliner would have its headlights. The two lights were at least 10-15 feet in diameter and were blinking on and off one at a time. (one off and then one on again). On the top of the craft were a number of small, bright blinking lights maybe 5 or 6. These lights were similar to what you would see on the top of a tower antenna. (a very bright strobe affect). There did not appear to be any determinable shape or angles to the craft. There was no shape of a wing or tail found on either a plane or helicopter. As we got closer we saw that there was another large bright white light turning on and off in a pettern with the first two lights that were seen. As we approached the craft it appeared to be completely stationary just to the side of the interstate. I then stuck my head out the window and observed the same bright lights that wre in the front and side of the craftin what now appeared to be the rear of the craft. We were now going approximatly 60 mph and as soon as I brought my head into the car to get a better view from the rear window it had completely disappeared from the sky. We scoured the sky for maybe two more minutes to find any sign of the craft, which had appeared to have disappeared. It was still very light out at that time of day and the craft appeared to be black or grey in color. There was a group of about five cars driving in the group with us and all of the people in the other cars had appeared to acknowledge the craft and ha! d baffel ed looks on their faces. Myself and the driver of the vehicle could not think of any type of craft that we knew of that this may have been.

We had a two hour wait, and we waited outside.  We were sitting on the bench looking out to the north and I noticed a very, faint amber colored triangular shaped object moving to the southeast.  The UFO phenomena has always interested me and I am always looking in the sky, but most of the time I am able to rule out a classic UFO.  99.9% of the time I can identify it, but this time, it was strange.  As it got closer, to overhead, but not completely I noticed that within its triangular structure it appeared to have many spheres or ""orbs"" interchanging within it.  The entire craft remained the faint amber color, although the spheres appeared to be more translucent.  My curiousity in the object, attracted a crowd who also were waiting to go inside and they all saw the same thing, including my wife and friend.  One lady even let out a startled yell.  A few gasps were also heard.  Out of the group of us who witnessed the event one lady said that they were just ballons, but the size of the object at that altitude would have meant the balloon cluster would be huge, and it retained a definitive shape, at least the outline did, the rest of the craft did appear to morph somewhat.  We watched it as it went off in the distant night sky toward the southeast, towards Fayetteville, NC.  I'm not sure of the altitude, I approximate it at probably 1000 feet or so.  The first sight of it looked like a jetliner with its lights on coming into land, but shrouded by heavy cloudcover(thats what the shape appeared as intially) It was a clear cold night, only high level cirrus clouds were barely visible.  It was not a helicopter, jet, or hot air balloon or geese.  This was clearly unidentified, in my opinion.  I have also reported this sighting to MUFON.",2002-01-11T00:00:00,36.0769630261661,-79.81581387940841

I was walking my dog.  I left the house between 7:30 and 7:40pm.  I live within a few miles of Newark International Airport so at any given time there are usually at least 5 or 6 aircraft in the sky.  Astronomy is a hobby of mine so I also know what the planet Venus looks like.  I was walking north, one block west of the entrance to the Garden State Parkway south at Hoover Ave. when I saw a light coming out of the southeast at a very great speed.  The light seemed to be flying at a steep angle.  At first I thought it was going to crash, but as it came closer, I realized that its flight was not on an angle, the craft itself was tilted, at least 45 degrees, but probably closer to 60.  And it was saucer-shaped.  Also, it did not have the lights on it that I usually see on aircraft coming or leaving the airport: it seemed as if the whole craft was one big light.  It was heading  north by northeast and had 2 near collisions with planes coming in for a landing.  It was also extremely loud, much louder than then the planes that normally fly by (and they are QUITE loud!).  In fact, it was the noise which first drew my attention.  )It sure as hell sounded like a plane that was going to crash).  The 2 planes it almost collided with were both coming from the direction of northern New York City, a typical flight pattern for around here.  If they had been cars, I would have said that this craft cut them off.  It was flying quite low, lower than normal for flying parallel to the ground.  As I watched, it seemed to head due north, following the Hudson River.  I felt sure I'd hear about it on the news the next day, since it was a VERY near miss with the other 2 planes.  But there was no mention of the incident.  However, I did tell a friend online that night about my sighting, lest you think I am making this up. I've known all along that what I saw was a UFO, but I run a fledgling website covering alternative and paranormal news. I felt that it is too early to have my credibility damaged.  The only reason I am reporting it now is because I read the report from Cresskill and I want the witness to know that they weren't just seeing things.

I happened to glance upward:  at the top center of the windshield, just above the steering wheel, in the western sky, fell a star-like object, in a zig-zag, almost floating fashion, slightly  toward the north.  It was slightly dimmer than what Venus has been recently;  at first I thought it was a meteor - but it seemed more ""lightweight"", as an ash or cinder would have fallen.  It was silvery-whitish-blue in color, and didn't change in color, a bit sparkly, but more like a planet than a star.  If it were to break into the atmosphere and ""land"", it would have fallen a few miles beyond west Seattle, into Puget Sound - not as far in distance  as the Pacific Ocean.  If this thing had behaved like a normal meteor, I would never have phoned the UFO Center...I even looked up information, hoping a meteor shower was in progress...but I understand the Taurid meteor showers are not expected until close to 11/09/00.  If an investigator were to call, all I could do in addition to this report would be to trace the object's pattern from the top of the windshield to its descending northern position as it went beyond the shrubery at the top of the driveway.

Because of this, I thought him barking was due to something he heard downstairs. I didn't think anything of it. Seeing as I was awake, I sat up and he jumped off the bed and headed to the door of the bedroom, which means he wants to go outside. I had left the light on out back. I opened the door leading to the deck and watched him while I waited for him to finish. He had just been neutered the day before so I was watching him very closely to make sure he wasn't trying to remove his stitches. He walked down the deck and looked in a South Eastern direction. I kept watching him for about 20 seconds when I looked up and saw an incredibly bright light. The street lights on our main road are orange in colour and this thing was bright bright white. Because my husband and I had gone to his mother's for her birthday on the weekend, our camcorder just happened to be close by, so I grabbed the camera and video taped the light. When I was zooming in, I noticed that there were smaller lights next to the huge ball of white lights, but didn't see it until I watch the footage after. I tried squinting to see the huge object better because I didn't have my glasses on and I had just woken up. I noticed that it was round and had 4 large lights on top and 4 large lights on the bottom. The smaller lights next to the big one had two blinking red and blue lights, one white light underneath, and two other white light under the single light. There was also one small white light to the side of this last cluster. I don't know if these clusters were stars (too bright for stars in my opinion, plus they disappeared) or a reflection.

I shut the camera off, put it down on my counter and turned to shut the patio door, when I noticed the light was gone. I picked up the camera again and filmed where it was.

We always exit Interstate 10 at the Pinal Air park exit and then turn south on Trico road. That morning there were a lot of military vehicles and personnel parked on Trico road right next to the air park. It looked like a military reserve thing. After church and lunch at the Grandparents my wife and I started back to Mesa around 3:00 PM. The military vehicles were gone by now. We were going North on Trico at about the Trico Marana road intersection when I noticed this aircraft making a banking turn and then descend below the tree line just like any normal airplane would to make a landing. BUT this was not like any aircraft I have ever seen. As soon as I saw it I immediately thought of the famous Phoenix lights incident, from the images shown on TV. I hollered to my wife look at that, but she didn't see it until it was a profile and didn't get a good look. The profile was strange too, it didn't seem to jive with what it looked like from the top. I have attached a JPEG I created of the the shape I saw when the aircraft was in its banking turn. The aircraft was solid black with no lights or windows that I could make out, but we were still pretty far away.

Heard a rumbling noise that made me curious but had lots of computer work to do so I didn't go outside to investigate. I work at my computer with ear phones listening to music.  Vaguely aware that the rumbling noise was louder and vibrating the house.   My wife was helping our youngest son with his homework.  They were on the 2nd floor.  My wife called me on the phone and said I should come up and figure out what was making noise.   By the time I came up stairs the noise suddenly stopped.  My 15 yr old daughter came out of her bedroom where she had just turned out the lights to go to bed.  The noise was so loud that she thought she would look our her window.  She said Holy S**t I think I just saw a meteor.  She described a light as big as a basket ball twice the heighth of trees flash accross the sky.   As soon as she saw the light the noice stopped abruptly.  My wife's ears were hurting because of the loud noise.  She had the sensation that it was passing slowly over our house from a SW to NE direction. The next day I talked to several neighbors who all reported hearing the loud sound.  One of our neighbors looked out the door and didn't see anything but said the sound was deafening and frightened her shaking the whole house.   Another neighbor said she went all the way out to her drive way and looked up in the sky (clear night) and saw no lights but couldn't figure out what was making such a loud noise (like a squadron of jumbo jets.)   Two weeks later I talked to a friend about the noise and him and his wife said they heard something just like I described on that same night.  My friend lives about 5 miles SW of where I live. I called the airport.  They said they were testing engines at about that time. But I hear them testing engines all the time.  Seldom more than 2 or 3 minutes at a time.

The entire object was not this color just the edges all the way around. We live near the lake in Elizabethtown Ky. This lake had a problem and they drained most of the water out of it. The Dam is repaired now but the water level is not up to normal level yet. This Bright Light appeared to be over the lake near the dam.  It stayed at that location for a long time with out moving.

She said she could hear the Helicopter but never heard any sound from the other object. We are located on the flight path for The Helicopters from the Louisville hospitals to Hardin Memorial Hospital our local hospital. She said aer a while the bright light started moving easterly which brought it closer to me. It was moving very slow over the tree tops and when it was located over the First Presbyterian Church, which is about a half block away I could see it very good. (It could have been farther away then half a block but she could not tell.) It was not a Helicopter and it was not an Airplane.

This second submission is intended as an update after a time of reflection. I originally described this object as some sort of fire ball moving across the western sky into the south in a continuous arching fashion.  I previously mentioned that I had fortunately grabbed my digital video camera and tapped this strange event .  I have viewed the tape over and over in slow motion frame by frame.  This object resembles a golden sphere that sometimes can be seen quite clearly. Unfortunately a was excited as hell and could not hold the camera perfectly still.  Upon using the telephoto lens and also zooming out for scale,the object  is definately something that is unexplainable by myself, or the 12 other people that have viewed the tape so far. Highly educated and professional standing people that I presented it to have no clue what it is, however, together they all agree that it is definately eerie. I'm not into UFO's, nor do I really want to push this issue with anyone because I dont really want to get hung up on reserching the hell out of it, but it was so strange that I decided to call Transport Canada, Enviorment Canada and believe it or not, I was connected on Sunday morning to Pearson International Airport's control tower shift manager because I actually thought I had a video of a plane in an emergency and wondered if they would need it.  I spoke to the shift manager and he had said that there were no reports of trouble in the air earlier that morning. I described to him what I had on tape and he came up with expanations such as a meteor or a plane burning surplus fuel.  I see alot of aircraft in this area and they make noise, even high up in the statosphere.  This did not make a sound. I even went sofar as to record aircraft and a star from the same window last night to see how they would compare to my original fireball/sphere recording. NOT EVEN CLOSE! After seeing this thing I went to the internet for explanations.  I have never been to your site nor any other UFO sites before.  I managed to read some similar sounding occurances and have concluded in my own mind that what I saw was definately strange. I will leave it up to who ever views the tape to conclude what it is for themselves.  I can't wait to hear the next ""explanation""",2001-02-18T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

I happened to notice one such helicopter ahead of me as I drove in a south-eastern direction. I paid special attention because I noticed that the ""spot light"" was on. This was of particular concern to me due to the fact that a lit spot light on the freeway could mean that there is a police chase in the nearby vicinity and caution my be exercised. I kept my eye on the craft as I drove and I began to notice that the spot wasn't acutally on at all. In fact, I noticed that the helicopter seemed to be hovering through the air very slowly and smoothly. I then noticed that what I had mistaken for a spotlight was simply one very large white light. Further, I noticed that the craft had NO BLADES. The altitude of the craft was approximately twice that of what a normal helicopter would be navigating at, yet the craft, itself, was large enough to where my perspective of it's altitude was skewed due to it's size. Alarmed, I began driving directly underneath the craft and looked up to see that it APPEARED to be triangular in shape and had a series of ODDLY-COLORED lights flashing on it's underside. I am a skeptic now as I was prior to last night's events. Nonetheless, I'm entirely certain there were/are others who saw what I did. The freeway was fairly busy, although not bumper-to-bumper.

The sky is perfectly bright and blue with no clouds at all.  At first I thought nothing of it and then thought that this is kinda weird.  They looked like stars but it's too late in the day and they were too bright and too big to be stars.  I went to another room to grab my binoculars and went outside.  When I got outside I was unable to find the objects.  I returned to my office and looked out the window again and there they were.  I thought maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me.  The whole thing was driving me crazy.  I was sure they were really there.  Sure enough I found them in the binoculars and watched them.  One was positioned at 12 o'clock and the other below it and to the left at 8 o'clock.  As I watched, the lower one moved to the right.  Both of them appeared to be followed by a light cloud of smoke, not a stream.  As the lower one approached the 6 o'clock position both of them just disappeared as if they ducked behind a cloud, yet there are no clouds. As I write this description of the event, one hour later, a third or one of the original two has appeared in the same place.  This time I took a picture but it surely won't show much as the object is too small and the camera too weak.  As I watched, it has drifted out of sight away from me and upward.

Location:  San Antonio , TX   United States County or area:  Bexar Date:  31October , 2001 Time (local time):  7:16 to 7:30PM Precise location: IH 410 West @ IH 35 N Military Base nearby?:  Yes Airport nearby?:  Yes Description:  7:12 p.m., October 31, 2001 San Antonio, Texas, USA Watching the sunset because of the very unusual cobalt blue and very red/pink layers with a thick, white and darkened cloud bank in the mid region, solid across the horizon. This cloud bank was massive. A Sony Hi-8mm 72x zoom camcorder was being used to capture the moment when the camera caught a ping from the infrared right in the mid section of the cloud bank. Clouds typically make the camera fuzz out because nothing is there to rebound the focus. The focus was almost immediate. It became evident, real fast, that something was either hiding or being masked in the clouds. It may even have been generating the cloud cover. We guess the initial distance to be about 10km+ from our location. The film captured something of encredible size, perhaps 1500'+ in length and no guess on the height. It appeared to have stuff hanging all over it. The IR was scanned above and below this region and found only the fuzz indication of emptyness, nothing to ping back. I know it sounds crazy, but everyone that sees the clip walks away with their eyes wide open and their mouths dropped open and with a stare. Their are appearances of reptilian shapes and symbols on this leathery textured object. It's very strange, but it was there.  Viewers in awe after watching the video. Distance from viewer:  10km - 20km Number of objects:  1 Motion of objects:  Extremely still for about 2 minutes, then gone from view and believed to be recaptured  about 12 minutes later on film at a much further distance up to about 20km further out away from camerman. Watched the shape at a distance move two different directions and then upward back into the cloud bank and disappear. Direction of movement:  West-NW, eventually moved more NW direction until out of view. About 45 minutes later a helicopter came and spot-lighted the vacinity for almost 45 minutes, spotting into the clouds and all around.  Yes, spotting the clouds.  About ten minutes later a fighter flew over, up like a rocket and loop to loop out to the same direction of that being filmed.  Shortly after that, another fighter repeated the path. Duration of sighting:  From about 7:11pm - 7:34 pm  Sound:  Very quiet. As a matter of fact, the birds were not as active.  Several neighbors did complain of headaches, some associated with a high to low pitch frequencies, twice in the preceding week.  Also, brief headaches were noted during the same period, but without the freq noise. Everyone thinks the INS building a few hundred yards away was probably tweaking some security gizmo.

I had an errand to run, and comming back home from the store there was a traffic accident on the intersection of Rosemead Blvd. and Longden Avenue. A police officer was involved, so all traffic going north was to detour on resdental streets.  I was heading North, and saw a flying saucer right in front of me,above the San Bernadino Mountains. I could not belive my eyes! I was alone in my car, expressing my disbelief in what I was looking at! It was very large, and there were lights all around the saucer. I pulled over to the curb to view it, but the street was lined with traffic, and I was causing even more traffic to build up.  That night we had a full moon, and the saucer was even bigger than what the moon appeared to be. It was hard to keep a full view of the craft since the street was tree lined.  As I was tring to keep the craft in view, I thought maybe it was a blimp.  It took me around two minutes, if that, to get back onto Rosemead Blvd.,  heading north bound. I was able to see it without anything blocking my view.  It's location seemed to me to be over the Glendale Mountain area, about 20 miles west of my area of Arcadia.  I know that if it were a blimp, it would have still been hovering over my area.  This has caused me concern as to why I had not heard of anyone else seeing it.

I am a supervisor at a local veterans hospital.  I was hunting in the Cheatham County Wildlife Mgt. Agency. I was walking up a footpath/road about 30' wide. I looked up to my right and saw a huge triangular shaped craft passing parallel to my position. I had a pair of 8x30 binoculars and started viewing it with them.  It was flying west and the sun was reflecting on the huge nose area and the leading edge of the wings and the area was smooth and rounded and was sand colored.  The underneath was shaded and grayish colored.  I seen no lights or windows.  It made a very faint jet sound.  It was leaving a very thick contrail.  I lost sight of it as it flew into the sun and the trees got in the way.  I then faced east and could see another one coming on the same flight path but closer to me.  Again I used my binoculars.  As it passed overhead and past me, I go a good look at the rear of the ship.  There was no tail and the rear of the ship looked very complicated.  I could see two rows of engines or exhausts where the very thick contrails was coming from.  There appeared to some kind of housing area around the exhaust areas and I saw a large strobing light on each side of the housing area.  There also appeared to be some type of louvered areas.  The top side of the back of the ship overhung the exhaust area and the bottom of the ship.  It is hard to estimate the altitude as this aircraft was HUGE!! It pretty much filled up my binoculars at times. Addendum:  I saw two huge triangular aircraft leaving contrails. this is a report of additional information on an earlier report made 11-20-00. I went back to the location and got a gps location of 36 degrees 09.41 west by 087 degrees 04.43 west at an elevation of approx. 760 feet.  I estimate the craft were flying at approx. 5000 ft with a wing span of approx. 1000 feet.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,36.2833,-87.0121

He was looking at a bright light, or close collection of lights, which was stationary in the sky outside, at a guess about 2-300 feet up. No exact shape was discernable, only bright lights cycling through red, green, yellow & possibly blue or white. I clearly recall looking to my side at some point and seeing our grandparents and my brother lit by the coloured lights.

PD)) Large craft , triangle shaped,very bright white lights/prism , forward/backward/90deg turns/hoovered ,at night over a city This forum is a good thing, at last I can tell my story and see if any one else has a theory on what I saw; I would like to tell of the two U.F.O. sighting that I had several years ago in the southern California area. As any one who has ever seen a U.F.O. can relate, I had kind of an empty feeling after my sightings. I could not tell you for sure what I had seen, only that it was truly an object that was flying and unidentifiable. The experience has never been explained to my saisfaction. The first time I saw something was in about 1979-80 the time was (pretty late I'd say 10pm) in Huntington Beach Calif. A group of friends and I had just come out of my parents second floor apartment, my buddy Brad saw it first; he had looked up to see the incessantly bothersome Police Helicopter that circles Orange County. This helicopter has a spotlight that it shines on criminals and the like, any way it tends to get a person's attention. We saw Brad looking up so we looked up, behind the copter, much higher in the sky was a grouping of bright white lights they were so white bright they were emitting a prism effect. They were in a triangular grouping not a formation, it seemed like one craft.  There were very high clouds that night and the light for this craft was reflecting off the clouds. We all were looking up at this thing as it stood still in the sky! Then we called my folks out of the house and even the neighbor came out see what was going on. So it was not just me, there was 7 people that witnessed this craft. Now the weird part; this thing started moving across the sky very slow, then it would stop. We realized the police officers in the copter might also have been seeing this. They were trying to get the spot light to shine up, I do not think the spot light was meant to go up. However, they were trying to do it. This thing started moving again then made ninety degree turns! It even went backwards once. We got a good look for almost 10 minutes. The lights were intense, it was nothing natural, and it was not a jet. The light sparkled all colors, a very beautiful site. Then it started moving one direction a little quicker, and then it accelerated across the sky so fast it vanished, this really happened! Right over the city yet, not out in the desert like you think. We talked about it over the years, we were no dummies it was not a plane or a Vandenberg launch (seen many of those) this was a craft, truly a Unidenfied Flying Object. I saw a second one years latter, but I got to go the wife is calling, Now that I know this site is here I will tell of that experience another time. Any Ideas, or theories I really can't swallow the space craft thing. But?!?",2001-04-01T00:00:00,33.68843322932917,-118.00499422776912

PD)) Strange beam and apparition terrifies child I didn't think anything of it until years later. I was twelve or thirteen (26 now) and my sister was eight or nine (22 now). My mother and her live-in boyfriend both worked third shift so they would leave the apartment at about 23:30 or so. They would leave the door locked, the living room light on and the TV going so people wouldn't try to bother us. I was awoken at probably around 00:00 or so for some reason. I didn't know why but it felt that I shouldn't be asleep. I kept having the feeling that something was outside or nearby that shouldn't be. I still fell asleep though. My sister came into my room at probably 01:00 or maybe later, but it was still nighttime and my mother still wasn't home. She said she was scared because she'd seen grammy (our grandmother had died not very long before) and she said grammy had had big eyes and vampire teeth (just bear with me). I mumbled that she could sleep with me. Then, not too long after she woke me up again and she was crying now. She had supposedly seen a blue beam of light CREEP in through the window, touch the wall next to my bed, mere inches from us, then slowly ascend the wall. When it hit the thermostat it darted out of the room and she claimed to smell burning paper or wood. Despite wanting to know what happened and being scared, I fell back asleep. In the morning she told me grammy had come into my room and asked my sister to go with her. My sister asked: ""To heaven grammy?"" to which the apparition chuckled somewhat darkly and said: ""Not exactly."" My sister couldn't remember anything after that until waking up. As I got older I began to become interested in many things, UFOs and the paranormal among the subjects and as I learned how many different ways aliens and supernatural forces come into contact with us, I couldn't help but wonder if this wasn't some kind of alien contact. I have heard that many abductees recall seeing familiar images instead of Greys or aliens, but with big eyes i.e. owls and monkeys with big eyes. I just kind of figured I would submit the report despite it taking place years ago.",2001-04-01T00:00:00,42.8731,-71.3904

If you can, imagine this; part of the sky opens, a metallic cigar shaped object darts out, stops, then exits at a tremendous speed through a opening in the sky across from it, disappearing. Thats the best way to explain it. It happened so fast that if my crewman and I hadn't been looking we would have missed it completly. We had just completed work on a light on the snake river and were traveling by boat to the boat ramp behind one of the dams (I can't remember which one) it was just the two of us on the river and we were trying to reach the ramp before it got to dark. We both looked up to our 10 o'clock posn at about posn angle 30 degrees and this object appeared. I can't say with any certainty the distance or how big the object was, but it was close enough to see that it was dark gray and elongated (like a fat short cigar). We just looked at each other and said, ""What the heck was that?"". The trip back to Kennewick we tossed around ideas as to what it might be but ultimately failed to come up with anything. It was like the thing opened a hole in the sky, entered our ""realm"", paused, then left through another opening. There were no lights, no sound, no trailing vapor, no other aircraft, nothing. In fact if I hadn't been looking right at it I would have dismissed it altogether. Sky conditions were clear, visibility was 10nm, seas were calm. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Describe the lights: Could only see the lights. This was seen at night around the time of 1:30 - 2:15 a.m.   There were many round lights and they were all green. Not blinding and could make out the pattern of the lights as well as the shapes of the lights very well. Object seemed to be round by the way the lights were set up. Green lights were round in shape and the center rows seemed to go around the object. Also remember there was more or just one more light near the top of the center row and one at the bottom of the center row of lights. A very close sighting and lights were seen clearly. Object was just below tops of trees and behind one set of tree line. I was driving home on a road at night where there are at times very little to no traffic. A road where there are woods on both sides and not many homes built. I think these woods that go along this long stretch of road (I think which is 538 or 539) are reserved by the McGuire Air Force Base, since they occasionaly have trucks travel to and from these dirt roads that come off of this particular road. It was around the time of 1:30 to 2:15 a.m., was so long ago, do not remember the exact time. As I came around one bend I noticed a green light to the left side of the road in the woods near the tops of the trees that were closest to the road, up ahead of me. I started thinking to myself as I was driving closer ""who would be playing with something this late at night like that"" or ""when did this light source get built and put up here""... When I got closer, I slowed down to a crawl, while looking upwards towards the top of the tree line, I eventually stopped the car and rolled down the window. I stared at it in puzzlement. I could see the tree branches silhouetted in front of the many green lights of the round object. This is where the most shock kicked in. After I had stopped and was looking at it.... I just started to realize that something was'nt right and started to realize that this object was actually getting lower and was 'very' slowly moving downwards behind the set of trees. I was directly across from the object that was lowering from behind the set of trees. There was 'no' sound that could be heard from the object, and I was pretty close to the object. Panic set in and I said a few words out loud, which I won't write here. And I slammed my foot onto the gas pedal to leave as quick as possible, I could not drive well, my arms and whole body was shaking. As I was making my way down the road away from where the object was, I looked in my drivers side door mirror, and I saw car headlights coming from around the bend, just before where I was stopped at, and also saw that the object with green lights was no longer there. I did not see the lights any where. Sorry this is so long. And I kept this and another event to myself because I did not know there were so many others seeing u.f.o's until years later when I started to read up about so many other events that others had witnessed. Never knew of it much until I got a computer and was able to read up on information. I would also like to add that I am in excellent mental health, high IQ, never had done drugs, nor alcohol, nor have ever had hallucinations, and I was not tired that night. This is being told in absolute truth. And would be nice to know if any others had spotted this green lit up object in that area as well. 2 years later on another night, the same 'exact' object with green lights appeared again I think in June. In the same area but not in the exact spot, maybe 1 mile further from the first time. This time I was going to head on over to a friends house, I took the same road, but for some reason while driving there I decided that maybe I'd go visit my friend another time, and decided to turn off onto another back road to turn around.  Well this weird feeling came over me, I don't know why, (I'm in amazement as I write this still now.) As I was slowing down on this other road which has no street lights on it, I looked into my passengers side door mirror, I almost had me heart failure, I caught a glimps of green lights this time much higher in the night sky and the moon was almost fool this night. The object was again stationary in one spot maybe 2 tree lengths up above the tree line. This object and the moon were not that far apart, I remember seeing the moon to the right as I was looking above the trees and the green lit up object farther to the left. Once again, I was the only one on these two roads at the time. This time I was thinking ""Oh my God, Oh my God, I don't believe this"" and ""It's back again"", with some curse words, and of course panic set in again, and I quickly pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to make a quick u-turn to go back to the road I had come off of. Which means I was turning around to head some what towards the object, because it was the only way I knew of to get back home. Again, I had slammed on the gas after I made the sharp u-turn and was driving quickly. After I made the u-turn in panic, I got myself to look up (to the left side now, above the trees), and saw no green object, only saw the moon. A second after looking again and not seeing the object I saw car headlights up ahead coming from the road I was heading back to get onto.  I made it back home, and said to myself, why when I'm on that road and that thing has to show up are there no other cars around, but when ! another car was coming around the object would disappear or it's lights would go out... I did'nt take that road again for a long time, I changed my route. These days, I am now a professional photographer, but I wish I was then and wish I had a camera on me. I am a 29 Yr. old female.

I was about ten miles out of Lafayette In. traveling twords my exit. I noticed an object in the sky at this point to my left. The highway is very dark, it was nine at night, and there are NO street lights lining the road. I first noticed the red ""globe"" of light in the middle of the object as I approached it. The object was floating VERY close to the road and quite low. It was on the other side, (North bound lanes) of traffic so I had to look across to see it. At this point I am still approaching it and think it is a red light on a tower of somesort, then I start to become horizontally in line with it as I pass, I look ,and as soon as I saw the 5 or so red flashing lights on the bottom of the craft that were flashing on and off slowly I knew what I thought I was seeing. I had a very good view of the object At this point, and so did others in the northbound lanes because I remember every car that approached the scene started braking. The object itself was about 2 to 3 hundred feet in the air and I just stared in awe. What I saw was a craft that was very dome like in appearence, the thing that was most odd was how this dome that made up 80% of the object was transparant this is how I could see the red light that never flashed in the middle. The red lights around the bottom were the same size as the one in the middle, and they appered to be attached to the saucer bottom part of the craft that the dome sat on. These lights flashed in unison at intervals of about 2 seconds. It was just like I saw on tv, it was like a movie was being played in front of me in the sky, I couldn't believe how fictonally sterotipical this UFO looked. I passed the object, kept staring and followed it until I was out of sight of it. I never saw the object zoom off, it really just hovered slightly as I was passing it anyway, no supersonic blastaways. I rac! ed to ca tch up to my girlfreind who was in my truck who was about 1/2 a mile in front of me, all she had noticed was the people braking, not the object though.

Something in our troubled NY skies?,Garden City Park,NY,2001-09-16T15:30:00,unknown,39 min,"Occurred : 9/16/2001 15:30  (Entered as : 09/16/01 15:30) Reported: 9/16/2001 19:02 Posted: 10/12/2001 Location: Garden City Park, NY Shape: Unknown Duration:39 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/019/S19567.html,"Something in our troubled NY skies? After a long and very tragic week here in the NYC area, I feel compeled to watch our skys more vigilent. With commercial air traffic stopped for 3 days, the skys were sadly quite. I do not wish to add to the current state of confussion, but feel I must note any strangness in the skys around NYC. On this day Sunday Sept 16 2001 at 3:30 pm in sunny warm cloudless skies I saw what I thought could be a Mylar balloon or satelite at high alttitude. The size of the object when first sighted was 1/2 to 1/4 the size of a marbel held at arms lenght. The strange aspect of this object was it appeared rock steady showing no movement. It also showed no dissernable shape, and seemed highly reflective of the bright sunlite. Because size was hard to determine, I would guestimate an altitude of 20,000 feet( a full size commercial jet appeared in the sky but not near the object) the jet appeared as large as a marbel at arms lenght but at only 1/2 the objects altitude. At the time of the sighting I was sitting on the stairs of the Garden City Long Island railroad station, facing due east. The LIRR runs east to west for easy referance. As I had 2 young children in my care at the time, and because of close proximity to the train tracks, I could not study the object to closely. I decided to walk the children 3 blocks to there home. In the 15 to 20 min walk home the object did not move at all. Once home I ran into the house for a pair of Busnell 10 x 50 binoculars. The object appeared to be over central Nassau county in the area of Mithcel Feild/ Uniondale.( a side note this object would have had a clear line of sight view of the World Trade Center 22 miles away) If I were to point at the object my arm would be at about 60 degrees. SMy freind also looked at the object through the binoculars, we both feel this object did not look--- and more immportanly act like a balloon. I ran into the house and went online for an AOL weather report for our zip code, here is the live weather for the sighting. Clear sunny skies temp 70 degrees--winds south at 8 mph---humidity 49%--barometer 30.07 . I next ran to the local grocery store and brought 3 crome look mylar balloons. Since the object was to my east one would excpect when I released the mylar balloon it would follow on that path ( if the object was also a balloon too). The balloons when released acted like what I  would excpect a balloon to act like, and followed the winds to the south, 45% away from the object I first viewed 39 min earlier. I should also note the balloons had nowhere near the same reflectivity as they twisted and turned on thier accent, with an occassional flash of sunlite, simular to a cameras flashbulb. Also the balloons I released stayed low in the horizion, and went no higher than 25%, but that could be attributed to the amount of helium in the balloon. It was futher determined, that infact the object did raise up in altitude, or reduced in size slowly through out the sighting untill it was no longer visible. I feel confident this was no balloon or satelite and will be even more vigilant of our great cities skies.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,,

Now that I've qualified myself so you all don't think I'm a nut.;) On the evening of Sunday, 9/16 at about 6pm I was on my back patio picking up messages from my cell phone.  As I was listening to messages I heard planes going overhead, the planes caught my attention considering the WTC bombing occurred earlier in the week and I was surprised to hear the planes in the air.  As I was watching a plane go over I noticed an object far beyond/above the plane that caught my eye.  The object was a little South East of me.  I live about 10 miles from NYC and I would guess the object was in that area.  I watched the object for about 5 minutes, it didn't move. I then pointed it out to my 60 yr old neighbor; he went inside to get a pair of binoculars.  I focused on the object for a few short minutes:  it was a soft tri-angle shape, almost a teardrop shape, and it was metallic in color.  As I was watching the object it disappeared.  I asked my neighbor if he saw that and he said it shot/flashed to the north...it was a streak/zip that left a short blurred trail behind it .  We discussed what we saw and thought it was maybe a weather balloon, but thinking more on it we didn't think it could be because it remained in one place for at least 10-15 minutes, and then it shot quickly in the opposite direction that the wind blew.  Further, the shape wasn't right either.  It looked like the shape of an upside-down balloon, but a little sharper on the edges.

It was not a terrestrial aircraft, at least not one I have ever seen or could imagine.  I was going home, eastbound on K10 approx. 6:35pm, and right around DeSoto I noticed lots of aircraft due east, and then more lights to the north.  Only these lights were moving in unison, i.e. they were not separate aircraft.  It was triangular in shape, with a light at each apex--these three lights flashed/blinked red and white at the exact same time.  And in the middle of this ""thing"" was a row or bank of five lights, which pulsated from right to left, or south to north.  They went from orange, yellowish, red, and then white, all down the row.  So I was watching this from a hill, and then I went down the hill, and back up, and it was gone.   So I got off K10 at the exit east of Evening Star Road, and watched for a bit.  Then I saw it again, only this time it was west of where I originally saw it, like it went backwards.  It flickered, and then disappeared again.   I got back on K10 again and saw it again, only it was way, way east, almost NE of my location (as opposed to due N of me) and it kinda faded into the city lights.  I also noticed during this whole time many aircraft in and around the area and even more to the east--I mean a LOT, more than one would expect to see, even around an airport. I'm sure many others saw this, the damn thing was HUGE.  I can't be sure because it was in the sky, but I estimate it at around 800m long, maybe 500m wide at the base.  I'm not sure of its altitude, but it was fairly low, maybe around 1000m or less.  In all, it was about a 6-8 min ordeal.

At the time the three objects were visible, the two objects which were close together moved in sort of a semi-circle pattern and exchanged general locations.

((QUERY TO ANOTHER WITNESS TO SAME EVENT)) Dear Ms. ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for the excellent report!  In fact, we received one other report from Fairbanks.  From your description, I wonder whether the event might have been caused by a rocket launch of some kind.  Are you able to make a telephone call, or two, to establish whether that might have been the cause?  I suspect a call to the FAA would resolve the issue fairly quickly, since any facility launching a missile would have to apprise the FAA of the event.  If you find out what the cause was, I would be most grateful if you could drop us a note.  We will add it to your report.  ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM OTHER WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I did phone the FAA (ATC at FAI) this evening and was told that the research facility out at Poker Flats (an atmospheric research center about 30 miles north of my home) was potentially active at that time (the NOTAM filed by Poker Flats is open-ended) though none of the same staff was on tonight so we we're unable to verify.  Poker Flats does apparently occasionally launch small rockets into the atmosphere for research.  The FAA employee also stated that the research does ""effect the Northern Lights"" which may have something to do with the good lights show last night (actually now I'm more interested by that...  ;)    The specs would certainly seem to line up with where and what I saw.

As we passed to the southeast of the lights, I was looking almost straight up at them and saw they were three white lights in a triangular formation, equalateral, with a red flashing light in the middle. I had not seen the red light until I was looking up at the object from underneath. The lights began moving slowly southeast along Route 76 towards Columbia. The red center light was blinking once every second or two, but as the object moved away it seemed to not be blinking constantly. It would appear to stop for a few seconds and then start. The object was eventually went below the horizon towards the east-southeast and could not be seen anymore. There had been heavy helicopter activity in the area since nightfall. A train was in the area as well at the time, so it was impossible to hear if it may have been a helicopter. It appeared to be, at most, a couple thousand feet up. The pattern of lights seemed too big for a helicopter, unless it had sponsons or wings with running lights.

I have no idea what it was, and don't even know if it was a ""real UFO,"" though it is certainly unidentified to me. Doesn't make sense to me that a UFO would have blinking light in the center.

If other people near Nashville have reported a similar thing, then my report would further support theirs. ((ADDENDUM)) Dear ((deleted)), Thank you very much for the excellent report! I have no idea what the object you witnessed could have been.  Given your academic background, I would presume that you had ruled out all obvious possibilities, e.g. aircraft, blimps, advertising lights, celestial bodies, aurora borrealis, etc.. Did you stop your vehicle at any time to look at the object, or were you driving during the sighting, please?  Also, were you looking through the windshield or window, or did you roll down a window to look at it? We will post your report to our website, probably tomorrow, and perhaps others will respond from Nashville, if they saw it, or if they know what it was. Thank you very much for taking the time to share the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) i Peter, Certainly wasn't any plane, cause it wasn't moving like a plane...was hovering, then went kind of back and forth, whereas planes fly forward. At first, I thought it was a helicopter, but I that wouldn't explain the three glowing lights at the edges. And I know it was not any celestial body or aurora borealis.  I did not stop the vehicle and look...I was looking through the windshield, but the windshield was not obscuring or altering my view. I was not looking through a crack or dirty area. Moreover, as I passed, I got the same view of the object through my driver's side window as through the windshield. I tried to turn around, but I was on the interstate and couldn't turn around for like five or ten miles.  Feel free to post my sighting. The University of Tennesee has a Space Institute somewhere near there, so who knows, maybe it was an experimental aircraft. There were other people driving on the interstate that evening, I was hoping there had been other reports, and that someone would have more visual detail on the thing than I did. Collectively, we might have had an interesting report. Really wish I'd been carrying a camera with telephoto lens that night. ((name deleted))",2002-04-08T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

It was somewhere between 12:00 noon and 2:00pm and the time I noticed some very interesting chemtrails.  They were in almost a sun-like pattern with a main chemtrail and others radiating out from it.  I thought I would take some pictures for my son as he is into the chemtrail phenomena.  As I was driving I asked my boyfriend if I could use his digital camera.  I started taking pictures but found it difficult to drive and do that at the same time so I handed the digital camera back to my boyfriend so he could also take some pictures.  Now, around the same time....either before or after I was also followed by a local police car.  I was never pulled over or given a ticket as I was going approximately 5-10 miles over the posted speed limit.  Other cars were going as fast or faster but the police seemed focused on me for some reason.  My boyfriend and I did NOT see any objects in the chemtrails as we were taking the pictures but later as I was sending them to my son it was my son that noticed an object in the chemtrails.  He enhanced it and sent it to me.  Sure enough, there is an oval shaped object that cannot be explained.  It looks to be lighter in color on top and darker on the bottom.  As the picture is enhanced further professionally to rule out certain normal explanations I can only compare it to other pictures of the same calibar.

I was driving home from work at about 2:30 in the morning. Out of my window I saw a high flying object that was a blinking red light. Out of my window the object appeared to be moving in an eratic pattern, no set course. I thought that this was probably an illusion because of the motion of my vehicle. I continued to watch the object however. On getting closer to my house, I saw another one of these objects. This one was closer. I could make out 3 blinking lights, that seemed to blink in a pattern. This object did not appear to fly eratically, but the blinking of the lights appeared almost in a revolving motion. In addition, flying lower than this object, looked to be a slow moving passenger plane. It had the front white headlights of an airplane. All of a sudden, the white headlights turned off and the object was blinking red lights. I finally got to my house and it was 3 o'clock in the morning. I was extremely hopeful I could get a good look at one of these objects on the ground. Then off in the distance I saw a slow moving object with two white headlights coming toward me. Again, it appeared to be a plane, moving at a set flight path. The object dropped altitude and continued to come closer. Once it got closer, the object appeared to turn, but it did not turn at an angle like a plane. It appeared to make a horizontal right turn. At the instant it made the turn, the white lights shut off and red blinking lights came on. I made out 4 red blinking lights. The object flew low and parallel to my house. As it flew by it made sort of a quiet droning noise. Hard to describe the noise because I've never heard a plane make that monotonous sound before. I could not make out the outline or shape of the aircraft. I would estimate its size to be about that of a small jetliner (737), but again, that is hard to determine, based on the fact that the red lights were all blinking from the rear. The object never displayed both white and red lights congruently. This aircraft was very mysterious and interesting to watch. This is just speculation, but this aircraft seemed almost as if it was trying to simulate an airplane. That night, I saw 3 of these objects. The longest duration was at my house for approximately 3 minutes.",2002-03-19T00:00:00,33.19502279411765,-97.11429981617647

It was totally black, and the lights did not illuminate any portion of the craft.

I might note also that I travel this area twice a week, and very rarely see any conventional aircraft at all. The shuttle launch was not visible due to the clouds. As a side note, before I left on this trip, I set the digital clock on the radio to sync with my local radio station from Tampa (970 WFLA) and after this event, the van clock was two minutes slow.

There were no lights, but it reflected light, signs, and even a light from a radio tower it went bye.  It looked almost exactly like the Bedhampton UFO that was video taped.

It was moving very quickly like this, back and forth for some time.  I parked my car in a parkin lot on Ynez and Winchester Road and continued to watch a bit longer.

At 5:25 a.m., my girl friend and I were driving to church on the H-1 freeway in Kalihi just past the Pali Highway on ramp, when I saw a dot (about the size of a planet or good size star) in the sky that moved from directly infront and above (about 45 degrees above the horizon) of my car towards the north-east, over the Koolau mountains.  By the time I said, 'What's that up there?' and my girl friend glanced up, the dot disappeared out of view.  I know this wasn't a meteor because we had just seen the Leonid meteor shower just a few weeks prior and this object moved much slower and didn't leave a trail.  The object took about 5-8 seconds to traverse half the sky.  I've been told that it could have been a satellite but being the winter time, the sun wasn't going to be rising for over an hour plus I'm not familiar with there being many satellites flying south to north over the islands, they're usually east to west.  It could have been a plane too, but there weren't any other lights except for just that one dot, and there wasn't any sillouette as it crossed other stars.  Also, I've never seen aircraft flying over the sky that early in the morning and going in that particular direction.  F.Y.I.  I periodically stargaze on early Sunday mornings. In an unrelated event, sometime in 1995 or 96, I recall seeing a series of bright blue light beams shooting up from a fixed point along the Koolau mountain ridge near the Pali Highway area.  This blast of 3-4 distinct beams shot up like a spot light and lit up the sky and clouds in the area.  The beams moved very fast and independantly of each other (some angled as low as 45 degrees to the horizon), however it only lasted for about 5 seconds.  Keep in mind that there are no houses that far up on the ridges and why anyone whould have powerful spotlights that deep in the woods for a 5 second show is beyond me.

As the brilliance intensified it also increased it's speed significantly to twice the speed it had been originally moving and also changed direction slightly by perhaps one or two degrees. At the same time there was a plane in the sky moving from the west towards the east and this object seemed to pass under it rapidly.

Then as my mind started racing to explain this flashing I saw a smaller dimmer object the size/shape/colour of a faint star appear a thumbs width to the left of where the flashes ocurred moving diagonally down to the right at about a 30-35 dgree angle and then disappear just after it crossed the up/down 90degree angle line of where the flashes ocurred. The smaller, dimmer, moving object moved the distance of 1 and a 1/2-2 thumb widths alltogether and this took around the time it takes to say ""one"".

I suspect it may have been Minneapolis Center, but confirmation of that would be helpful. Also, can you share what your call sign was at the time?  That helps the FAA do the search, and go right to the radio communication with certainty that they have the right audio cuts.  We will not release the name of your company, of course, in our written material.

While driving north on Jefferson Street through town, my 9 year old daughter noticed an object in the sky. She said ""Dad what is that? It's really shiny."" I looked and couldn't see it at first, but she continued to talk about it and soon after I spotted it too. I pulled the car over and got a very good look at it. The object was square in shape from a frontal view, but thin from a side view. The front of the object, while square, contained 4 circular shapes within it (like 4 dinner plates placed side by side, two across, two down, to fill the square.)The front was ""chrome-like"" and extremely shiny. The back side of the object was black & flat with no other markings. The object was on end and slowly spinning horizontally, so that to look at it while spinning was to see the shiny side of the square, then the thin, then the black side, and so on; a pattern of thick & thins. While spinning, the object traveled North towards downtown, then made a turn to head West near Busch Creek. A guess to it's speed may be about a varying 10-25 miles an hour. A guess to it's height from the ground would be approx. 100-150 feet. The overall size estimate would be 5+ feet with the thinner side maybe 1 foot thick. We watched the object as it changed course and even tried to follow it, but it soon vanished from our sight due to obstacles. I am anxiously awaiting an explaination of what we saw. I am not the type who even proposes this could be a UFO. I feel that I am a well grounded person as well as local business owner and would much prefer an explaination of this, than none... but I still cannot explain what my daughter & I saw. My wife had each of us draw on paper what we saw & they matched exactly.

I am a am a nightly sky watcher and I suddenly noticed this new star which caught my eye due to the bright magnitude. It's brighter than any nearby stars in that part of the sky.  It is white and something about it just looks different, it appears to me to be slightly flashing but totally white.  When I look through the binoculars, I am definitely seeing 3 colors flashing: green, red and amber.  It rises like a star throughout the evening as if it's moving with the earths rotation.  I look through the binoculars at other objects that I know to be stars to see if maybe I am getting the colors through some kind of distortion but the other stars are all white.  One evening, there was 2 of the objects about the same height in the sky and about 30 degrees between them. Also, always in conjunction with this star rising, I see lots of little white flashes flickering here and there in the vicinity of the star.  One night, there were 8 flashes that all went off pretty much simultaneously, like flashbulbs popping but not with that amount of brightness,  and it was almost like they were communicating.  One other interesting point, I looked up in my star maps and there is no star of that magnitude located underneath Casseopia.  I know stars twinkle but they don't change colors.  I don't know what to make of this and think that I can't be the only person seeing this.  Hopefully, someone else will write in and confirm my sighting.

It kinda looked like maybe a triangle, but I couldn't really tell. It was huge, I would guess maybe a hundred feet or more, depending on how high up it was. It moved really slowly over the tree tops and slowed down as it came over the Ohio River. It looked like it was just looking at the water then it came towards our house. It speeded up and dissapeared over the hill to the back of our house. I'm not really sure of the exact details, but it seemed to have a sphere on the bottom, but like I said it was just a distortion. The reason I think it had a sphere on the bottom(semi-sphere) is the way the stars moved. They got longer and longer, and then seemed to get really close at the middle of the distortion. This is my second Ufo sighting, but I really don't know what it was. It could have been some strange gas that can stop and move again or a military aircraft that can go invisible. The reason I don't know if it is or not is because I never heard of anything like this before, but if it was a Ufo, it's a strange one.

I was on my way to work, traveling eastbound on Winchester Road, just outside of the Memphis city limits. There was a low cloud cover, and the sun was not visible in the sky. I noticed a long, black object traveling at high speed beneath the clouds. It appeared on my left, to the north, and moved in a southerly direction. For a split-second, I thought I might be watching a flock of geese flying over, as we have many geese in the area. However, the object was traveling far faster than any flock of geese could fly. There appeared to be a black ""smudge"" behind the object. I at first thought this might be a black vapor trail, but the ""smudge"" didn't linger in the sky. The ""smudge"" seemed to move in tandem with the object. The object first appeared as a black line then changed to an acute triangular shape. It struck me as odd that the edges of the object appeared to be blurred and somewhat indistinct. Nevertheless, the most striking feature of the object was the speed with which it traveled across the sky. I cannot begin to estimate its speed, but it was out of sight within seconds. I'm a professional with two college degrees. I've lived near the flight paths of Memphis International Airport for the past sixteen years and enjoy ""sky watching"" during the day and at night.

The event lasted no more than 3-4 seconds.  It was impossible to tell how far away it was, and I immediately thought it was a meteor that had burned up, and maybe even impacted.  I turned the AM news on and in about 15 minutes, heard a new report that others had seen it too.  Then the local Denver talk radio station made this event its topic for the next few hours. I called the station from a pay phone and told them what I had seen. After, I saw a newspaper article that had listed the phenomena to a meteor. I told friends and family of the event and had not really thought about it until Sat. March 24, 2001 when I was attending the Aztec UFO Symposium in Aztec NM, and a person got up and told of his sighting on the same night and same time.  I was encouraged to report my sighting by one of the presenters at the symposium. My sighting was on a very clear night and with no city lights nearby to dilute the image. I don't recall the moon location or if it was visible.

A friend and I were observing the night sky when I spotted 3 white lights flying overhead in a formation of a triangle. No other lights were noticed in between the other white lights. These lights were very high up, probably much higher than any air plains that fly over and the three white lights were the same size as many other stars, as well as being as bright as many other stars. The reason it caught our eye was the formation the three white lights were flying in and they remained in that position flying at a steady pace overhead towards south Jersey. There was also no sound, it was very quite. The sky was very clear. While quietely watching the triangle of three lights fly over head in a straight line a sudden scurry of birds flew out of the trees behind us very quickly. I always thought it was unusual for many birds to want to fly in the dark especially in an area without much light around. After about 12 - 16 seconds of watching the flight pattern, we watched as the one front light went out (disappeared) quickly, which then the second white light then went out about a second after the first one and then the third light went out, dissappeared, after the second one, until there were no more lights to be witnessed. It was'nt that the object had flown way out of our sight and slowly faded out, rather it had not flown that far off before the lights started to go out one by one. I did not have my camera equipment with me on this night. Now a days my camera equipment goes every where with me. We had never seen an air craft with lights like this do this sort of thing. It had also seemed that this craft had to of been very high up because of the size of the lights and could not get an idea of speed. After we calmed down and discussed what was unsual with this object compared to an air craft/ air plane we finally headed home. When I came back home my cable was out and was unable to watch t.v., not that this could have anything to do with this event, but it did'nt help me to relax that night. I am a nature photographer of 4 years, my friend was in the Navy in the past. We had become interested in unusual sightings and have witnessed a few before and after this particular event and had become very good at knowing what does not move, or act like any air craft and if something does not have the normal lighting to an air craft. I would only be interested in being contacted for information by email or snail mail.

Both clouds were in the east and one was the apparent size of a thumb, the other half this size.  I also noticed that the vapour trail of a jet was stretching from roughly the SE to NW and its leading end was obscured by the smaller cloud.  It is always my natural reaction to watch, for a few seconds, the passing of a jet as it goes overhead but as yet this jet had not moved from behind the small cloud.  It should have taken a second or less for a jet to travel the apparent width of this tiny cloud.  After maybe ten seconds I was expecting to see burning pieces of jet fall from the sky as this was the only reason I could come up with as to why this jet had apparently stopped.  Time went by, maybe 20-30 secs, I can't remember the time scale that well because I was just astounded that the jet seemed to have stopped.  Then I saw what looked like a triangular object, an isoceles possibly moving in a smoothly curving path from a point which was many degrees above and to the right of this small cloud.  It's apparent size was 2 or 3 times that of a jet, its surface was not smooth but appeared to have details which were beyond my vision.  It had no vapour trail and it moved faster than a jet possibly twice the speed, it is hard to compare since it moved in a long arc.  At this point I was aware that something extremely mad was happening and that something weird was going to happen.  This object, which seemed to appear from nowhere was swooping its way towards this little cloud where a jet was apparently stuck.  Incidentally the jet was still 'stuck' while this thing was making its way.  Obviously my heart was beating fast and my jaw was hanging and various expletives were repeating themselves in my head.  Anyway, as soon as the object disappeared behind this cloud, the plane popped out!  The object was gone and the jet continued on the same course indicated by it's pre! vious va pour trail i.e. SE to NW.  I am an amateur astronomer and I where glasses with weak lenses.  I have also seen other anomalous things when doing astronomy such as fast moving orange lights, which have also been reported by two others in the letters section of a UK astronomy magazine.

I and my friend ((name deleted)) were in the air at the time of the Feb. 26th, 1998 sighting above, that was reported near Ontario, NY. We too had a sighting. We had departed from the Oshawa airport and were flying on an eastward heading of about 080 degrees, eventually passing just north of St. Andrews, which is just west of Cornwall Ontario, Canada. ((name deleted)) tapped me on the shoulder, pointed out the window to my right and said,""what's that?"" I saw an object that looked like the underside of a massive metal bowl with multi-coloured lights on it. This thing was much, much, larger than our airplane (a Piper Cherokee 180) and appeared to be tagging along with us at the same altitude (5500-ft.) about 5 nautical miles off of our port side wing. There were several different coloured lights on the object, some of which are not used in aviation at all. They pulsed from left to right slowly, dimmed out, then pulsed from right to left. The color pattern from left to right was: GOLD-RED-BLUE-GREEN-GOLD, then from right to left: GREEN-GOLD-BLUE-RED-GOLD. When the lights were not on, the thing looked semi-transparent. You could see the outline of it, yet it appeared to me that you could see right through it at the same time. I was very excited to see something like this, but at the same time quite upset and afraid because I was unsure of what is was or might do. ((name deleted)) and I were quiet for what seemed like quite a while, just watching this thing, then I decided to call Dorval Terminal in Montreal, Quebec. I said, ""Dorval terminal, this is Cherokee 180""; (I'm holding my callsign until I know what is going to happen with this information). ""Cherokee 180 good evening, Dorval Terminal."". ""We are on a VFR cross-country flight plan, passing just north of the town of St. Andrews on an eastbound heading and have traffic to the south of us at the same altitude. Could you tell us what it is?""  ""Cherokee 180, squawk code (####) on your transponder and standby.""  ""Dorval Terminal, Cherokee (call sign) squawking (####).""  ""Cherokee 180, there in no know traffic at that altitude on our radar within a 60 mile radius of your area.""   I couldn't believe it.  ""Cherokee 180, what kind of aircraft is it?""  ""Dorval Terminal, I don't know. It doesn't look like an aircraft. It's got multi-coloured lights on it that go from left to right and back again and it looks bigger than a 747. It's massive.""  ""Cherokee 180, how long have you been in the air?""  ""Dorval terminal, we've been up here for a few hours.""  Maybe you should land and stretch your legs for awhile, maybe take a break.""  ""Negative Dorval, we'd like to keep going if that's O.K. with you, but you don't know what that is we&#8217;re seeing?&#8221; &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a u.f.o. Cherokee 180! Ha! Ha!&#8221; I was upset and annoyed at the attitude of the controller, because Stan and I both were seeing that thing and the tower was denying it being there. I didn&#8217;t think it was a joke. &#8220;O.K. Cherokee 180, call us again in another 10 minutes&#8221;. &#8220;Roger, Dorval. Cherokee 180 checks remarks&#8221;. I said, &#8220;Stan whatever that thing is out there, it doesn&#8217;t matter right now. We&#8217;ve got to pay attention to our aircraft and flight plan right now, so let&#8217;s do that.&#8221; We resumed our time keeping and navigating. The next time we looked out the window, the object was gone. I asked Stan how he felt about seeing something like that and he said he felt sort of scared. I said, &#8220;me too&#8221;. I contacted Dorval terminal and they gave me a VOR radial (a navigational frequency) to track outbound, away from they&#8217;re airspace. I set up the VOR receiver with the proper radial selected and began trying to track it outbound as requested. The needle twitched from left to right and no matter how hard I tried to hold my heading, no matter what I did, I was unable to keep the needle in the center. I tried the second VOR receiver. Same thing. &#8220;They were working when I tested them a few hours ago!&#8221;, I thought to myself. I knew that Stan had no idea what a VOR was and what was happening, so I tried not to draw his attention to the problem. I looked outside for the object we had seen earlier, but there was nothing there. I had a look at my VNC (VFR Navigational Chart) and set myself a new course for our destination in Quebec. The ceiling started coming down and a call to the local FSS (Flight Service Station) revealed that the weather was below VFR minimums where we were headed. Also, I was amazed to see that the fuel gauges read only ¼ of a tank on either side! I remembered passing a small airport a short while ago and decided to find it on the map, turn back and land there. I asked FSS if there was fuel available there and they said they&#8217;d have someone waiting for us. We found and identified the airport quite easily, made the appropriate radio calls and landed safely. I had the tanks filled to the rim on both sides before we left Oshawa. I had been running the engine at &#8220;best-lean&#8221;, to conserve fuel and get reasonable power, so I was surprised to see how much fuel had been used. I&#8217;d never noticed this plane to have had such high fuel consumption before. It was as if we&#8217;d been in the air a lot longer than we actually had been. We couldn&#8217;t find anyone to buy fuel from when we arrived at there, so we called FSS and asked them if they had any ideas. They said that we&#8217;d have to go to another nearby airport, about 15 miles away. I was told I&#8217;d get fuel there for sure. Neither of us had enough money for a hotel for the night and cab fare to and from it, so we considered our options. At the time, Quebec had recently experienced an ice storm and was recuperating from downed power-lines, blocked roads and even food shortages in some areas. The temperature was probably between &#8211;15 to &#8211;20 degrees Celsius, so waiting in the plane all night was not an option either; we had to fly. Again I planned the route to our new destination and we took off. Enroute to our new destination I was in constant contact with Dorval Terminal and they gave me some vectors (directions/headings) to help out along the way. The fuel was running out fast and I told Dorval that I didn&#8217;t think I was going to make it. Stan heard this in his headset and must have been terrified, but he said nothing. For some strange reason, I wasn&#8217;t worried. All the events leading up until the end were so surreal. Dorval told me that I should see the airport soon and sure enough, there it was. I had to fight a crosswind like I&#8217;d never experienced before. On final approach, I had such a great deal of crab (wind correction) in that it seemed as if we were flying at almost a 70-degree angle to the runway. As we got closer to the runway, the wind strength died off considerably and I was able to use the rudder to get more in line for our landing. There were fire and foam trucks, the local police and the Chief Pilot of one of the FBO&#8217;s at the airport, waiting for us. We landed normally and taxied in. Along the taxiway, the engine started sputtering and when I went to do my shutdown checklist, the engine quit before I had a chance to pull out the mixture control. The firemen walked over to the plane as Stan and I got out. One of them took the fuel cap off and said something in French. Stan told me that he&#8217;d said, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing in there&#8221;! One of the firemen asked me in english what my name was, and when I told him, everybody including the police and Chief Pilot was roaring with laughter. I imagine the reason for that is that my last name is almost the same to the letter as a pilot who flew across the Atlantic in a single engine plane without knowing if he&#8217;d make it or not. We got our fuel, had a bite to eat, I got the Chief Pilot to stamp my logbook and we set out to return to Oshawa. The trip back was uneventful and we landed with&#8230;..plenty of fuel!??! I&#8217;m not sure what happened that night, or if any of the events were connected, but I know what I saw. I haven&#8217;t stopped thinking about our sighting and certainly have kept it quiet in commercial circles. I&#8217;ve told a few people, but they all think I&#8217;m either making it up, or that I&#8217;ve got something wrong with me. I&#8217;ve given up talking to people who are ignorant. I&#8217;m ready to talk to someone that believes me, but I&#8217;m still afraid of being ridiculed. I&#8217;m not sure what to do, but it seems to be bothering me more than usual lately. Also, for some reason I keep having this vivid picture in my head of turning directly toward this object and flying in that direction. When I get the image of this in my head, I feel sick, distressed and the tears start coming out. I don&#8217;t know why. I&#8217;m starting to get worried about it.

They appeared to be in a fixed position, perhaps a bit lower than the stars. Their movement was slow, just like the stars, indicating the objects' perceived movement was actually due to the Earth's rotation. The base of the Y-shape was the brightest, looking somewhat like a cluster of three adjacent stars. The angles at the top of the Y were like lighted lines, not as bright as the base. On some nights we have seen a short line extending downward from the middle of the base of the Y. We have since seen these objects moving from west to east between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. every night when the skies have been clear. They are probably visible much later into the night, but we haven't stayed up later. Our suspicion is that these are U.S. spy satellites grouped in position for sightings of overseas locations as part of the War on Terrorism, but attempts to confirm this have failed. We have been told the spy satellites are too high in the sky and to small to be visible without powerful telescopes, but we have also read that newer, and perhaps bigger, spy satellites have been in development for some time. Some other people in our area have also seen these Y-shaped objects in the sky.

Facing west I scanned the cloudless sky trying to locate Mars in order to find the comet but a cluster of swiftly moving dim lights caught my attention. The lights numbered five or six and the intensity of their luminosity was no greater than the fainter visible stars that night. In fact had I not been starring in their general direction at the time I would not have noticed them. They moved from south to north at a high and relatively unchanging rate of speed. When I first noticed them they were arranged in a roughly straight line and I took them for conventional airplane lights except they didn't strobe and then I decided there were too many and the configuration was unusal. As I tried to determine what aircraft this was the lights reorganized into a rough arc. At that point I figured these were indivdual objects and not a solid lighted body. The reconfiguration took place very quickly and it seemed as if the trailing lights had increased speed slightly and took positions on the easterly side of the arc as the others spread out to the west. The pattern was very tight which lead me to discount the normal military aircraft in formations I'm accustomed to seeing in the area skies. The lights remained in the arc formation and I had the impression they were breaking into another pattern but I lost sight of them in the glare of a street lamp. the glare of the street lights of the intersection north of my home coupled with the speed the lights travelled made it impossible to find a better vantage point to track them further. I tried to listen for aircraft engines as they passed overhead but the din of passing traffic on the highway an eighth of a mile west of my location made this difficult. I couldn't make a determination of the altitude of the lights but their faint appearance gave the impression they were very distant. Likewise the individual lights seemed to be in close proximity of each other but this is impossible to determine definitively. Their size and luminosity gave the impression they were roughly at the same altitude and attitude. I would be content to dismiss this formation as satellites but for two factors: Their high rate of speed and the ability to reconfigure their positions simultaneously. On the evening of Sunday, 3/31/02 I watched the sky between 7:45 PM and 8:10 PM with the perhaps eroneous assumption that I might see the same cluster of satellites pass by yet did not. I did however note two satellites, one passing north to south and the other the opposite, and noted that these had roughly the same luminosity as the cluster I'd seen before but not the greater speed. I'm read of four or five clusters of satellites launched into orbit by corporate entities but I'm not aware that they can reorder their relation to one another or regulate their speed. A couple days of research hasn't yielded any information on such a satellite cluster but I'm open to education.",2002-04-08T00:00:00,30.266904680969628,-81.6163728336584

As I looked back at the object a second, and third, time, I could see that something was just ""different"" with this ""star"".  At this point I asked the two people with me to take a look as well.  With their younger eyes they verified that it couldn't be a star, insomuch as it was showing two separate colors, green, and, yellow. At this point, we pulled out the binoculars for a closer look, and could just discern an irregular shape, as well as a twinkling, or pulsing of the colors.  Also, we noticed that the object had risen higher above the ridge line, and seemed to be a bit further away. Our total viewing time was approximately 30 minutes before we were forced to leave the mountain due to the cold temperature. As we departed, the object was still in it's position, ruling out the possibility of an aircraft. Also, with the 25 mph (est) winds that were blowing, a weather ballon would have long since been blown away. This one goes down as ""unidentified"" in my book.

I woke my mom and we grabbed our jackets and headed outside. After about 20-25 minutes or so, my mom went inside to grab some lawn chairs...looking up at the sky hurts your neck!

It was then that I saw the triangular shaped object moving silently against the night sky. As an amatuer backyard astronomer, I am very familiar with the sky...meteors...comets, satellites and the like...and I know that what I saw was nothing of the sort.  It appeared to have three ""lights"" with one in each corner. I put ""lights"" in quotes because they were not like any kind of lights I have ever seen on a familiar aircraft.  Most planes and such have sharp, crisp looking lights.  However, the lights on this craft were diffused...more like a glow.  They were of an amber-red color and were large and round.  They appeared to be directly under the craft and not on the sides. I have no idea how high up it was, but it did not appear to be flying at a high altitude. I followed it as it traveled in a straight line until I lost it.  Unlike other people's posts, this craft did not stop and turn abrubtly, but just continued on a straight path.  I lost it in the sky because the object itself was very dark.  Without the reflection of the city lights, I probably would not have been able to see it at all! I do not know what I saw that night, but I am of the mentality that it was some sort of government craft.  In this day and age of terrorism, I do not believe that there is a way for ANY kind of foreign craft to be in our atmosphere without the government descending on it instantly and without everyone hearing about it.

Pretty consistent and most noticeable along the horizon in a 360, so I decided to go to the front of my apartment and face South-Southeast to watch. All meteors had long, distinct tails.  I live under one of the main flight paths for the Syracuse airport and I am used to all the planes. About 20 minutes into my watching I noticed  one plane that was going along at a slightly different speed, a little faster than normal for a plane with a very steady, smooth flight. At first I thought it was a plane, but quickly realized it had no landing lights on, no colored or blinking lights either.  This was a strong white light, about the magnitude of one of the planets, and wasn't blinking.  The shape was circular and it did not appear to be attached to any larger body, just a light. I have to mention here, that it seemed to blend in very well with the star-filled backdrop. If I hadn't been looking in that exact location, I would have missed it.  I watched it transverse the skyline for approx. 4-5 seconds traveling west to east, and then simply fade out. It did not burn up like the meteors or have a tail, and it was on a straight horizonital flight path.  Sort of freaked out by it and getting cold, I decided to go into the apartment to warm up.  At about 4:45 am I decided to stay inside and watch the storm from my glass door b/c the meteors were certainly strong enough to watch from inside.  There are two trees in my backyard and I have to look through the branches to see the sky, but it worked fine for viewing. It wasn't long before I noticed a second light just the same as the first, go from above my apartment and over the trees.

I'd seen enough and went inside - I was tired.  My Wife stayed outside, and several minutes later she came in the porch door asking me to come outside and see if I think this is part of the Leonids or not.  She didn't say what her opinion was.  I walked out, and she was pointing at it. At first I was focusing so far out that I seemed to just focus right past it.  Then she said pointed again, more deliberately.  At that time I saw it. At first it looked similar to some of the shots when that comet/meteor or whatever it was, broke up, in a line, then slammed one of our Planets a few years back.  I then saw that this column of lights was not descending nor were any of the parts fading. Then I realized it wasn't a naturally ocurring event. It is best described as a series of six (what must have been) large lights, orange in color with a brightness I can best describe as ""Low-Glow"".  It was moving slowly and silently from the West when she first saw it, then by the time I got out there it had already begun South East. We both agree that there was a series of six lights.  She remembers round, but I remember them being that of an elipse. (Typical track and field) The lights all appeared to be spaced evenly front to back with the exception of the space in between the 3rd and 4th lights.  There was space there, of a size which was appr. that of the lights themselves.  Within that area, we each recalled dim, seemingly intermittent lighter-colored and smaller lights.  Like a dim,....very dim sparkler.  It was moving in such a way as to give the impression of an airliner in that, the lights were 1,2,3,4,5,6 all in a row with one being on the end it was travelling toward and on down the line, until one was at the trailing end.  I must say,...it certainly is! analogo us to a passenger craft, although no body or surrounding craft could be seen.  The way things were laid out however, a quick description of the light layout and the direction of travel was ""similar to the tubular design of a fuselage"".  As we both stood silently watching,...it passed overhead at the appr. speed of a blimp,(no noise)with the look of a fuselage and the quietness of a bird.  It was a starry night and no ""structure"" was observed. We live within 3 - 4 miles of Houston Intercontinental Airport. I grew up around Eglin AFB and Pensacola NAS, spent 9 years in the Military, (4 USMC / 5 US ARMY SF) and am VERY familiar with military aircraft to include winning awards for same.  ""THIS WAS NO CONVENTIAL AIRCRAFT.""  It flew silently over us, appr 1,500 feet to our North, (right over a certain Chevrolet Dealer very near I-45 and 1960, for you locals).  It is proving difficult to gauge the height since I do not know the size of the lights, although I'd say it was probably several hundred feet long. It did not appear to vary in altitude or speed. The lights ""seemed"" to be large.  It passed by us, heading toward the Airport, which is only 3 - 4 miles away (if that).  Eventually, we lost sight of it due to light-pollution. and our roof.  I am mailing sketches drawn by each of us without collaboration.   The only addition I have is that my Wife did say that when she initially saw it (before I did) it seemed to ""move like a snake"", in that it was travelling level, then seemed to hit a bump which it simply made a quick humping motion with each of the six lights doing the same thing at the same spot.  Like a centipede walking over a twig.",2001-12-05T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

It was a clear and crisp day and at first I thought it might be venus because it was a very small and bright white round object and not moving, I thought. I have observed venus on other bright clear days in the distant past. But as I was watching this object which I had centered in the binocular lense, which I thought might be venus I saw a branch slowly come into view in the binocular lense. It came into view much faster than any earth rotation would have on a planet. So it was not venus as I first thought. It was not any type of aircraft known to me. Possibly it could have been one of many earth satellites. But are satellites observable in broad daylight moving so slowly?

It was a triangle with lights all around the edge between 7 and 10 alltogether.

In addition, it was perfectly quiet, no sound no blinking lights and it appeared to be somewhat opaque in the center but yet retained some translucent effect as well, if it passed under a star it seemed as if the star would fade but not dissappear. After a it dissappeared to the west and we regained our ability to actually talk, my 2 friends went inside to warm up but I stayed, EXACTLY 11 minutes after this sighting 2 military jets possibly F-15 or F-16 fighters came from the southwest and rocketed passed my home heading northwest at a high rate of speed, the classic sonic boom trailing behind, blinking lights etc...

Triangle shaped craft We have received mail from a young man in Portland, who, while laying outside watching the meteor shower had a very unusual event occur involving a triangular shaped craft which dropped out of the sky to a position directly above him at an estimated distance of 15 to 20 feet. The craft was described as having a ""red light like thing all the way around it and a black dome in the middle that turned white."" He says there was no sound coming from the craft at all and, after what appeared to be about 5 minutes, it left as he heard the sound of a car coming in the distance. OUFOR contacted this witness and gathered a few more details from him. These are his words... ""During the 5 minutes that I lay there in surprise, I had a strange calmness come over me as well as a tingling feeling. When the black dome became white is when the tingling occurred. It couldn't have been more than 5 minutes though that's what it seemed like. I ran into the house afterwards, but I didn't tell anyone because they would just laugh at me and say I'm full of it. Nobody, including myself, believed in UFO's until that night. I have had dreams both nights since it has occurred, of the craft, and also I have seen aliens in these dreams, but that is probably my mind seeing pictures of things I've seen before and adding them in. The main reason I reported this is because I wanted to know if others saw the same."" This now appears to be the third report of UFO activity in this area, the second of a triangular shaped craft seen during the meteor shower and the third from a sighting that was reported on August 1st which included two videos taken of the same craft on the same day. Analysis of that video have shown that this craft was found to be cruising the same area as this young mans physical address 3 months before his reported encounter which seems to be an abduction situation on the surface.

There were no other lights surrounding the object; there were CLEARLY no standard regulation aircraft beacons, strobes, or wingtip red/green lights, and the object made no discernable sound.

My wife and I and at least 50 witnesses were out at Long Lake Recreational Area outside near the north end of Long Lake (located east of Fond du Lac County). At approximately 10:05 p.m., a series of very unusual events began occurring and continued late into the early morning hours. At 10:05 p.m., we were looking south and could plainly see the planet Mars off the southern horizon. Slightly east of this location, a large bright amber colored light rose straight up from behind a forest of trees in the distance. The object went up approximately 25 degrees off the horizon and moved in a northerly direction at about the speed of a fast moving airplane. As it was removing, it seemed to drop round orbs of amber colored lights. It continued and disappeared in the northern horizon. As it disappeared, a second object reappeared exactly as before and followed the exact path as the first object. This object also headed north and seemed to stop before the northern horizon. At this point, a third object rose again at the same exact starting point as the other two. It rose up and became extremely bright white and accelerated in a northerly direction in the same path as the previous two. Along its path several times, it seemed to flare up bright and dim and several times it seemed to drop amber balls of light. As it approached close to the second light, the second light blinked out and the third light continued northerly and finally blinked out. This series of events started at 10:05 to 10:20 pm. At this point, everything seemed to calm down. At this point, we were excited but some of us felt these 3 events could perhaps be described as airplanes or pyrotechnic devices, therefore, no one seemed to draw irrational conclusions. This was only the beginning of several strange events that were to follow. At approximately 10:35 pm, a 4th amber ball of light rose from the general location as the previous three. At this time, the fourth light however headed westerly instead of northerly and seemed to hover approximately 30 degrees off the southern horizon and was blocked by trees approximately the first 20 degrees. Now the object after it headed west seemed to head north directly toward us and became quite large, approximately the size of a small finger fingernail at arm's length. At this time, became extremely white bright and then extradionary the orange's object seemed to have a definite halo or fog around it. Outside of this halo were two distinct bright greenish-blue tiny orbs that continued to circle and rotate wildly around the object. At times, the two greenish-blue orbs would seem to stop directly in front of the object and at times, they would stop and change direction wildly. Other times, they would circle around the top or bottom or around the side of it. This wild movement continued for approximately 35 minutes and was seen by at least 50 witnesses, some had video cameras and still cameras. After approximately 35 minutes, a major event occurred. At this time, the large amber object seemed to split into two. One piece shot directly down towards the ground and was covered by the trees. The second piece seemed to disappear. At this time, one of the intense greenish blue orbs ""shot"" directly up and northward at an extremely high rate of speed covering the sky from where it had been to the northern horizon in perhaps 8 seconds. The other greenish-blue orb continued to stay in the general area above where the amber orb seemed to have descended or crashed to earth. The time now was approximately 11:15 pm. The one remaining greenish-blue orb continued to move wildly up and down, side to side doing circles and loops but stayed in the general close area. The single orb continued to move wildly into the early morning hours. Unfortunately, I left for home approximately 12 midnight and drove home. Several friends of mine stayed until 1:30 am and the object was still there and doing its wild dance. I don't know how long this continued because most people left near or at this time. During all these events, I had a 35mm camera equipped with a 450 mm lens mounted on a heavy duty tripod and was using 1600 ISO rated color print film. While looking through the view finder and centering the object in the microprism, I could clearly see the object move wildly and I know my camera wasn't moving nor was I. I shot approximately 30 shots of film during both major events, the first three and the fourth. Also, I used a 10x50 BAK4 optics glass binoculars meant for astromonical use and viewed the object. Clearly, I could see what appeared to be an envelope of haze or fog that surrounded the amber light. The two greenish-blue lights appeared clearly and extremely bright and very distinct with no haze whatsoever surrounding them. The greenish-blue orbs reminded me of what appeared to be bees flying around the object in a nonrestrictive orbit, changing directions and paths many times. ((NUFORC Note:  Several reports.

The one blue light that was left hovered in it's position by itself for over a half hour. There were atleast 20 other people who saw these objects. They definately were not airplanes, hot air balloons, or kites. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and his wife, both of whom submitted written reports of their sighting.  Both parties appear to be exceptionally good observers, and both seem to be quite eloquent, and serious minded, individuals.  The husband has served in the military, and is an experienced investigator of UFO reports.  They both were standing with an estimated 50 other observers to the phenomenon at the time of the sighting.  The witnesses estimated that the first three red ""balls of light traveled from the southern sky to the northern sky, passing through an arc of an estimated 160 degrees, in approximately 10 seconds.

When I used my husband's binoculars, each bright greenish spheres looked like tiny v- shaped objects when they appeared in front of the orange sphere. When the bright greenish objects moved wildly on the sides and top of the orange sphere, they appeared to be spherical. I continued to watch with and without binoculars. There was a bright flash and the orange sphere split into 2. The bottom half appeared to have dropped to the ground and the top half disappeared. One green sphere headed to the north at a fast rate of speed and the other green sphere stayed in the general vicinity of where the orange sphere had been and seemed to move wildly around that area.

It was a very clear sky without moonlight so the stars were very visible.  Took dog for a walk in a large field and took the opportunity to stargaze. Immediately noticed movement low on the Northern horizon.  Braced myself against a fence to make sure the two lights were in fact moving.  I estimate a low flying object no more than 1000 feet altitude and 200 feet in diameter (large).  The trailing light was at about 35 degrees lower than the leading light and this attitude and orientation was constant.  Both lights were white and steady and I could make out a very light white or light blue light arc of light or forward rim on the leading edge, suggesting a saucer shape.  There was no sound and the movement was rather slow for an aircraft.  I counted 10 seconds and judged it at about a 1/2 mile... -180 mph.  At its closest it appeared to pass within a 1000 yards of me (a fence stood between me and a high school football field, so I had a decent basis of comparison).  At this closest point I had a horrible few seconds during which it appeared to stop moving forward and seemed to be getting either bigger or closer.   It did however, slowly proceed northeast without a sound.  I followed it with my eyes for about 2 more minutes before it was gone, low on the northeast horizon past Palatine and towards Mt. Prospect. Interestingly, I realized I was hearing a ""wooshing"" of air shortly afterwards.  I saw no aircraft in the sky at all, but there was no mistaking the sound of a subsonic jet passing overhead, but not like any I had ever heard.  It sounded extremely low and ""muffled."".  There were no chem-trails (I was looking for chem.-trails to appear from the first craft).  My watch read 3:05AM.  This too was followed by a distant, low rumble, which I presume to have been a high altitude supersonic aircraft, again unlike any I had ever heard and much more subtle than the ones I have heard.  Although I have no explanation for the first craft, I speculate that the last two craft were chase planes -one subsonic following closely and the other supersonic circling at a distance.  The sounds clearly occurred over to great an expanse of time to be physically connected to one another or the siting. This is the second siting of ""unknowns"" I have recently enjoyed while walking my dog.  I hate the idea that such phenomenon is commonplace above our suburban skies.

But it was quite high and it did appear to be approaching relatively quickly from the East/Southeast, flying to the North/Northwest.  As I watched, I saw that it was appeared to be a small, black disk, flying VERY rapidly, and as it passed just to the east of me I examined it as closely as possible, determining there were no wings or other appendages.  So it could have been a cigar-shaped object, except that as it crossed the highway behind the car (perhaps 2 miles north of the car, which was travelling south, continuing to the North/Northwest, I saw that it did not change shape, therefore it appeared to be a solid disk-shaped (or round) vehicle.  I judged it as travelling several hundred miles per hour, and while it is very hard to judge the size, it must have been between about 20 to 50 feet in diameter.  I did manage to grab my binoculars but due to being in the car and it moving so quickly, could not bring it entirely into perfect focus, but can confirm it was a solid, black, apparently round object (seen from the side).",2002-01-29T00:00:00,35.4988,-104.937

The object was about half of a pencil eraser diameter at arms length, just enough size to make me think it was probably round, and the tail was about 1/2 to 1 hour of arc, trailing behind it. It only was visible for about half a second, and just when it was about to go over the highway, it seemed to disappear. I have no idea how big it was, or how far it was away. I think it was less than 1,000 feet from me, and less than 200 feet in altitude, but I am not sure. If it was farther away than that, it would have had to be really moving! I tried to fit it into some familiar object, and could not. It was not a balloon, because it going against the wind at a high speed. I don’t think it was a stunt kite, because there is no place to fly one in that area, as far as I know, and because it went in a straight line. It did not reverse direction or stop as a kite would have to do. (I fly them myself, and it definitely didn’t move the way a kite does.) Airplane or helicopter, no way. It did not resemble one in either appearance or the way it flew. As for a meteor, I have never seen one in broad daylight, and this object seemed to have more size than that. Also, every meteor I have seen has been going almost straight down, and I have only seen them at a much higher angle of elevation, while looking up, not straight ahead. The nearest thing I can fit it with is a “rod” which I have read about a few times on various web sites, but I am not sure about that either. I don’t think it fits any of the classical descriptions of “flying saucers” or any kind of alien space craft, unless it was moving at a truly incredible speed, or was less than 3 feet in diameter. They usually don’t have tails, as far as I have heard. Don’t know...just a curious thing. If there are aliens, I wish they would fly things around here, it’s kind of boring in Sacramento, most of the time. I never thought I would be sending you one of these things. Contact me only if others reported it. Otherwise why bother? Not a strong sighting.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,38.57580181028241,-121.45009956553221

Small aircraft moving in other direction! After having gotten out of bed due to some extreme lower back pain I looked out of the window at bedside and started to look at the sky which was filled with stars. The moon had set and as I was looking to the Southwest at Orion I noticed a bright white light just below and to the left (from my perspective) of Orion. At first I thought that it was that bright star in the Constelation next to Orion, but then realized that it was something else, perhaps a planet! I then noticed that it began to move to the Southeast at a very slow rate of speed. I estimate it to have been between 2000 to 3000 feet in altitude and about one to two miles away. It made no sound and as it moved away I moved to the side door and opened it standing on the deck to watch it continue to drift away from the house. While outside I confirmed my own opinion that there was no motorcraft sound at all. The temperature at the time was noted by me to be 32.2 degrees. I do not know how it got to be where it was when I first noticed it without my have having seen it, as the area in my view of  the Southwest sky is not obstructed by any trees and I did not see it move through that portion of the sky as it would have had to do in order to get to the point at which I first sighted it. My conclusion is that it (1) had been at that point motionless for a period of time before I started looking at that sky or (2) suddenly appeared out of thin air! This is not the first time that I have seen such a light in this part of the sky going in the same direction and at about the same slow drifting like speed. About 8 minutes latter a small aircraft which I believe was a Cessna flew over near the same area in the opposite direction. Certainly the pilot of that aircraft had to see this light. I would be interested to know if that pilot reported any unusual airtraffic at that time of the day. Perhaps the host of this site can check with air traffic control in Teterboro or the or the airtraffic controllers at Scranton/Wilkes-Barre both of who have radar looking over this part of Pike County.

From an upper floor in the Rainier Tower, I watched it descend moving slightly north-west over the next few minutes to just above the Bellevue Mall where it held stationary for a couple minutes. I have 8x23 binoculars in my office because of my view, so I was able to watch this object and see it in decent detail. The object looked like a large ballon in the shape of a butterfly, except that the ""wings"" of the butterfly were not part of the balloon, but attached to the sides. It was symmetrical, with ""wings"" on either side, and was very colorful, as you would expect a butterfly to be. I thought it was interesting that a balloon would descend from the sky, but I assumed it wasn't impossible. I was very surprised to see it start ascending, and headed slightly south-east, the same path from which it descended. This seemed strange for a balloon, to descend from high, stop close the the ground, and then begin ascending again. I know the time and date of the event because I took pictures of it with a Mavica digital camera which recorded the date and time. Unfortunately because the object was small and distant the only thing in the pictures is a gray blot. No detail to be seen. I can provide the pictures if necessary, but they really don't show much. I didn't think much of it until today (11/08/2000). Again, at about 12:20pm (this time I looked at the clock and did not take pictures) I noticed the same object above the Bellevue Mall. I looked at it through my binoculars and it appeared the same as I remembered the previous object. It descended slowly, heading north-west (note that the prevailing winds in the area are north-east, but it's a calm day) until it was below my line of sight (high in the Rainier Tower). I called a co-worker over and asked him to look at it. We then went to another office on our floor because we knew of a telescope we could use to image it better. Sadly, it's a crappy telescope and although I was able to track it for a while it didn't produce any better picture than the binoculars did. This time, instead of heading back up, it floated just above the tree line out over Medina and moved north slowly in between trees. I eventually lost it just south of NE 8th. I estimate the size to be beachball to basketball size, but it's hard to guage size from the distance from which I observed both events. Right now I'm watching several different helicopters flying above and around the Medina area. Helicopter traffic isn't unusual around here, but the timing is interesting to note. I've seen three thus far, two look like private, small helicopters and the other a larger news-chopper breed, but too far away to see any markings or color. All three have been flying up and down the east shoreline above Medina.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,47.604556307692306,-122.16441774358974

The sky wasn't completely black, but some stars were visible.  We were living on Richford Avenue in La Puente, California.  The sun had just set about a half an hour before.  It was very hot that day.  I was 14.  My Mother was in the backyard swimming alone in our doughboy pool.  I was inside of our house and heard her screaming.  I ran outside thinking she was drowning and she was pointing up in the northeastern sky screaming ""LOOK!""  I looked up and saw 3 triangle lights that appeared to be about the size of a quarter to the naked eye.  One was a little bit larger than the other two.  I am not good at judging distance, but they were very high in the sky, at least a mile I would guess.  They appeared to be playing ""tag"" in the sky.  They were white.  The larger of the two raced across the sky vertically and stopped, and the other two would follow.  The speed was unbelievable.  They went back and forth, up and down for nearly five (5) minutes.  This was over 30 years ago and our technology did not have the ability to dart completely across the sky, hover and then dart the opposite direction and stop again, defying inertia.  After they finished playing tag, all three went straight up in the sky until they were out of sight.  There was no sound.  They were perfectly quiet. I will never forget this, it is etched in my mind forever.  That memory is as clear in my mind today as it was 30 some years ago.  I called the police department to report it but they told me that I had to have been mistaken.  It made me feel very afraid to say anything since that time.  It is something my Mother and I only told our family about and kept it to a very close circle of friends, but I have always wondered if anyone else saw it.  I am a professional person and have worked in law since I was 16 years old.  If only we had computers back then to track things as we do now.  Thank you for this website.  I have waited over 30 years to be able ! to tell someone that might listen. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,34.031298606271775,-117.94306829268294

My 2 friends, my brother and I were out late that night (after 10:00 pm). I was 11 yrs, my brother 9, the others about the same age. We were playing some game on the sidewalk, and we noticed a huge yellow light in the sky, approx. 1/16 diameter of a full moon. It seemed to be very high in the sky or in space. The small airport called Sunland Park was visible in the west accross IH 10, and the lights from some small planes could be seen in the vicinity of the airport. The light was very high above the airport, and slowly moving to the north. We were excited, and I said to my friend that we should run up the block to his house to get his new telescope. At first he didn't want to, being afraid we would miss something while we were running up. But it kept moving so slowly that he agreed, and we sprinted up the street to get the scope. When we got to his house his Dad was out getting ready to call him and his brother in. He said ""Dad, LOOK AT THAT!!"", and his Dad took a long look at it, then called his wife and the older sister out to look. By this time, the light had crossed 1/2 the horizon, but was still very high (in space?). Soon thereafter it stopped moving, and after hanging there for 15 secs. or so, it began dropping smaller yellow lights out of the bottom, one after the other. The lights were about 1/10 the size of the larger light. It proceeded to drop about fifteen of these. The craft was at about 10:00 high, and these smaller lights would each disappear at about 08:30 high. When they began disappearing, the number of them and the realization that they could fly over us invisibly made my knees start to wobble and give out from fear- the only time in my life that has happened. After the last of the lights fell, four lights simultaneously broke off the object at each corner or quadrant, then fell to the same area and disappeared. After that the entire craft just blinked out. I looked around the neighborhood, and some other neighbors saw this as they! were ou tside watering the grass and others working on a car.

On Friday evening, March 31, 2001,  ((sic. Date os sighting was 30MR01.  PD)) I was working at my PC. The window was cracked open and I heard an approaching car and looked out the window to see if someone was coming down our driveway. We have a gravel driveway that leads to a country road. The driveway is approx 1/4 mile long. It was about 9:20 p.m. or so...I was not aware of the time at that point. As I looked out the window and saw the car was headed to another house by the main road, I noticed lights in the sky. They appeared to be those of a plane initially, but there was NO noise at any time! There were yellow lights and red lights and I was startled because it seemed to be flying at a very low altitude. It appeared to be coming head on rather than across the sky. It was located on the other side of the road, off the road, back towards the woods, near the tree tops. I understand that they were coming from the East. I continued to watch and then called my husband as I left the office to go outside for a better view. I couldn't get the words out because I had to sneeze and by the time my husband got to the front porch it had disappeared. I told him to wait as I was going to get the video camera as I felt ""something was very different about this plane and it would be back.""  Only a few minutes passed and I returned to the front porch and I would guess it was around 9:25 or so. The rest is recorded on the video tape. I would say that in retrospect, that the so called quick movements made by the aircraft as perceived by me, probably resulted from my zooming in and out. I used the night vision mode. The camera is a Sony Digital 8 , Model DCR-TRV310.  There is quite a bit of air traffic in this area, BUT we can hear the planes without any difficulty whatsoever. That is what is very odd about this, unless the objects were so far away that we couldn't hear them. It was cloudy that evening and you could not see the stars with the exception of the one I recorded close to the moon. I am assuming that was a star. The ""planes"" seemed to appear from the woods in the East. At the beginning of the video there are two...which my husband  reasons are planes. They are traveling at different altitudes from south to north the best I can tell. My last shot of the event films an object going the other way, from north to south, back towards the woods.  (To be continued) Multitude of extremely fast flashing lights in a small area of the sky. Part II of report After reviewing the video several times in different modes, I might accept someone telling me that these are planes. But in order to do that, I want to video tape again, during the evening on a clear night and compare the two.  I find it very difficult however, for anyone to come up with any explanation for the visual display of rapid-fire light activity (similar to a seventies psychedelic rock concert) in such a small airspace. I find it difficult to believe that FAA would allow planes to fly so close to the ground and/or allow the number of planes (as represented by the flashing lights) we saw in such close proximity to one another. To take this further, IF you view the tape in frame by fame mode, you can actually see the smaller objects moving from one point to another, at such a speed and in directions that defy what I, with no knowledge of physics, know as possible. It is difficult to see initially, but the parts are noted with my commentary (which I hope you will ignore!) about ""twinkle, twinkle little stars"" and then later, with ""they are like mosquitoes.""  There are frame views of the objects that show two round lights and also parts that show how the objects appear to be turning 360 degrees on an imaginary axis, then close up (like a clam) and move. On the frame by frame close ups, they look like a diamond shaped object. In one of the views , unless this is all my imagination or camera foolery, the object looks like it rotates, gets very dark on one side with a finite line showing a very dark underside and starts to collapse before heading to another location. Today I shot some more video of the area in daylight. Hopefully that may help in orientation of the landscape. Perhaps I am making more of this that what is actually there. But it is something I have never seen before. Also, I guess it could be tricks played by the camera and the way it films light? I have no idea. Would appreciate hearing what you think after viewing the copy of the tape.  Rather than emitting objects, which I did not see, I felt by movements that this was some type of exercise or manuevers and the object went back (not all) into another object? I know....CRAZY! End of Report ((NUFORC Note:  We received the lengthy video tape on 16AP01, and we have looked at it several times.  We agree with the witness that the lights ""strobe,"" and we agree that they move in the night sky.  However, although we cannot be certain yet, our suspicion is that she may have been video taping aircraft in the distance.  We will investigate a bit more, but the strobing patterns are not inconsistent with aircraft, or perhaps helicopters.  PD))",2001-04-28T00:00:00,37.1399,-77.2096

Marana was approx. 10 miles (35 north of Tucson).  As we got closer to Marana and allowing for my directional change of roadway we were made aware that it began moving (floating if you will)liesurely to the West and between Marana and the Tucson Mts. just west of I-10. As we approached the exit off I-10 into Marana (Greir Rd) I decided to exit to get a better view. We traveled west for 4 miles and met a dead end, exited our auto and watched it speeding up considerably and entered the distant cloud cover probably some fifty plus miles away.  The skies were cloudless over it's hover-location as well as Marana.  It's itinerary as I could discern that it traveled over the pencil of Tsn Mt's as they curved away from I-10 for about five miles.I wish to add that the confirmation of configuration is a typical saucer image with the dome over a concave/convex type body, exactly what has been drawn by others as well as the caricature craft we think of as being a 'flying saucer'.

possible explanation for strange sights around Nellis AFB 3/30/01,Pahrump,NV,2001-04-01T21:00:00,light,10 minutes,"Occurred : 4/1/2001 21:00  (Entered as : 04/01/01 21:00) Reported: 4/7/2001 21:28 Posted: 4/28/2001 Location: Pahrump, NV Shape: Light Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17182.html,"possible explanation for strange sights around Nellis AFB 3/30/01 This eeally doesn't qualify so much as a UFO report as a possible explanation for a report filed a couple of days ago by someone in las vegas. I used to live about 2 miles south of nellis AFB (foe about ten years) and saw large night maneuvers such as he described...with as many as thirty aircraft, and supporting aircraft such as refuelers, AWACS type aircraft, and cargo planes taking off at late evening hours and returning a short time later. Of course, some of these instances may be simply explained as one group of pilots leaving for their homes, and another group timed to arrive shortly thereafter. I have also witnessed the ""winking lights"" scenario described, though only once and it was here in the Pahrump valley, anout fifteen years ago. I saw a similar glowing ball of orangeish light, above the mountain range that sperates Pahrump valley from Death Valley area, it pulsed a total of three times that I witnessed, and in those pulses it appeared to travel some twenty or so miles northward . I saw NO chase airxraft as the other gentlrman described, and had two witnesses with me. I at first argued that it must have been a series of beacons on radio relay towers or something, but there are no towers along that range. No sound, ball was about the size of a pencil eraser on end at arms length. It would start as an amber dim glow, increasing in intensity over about five seconds, then flash out and reappear some five miles uprange. Whew! All of that said, I only have one more thought to add before I tell about my sighting. Because of the job Ihave, I have occasion to drive seventy miles at night five nights a week, and have noticed that lights can easily be seen thirty miles or so most of the time, and aircraft lights approaching MCCarran can be easily seen 50 miles away. You would never hear them, but you would see them, and a more inexperienced viewer might feel they are much closer, and therefor should make noise. Also, I have seen flares dropped by evading aircraft, and the orange lights are NOT at all the same, flares slowly fall to earth, start brightly and then dim. Now to my sighting. Its about 9 PM, I am in a hurry to get inside to watch something on TV, and as I walk westward to my door, I hear a low throb in the air. There is a small helicopter service that sometimes flys at night here, and the air-rescue helicopters from Vegas, each with their distinct sounds, and it was neither. Sometimes jets heading to MCCarran will throttle back over the Pahrump valley and the change in pitch as it bounces of the mountain ranges, and its strange, so I pause for a moment in the dark, scanning the clear night sky for any unusual movements. About thirty seconds later a pair of red flashing lights appear over the range of mountains directly to my Northwest, the foot of the range is two miles from my home, and I beleive that the lights were two of the black helicopters stationed out at Nellis, you can usually see them at the extreme North end of the airstrip if you drive LVBL North to the Speedway racetrack. Anyway, these are the two prop jobs, which fits with my recollection of the sounds from Nellis when I lived there. The two lights followed the ridge of the mountain Northwest and at one point flew below the ridgeline, obscuring them from view and masking their sound almost completely. Since the Nellis training grounds lie mainly NE of the Pahrump valley, I can only guess what they were doing flying along the NW range of PV, unless it had some thing to do with sneaking into the training area by flying low and entering from the west instead of the south or southeast, as much traffic does. Well, that is all I have to say, and I am not a debunker or anything, but I have lived near airbases since I was 8 years old. I'm 40 now, and worked nights for the last six years. The report from Las Vegas seems to be a description of night manuevers, with planes chasing the Agressor aircraft, and larger planes supplying intel to the pilots, whose jobs are much more dangerous at night in a dogfight situation. The flashes could be flares, and the excersise could probably be seen if it was held in the southern end of the Nellis range and the subject lived on the side of ""sunrise""(frenchman?) mountain, say near the intersection of Lake Mead and Hollywood, which affords an excellent view at night of Nellis AFB airstrip and views some forty miles northward. I would also guess that my helicopters were involved in a similar night action, perhaps practicing recovering a pilot downed at night. Sorry to go on so long, I just thought it would be fair to give a litlle explanation of the manuevers around Nellis AFB, since a lot of people would think military air traffic at night as strange, but at Nellis, its fairly commonplace! ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the contibutor's assessment of lights in the night sky.  They can be very difficult to identify positively.

While driving past exit 35 on 85 I noticed an extremely bright object over the tree line. It was like a pinprick of blueish white light. Just by the objects appearance I was able to decern it was not any type of conventional aircraft. If it was a passenger jet really far away, then its lights were way too bright, If it wasn't very far away then it had no discernable shape and it hovered motionless in the air. From what I saw I think it was pretty far away though. One noticable event that happened was that the light blurred for one moment then returned to its normal brightness. When I say blurred I don't mean it looked as if it was obscurred or anything like that. It sort of fizzled. The thought immeadiatly came to my mind that it seemed almost pixilated like a distortion on a crappy computer monitor.

It may be nothing more than a normal contrail that has taken on a ""buttermilk"" appearance, which often happens in a slightly turbulent atmosphere.  Also, the second photo does appear to show two amorphous ""blobs,"" that appear to be somewhat triangular in shape.  Our computer monitor does not allow us to identify them, however.  We doubt that an Aurora aircraft would fly in formation with another, although that is a guess.

I see about 30 spectators (including 3 security doormen) lookin' to the sky, claping and screaming in joy. I look up and see, what seems to be flying stars. I instantly know there not stars becuase the way they are moving.  There where lots (probably around a hundred all together).  I would see some moving as a group (like 5 or 6) ,but not in Unisen, all where traveling at there own speed and direction. they would fly in one direction then pause in one spot then dart off in the oppisite direction. They would fly up then down and zig zag across the sky. I seen some fly in real close to each other, pause next to each other, then dart of in different directions.  There was huge lights at this club that shot up in the sky (around 8 lights formed in a circle) that would go left to right, right to left.  When these lights went to the right hand side of the sky (where most of the UFO's where) the UFO's would get brighter and more active (almost like it was putting on a show for us). At one point about 8-10? UFO's joined in what seemed a sloppy circle in the sky, paused for a brief couple seconds, then they all darted off in there own direction. (kind of like a childs drawing of the sun. They took off like the lines around the circle).  I seen a few that seemed like they where goin so fast towards each other like they where goin to crash, but they went right by each other (real close). After about a half hour of seeing this, I went into the club and tried gettin all my friends to come out and see what I seen, there first reaction was that I was high or drunk and was seeing things, after getting up on the deck though they relized I wasn't seeing things.

Dear Sirs and To Whom It May Concern, Please indulge this report from a former Marine regarding what I believe to be the most astonishing visual sight you can imagine. On Sunday morning, January 20, 2001 at  0130 hours I made the following observation from my own backyard that borders the San Luis Rey Riverbed on the South side. This is directly South of Camp Pendleton. The river-bed is 10 feet from my backyard and goes West to East. I noticed an unusual aircraft coming East from the coastline, directly over the river-bed. At first I could not process what I was looking at. It continued toward me at approximately 25 mph and 300 feet above the ground.  This vehicle was illuminated occasionally by street lights and headlights of cars on the road nearby as it slowly headed past my back fence. Personal Visual Report Following: 1/26/01 by ((personal data deleted)). 24/7 Unknown Air Vehicle Identifiers By Sighting: This aircraft is approximately 50-60 feet in diameter and shaped exactly like a tall slice of pie.  It was of equal dimensions on all three sides and these sides were 15 feet high. There was no lighting, no visible ports or venting. The color was dark (amphibian) green with black splotches. THE FORWARD POINT OF THIS ""PIE"" WAS ALSO THE FORWARD-DIRECTED SECTION. This color scheme is nearly (if not) identical to a large tropical frog.  The backside was black-framed with black paneling and exuded no light or visible exhaust whatsoever. The underside of this aircraft was flat (as were all the sides) and had two large white pods (looked like tap lights you see on TV) and each was 10-12 feet in diameter. They were located where you might expect landing gear to be placed. This aircraft rumbled as it went by in a very hushed tone. It sounded like a jet engine encased in a steel room with no porting or exhaust sounds. The ground slightly shook. Perhaps it sounded like a reactor core, utterly encased, strong with no venting.  This vehicle floated at 25 mph over my house and was in my plain sight for over 30 seconds. I got a very good look at it. It made no effort to conceal itself except by color and no use of lighting. The 25mph speed was constant and level at 300 feet as this aircraft followed the San Luis Rey River-bed East and beyond my sight. I also want to tell you that I have been observing the skies over Camp Pendleton since last Sunday. There are several  things I have seen that defy explanation and current (public-known) technology.  I have seen white dots evade your helicopters and also follow your helicopters very closely.  These white dots seem to duck-and-cover when an aircraft is coming toward them. They seem quite bold and brazen when the aircraft is heading away and has no visual view behind them. I have seen these white dots follow your helicopters very closely. It appears to be a game of hide and seek. The more helicopters you have in the air at once, like January 24th at 2100 hours, the more visible this activity is. Your flights seem to stir these white dots up and cause them to ""blow cover"" and start evading. I strongly recommend the following operation to document this nocturnal activity over and near Camp Pendleton. Recommendations for Video-Recording UFO Events: 1)  Have an Audio-Visual platoon set-up an Observation (OP) station on very high ground with a 360 degree view. They must be in a location that is very dark with no street or vehicle lights to diminish human night-vision.. Use telescopic and panoramic lens on digital video recorders using strong and stable tripods. 2) Have these video-crews scan the skies for one week, all night. Have them take visual note of civil aircraft. Have them follow the civil aircraft through the sky with the video lens. Have them watch with their finger on the RECORD button the entire time.  Watch for lights moving ahead of these aircraft or behind them in close proximity. 3) Notice lights in the sky that appear stationary or cosmic. Some of these lights will move away suddenly and very fast if an aircraft comes between them and the ground. These white dots sometimes leave trails of light when they move abruptly.  These white lights tend to flash at times or go entirely blacked-out at other times.  The movement can be from one quadrant of the sky to another in mere seconds. If you can arrange this kind of video-observation operation, or I should say, If you choose to do this, you will eventually get good video tape of UFO aircraft activity right over our heads. What I have seem so far defies explanation. Your own video-tape can then be analyzed by your experts. I am available for polygraph or Sworn Affidavit if so requested.

At first sight, I thought maybe it was an airplane but upon further examination it clearly wasn't an airplane.  I think my first words where ""what kind of airplane is that?"" or ""what the heck is that?"" as I pointed the object out to my cousin. The object appeared burnt-orange or amber in color.  There were no distinguisable lights or strobes on this object as you would see on an airplane or helicopter.  The whole object appeared to be dimly illuminated and slightly shimmering or hazy.  Although the object seemed fairly close, the manner in which this object was illumination made it very difficult to determine exactly what shape it was.  I would have to identify it as triangular shaped and it appeared to have a flat bottom surface. When we first saw the object it was just slightly in front of us and traveling away from us in an east, northeast direction.  At one point, as the object was moving away, i thought the back of the object seemed to have the shape of a boomerang with the ends pointing down.  The object was traveling in a very smooth, fluid-like motion and was completely silent.  It was also traveling deceptively fast too.  Upon first sight the object was roughly the size of the finger nail on my pinky finger held at arms length but in about 5 seconds it had traveled far enough to appear as a mere point of light.  As we were both watching this thing in disbelief and trying to figure out what it was it instantly shifted directions and was heading north for about 1 second the shifted directions again and was heading east for about 1 more second until it vanished from sight.  I have never seen any plane or helicopter on television or in real life that could change directions so rapidly.  We were both completely awestruck by what we witnessed that night and I have been thinking about it o! n a dail y basis ever since.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,32.91864702380953,-96.55677202380953

I got in my car and drove to the beach to investigate (about two minutes away) and got out of my car and walked down on the beach.  The light was orangish and very bright.  I thought it was a planet at first(as bright as Jupiter) but Jupiter was straight up above me, along with another minor planet.  Watching the light, I noticed it was moving in a northerly direction very slowly over the ocean, and in the meantime descending gradually.  At that moment I assumed it was a plane coming in to land at the airport here, but it never approached the airport. I then drove north along Pebble Beach Drive to another pullout where I sat awhile, and to my astonishment the object began to move up and down and began to slightly accelerate at certain moments (the object was still very far in the distance) and then it would slow again.  At this instant I just knew it wasn't a plane.  The light then began to appear brighter, and then fade again, where it faded altogether and didn't reappear. I drove down to the end of the road to Point St. George to see if it had appeared again, but the sky was pitch black and there was no light to be seen.

There was no engine noise at all - It was silent. There were 4 red lights in a diamond shape. They went on and off about once a second, not flashing but fading smoothly up and down. It travelled south east passing overhead, but not directly over. When it was over our area the size was similar to a large commercial aircraft a few miles from an airport coming in to land. There were no red and green port & starboard lights nor any flashing white lights, only the 4 red ones. The speed was much faster than a commercial jet. Within 30 seconds it had travelled in to the distance and I lost sight of it. There were patches of cloud but otherwise the sky was very clear and the stars were all clearly visible.

I have never seen one before only read about them on different sites.  However, the object I saw was lower than most aircraft in the area and was shooting across the sky at a very rapid rate, much faster than the aircraft here.  The object was round, the bottom looked like a reddish gold color, no lights and no sound.  I ran downstairs, from my apartment, went to the parking lot, not 3 to 4 seconds later and the object was gone.  I've had many mixed feelings until now.  Now I have become a believer.

My guess (very hard to estimate something you see briefly in the dark) was that it was a metallic (dark metal...like stealth material) triangular object maybe the size of a helicopter or small plane. It glided quickly and silently (no noise AT ALL) about 500 feet (??) above the buildings in a south direction. I could see the bottom of it enough to make out something like landing gear or lights or something on the bottom, but it was dark. There were no lights at all. The only reason I saw it at all was because I happened to be looking at the sky in the middle of a city and well-lit apartment complex by a major street. I could make out the shape and bottom of the object because of the city lights just bright enough to allow me to see something...although just barely. I could easily have missed a dark object floating across a dark cloudy sky!

The object intentionally stopped near the moon for what seemed like a ""look"".  After two minutes, another light paralell to the other appeared.

There was no sound or sonic blast, so we assume it was traveling slower than the speed of sound.  Since it did not pass through any clouds, we assumed that it was below them, perhaps a few thousand feet above us.  It had no lights, although it changed colors from red to lavender to silver as it streaked across the sky.  It appeared like the sunset was reflecting off of it, but sun had set around 19:00.  There was no visible exhaust, flames, or vapor trail.  We first observed it almost directly overhead.  It was moving in a WWN (290 degrees) direction.  It was only visible for a few seconds, since it was traveling at a high rate of speed; much faster than a commercial airline.  Its relative size would be equivalent to looking at an object the size of a dime held at arms length over ones head.

Tøgersen says several more people have come forward after news reports carried the account of three people in the town of Mosjøen who dove for cover when they saw a low-flying, whirling object hurtle through the night skies On September 23.  ""We also have several other witness observations of the same phenomenon in the same time frame on Sunday,"" Tøgersen said.  Other people have reported sightings of additional UFOs that apparently resemble small, brightly lit balls.  While the larger object over Mosjøen emitted no noise whatsoever, Tøgersen says the smaller objects are reported to have made a hissing sound.  But the most remarkable reports came from the northern city of Bodø.  There, a woman went out of her house and a flying object landed on her lawn, stoo! d there awhile, and then lifted off and flew away.  Two other separate individuals reported the same sighting, at the same time, on Saturday evening.  One of the two was driving his car when he spotted it flying over Vefsnfjorden, while another saw it while out on a veranda.  Both reported that it was brightly lit.

It passed the tip of the crescent moon travelling west to east and was as tall as about 1/8 to 1/6 of the moon's diameter. The moon was surrounded by a halo that was about three times the moon's diameter, and the object was silhouetted by the moon and surrounding halo, giving me about 5 - 7 seconds to watch it. It was moving faster than a jet would appear to move at high altitude, but perhaps as fast as a jet appears to move at a lower altitude. Since it was silhouetted by the moon's halo, it must have been travelling below the high level cloud that created the halo. It may well have been an aircraft, especially since aircraft regularly travel east and west in this portion of the sky, but I was struck by the apparent lack of a fuselage. As soon as I saw it, I ran to the window and cupped my hands against the glass to block out any extraneous light and watched the sky for signs that it might have been an aircraft.

Just another group of stars in the sky. I started to try to put together other constelations when I noticed a light in the sky. At first I thought it was just another star though I'd never noticed it before. I started to ignor it when I saw it was moving, thinking it was a plane, but realized it couldn't be. It moved oddly, to fast to be a plane and it was too bright, small, and it wasn't actually going anywhere. It continued to pretty well hover just below and to the left of Orion's Belt. I noticed it was making small swirling movements only to stop, not moving at all, then doing it again. I ran to my friend's house and dragged him outside. He noticed it was moving as well and ran back in to get another of our friends. We continued to watch it for another few minutes as it moved slightly, maybe an inch in the sky, though it covered that inch quickly. I'm not good at math but given the distance...I don't know. Planes just don't move like that, not in so many directions so quickly. We debated whether it really was moving or if we were all just seeing what we wanted to see. We decided to sit for a moment and watch. It did indeed move though only two of us could see it clearly. My other friend had just taken out his contacts so he couldn't say if it was moving or not. We did take a picture though we haven't yet decided if we are going to send it anywhere yet. I ran home to get a pair of binoculars but couldn't find any that allowed us to see it any better. After a while we gave up trying to see what it was and went back inside. When I left the house most of the stars were gone because it looks like a storm is rolling in. That was around 1 Am. I can't say anymore because my friends and I wish to remain anonomous. The only reason I'm sending this is because I have never seen anything like that in 12 years of traveling the United States, on vaction, or anywhere else. Nothing can cover such a distance in the sky like that and not be some kind of air ship or spacecraft. Whatever it was it seemed small, and fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness chooses to remain anonymous.

I suddenly spotted an orange ball, appearing to 'drift' above me, at about the height that a helicopter normally flies.  I say this because I live near the airport and am very familiar with the 'flight paths' and aircraft in the area. I was, of course, excited and curious; and commented to my friend that it looked like a ""hot air balloon that's on fire""! As I continued to focus in, I noticed that the 'intensity' of the orange color frequently changed from near amber to dark orange.  In addition, I could see 'spots' or areas of red that came and went.  The object had no clear 'definition' or 'silouhette', just roundish and glowing/burning.  I would guess the size of it to be about the same as a hot air balloon.  It slowly drifted north, then suddenly became much smaller.  At first I thought it diminished in size, as if 'burning out', but then realized it was much closer to the horizon...and MUCH further away...that it must have traveled a large distance in a moment's time.

Then I watched to see if they were going to fall like flares do but they didn't. They slowly ascended up at an angle like planes do on take off. I then said oh shit and told my homeboys look at this shit. Then we all jumped out the truck to get a better look. I noticed that the two lights were independent of each other because of the irregular patterns that they were doing. They were definately flying with each other though. They made no noise at all. Sky was very clear. It seems like they got to a certain point in the sky and kind of stood there hovering. It seems that one of them was kind of bouncing and doing some out the ordinary movements. By this time, we were causing so much commotion that a couple of employess took notice. I remember two gentlemen sitting in a truck in front of Whater Burger as well watching this. Then they got smaller and eventually faded. They definately were not airplanes or helicopters because they didnt have the usual lights that those craft would have. There's no airport in that area in which it seems they arose from. Just neighborhoods.

I was out on my usual walk with the dog (again) and I caught site of it out of the corner of my eye as it passed overhead. I was walking east (again) about 15 minutes into my walk when I spotted it. The object was passing over me (to the south slightly) on my right at what I thought was a low altitude maybe 1000 to 2500 feet. It was a reddish object, disc in shape. It passed over at a high rate of speed without noise. The dull reddish glow was at a low level until after it had gained a lot of altitude. At this point the glow became very bright like a light emitting diode red. It's path was to the east for about 5 seconds and then swooping vertical (circular shape became very noticeable) and the streaking off to the south in a split second. I saw whatever it was for only about 20 to 30 seconds before it disappeared. It was very clear and cold last night, the visibility was fabulous... stars all around and no clouds.

Puyallup. She called to me because she seen it first. She asked what is that? Upon looking I tried to reason that it might be a balloon or fire works. My brain raced with reasonable answers but none fit the M.O. I quickly ran and grabbed my camera. Four or five shots where taken but I am not sure if they will turn out, the F stop was off and I could not hold the camera still. On the last one I braced myself against a pole to hold steady. Maybe that one will turn out. The sky was black, except for the orange glow of this object bouncing and moving erratically around the sky. It would move slow and stead in one direction, then suddenly move quickly about the night sky. It seemed to have no apparent direction in mind. As it moved south we jumped into the truck to follow and see it. We parked on 10th Ave in Milton and watched it moving to the south and east. It seemed to me to be over the Puyallup area at this time. The orange glow coming from below the object was bright, but would at times glow brighter then fade some. It seemed to get pretty far away from our position, maybe eight to ten miles, then it started moving back toward and to the west of where we were. At or about it's closes point to us at this time the orange glow faltered then grew stronger. As it grew stronger it instantaneously  released a shower of sparks, almost resembling a fire work being shot from the sky toward the ground. This happened twice very quickly. Both pulses of fire could be seen hailing down toward the earth at the same time. There also was a slight audible release when these showers erupted from the object. It sounded like a very soft pop, kind of like popping a finger out of the corner of one's mouth very quietly. We decided to drive toward the Fife Valley for a better look and to be in a position that we could travel in the direction of the object's flight path. We turned the corner and parked when the object started to move about very rapidly. It made a quick move to the west, so fast that it was almost as if you blinked and it had moved a quarter mile already. Then we rushed to get to the valley where we could see the whole sky. It was less then two city blocks to the valley. I told her as she started to drive, ""It's gone."" She said, ""No way.""  I then told her I had seen it disappear into the southern sky in an instant. We drove down the hill to the valley and seen nothing. We were back at the apartment at 12:11 am. The object looked like an inverted cylinder with an orange glow coming from the bottom of the it. I wonder if anyone else seen this!?!? ((NUFORC Note:  Illustration provided by witness.  PD))",2002-02-22T00:00:00,38.4442,-82.1337

The first time I saw this object was in either 1998 or 1999. My boyfriend and I were sitting in a porch swing in front of my house after midnight when I noticed this amber-colored light a few miles away. It was rising vertically in the sky. But what caught my eye the most was that the light was pulsating. It was fading in and out. It was very high in the sky when it became so bright that it looked as if it were going to burst. It then dropped something that looked like shiny gold-colored stuff that sparkled as it fell down. The light then dimmed down until it vanished. Soon after, 2 planes flew over in its direction. My mother later told me that she had also witnessed the light the same night.The second time, I witnessed the same exact thing, in the same exact spot, a few months later by myself. The third time, around March 15th, 2002,my boyfriend and I were driving when we saw the amber light again. This time it was moving above us and only about 5,000 ft in the sky,  probably closer. I stopped my truck and we got out to watch it. There was so much glow around it that I could not make out a shape of the object, let alone,see what it was made out of, and there wasn't any sound coming from it.When the the light stopped quite a few miles away,  again, it became very bright and dropped the same stuff that we saw before. Then the light just disappeared.And again,planes flew over to the area that the object was last in. The last time we saw this object it was around 1:30 in the morning today, April 1st (yeah, just what you need, a sighting on April Fools Day). I met my boyfriend at the track at the high school to go jogging after work. We were walking along when I spotted the amber light. It was moving very slowly and doing the same pulsating stuff. This time, when it became VERY bright, it looked as if it produced a red ""flare"" and then dropped it. The red flare-like thing seemed to burn out before it hit the ground. It repeated this once more before it disappeared. I didn't notice any other aircraft flying to the area this time. I really wish I could find out what this is. My boyfriend thinks its a military helicopter test. This would have convinced me if the object would have made some sound when we witnessed it up close. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports of amber lights over Arizona.  Some of them may be military flares, but follow-up investigation is the only way to distinguish flares from bona fide UFO's.  PD))",2002-04-08T00:00:00,34.506735795454546,-114.29056420454545

I was not home at the time, as I was away on a family, medical emergency, followed by a funeral.  When my husband joined me on the day of the funeral, he told me of this incredible sighting, and believes it could have been a UFO.  He is not absolutely sure that it was a UFO, but he has never seen anything like it before.  Also, he isn't particularly interested in UFO's, but he knows enough on the subject, through me, to realize that what he was seeing would definitely fit the description of similar sightings. We live on a flight path to Pearson, International Airport outside of Toronto, so we are used to the sounds and sights of planes, including flashing lights, their shapes, and sounds, etc.  However, what he saw was completely unfamiliar.  He was just opening the bedroom window, before going to bed.  The window winds outwards, and faces north-east, and as he glanced to the north,  4 very, bright lights caught his eye, as they must have just passed through our property, heading northwards.  He said the object was completely silent.  We live in the country, so we know the sound of silence, and are aware of the times when it is disrupted even slightly. He described the object as appearing to be one, long completely flat, and rectangular craft (from the angle he was seeing it..retreating).  The lights were flashing or blinking in a pattern, as opposed to being like beams or spotlights, and they were very, bright white.  The object appeared to be descending in a manner that he described with the motion of his hands, (difficult to translate to this page) and it was as though it was descending in steps, as opposed to a smooth transition.  It quickly, and completely disappeared from his view, as it dropped beyond the horizon, just beyond the tiny, hamlet of Mono Centre, located approximately 1/2 kilometer north of our house.  Also, there is a large, Provincial park, just beyond Mono Centre, where the object appeared to descend.  He described its' movements as quick and completely silent.  He was literally stunned, and knew how disappointed I would be that I wasn't there to share the experience.  I don't know if this is relevant but there is an Canadian, armed forces base, north of here...Camp Borden. Our approximate, geographical location is North/West of Toronto, Ontario - 1 hr.& 15-30 minute drive (75 km).  We are on apaved road that runs between Airport Rd. & Highway #10 (Hurontario St.) about 15 minutes (18 km) north of Highway #9 and 15 minutes (18 km) south of Highway #89 and approximately 15 minutes (18 km) north/east from Orangeville, Ontario.

I watched it's straight line path until it was out of sight . I then turned around to view west again and I saw a bright star-like object, traveling from west to east . It was to my north and as bright as Saturn. It was not an airplane. It had no flashing lights.  It appeared lower and larger than the satellite I had just seen, but higher than the hazy cloud patterns present. I was so amazed at this object and was semi- scared by it's appearance. Suddenly there was another object right behind the first. As if they were flying in formation. Both objects were on the same course and speed. The first object was brighter than the second and I watched   them disappear in the eastern sky. I have been in the military during Viet Nam and spent my entire life around airplanes.

I watched it, until it vanished overhead. (no cloulds near) After straining to see where it might have gone, a small red flash appeared. I'm thinking to myself now and wondering just what is going on...I radioed down to my work partner, to get upstairs and see the show that was going on. He arrived in two minutes and I explained my observations. He also has seen these on occasion and the couple he has observed didn't always move in a straight line but eratic patterns. We both began watching now and within two minutes I noticed another bright satellite object moving towards us from the west. I pointed it out to him and he caught sight of it, also. Then this object faded from a very bright light to nothing, r! ight abo ve us. Within less than an a hour, 12 objects were seen until cloud cover and the brightening sunrise took over.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,44.95305527415144,-93.11475467362925

There were four in a sort of formation. There were also two or more off to the right and two to the left. The lights were so far off at first I thought I must be seeing stars even though it was the middle of the day. I watched very carefully and at times it was hard to see them. I actually stopped a lady walking down the street and asked her to look up. She described exactly what I was looking at without me describing it first. She said two of the lights were red. I only recall seeing one red. She also said she saw movement. I am positive I saw movement because the formation I saw changed shape. Not rapidly and not all four lights at once. There was a gradual but distinct and unmistakable shift over the course of ten minutes. I am postive of what I saw. These lights were suspended extremely high in the sky. There was a gradual controlled movement, and after approxamately ten minutes the lights dissapeared from my vision. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means July 23, not July 24.

My roommate, my coworker, and myself were all of sound mind at the time, getting ready to have a few beers but hadn't quite taken that initiative yet; all three of us work for the same company, a timeshare and travel agency in the Daytona Beach area, and none of us have ever made a claim or filed anything like this before.  My roommate was out on the landing, looking into the early evening sky when I heard him exclaim, ""What the hell is that?""  I raced outside, thinking maybe he'd seen an accident of something, but he was looking up at a bright light in the sky.  Jupiter had recently been overhead, just one or two nights ago, so at first I thought it might by Jupiter or other planet, but it moved.  We were facing east at the time; the object was over the ocean, and at great altitude.  He said that it seemed to be made of one light surrounded by smaller ones, but I was unable (at first) to make out those details with my glasses.  He ran inside to grab his binoculars; our coworker came out to see what we were making a big fuss about, and when she saw the object she also said that it looked like multiple lights.  I grabbed the binoculars from my roommate and ran downstairs into the darkest area I could find in order to avoid any ground light.  When I zoomed in I could see that it definitely looked like one bright light surrounded by smaller lights.  However, the ""shape"" was not constant; at one point it appeared to be a single light, then a bright light surrounded by four lights, then two lights, then as much as a dozen lights.  In addition to the changing shapes, the object's colors were cycling, from blue to white to yellow to red, although I wasn't so observant that I was catching a pattern.  Anyway, our neighbors started coming out, and we showed them where to look, passed the binoculars around; we wanted as many people to witness this as possible.  We live not too far from the Daytona Beach airport, and as pl! anes, an d even a helicopter, passed overhead, we could tell just from the object's altitude that it wasn't a plane, at least not one that was coming to or leaving from the Daytona Airport.  Also, its pattern of movement was unlike anything any of us had ever seen.  Though it seemed like it was climbing in altitude, it was moving north, then south, in a snake-like pattern, and at several times it seemed to have dropped in altitude.  We asked around for a camera, but it seemed like nobody had a camera, or they weren't willing to take pictures, although I saw one of my downstairs neighbors taking snapshots. We phoned the local authorities, but they ignored the report.  We called the local newspaper, who told us to call the local authorities; no help there either.  I even tried to find a local number for MUFON, to no avail. After about 2 hours, however, the object moved out of our field of vision, and we left it at that, with no explanation and nobody taking us seriously. ((NUFORC Note:  If, in fact, the object did move abruptly, it could not have been a celestial body.  However, we believe that the first possibility to be eliminated is the star, Sirius, in the southern sky.  It can be very bright, and it gives off a very brilliant chromatic display, as described in this report.  PD))",2002-01-29T00:00:00,29.191653301886795,-81.03306603773584

On the evening of Jan. 11, 2002 around 8:30 p.m. and again on January 12, 2002 around 9:00 p.m. diamond shaped objects were observed in the sky over the Pacific Ocean just off the coast of Santa Barbara. On Friday night, I noticed what I first thought was a very bright star from the window of the second floor of my home. I went downstairs and outside for a better look. It was too bright to be a star and it had the shape of a diamond with a blueish color and it seem to be flickering. I waited to see if it was an airplane or helicopter. I waited. It was not. After about 5 minutes I went inside to my office and got a pair of binoculars and was followed outside by two other persons, who witnessed this object. What appeared diamond shaped to my eyes was actually(looking through the binoculars) something very large and round. It was spinning in a vertically. Colors of bright unique shades of some light red, blue and greenish yellow could be clearly seen. The colors were in circles and spinning in alternating directions. The blue color was pulsating and their was white like sparks all around the edges (like electricity popping out of a broken line). At one point a beam of wide white laser like light went from this object towards the mountains. This made us nervous and concerned. We remained outside for another 5 minutes and it remained in the same position. Everyone went in and I called the airport tower but they had a recorded message that sounded like it was for piolets. During the next evening my 31 year old daughter was visiting about 9 p.m. I told her about the previous evening and what we experienced. She said it was on the news because several people had called. The news said it was space debris from a satellite that probably broke up. I told her it was to low, it would have fallen or something. It was visible for at least 20 plus minutes. I took her outside to point out where it was when we noticed three of the objects. One over the Pacific and two almost overhead. There was plenty of space between them. One was almost in the same place it was the previous evening. She used the binoculars  and we were joined by three others who also looked at them and reported seeing what I stated above except that one of the objects had a something like a tail extending from it, that looked like a long streak of electricity. We remained outside for about 15 minutes and during that time all objects remained stationary. Around 10 p.m., I looked again and they were no longer visible. No noise. No movement except for within the objects themselves. This was a very concerning sighting. The laser beam triggered thoughts of some sort of high tech a terrorist controlled satellite. Because it remained undisturbed and returned as three the next night, I assume this is some sort of government project.

Like it was lost. After the 325 degree turn it was traveling East and continues for the next 2 minutes the it slowly turns a little bit and heads North East. My eyes where focused so much on this object that I missed my exit not one offramp but two. After realizing I was about 5 miles from my missed exit I immediately got off because at this point the object was to faint to see anymore. When I first saw the lights on this object it approximately was about 2-3 miles, I could see the objects shape or form, But the amount of lights that where horizontal on the object from my distance seemed like a wingspan of a jumbo 747 jet. I also noticed alot of other flying objects around the sky which looked like planes and helicopters all aroung the Inland Empire as if they where sent to observe the object.

We were travelling north on Macadam Boulevard right near the industrial area on the west bank of the willamette river when I looked up and noticed two rainbows that broke off mid way up in the sky as above them loomed a thick cloud formation that covered most of the eastern sky. While examining the rainbows my girlfriend (who was driving at the moment) noticed little lights which were floating either in front of or within the cloud formation. The lights, looked EXACTLY like stars but it was 4:10pm in the afternoon and they appeared to be in front of the clouds. There were 6-10 lights all hovering and moving both in formation and separately (I definitely counted 6 I could see at one given time while my girlfriend claimed to see as many as 10 at one given time). These were not like any planes I have ever seen as they remained stationary and were able to move back and forth in relation to one another with surprising speed and no need for turning radii. One moved in the northern direction, then stopped on a dime, hovered for a while and then returned in the direction it originally came from. They moved quite quickly and seemed quite agile.  The group of lights occupied no more than 35 degrees of the sky  horizontally and all appeared around the same altitude (guesstimate of 200-300 feet high) Neither one of us could tell the size or distance of the lights as they appeared as little more than pin pricks of light but we both agreed that they appeared to be somewhat close and the way they moved only heightened that sensation. If I had to guess I would say they were no more than 2-3 football fields away. This is my first UFO experience and I hope other people were looking in the direction of the rainbows and can back up our story. Did anybody else see this?

I ducked but they had passed over some trees and I yelled to my daughter to look to the left, as the ""object"" came through a clearing.  Whatever it was, it had seemingly transformed from two closely-spaced but possibly separate black Vs (almost like birds flying closely together) into one slightly tilted black line with 4 distinct, shallow Vs connected to a straight black line making up what appeared to be a wing configuration (no fuselage seen, i.e. it appeared to be a horizontal line while flying away from us).  It was flying at tremendous speed -- much faster than any small aircraft would.  During the lapse of 1 or 2 seconds between my first seeing it out the windshield to seeing in a different shape (different perspective?) from my driver's side window, it was by then probably about a half mile away and flying at no more than a mile in altitude, yet still about a full inch from side to side at arm's length.  Therefore, it was good-sized, yet did not appear to be any kind of typical aircraft -- and not two very fast-flying birds which was what my split-second initial view of it had reminded me of.

It was a bright red circular or possibly disc shaped craft, with what appeared to be a smaller red light that seemed to revolve around the center of it (it almost appeared seperate from the larger shape at times).

I then called the Bend Police Department's 911 line and reported it, and asked if they had any other reports of it, they said they did. My roommate then came home, and I had him look at it also.

I was reviewing the recent reports on your site as I do every couple of weeks to see what is being supposedly seen. I just noted the sighting reported from Bend, Oregon and I need to chime in that I saw that and took two photos, yet to be developed. I was at the Pilot Butte Oregon State Park, which is a large conical volcanic cinder butte which has a road to the top and there were probably ten or twelve other folks up there then at the viewpoint overlooking Bend and vicinity..  My wife works at the nearby ((deleted)) and I had about 15 minutes to wait till I picked her up as she got off at 5P.M..  The place has a great view down to the city of Bend and you can also look over to the Three Sisters Mountains to the west about 25 miles. I had been watching the sunset going down over Mt. Bachelor south of the Three Sisters. There was a high thin cloud layer above the 10,000 foot summits of those mountains, and over Bend.. After a few minutes of watching the sunset I took a few minutes to walk over to the east side to look down on the side where I could see the building  below where my wife worked. The sunset was creating a great shadow of the Pilot Butte Cone which was stretching some length of miles across the flat land to the east of town. By chance I had my camera in my car and I took a photo of the long conical shadow, but because it was dimming light I thought to myself that the photo probably would'nt come out with much contrast or detail. As I walked back to my car on the west side of the overlook parking area I spotted this silver circle slowly rising to the west of Bend. I was looking down at it at first and it appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground already, but below my vantage point.  It looked like it might have risen from the forest area just west of the city limits.  My impression of it was that it was probably a large balloon, perhaps the size of a car, and probably three or four miles distant. My second impression was, is that a UFO? It deffinately appeared round and silver, but I did not see any lights or anything else of distinction on it. There was enough light left in the evening sky to see it pretty well and know that it was not a plane, copter, ultra light, hot air balloon or blimp. It was going very slowly up and drifting slightly north and east and coming for a time closer to my location as it ascended.. I felt this to be consistant with the light wind direction. I had seen a weather balloon launched just a few days before at the Salem, Oregon airport and it rose at a similar pace.  However it did not have that kinda inverted teardrop shape nor the hanging attachment of instruments like a weather balloon does. In that I had intended to photograph the great setting sun silhouette of the mountains, I went ahead and took two photos then with the circular object pretty much centered in the frame, just in case it was really a UFO..  By then the object had risen to about eye level and was above the tops of the distant mountains from my vantage point. I have not developed that roll of film yet, and at best it would probably appear no bigger on the print than this period>. unless enlarged. If it is helpful, I! can pro vide a copy of those photos when developed. Had I observed any thing more out of the ordinary, like unusual maneuvers, I would have rushed that unfinished roll of film to the developer. I noticed several of the other folks at the top of the Butte looking at the object but nobody appeared too excited so I just presumed it to be a balloon and that they probably did too. In that it was time for me to go and pick up my wife by then,I drove on down the spiraling road from the top. Several minutes had elapsed and the object kept slowly floating up toward the high clouds. I lost sight of it as I spiraled down the road, and when I could'nt spot it any longer I presumed it to have disappeared into the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Time indicated is approximate.  It is an estimate of when sunset would occur in that part of Oregon.  We spoke with the witness, and find him to be quite credible.  He holds a responsible job.

At about 6:20 am MST on Sunday, November 12th,  I was going outside to Get my paper, when and saw it wasn't there yet so I turned to go back inside and saw a light about the size of a big star moving towards me from the  South West.  The first thing I noticed was that it was moving fast and smoothly. I thought UFO? Then I thought  no, Airforce jet. Then I realized it was moving too fast,  and had an odd floating sense about it. I continued to watch and it wavered a litle twice which tipped me off that wasn't a conventional craft.  It started at about twenty degrees off the horizon and kept coming towards me and slightly curving. It started out about the size of a big star and was the size of high altitude aircraft light. It was either very high and moving VERY fast, or very low and EXTREMELY small. There was absolutely no noise,  It was just after dawn and the full moon was low to the W. Northwest so there was plenty of light to see if there any conventional stucture. There was none.  The light was white and there were no other colored lights to indicate any kind of coventional craft.   It continued to move overhead and to the Northeast until it was out of site. The whole thing too k 3-4 minutes and it moved faster than any plane at a high altitude, even the airforce jets of which I am familiar with.  I have spent most of my 37 years in phoenix and have been watching the Phoenix skies since I was a kid, but very consistantly for the past 16 years. I spent  I am very familiar with the air traffic in the area. I spent ten of those years outside at night almost every night for 5-8 hours because of insomnia, and because as an actor and artist I have a very hard time winding down after  work. For the past 2 years I have been riding my bike at night for 1-4 hours.  I have seen many UFO's in the past four years in the valley. It has become almost common place. I tried to report one to you several years ago but was followed by what I realized was a man in black, and had someone come into my back yard one night! and was just a couple of feet from my open screened window.  I thought I woud try the website this time.  I have better than 20-20 vision, and excellent night vision which I didn't need this time because there was plenty of light.

However, this is what happened. I was coming back from the computer lab at UMO and noticed a light over the trees as I passed in front of the gym.  Anyway it struck me as odd and I pulled into the parking lot on the ball fields side and looked at it. I realized that it was on my way home about over by the dairy farm.  So, I got back in my car and went like I was going to the dairy farm and while on the way I could occassionally see the glow of the light ( bright white ). As I got closer I saw the source of the light was hovering over the edge of the field.  As I turned into the road that went to the farm I almost immediately pulled over and stopped and got out of the car.  I looked at the clock and it was nearly 8 pm. I looked up at the craft and some things that struck me were the following: it sat as still as if it were on a stand somewhere between 300-1000 feet in the air.  It did not appear to be that big (about the size of a small school bus but wider. ) It appeared to be pretty flat and shaped like a shortened home plate (more delta shaped than rectangular). As I stood there I could no longer see the source of the light because I was a little under it and behind it (the light source on the object) .  I could see the glow of it though.  The next thing that struck me was the sound it made.  It was very quiet but it sounded kind of like a jet engine with the volume turned way down.  No other lights or sound was evident.  The night was still as could be. I watched it for perhaps 5 minutes and at that point it headed towards Route 2 going to Bangor.  As it got close to Brewer I lost site of it because the road was under construction and I could not get into town quick enough to get across the bridge. It never went very fast.  It was still for at least 10 minutes in the beginning and then I followed it for another 5-7 minutes as it followed the river.",2001-08-20T00:00:00,44.94808653846154,-68.67745384615385

It appeared to be moving very slowly in a north to south direction amongst the stars, and it gave me the impression that it was many thousands of miles away.  It moved straight and steadily, and I would estimate the pulsations to be about one per second, with the brightness peaks about twice the magnitude of the lulls.

On the evening of March 12, 1997, I went to visit a friend and former neighbor of mine from ODU college. He lived in a one story ranch at the end of Rogers Avenue, in the Glenwood Park section of Norfolk, VA. Glenwood Park is a small rectangular shaped residential neighborhood, approximately 5 blocks by 5 blocks situated inside a residential section of the Norfolk Naval Base. A street level maps shows quite clearly that this neighborhood is surrounded on all sides by what is collectively referred to as the ""Norfolk Naval Base"" or just NAB by locals. IN clockwise direction, to the South of Glenwood Park is all Navy Housing, to the west is the Norfolk International Terminals, to the North is Norfolk Naval Air Station, one of whose major runs parrallel and just to the north east of Glenwood park about a 2,000 yds away. Also just north east of Glenwood is the home of the US Atlantic Fleet, complete with ballastic and attack submarines, Arleigh Burke class destroyers, and usually a few Aircraft carriers and their support craft. To say that the area I was in was a ""military area"" is an understatement, for the Hampton Roads Area has over 250,000 active duty personel, which makes this area, in effect, collectively, the largest military base in the country. (USA) At any rate, at approximatley 9pm EST, while flipping through the basletball games of the ""March Madeness"" basketball season, in which ODU was playing a major game, my friend (Tommy) not his real name, told me his father who lived next door, was having some plumbing problems. I was a plumber at the time for national plumbing company, and told him that I could help his dad out. I didn't have any buiness cards in my wallet so I walked outside to my service truck which was parked nearby, to get some cards. I dug through my messy paperwork and finally found a few cards and began walking back to my friends house along a 30 foot long path towards a small 3 step concrete porch before entering his door. As I walked along the path, towards my right hand- upper right about 45 degrees from the horizon level, I could see the constellation of Orion with its three stars, AL nitak, Al mintak, and Al- whatever it called, shining very brightly. I could not see the moon, (it was close to a New Moon) the temperature was probably about 40 degrees F and the sky was crystal clear with no clouds visible. Humidity was normal to below normal, and the air was crisp. As I walked The Path, I noticed that ""something"" was catching my eye and I felt distracted by something. I kept walking, and as I walked I glanced up again at Orion's Belt. My attention was drawn to the area in between the first star on the left of Orion's Belt and the star Sirius which is directly to the east of it. I'm not sure why I looked up there...but my my peripheral vision was catching something moving and I strained to see something, but I didn't know what... So I kept walking up the path and by the time I got to the first step of the porch I looked up again briefly at Orion's Belt and noticed something odd. As I began to walk up the three steps of the Porch, I kept my eyes fixed on Orion's Belt. Something had passed in front of the left star of Orion's Belt blocking out the starlight. ""That's Odd"" I said to myslef, because as a Former Civil Air Patrol ""spotter"", I have been on many flights in small cessna 152's and Piper's and knew from experience that any aircraft in this area of NAB would have to have their FAA approved Anti-Collision Lights on at night. Moreover, I also knew from experience that any craft traveling at night, over a military Terminal Control Area (TCA) wihtout lights on, near the final approach vector of its major East-West...would certainly lose his license to fly...in a heartbeat.. Intrigued, I paused at the top step of the porch to wait and see if this idiot pilot would turn on his running lights. I waited for the white random flash in the middle if the craft with red on left (port side) and green on right side (starboard) indicating its presence in the nights sky. Just as soon as that thought passed in my head, I saw the middle star of Orion's belt blink out, as if the craft had passed in front of it...passing as it were from the left of Orion's belt straight across and in front of the middle star of Orion's Belt and the then on to pass in front of the third star on the right...blinked out...all in succession....like One-Thousand, Two- Thousand, Three- Thousand. ""This guy's screwed"" I say to myslef thinking of how much trouble he's in, (or she, not to offend any woman pilots) when my eyes adjust enough so that I can now see that the dark object is some kind of huge flying wing or boomerang shaped object. ""A B-2 Bomber!"" I say to myself? Then I say, there aren't any B-2's stationed here? Just as my eyes were able to focus on the craft (with no lights on it whatsoever) It initiated some type of maneuver and I lost it for a few seconds. I took this moment to look at my watch...and as far as I can remember it was 9:08:00 pm EST. From that point on my recollection of how time passes is very bad. I lost the craft for anywhere from 3 seconds to maybe as much as 20 seconds....I'm not real sure. When I first saw the craft, as it passed in front of Orions belt stars, it was approxiamtely 3-4 inches, wingtip to wintip as measured from my face to my outstretched index finger. The shape of the craft was a ""boomerang configuration"". Some might call this a ""chevron"" configuration...but I think that describes something more like a carpenters square than what I saw...the bend in the middle, the Dihedral, was only about 5 or ten degrees maximum, meaning that the boomerang shape was only slightly bent in the middle, not 90, or 45 degrees, but much less. Ok, so when I first saw this thing, I had absolutely nothing to gage its height by. I automatically assumed that it was a B-2, not just because its shape resembled a ""Flying Wiing"" but because I couldn't hear any engines. So I assumed that it had to be a B-2..... As I was pondering all this in the brief period when I ""lost"" it against the night sky, I got the overall sensation that it was performing some sort of ""maneuver"", another thought popped into my head... I thought to myslef, ""Maybe it's the Navy Seals!"". Yeah that's it, it's the Navy seals on a hang glider on a stealth mission...like that scene from ""Escape from New York"" and I thought to myself ""they are training for a mock take-down of NAB! this is cool, I 'm gonna watch this! Just as I had convinced myself that this thing was not a B-2 and had to be a hang glider, because there was no sound, I noticed something coming over the treetops to my left hand side. (southwest). My dad was in the Army and I remember him always telling that if you want the best visual acuity at night, you don't look directly at an object, you constantly move your focus ""around"" whatever object your trying to look at, this keeps your rods and cones replenished. The reason for this added detail is because, I got the impression that the craft made some type of maneuver to fall from its original position which had to be 6-10 angels high. It moved so fast that I totally lost it from my vision, even though I was looking right at it...I didn't pick it up again until it was about 20 feet above treetop level and about 100-150 yards away! What I'm trying to say is that I don't know whether this craft ""fell"" from its first position or ""dematerialized"" and then rematerialized over the treetops...because as I was trying to explain before...I changed my viewing from looking directly at it to focusing around it and it just sort of ""materialized""...I don't know if it was because of the way I changed my focus on it (night Vision) or if it really did ""Demateraialize"" and then ""Rematerialize"", but my gut feeling at the time was that it did some type of rapid circling maneuver, like when you took the seed pods of maple trees and threw them in the air, we called them, ""helocopters"" and played with them, they would fall and spin on a central axis while spinning rapidly...I am aware of the brains ability to ""fill-in"" areas where it does note have enough data to form an opinion, I call it projection, I'm sure some psychologist out there has a name for it. It may have done both or just did a super tight, super fast, ""helicopter"" maneveur, I'm just not sure. Having flown right seat in cessnas and pipers and having flown hang gliders at Kitty Hawk quite a few times, this intrigued me, because if it was a hang glider, it would explain why it was so silent, but there is no way a hang glider can drop 6000 feet in just a few seconds, without having a catostrophic failure! Hang gliders can drop very fast and silently, but their center of gravity is such that it always seeks the horizon, I just can't imagine a hang glider going straight down like that, unless it had a catastrophic failure, but these thoughts were all muted in a few seconds as It grew closer... So after it made this falling maneuver, it was now situated approximately 200-300 yards away to my left, at about 200 ft ASL or just above treetop level. The craft is moving quite slow now and I am just starting to get a glimpse of its shape, which has changed, not because it actually changed shape, but just because I was now looking at would have been it's right ""wing tip"" from a position that was in front of and to the right and below the craft. Now the craft, instead of ""appearing"" like a boomerang, now looks like.... A saucer? I say to myself? No how the hell it went from Boomerang to Saucer shape was beyond me.... AS it grew closer to my position I could see that it had some type of dome shape on the bottom of the side I was looking at. (At the exact time of this angle of view from my perspective I thought it looked like some sort of Dome or oblong shaped Craft...) Ok now I'm standing at the End of Rogers Ave which runs nearly exactly East West and I am at its most Eastern part. The Craft is travelling From due south to North, without any deviation, except for whatever maneveur it made to fall in height. It was just as if I was on a parade stand and this craft falls from the sky and silently floats in front of me going from my left view to my right and out of sight.... But at this time the UFO is now directly in front of me. Rogers Ave is about 5 blocks or approx 2000ft long and lined with yellowish High Pressure Sodium Streetlights. Rogers ave, from my position is exactly perpendicular to me, meaning that it is forming a right angle 90 degrees from my viewpoint. To be more descriptive draw an upside down T and I am at the position of where the Bottom and top of the T intersect, looking down the vertical part of the T. Also important to remember is that this was March and the trees that year hadn't quite bloomed yet, and there were many trees in the nieghborhood and along Rogers ave, so at times during the sighting, the craft was behind the branches. In my original report to MUFON VA I said I thought it had some type of antenna on top of it, but after going back to the sight a year later at the same date, I quite clearly mistook the branches for an antenna. As it got to a point where it seemed to hover over the streetlights I was looking at the craft directly through it's right side. From this perspective it actually appeared to be classic Saucer shape with a rectangular body, with smooth corners and dome on the bottom! But just as my brain was trying to tell me it was a Sacucer, I noticed that the craft seemed to slow down and seemed to almost stop, directly above the streetlights. As it did slow down the right tip seemed to dip down a little as the left tip seemed to yaw to the right, like a conventional plane would do in a turn, but the difference is this thing was nearly at a hover, less than a stone's thro away trtavleing at most 1-5 mph....I knew it wasn't a hang glider or B-2 or anythign like that at all... Right around this moment I noticed that I could ""feel"" a very low frequency hum, a frequency that sounds much like an eighteen wheel truck in the distance on a deserted hwy, the way you hear it is like a long drawn out huuuuummmmm.....huuuuuuummmmmt. The biggest difference is that I seemed to ""feel"" this not necessarily ""hear"" it. Realizing that this was an extraordinary event, I tried to shout out my friends name who was only 20 feet from me through that door...but only a whisper seemed to come out....thinking I had lost my nerve I took a quick breath and shouted again....but nothing came out.....in a panic, I took a really deep breath and exhaled a shout that my mother could have heard 600 miles away....I felt my lungs contract, my throat muscles contract, my tongue moving and breath exhaling....but not a whisper came out! Truly terrified now, I just stood there transfixed on the craft as it seemed to hover over the streetlights and as it did so its right front and right bottom wingtip had the amber colored lights off the HPS streetlights illuminating it. It was at this point that its shape and form were very clear and defined. From my perspective the craft appeared to be approximately 30 or 40 feet from front to back. About 20-30 feet high and ...well at that time I hadn't seen it from any perspective that I could gage its length-wing-tip to wing-tip yet. It most definately had a dome about 15-20 feet wide which protruded down from under its right wing-tip about 5 feet at most. I could also see the outline of another dome on the left under belly of the left wingtip. The right front or leading edge of the wingtip was essentially a vertical surface as was the rear leading edge, but I don't want to confuse the reader into thinking that this craft actually had any laminar flow. The top and bottom edges of the craft were rounded like the Quarter round mold on your floor. In general it was an immense rectangular cross section, boomerang shaped craft with rounded smooth radius edges with no other protrusions or lights or windows or whatever, just perfectly smooth as if it had been injection molded out of a high temperature ceramic composite. The color of the craft resembled what I would best describe as a Black-Bluish. It blended so well with the night sky it was almost impossible to see unless you were looking right at it. You probably could have been sitting right under it, looking stright up at it and the glare of thelights would totall block your view...you wouldn't even know it was there! I have a some Engineering experience and I would say that it most likely resembled a Metallic flame spread coating, whereby metal powder is heated and melted in situ as it is applied to a substrate. This gave the skin of the craft a texture which made it appear from a distance to almost be pourous, like a lava rock or something of that sort but much smoother. It fit in with the sky so well that I think you could have been driving right under this thing and if you werent looking directly at it, you would go right by.... Of course by this time it was apperent that it was not any type of ""Air"" craft. The ""wings"" were 20 feet thick, there was no chance for the wings to produce any laminar flow whatsoever and without laminar flow and the Bernoulli principle, you can't produce lift, there were no jet engines, no jet exhaust hitting the trees and moving branches, nothing at all just that all invasive humming. After it did its little slow down and tilt, it then seemed to regain its bearing and slowly began to move a little faster and straighten out its flight path continuuing on its northward path and gently, quietly passing over the homes in that area before I lost it over the horizon. But this was probably the most awe inspiring thing of the whole event for me, because now I had a third perspective from which to gage its true wing tip to wing tip size or length....and I was completely dumbfounded by what I saw.... Before my eyes was a craft that had to be no less 800 feet from wingtip to wingtip. To give the reader some perspective of it's shear size, a 747 looking at it head on is about 187 to 200 feet in length, so if you took 3- 747's and laid them tip to tip they still wouldn't be long enough to match the size of this thing. It was so long that I couldn't focus my eyes on one part of the craft and still be able to see the rest of it....from 2000 yards away! I actually had to move my whole head to scan its size from left tip to the middle and then all the way back over to the right where a tree got in the way! One side of the craft was on the right side of tree and the left part on the left side of tree with 20 feet of branches in between! One more thing, on the back of the craft there was some sort of ""line"" which ran parallel to the body of the craft. In other words it looked like a rectangle within a rectangle. In retrospect it must have been a protrusion of a few feet out because it was passing over a huge playing field and the lights which illuminated it were now coming from an angle which would could only have made the shadow line I saw if something was protoding as opposed to recess within the crafts structure. Also when viewing craft from the rear, I could see that there were three domes on the bottom of the craft, one on each tip and one in the middle. The next day I searched every paper and news item...but I heard nothing. I thought that I was the only person in the world who saw this thing. Then on July 4, 1997 the SCI FI channel did a special on the 50th anniversary of the Roswell crash...and at the end Jonathan Frakes says, ""and in Phoenix Az, on March 13, 1997 Strange lights were seen.…"" You have no idea how nuts I went, my roomate thought I was losing it...Now here I was, with proof that others saw exactly what I saw, but only they were 1000 miles away and it was the next night! This began a 4 year quest to find out the truth, the disinfomation, and meaning behind my event. I reported my sighting to MUFON....but they weren't much help at all...I am hoping that posting on this agency will encourage others who know the TRUTH about 3/13 to come forward about this and other sightings in the Hampton Roads Area....I have more information about this sighting for those interested contact Peter Davenport.",2001-08-20T00:00:00,36.889383361064894,-76.26208236272879

It was approx. 7:10 or 7:15 and both my cat and I saw two firey objects streak acorss the upper portion of the window (which would probably be about 70-90 degress from the horizon.  These two objects were moving from the south to north, low and it almost appeared that they were below the clould level.  They were both yellow-orange in color, and appeared to leave a trail or had a trail as the streaked acorss our line of vision.  They were moving fast in a horizontal movement, slightly rising.  They were almost parallel with each other, possibly one slighty postioned behind the first.  It was not totally dark as I could see the clouds, yet the lights from the objects was bright, nearly as bright as the reflection a few minutes later of my interior fan light on the window.  As soon as they streaked by, I said out loud to my cat, What was that!  He had definitely noticed at the same time I had.  I jumped up and ran into my living room so I could see the north exposure.  (I live close to the Red Rocks at the uptown area of Sedona).  I could see nothing in the darkening sky, except a few clouds.

Almost directly above me there was some type of aircraft.  From almost directly underneath, it had five rounded sides, with a light at each of the five points.  It was a bit like a pentagon, but rounded enough to say that it was round - with five distinct edges.  The lights were yellowish in color and not very bright.  The craft was low to the ground compared to the air traffic that we typically see in our area. There were intermittent clouds in the area, and the craft was moving slowly.  It was moving in pretty much a straight line to the east/northeast.  There was a large cloud in it's flight path, and as it disappeared behind the cloud, I stood there to watch it come out the other side.  Given it's speed and the size of the cloud, I expected to see it come out the other side relatively quickly.  When it did not, I looked around, and saw the craft now moving in a south/southeast direction, looking like it made a 90 degree turn when it was hidden by the cloud. I could not make out the color of the craft since it was night, but the lights were yellowish and they lit the craft enough to make the five sides clearly visible. I am a professional and student in the town of Charlottesville in my late 20's.  I've never seen anything like this before, and was not under the influence of any substances - it was a fascinating experience, and I hope I see it again sometime soon to get a better look!",2001-04-28T00:00:00,38.04475955882353,-78.53657691176471

It passed almost directly over me & continued in a straight westward line until the trees obscured it from view.  The light was like a motorcycle headlight - single, not double as an airplane's.  There was no accompanying jet noise or airplane motor noise - only a soft after""hum"" - like a furnace running, or wind through trees.  This craft did not have red and green lights.  I saw 4 distinct lights arranged in a diamond shape (or a triangle with a tail).  There was also the suggestion of a few smaller lights around the back of the craft.  The front and rear lights were cream colored, while the side lights were amber and chartreuse.  It was travelling rapidly - from initial sighting to the point where I lost it in the trees took less than 30 seconds and the approximate distance I would estimate to be 3/4 mile.  The sky around my farm usually has many moving lights - all attached to regular aircraft.  The traveling speed of this craft astonished me, making me realize that it was not one of the ""regulars"".

I looked to the sky to compare the many other stars on this clear night and this was about ten times the size of star and appeared to have the shape of a diamond. From my driveway the light or object was not blinking nor did it have any color distortion and seemed to be close in vicinity of my home. The moon was low and the object in perspective was seemingly above a rooftop. I wanted to verify if it had any movement so I gauged it next to a tree limb. It moved up and down slightly within seconds when I had it positioned in the tree. I jumped into my car, driving from Kirby and Westpark at 35 mph and chased it going west towards Newcastle & Westpark. It seemed to be unusually dark in this area of the overpass at Westpark & Kirby (near the midsize electricity plant). It was larger than I previously thought and it seemed to move quite fast in front and away from me going west. At one point I thought I would lose it so I sped up eventually driving around 60 mph passing red lights. On Westpark underneath the 59 overpass I noticed a helicopter flying low coming from the south, going north, the light then dimmed, became hazy and barely visible when the helicopter passed. I pulled into a parking lot on Rice Street and Westpark, to observe the object. Once the low flying, low speed helicopter passed that area, the object dimmed and suddenly disappeared, I assumed it traveled at high rate of speed heading west which made it impossible to see.  This occurred less than a half mile from my home. Upon arriving home the object was no longer in the sky near the tree branch where I had first had seen it.

To my complete amazement, the whole v-formation appeared to come to a complete stop, and then all 7 lights started blinking and moving irraticly in and out of formation.  This went on for almost 10 seconds. Amazed by what I was seeing, I jumped up to get a better look, but just as I did so, the lights went back into v-formation and flew over my house, continuing south. I quickly ran to look out a window on the south side of the house to see it emerge, but there was nothing there.  It seemed as if the whole v-formation just disappeared, or went straight up into space.  Very strange, very ufo.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

As I was pointing out the object, it starts to speed toward the northwest, beyond some trees which obstructed my view, so I was not able to track it. Incidentally, there were brown leaves falling from the trees, but I could tell the difference between this object and the brown leaves.  It was sort of brown in color, with just a hint of a reflective surface.  It did not make any ""detectable"" sound, and I estimate its height was about 1000 or 2000 feet, although, since it look like it was ""small"".

I then ran to my truck to get a pair of binoculars but by this time it had disappeared. The object appeared very small compared to the size of the airliner and had a highly reflective surface.  There were no visable characteristics other than this due to the high altitude. I asked the delivery person if he could see what I was seeing.

There was a nice light breeze and thin clouds with spaces between them were continuously rolling over the mountain range out to the east. The moon was approx 1/4 and out to the south west about 30-40 degrees, with clouds obscuring it sometimes. Observer 1 noticed an object directly upward which at first glance could be mistaken for a bright star, only he said it was moving. He pointed it out to us, and myself(observer 2) and observer 3 also could see it moving, almost fluttering around much like a bee, kind of bouncing ever so slightly. We kept watching it and started noticing there were many more overhead that were moving around too. They all appeared as stars at first, some more intense in light than the others. The light was constant, not blinking, but fading in and out. Observer 3 said he saw a blue light coming from one of them, changing back and forth from blue to white occasionaly. I personally noticed about 3 or 4 of these things moving, dancing on the edges of the clouds, almost trying to hide themselves with the moving clouds. They never went too far from their apparent location in the sky, but appeared to all of us that they were rapidly changing up and down in altitude at times, the light would sometimes be diffused by the clouds. We called my mom out, observer 4 to take a look. She said she could see them moving around too. Remember, this is just my account of this eyewitness, and I may have forgotten a few things, as I am writing this 24 hours after the sighting. Nevertheless, it is still very freshly ingrained in my mind. I am going to encourage the others to post their accounts of this on this website too. Just after observer 4 saw these objects, observer 3 decided to go home. Us 3 kept watching the skies, and woke my dad up to come see at approx 9:30. He looked for a just a few minutes and didn't seem to interested or convinced and went back inside and went to ! bed. Us 3 kept watching, myself and observer 3 lied down on the benches on the deck so we could see straight up. There seemed to be more and more of them appearing out of nowhere, fluttering around the clouds, which were diminishing and the skies gradually getting clearer. When all of a sudden, 2 seconds of sheer terror and astonishment at the same time. A triangular shaped, HUGE OBJECT, darts across the sky, seeming to be relatively low in elevation, and MASSIVE in size. It was almost like a shadow, an ominous bird taking up a good portion of our view. It could have been a very tight formation of several craft, or just one HUGE one. I thought I saw maybe nine arrow like faint lights or reflections of city lights below all pointing forward, almost like a formation jets fly in. We yelled out because this thing was flat out the fastest thing I have ever seen in my life. It covered the portion of the sky visible to us in those one to at most two seconds we saw it. Not only that but perhaps the biggest thing too. It was probably only in view for only 1-2 seconds. All of us saw it, and realized we had shrieked out in amazement, saying what the hell was that!!!!!!!!!! I can't begin to tell you what kind of feeling came across me, and us. Goosebumps and heart racing. It was so stealthy, appearing kind of neutral in color, not dark and not light, almost transparent, but blocking the background above it. It was going due South, DIRECTLY over us. Observer 3 said it reminded her of a huge Thunderbird. It appeared to be about only a couple thousand feet up, and about as big as my hand when held as far away as possible. As we gathered ourselves and asked eachother about it, while still looking up, another one flew over, maybe 5 or 10 minutes after the first one. We all briefly screamed again, because we were excited about seeing the first one, and something that moves that fast is supposed to scare you!! We are ALL CERTAIN we saw the same thing. This one didn't appear as large, but going just as fast, who could estimate the ! speed of these things, but I would say several thousand miles an hour, that fast!!!!!!!! IMPRESSIVE.... At this point we were wonderin what the hell was going on, almost like being in a dream, where you can't believe your eyes. But it's real and you know it. We live on the outskirts of town where many people have animals, and we heard dogs barking, horses and donkeys beying, pet geese making all kinds of noise. The second (relative to the size) also appeared to be flying low, maybe half as large as the first one that flew directly overhead, north to south just as the first. They made NO noise whatsoever, and left no trails, only in view for an instant. They appeared to be going straight and at a constant velocity, real damn fast. How could this be happening? Are they ours? I don't see how they could be, given the apparent size and speed. But you never know. All the while, these star looking lights, that were moving around, almost confined to an area, started to have more activity. We witnessed several of them shoot across the sky over the next hour or so, almost like meteor trals, but the trails much much longer then a meteorite's, but not seeing that ominous ""big bird"" again. Observer 1 was freaking out a little, and decided to go inside to sleep. Myself and observer 3 stayed outside, waiting and watching when whizzzzzzzzz Two light colored objects about 70 degrees up to the east of us, coming out of the North again, going south, were two light colored Diamand shaped craft, resembling big planes with only wings and no tail or fuseloge, whizzed across the sky with the same breakneck speed, then the were gone, disappearing as quickly as they appeared. Where are they going? Back to Nevada or New Mexico? Or better question, where are the coming from? We might never know. But we have to believe, anyone looking in the Pueblo skies that night HAD to have seen it too, just too much activity, too many things moving, and the flyovers, those were enormous crafts, too big to miss, but maybe too fast for someone to see if n! ot looki ng up at all times. This had started at about 9:00 pm and at midnight, still happening. I think I had seen some sort of UFO sighting about 12 years ago, but it was nothing as convincing and REAL and fast and awesome as this. So us two keep looking at the skies and noticed a formation of flickering lights off to the east about 30-40 degrees up. It looked like a mini little dipper constellation, only the objects were dancing around this look alike formation, way to small to be the little dipper. We kept watching this because it seems to have appeared out of nowhere. The objects seemed to be about 2-3 times the width in length, appeared bluish white in light, and danced and tumbled around almost like a school of fish. We were getting tired and weary and decided to go to sleep. That's it. Hope to see them again, next time I will have my camcorder on a tripod, recording constantly looking straight up. I didn't have it at the time of the sighting and no pictures were taken. This eyewitness was just too eery and too scary not to report, I'm sure some people will think I'm crazy, but 4 people can't see the same thing and it not be real. Besides, I'm almost certain that other people in the Pueblo area had to see it and will hopefully report this as well.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,38.27602697368422,-104.66346271929824

The UFO sparked excitement and speculation among the residents, some of whom called the Channel NewsAsia hotline. Resident Benjamin Lee captured the object on a video camera, but by the time the camera began rolling, it had moved some distance away. ""They were shouting and said some flying saucer over the place so I just came out and saw the thing,"" he said. ""They said, 'Take your view cam.' So I started taking down the picture. Then the saucer was just hovering over the top of the block, a very bright light. ""At first I thought it was a chopper. Everybody was saying it's a helicopter but after looking at the lights -- the lights were running around the whole thing -- it looks much more like a saucer."" Mr Lee said. ""I was in the kitchen when I saw the saucer. It was as wide as the flat window,"" added Joanne Lee. ""I didn't believe it, so I used a toy telescope to look at it. It was very clear, like a plate, rounded, with blinker lights,"" another eyewitness, Mr Tan, said. ""I saw it at 9.45 pm. I used a telescope. There were many lights on the bottom of the saucer. There were three windows. Fifteen minutes later, it flew off in another direction,"" Madam Yong added. A spokesperson from mobile phone company StarHub thought it could be their lightship, which flew over the Bukit Timah expressway that night. StarHub said the two 1,000-watt lights on the lightship are so bright it could have been mistaken for a UFO. Residents in Bukit Timah apparently saw a similar object but concluded that it was the back of the lightship.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,,

The morning was warm with absolutely clear skys and no wind.  A group of six of us were gathered after church at one of their homes.  Four of us had stepped out into the back yard to smoke (cigarettes).  I was watching an airliner fly through the sky about 1000 Ft or more in altitude and noticed a bright/shiney round object sitting what appeared to be stationary well above and N.W. of the passenger jet.  I asked the others what they thought it could be and asked for some binoculars to view it better.  Most said that it must be a balloon.  It was to hard to see clearly what it was even through the binoculars.  It did look circular in shape.  Several of us took turns with the binocs. to see if we could make out what it was.  It remained stationary the whole time we watched it, not moving up, down or horizontally.  As one of the others was looking through the binocs. I began to scan the sky and saw another airliner heading North at what appeared to be a normal flying altitude of maybe 2000 Ft. plus.  Then all of a sudden I noticed a formation of seven Bright/shiney oval objects as large as the airliner, flying South far above the airliner.  These objects had a bright sheen to them, almost like a ""halo"" around them.  Again I brought this to everyones attention and most dismissed these as military aircraft doing manuvers, geese or something else.  The odd thing about this formation was it looked like a lower case ""y"" flying sideways, tail first and that at the altitude these were flying they were still as large as the airliner.  Also noteably peculiar was that three of these craft rotated/changed positions in the formation with relative ease.  That is to say that they dropped out of formation, dropped back behind the others, then moved to their new position with ease.  Very fluid and quick  movements, which seems a strange ability considering their size.  Their rate of speed was no faster than normal airliners as a formation.  After the formation left our view I returned my attention to the area where we ob! served t he ""balloon"" and it was no longer in view.  The whole time this transpired was no more than 10 minutes.  Our group consisted of various ages and backgrounds.  As for me, I am prior military, 44 years old, and definately keeping a closer watch on our skys.  These are not the first peculiar aircraft I have sighted or reported.  I am one that tends not to speculate to much as to where these unusual craft come from.  I believe they are made by ""man"" until proven otherwise.  Just seems strange that with all these different objects flying around, how is it that the ""men"" who makes them or flys them hasn't bragged about it or ""let the cat out of the bag"" so to speak?",2001-10-12T00:00:00,33.93964338565022,-117.4001158071749

Three witnesses came rushing to the police station in Mosjøen last night, and the police confirm that they regard the witnesses as serious and honest people. Roar Tøgersen, chief of staff at Helgeland policedepartment in Mosjøen confirms that the witnesses are considered ”high ranked” and that there was absolutely no reason not to believe what they reported. The 3 were riding in a car when they saw a ”strange object come very low over town”. They could not clearly see what it was, but first they thought it was a helicopter. The UFO came in very low from the south. The police still considers it as a UFO as they so far hasn’t been able to find any other explanation. Scared The witnesses explained that the object or part of the object rotated around its own axes. They went out of the car to have a better view, but jumped back inside as it looked like the object was going to crash in the midtown. They experienced the situation as threatening. There was no sound. What originally looked like a helicopter was completely silent. After looking like it would crash it changed direction and flew out the Vefsn fjord and disappeared. As the witnesses thought it had crashed in the fjord they went to the police to report an accident. They could see the object as long as a couple of minutes. When the police got the report they immediately sent policemen out to find the area of ”the crash”, and prepared to send out ambulances and medical personnel. “Hovedredningssentralen i Bodø” which is the offical headquarter for accidents at sea were, were alarmed and preparing for action. Forces were out in boats and walking the shores to look for debris. Nothing was found and the search ended at 04.00 am. Search was started again Monday morning (24th).

Suddenly a small cloud appeared directly to my north.  I thought where did that come from since it was a cloudless night.  Then I noticed it was moving and realized it couldn't be a cloud.  As I followed the movement it became black against the dark sky moving south directly toward me.  There were no lights visible on the aircraft.  It was moving in a direct flight path.  As it passed overhead at an altitude of not more than 1,000 feet, I leaned over the wall of my patio to see the reflection of the lights in our parking lot hit the bottom of the aircraft.  It refkected a dark gray metal and v-shaped.  I cannot positively say it was triangular.  There was absolutely no sound as it passed overhead nor afterward.  My thoughts were ""What the hell was that thing?"" As I sat contemplating what I had so quickly witnessed, I thougt at first it might be a glider plane. In the wake of recent events, I thought maybe the terrorists are going to use gliders next.  But even gliders make a noise as they swish by!  Then I thought of how the object must have appeared as a cloud at first.  Our town has no street lights.  It is relatively dark.  One half mile away there is a small plaza with a lit parking area amd a senior apartment complex with a lit parking area.  This craft must have reflected those lights as it passed over. When it passed over the empty lot across the street was when it beame black on black.  I did not report this to anyone as I was waiting to here of another siting by someone. But this has been preying on my mind all week.  I don't think a military craft would be permitted to fly so low with no lights over a populated area.  I don't even know if we have silent aircraft.  That is what I question most of all was the silence and no lighting.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,33.60411666666667,-111.74221818181817

The following report was submitted by Oregon UFO Research team member and long time UFO investigator Jean Bilodeaux in Northern California. This sighting has multiple witnesses, three total and took place near the Oregon, Nevada, California border. Many thanks to Jean for passing on this sighting and we will post any further information that comes forth in the future. Eric Byler - OUFOR. Jeans report... The first two witnesses live in Lake City, Calif. The town is not on all maps and is located approx. 10 miles north of Cedarville and 16 miles south of Ft. Bidwell. The first few sightings were estimated to occur over Fee Reservoir, which is barely in California and maybe partly in Nevada (The state line tends to vary from year to year). The third witness lives in Ft. Bidwell and saw the light over Bidwell Mountain which straddles the state line between California and Oregon (this mountain is NNW of Ft. Bidwell). The lights were spreading out to the north and south from the initial sighting. The sightings reported to me last night, 02-12-02 were large, bright orange lights in the sky. A man was soaking in his hot tub around 7:30 p.m. He had a view to the north and northeast, with almost no lights except for a small town (about 30 lights) 16 miles to the north. His attention was drawn to a bright light suddenly appearing in the northeast, (SE Oregon, NW Nevada or NE California)around 7:45 p.m. It was bright orange, and appeared suddenly about 10 degrees above the horizon over an unpopulated area. It was visible for about 1-2 seconds. It was just on and off...""A light being switched slowly on and then off."" This was followed in turn by two lights, one light, three lights, one light, two lights, etc. Perhaps a total of about a dozen lights. They were miles apart and not associated with any populated area or roads. There is no commercial air traffic in the locations where the lights were seen. There were no 'tails' or anything to indicate these lights were meteors or satellites. The man viewing these lights has seen both meteors and satellites while soaking in his hot tub. They were not planets. He called to his wife and she saw three lights appear at once. She also felt they were not naturally occurring phenomena. The last light seen that night occurred when the man was reporting his sightings to me via telephone, at 8:00 p.m. The couple also called a friend that lived in the town to the north and asked them to look outside. The man went outside and saw the 8:00 p.m. light. None of the people that reported seeing the unidentified objects that night drink alcoholic beverages or indulge in illicit drug use. They are credible people and the first couple invited me to their home that evening in hopes of all of us seeing more lights. Unfortunately that was not the case. This is just another in a long series of lights being seen in this area. One such sighting, several years ago, was filmed with a video camera for 2 seconds before the couple tried to zoom in on the objects. The camera lost focus, but the existing footage was sent to Jeff Sainio to be analyzed. Jeff estimated the lights to be from a UFO approximately 750 feet in diameter. Another couple substantiated the sighting, which at times consisted of up to eight unidentified flying objects. UFOs are seen several times a year in this area. Some encounters have been very close-within 12 feet; some with interaction among the objects-shooting lasers at each other; missing time, a crop circle, and other anomalous events have occurred in this vicinity. The first and possibly only photo documentation of UFOs and abductions occurring together was in this area. Many of these events have had multiple witnesses, some with photo documentation. I believe this sighting to be another in a long series of sightings to occur here. ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Jean Bilodeaux, ultimate source of this report.

One was red, one was blue, one was yellow - the primary colors.  The craft zigged and stopped at an awkward angle at a higher altitude.  This happened one more time, then it just sorta faded away - disappeared.  It didnt shoot off, it faded like pulled a cloak over itself.  I tried chasing it, but, it didnt work.  I noticed some bright lights in the distance, East I believe.  I went to check them out and got as close as I could (in my car) and saw that they were six apache helicopters.  I know they were apache helicopters because of my military training.  The choppers wouldnt let me get close, they would veer away.  As I watched, they seemed to be searching the fields for something.  Earlier that night I was in the country looking at the sky and noticed what looked like stars zigging and zagging about the sky.  Definitely not any sort of commercial aircraft.  I have some friends who have also witnessed such a craft, but, had never told anyone until I told what happened to me.  They too said it had first been noticed at the graveyard.  Human or extraterrestrial I do not know.  What I do know is that this is real.

I was looking (as i do throughout the day) for ""odd""/chemtrail activity but instead saw two unusual objects. The more stationary of the two was larger and seemed  to exhibit no anomalous motion. approximate range seemed to be about at least 2-4 miles. Clear blue skys (for once ;). The smaller object appeared to be moving southeast at about double the speed of the first. The larger object appeard brighter than the smaller, mobile object. My impression was that of two mylar ballons catching the sun, but why at that range would one move consistantly away from the other at twice the speed, while the other remained relatively motionless?

The lights seemed to be over a major highway (Hwy 400) so I thought it was a traffic plane. When I stopped at the traffic lights and the object didn't move I thought it might be a helicopter.

That area in the sky stayed lit for 45 minutes after. (this latter difference in sky color may have not too been noticable to anyone not looking for it) The lit part of the sky was a lighter color than the surrounding sky, with a tinge of blue.  This happened during a heavy snow storm so it could have been lightening, but I've never seen bright blue lightening before, and that doesn't explain why that part of the sky stayed a little bit lit for at least 45 minutes later...the lit sky has returned to normal at last peek (11:15pm)",2001-12-05T00:00:00,44.98078334423014,-93.29330787839163

Last night at 10:20 PM I was carrying groceries in from the car when I noticed several bright points of light in the sky overhead that appeared to be moving in a westward direction towards me. As there is a lot of conventional air traffic overhead at night I didn't pay much attention at first until I noticed that they seemed to be flying in formation; not a V pattern or anything like that (they were all over the sky in no pattern), but in tandem with each other (they maintained roughly the same distance from each other as they crossed the sky). That night was very cold and the wind was blowing from the west. There was also heavy cloud cover that frequently obscured the lights for 15-20 seconds (at times I could not see all of them at the same time, and by the end of the incident cloud cover had thickened to obscure all of the lights). At first I thought they were just stars, as the moving clouds gave the appearance of the movement of stationary objects behind them, and indeed some of them were (as I watched closely I noticed that they didn't really move). However, even as the clouds moved I could see some lights that seemed to move while others didn't, and at least three of the seven lights I saw moved across the entire sky from the far horizon to directly above the eaves of my townhouse where they were finally obscured. When I first saw them it looked strange enough that I called into the house for my girlfriend to come out and see them also (approximately 10:23). As we watched I tried to verify that the lights were actually moving by looking at them and a stationary object overhead and visually measuring the distance between them. At first I used the moon, as it was the only stationary object close enough in sight, but later I was able to use the eaves of the house as well. The objects looked like large, very bright stars (single blue-white lights just like stars but they didn't twinkle or blink; no red or green lights were visable at any time). They slowly moved across the sky, from east to west against the very strong (at least at ground and cloud level) wind, and at times seemed to change speed. As they got closer to directly overhead, the lights stopped and hovered in place for 2-3 minutes before starting to move again in the same direction, then quickly disappeared behind a very thick cloudbank and were obscured completely. As it was very cold with the wind chill and I was in short sleeves and still holding 25 pounds of frozen chickens and bottled water I decided not to wait and see if they were still there when the clouds cleared; the cloud cover was very thick by then and it didn't look like it was going to break anytime in the next several minutes. My girlfriend and I went through the townhouse and she went out the back door to see if they were visable, but said they weren't (the clouds were too thick). I went into the kitchen, where the clock said 10:37; earlier I had just come out of the kitchen and was going back to the car when I saw the lights which is how I knew it was 10:20. As I mentioned, I am hesitant to report this as nothing happened which would preclude an optical illusion (stars and moving clouds) and some conventional aircraft (helicopters) being responsible for the incident. However, it seemed strange that so many craft (helicopters or otherwise) would be moving so slowly in apparent formation over Kansas City against a very strong wind at that time of night, and that none of them looked like anything more than very bright stars. I have reported one other incident, a non-incident actually in Lawrence where a strange appearing (but conventional) aircraft flew overhead similar to an earlier report from the same area in Lawrence.",2001-12-05T00:00:00,38.95079716535433,-94.75379165354332

Saw three bright flashing white lights clustered together in the distance over wooded area.  Assumed at first to be aircraft.  Were temporarily blocked by view by trees.  (We were driving on the interstate.)   After a bit, two came into view on the horizon.  They looked to be the approximate height of one of those poles that have red warning lights for planes.  The light was a blinding white and was pulsating.  We began to wonder if it was some unusual type of aircraft.  We saw them to our right as we were heading South, but they then became blocked by view when a hill on our right came between us and the two lights.   I was driving and my good friend was the passenger in the car.  She then fell asleep and i continued to watch the sky for any more signs of the light.  I could begin to see the pulsing glow from at least one of them from behind the hill we were driving along.  I started to get the feeling that it was going to reach the top of the hill and become visible.   No sooner had I thought that than one of the pulsing white lights was right beside our car on the right.  It seemed to not have traveled the distance over the hill to get to beside our car.  It seemed to have just been in one moment still behind the hill and in the next instantaneously beside our car.  I woke my friend up who was on that side of the car.  She immediately saw it as it was essentially right over her window.  She was able to look up at the underside of it.  I was able to lean over and see it through her window.   It was a blinding white light that was incredibly powerful.  It was pulsating regularly.  My friend describes it as an oval shaped object with a flat bottom and curved sides.  Neither of us could see the top.  I could not see any material in the middle of the oval, the matter it was composed of seemed to form an oval shape with the center cut out, similar to a donut.  Both of us sensed, however, that a middle to this craft may have existed, but was not visible to us.   The pulsing light was definitely coming from the ! perimete r of the craft.  When it would flash, the whole craft lit up with a glow while it sent out a pulsing flash that could be seen from a great distance.  This particular craft beside our car then was behind us as we traveled down the interstate.   For the next hour or so we could still see at least two of the lighted objects in the distance if we looked back or looked to our right, depending on which direction we were heading.  The closest way my friend and I can describe the light the craft emitted is to state that it each time it flashed it looked very similar to the photos seen on the news of air bombing.",2001-12-05T00:00:00,44.653600000000004,-70.1149

The very bright light in the center of the craft which was approx three fourths of the way up the craft from the rear , and two reddish orange lights which were smaller with one at each corner in the rear .I could not tell if there may have been a similar small light on the front of the craft as the bright central light made it diffucult to tell and its placement being closer to the front than it was to the rear . It was traveling slowly toward the southwest and as it flew overhead at the altitude it was at I would guess that it would have appeared to be about four inches across at the rear and about five inches in length .Roughly the same size or perhaps a little larger than an A10 would appear at a similar altitude .

I was driving West on Town Center loop road, looking to the South at 8:27 PM local time.  With the exception of a few high level clouds (cirrus), it was a clear day, 80 degrees.  Looking over the top of Fry's electronics in Wilsonville, I noticed what I first thought to be a black mylar baloon floating above the parking lot.  I looked again, and noticed that it was stationary even though there was a slight wind moving approximately 5 knots to the Southeast.  I looked again, and realized that it was not a baloon, but was much larger and farther away than I first thought.  I pulled into the Les Schwab parking lot on the North side of town center loop, stopped the car, and looked at it in more detail.  We get a lot of aircraft in our vicinity since we are essentially in the Northern approach to Aurora airport.  I thought that this might be one of the larger hellicopters that are operated by Evergreen Aviation, a Sykorski Sky-Crane, or similar. What struck me is that this thing was hovering , then moved toward the South.  There was no sign of the rotor on top (normally I can see the disk that's formed by the rotor), there were no lights of any type (strange, being in the Northern approach of the Aurora Airport, and within an hour of dusk), no sound, no protrusions out the side for wings, no tail, nothing.  I called on my cell phone to a friends house where I had just left.  I explained what I was seeing, (I told her as it was happening that it was hovering, then moving to the West, then moved upward, then away to the South again.  I asked if she could see it from her house (less than 1/4 mile away).  She ran out and looked where I was describing, I lost the signal from her cordless phone and drove back to her house.  I didn't find her at home, and decided that I must have passed her somewhere on the road without seeing her.  I back tracked my route and found her standing down the street pointing to it.  She said that It had continued to move away to the South and that she had watched it for 5 minutes.  I could no longer see it since it had just become a dot in the sky, and I had lost sight of it while driving.  She continued to watch it, until we decided that it had dissapeared into the distance, and drove back to her house. The best way to describe its shape is the following: I was viewing it primarily from the end rather than the bottom of the object.  It was roughly triangle shaped as viewed from the end, but had rounded corners on all three corners.  I described it to my friend as shaped like one of the black licorice candies you get at the theater.  When I was describing it to her on the phone earlier, I said it was like a pyramid shape, but with rounded corners.  My friend said that she saw it moving straight up, but that when she viewed it, that it had not gone into the clouds, but had continued to move upward, and had made a jog backward to avoid going through the clouds she saw.  We compared our timelines, and decided that the cloud I saw it go through was before she had arrived at a location where she could see it, and that when she watched it, it had continued to climb, but avoided the other clouds on its way up. Compared to all other aircraft we see in the Wilsonville area in and around airports, this thing moved really slowly.  I have experience being in and around aircraft, have flown in and piloted light aircraft including helicopters, and can not explain what I saw.  I think that several other people may have seen this object since it passed over Interstate 5 in the vicinity somewhere between Boone Bridge (Willamette River) and the Donald exit (5 miles to the south of Wilsonville).

It seemed to come back toward me and a bit to the West.  Then it went up and over the cloud, not through it.  Then it continued to move South and up, very slowly.  I watched it for a long time, probably at least 5 minutes, during which time my friend drove by looking for me.  He went to my house.  I walked backward through the parking lot to the street, keeping my eye on the object.  By the time he came back up the road from my house, it was almost too small to see. I called KEX radio in Portland to report it.  I was surprised that no one else had.  It was right over I-5 most of the time.  I also called the Oregonian news paper.  They also said that no one else had reported anything. My house is on several flight paths.  Small planes land and take-off from the Aurora airport to the South.  There's a helecopter company there too.  Also, jets fly overhead many times each day on route to/from the Portland International Airport, about 30 miles away.  So I'm used to what aircraft and helecopters look like, how long they stay in view, and how they sound.  This thing stayed in view far longer than anything else I've ever seen.  It left no trail, and did not move in a straight line, but rather kind of wandered a bit.  I heard no sound at all, but I would have expected to, if it were a plane or a helecopter. ((NUFORC Note:  We have talked to the other witness to the same event, who was in a different location at the time of the sighting.  However, the two witnesses were communicating by telephone.  Triangulation on the location of the object may be possible.  PD))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,45.3084,-122.7799

The craft was so black that if it turned off it's blinking strobe lights, you could not have seen it in the night sky; just its outline. The craft had three red lights at each tip of the triangle.  These red lights flashed independently of each other.  A very deep low rumbling sound was associated with the sighting. The craft was flying very, very slowly, as if searching for something. I cannot give an estimate on the size, however I would say that it was larger than a normal airplane. The sky was 100 clear with no clouds and about 2 nights into the new moon.

Always from the Northwest part of the sky, exactly at the same spot, we have seen a 'fireball' shoot down from the sky.  It was extremely bright (like a fluorescent white) and also contained a greenish glow to it.   This left no trace or trails.  On the second observation the object DID 'shoot' back up in the same section of the sky approximately one hour later.  No sounds, nothing out of the ordinary afterwards.

Strange jet-trail-like thing sighted over mountains,La Quinta,CA,2002-03-15T18:00:00,other,About 30 min.,"Occurred : 3/15/2002 18:00  (Entered as : 03/15/02 18:00) Reported: 3/16/2002 9:05:09 AM 09:05 Posted: 3/19/2002 Location: La Quinta, CA Shape: Other Duration:About 30 min.",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/022/S22242.html,"((NUFORC Note:  Report of missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  PD)) Strange jet-trail-like thing sighted over mountains At about 6:00 PM, I called my friend to let her know that I was probably going to be late to her house (I was supposed to come over). However, while I was on the phone, my friend was talking and talking about some strange thing in the sky, that she couldn't exactly describe very well. I wasn't so terrified of it, because I wasn't a believer at the time, and I'm still sort of doubting the existence of aliens. Well, my friend was telling of an object that zoomed into the air from the mountains, zig-zagged, and finally disappeared, leaving a very prominent trail. As my friend said, there was a red circle surrounding it, but she wasn't able to describe the circle very well (like whether the circle appeared when the light disappeared, or how big the circle was...etc), so I'm doubting the existence of the red circle in the event. Well, while I was still talking to her on the phone, actually on my cell phone and she on her cordless phone (while she was outside checking out the strange light), our connection began to get more and more static. After a few minutes, Bridget had an idea that she would go and get her dad's digital camera and take a few pictures. This was when the light had disappeared suddenly into the mountains. By this time, it was approx. 6:20. Bridget took the pictures, and after coming over, I was able to see them. When I got to Bridget's house, the jet-trail was still very prominent. The trail just stayed in the air, without leaving until about thirty more minutes later. Also, at the points where the trail began to turn to make the trail a zig-zaggy form, there were bright lights. The top of the trail was already beginning to drift right, because of the wind. My friend and I decided to look at the pictures then. All the pictures that Bridget took of the UFO contained orbs. Bridget took a picture of me then, to check whether the camera lens were dirty or not, and the picture of me came out perfectly fine, and without orbs. After thinking and thinking about this event, I knew that the UFO had b! een in t he Earth's atmosphere, because the wind could blow the jet trail away. The jet trail was vapor, I think, because after thirty more minutes (6:40 PM), the trail had faded. Also, before taking the pictures, when there was still some sunlight left in the sky, my friend and I could see a small rainbow, probably from the sun shining through the prism. I highly doubt this is any UFO event, because we do have a air base near by, and they were probably doing some experiments/tests/launching missiles. But the occurrence just seemed so unnatural, because of it's zig-zag shape and the bright lights at each point, and how the light just disappeared. Another thing I'd like to point out is that my friend, who witnessed the whole thing, saw the light coming from somewhere behind the mountain, meaning it was probably under 2000 feet. Either the UFO landed, or the people at the air base were doing some experiments. Another thing, although this might be totally off subject (but I did hear orbs may have relation to dead people or angels), my friend's friend was shot in the chest, and found on March 14, 2002. My friend found this out March 15, 2002, so perhaps the orbs were intended for my friend (does that make sense?). I just wanted to clear the situation up, so maybe you can help me determine whether the object was an UFO or not one. Thank you very much!",2002-03-19T00:00:00,33.65794508196721,-116.27032786885246

My family and I were heading south towards Coupeville on highway 20.

Having a Navel base near by and a small airport even closer, aircraft are common and none of us gave it a second thought.  Once at the end of the straightaway the highway veers and proceeds to the left, the object was still in the same spot although now to view it one would have to look up out of the car windows on the right side and look through the branches of the trees.  It seemed to travel along side us for another mile where I turned right onto a side road to get a better view where now the object in fact paused momentarily and slowly moved down the hill towards the water and the town of Coupeville on the other side. The object was moving slow enough that I was able to turn left onto the street I live, stop at my house, run inside grab my digital camera.  Get back to the car drive to the end of the street where it meets back up with highway 20, get out and snap a few pictures.  The object more clear to us now appeared to have several sources of light close together, mainly white but later turning red (unlike that of an airplane).  The object turned left and started heading east traveling along the opposite shoreline.  Just past the town the object again took another left which put the little airport mentioned earlier, in its path.  We decided to go to the airport and wait to see if indeed it was an airplane.  No airplane landed and the object was gone. The night was clear and the sound of jets could not be heard and the prop sounds from smaller aircraft was not heard.  It was not until twenty minuets after arriving back at our house could the navel jets be heard throttling their engines.  To my knowledge no other reports were made.

Tuesday Jan 15, 2002 at 8:48 PM 45-48 degrees, dry, crisp and very clear dark nite. I am an amateur astronomer since 1973 and very familiar with not only the night sky but local air traffic and weather. Lights or objects sighted in Hayward, Ca, 15-25 degrees above the horizon looking east and my position is East of the Hayward Airport and west of the east bay foothills with Lawrence Livermore and Sandia on the other side about 50 miles. I had just got out of my car and removed an item from the trunk and as I turned looking up at the very clear starry night, looking east, with no traffic, and Gemini just right of my view above trees and power lines. I then noticed a very large bright red stationary light and quickly discounted Mars, a satellite, plane but not yet a helicopter. I assumed it was a helicopter at first by its apparent static movement but it slowly moved in circular pattern and then the light flickered and got dimmer/brighter. It appeared 10 times larger then any planet and many, many times brighter then Sirius in the winter. As I watched I noted the background stars (2 faint ones) and I moved away from the neighbors porch light and positioned myself with a better view. I moved around to see it pass behind the power lines and to get a different angle of view. I noticed when I stopped moving that it was making a slow circular motion in a small area. I continued watching and heard nothing and it started moving in a linear manner to the south. I then alerted my neighbor. He came out and observed it. I asked that he turn his porch light off and he stated it would take forever to turn back on but he turned it off anyway. We both continued observing it and then I stated, ""Stay here while I grab my binoculars."" I quickly retrieved them and came out and started viewing it in a wide angle and saw that it seemed to have no shape other then seeming very broad. I zoomed in and still no shape, I zoomed out again and focused to see it better and followed it as it moved. I noted no other lights or surface. It seemed to have a sphere shape but more like a very large bright red orb or sphere shape. I handed the binoculars to my neighbor and he looked for 10-20 seconds. I regained the binoculars and spotted it quickly and as I did it dropped a light from the bottom (not as bright, and much smaller and slightly orange/red) which moved very quickly at a right angle to the bright red light. I stated loudly ""What was that?' and continu! ed follo wing it by eye and binoculars, it then dropped 4-5 more small bright reddish/orange lights that dropped quickly at a regular interval and they seemed to drop just over the hills or tree line. We both witnessed this. They seemed to be like flares shooting down with some sort of trail but they moved quickly, much faster than I would expect from a free fall.

At this point the larger red light continued moving away and dimmed giving the impression of moving quickly away and out or dimming and moving away.

I did not report this to you yesterday after having seen the object (although I did send an email to the local newspaper asking whether anyone else had seen the object), as I was hesitant to do so since, firstly, we both thought perhaps it was a balloon of some sort, and secondly because I had previously reported a ""star-like object making erratic movements"" some months ago, and felt that my credibility may have been suspect by making a second report - this one more 'outrageous' than the first.   However, I do want to report this, primarily because I would like to find out whether the object has in fact been positively identified as a balloon, and/or whether anyone else had seen it.  As it was travelling due south, it may have been observed by others in Victoria, and in Port Angeles.  In any event this is what I/we saw: I had the day off from work (I work as a paralegal with the B.C. ((deleted/government employee))) and after a night of poor sleep, I thought to get a nap on the livingroom couch at about 11:15.  Unable to fall asleep as planned, I lay on the couch looking out the livingroom window. Within a few minutes the object came into view and, in relation to a highrise about 9 stories high about a block from our home, it appeared to be moving somewhat above the highrise and to its left (east).  I generally do not like to speculate on an object's height unless I know how large it is in fact, and cannot say how large this object was. I can say that if one scaled the object down, it was when I first saw it about the size of a twonie (two-dollar coin) held at arms length, in otherwords quite large.  Admittedly, I was wearing my glasses which are not a precise prescription (I usually wear my contact lenses when out and about - which actually give me slightly better than 20/20 vision). Had the object been much farther away, I would not have seen it well enough even to think it may have been something unusual.  However, because of its relatively close proximity, I was able to see what appeared to be a dome on its top and a disk shaped underside that seemed to dip slightly back and forth while moving generally south. Again, it is unfortunate that I was not wearing my contacts, since I believe that it also tipped slightly at an angle forward in a south east direction (imagine holding a pan in front of you and tipping it forward to look at its bottom), revealing its underside, and at that same time swooped a few degrees to the left and back before resuming a straight course south.  Like I say I would have gotten a much clearer view had I worn my contacts.   Shortly after seeing it and realizing it was something unusual, I called to my wife Leann (a teacher, off for the Christmas break)who was in another room.  She came quickly to the livingroom. I pointed through the window to the object, and said ""what is that?"".  At the time that she arrived it had moved far enough off and was less than the size of a dime at arms length. She ran for the binoculars, but by the time we got out the front door for a clear look it had disappeared.  I asked Leann if she had seen the dome on the top, which she did.  She seemed to think it may have been a balloon, and because I was not seeing it as clearly as I might have, I have been inclined to defer to her better eyesight.  However, a few things seem to militate against it being a balloon: 1) it was moving very quickly and it was not windy (at least not at ground elevation) 2) it appeared to slow down, almost hover, and then accelerate 3) it moved side to side 4) it was disk shaped and dark - what balloon has these characteristics? In any event, I am not drawing any conclusions and really only want to find out if I am corroborating other sightings. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Mr. Davenport: Thanks for the reply.  Yes, you may pass on my report and this email to the UFO BC group.  Perhaps they are in contact with those parties who would know whether or not a weather balloon was in the sky at the time. I neglected to mention in my report that later yesterday evening, during a New Year's evening get-together, a fellow mentioned that he and some co-workers had seen the object while taking a break at the time (which he thought was about 11:30 am).  They work at ((deleted)), a ((deleted)) operation located approximately a block to the west of where our house is situated (this is an in-city operation -  near downtown Victoria).  ((name deleted)), the fellow who said he saw the object, said he didn't pay that much attention to it, but indicated that his co-workers were looking at it with some degree of excitement, as they also were not certain what it was.  I understand, however, that they decided in the end that it Just have been a balloon.  This is, of course, hearsay, and if you'd like I can ask ((name deleted)) to get one or more of his co-workers who saw the object to contact you.   As I mentioned in my HMTL report, it seems to me that there are reasons for thinking that this was not a balloon, but my curiosity has been sufficiently twigged that I would like to find out if any weather balloons were in the sky at the time (it almost certainly wasn't a regular blow-up balloon).  If there were, then it seems we could rule out other possibilities.

UFO or spacegarbage, either way it was an awesome sight. The object was a rather large streak of green light that flashed half way across the sky.  It had to have been seen by a bunch of people because it was somewhere over somerville NJ, which has a big population.  I was driving on 202 heading inside of somerville when the event occured. It was in the sky directly above the road.  Anyone who was driving at around 10:00 on 202 had a great chance of seeing it.  It was pretty high up, but awfully big and bright enough that it grabbed my attention.  The driver in front of me even slammed on the brakes for a second.  But as quick as it came it also left.  The flash of green which had streaks of yellow and blue behind it only was around for about maybe two seconds.  It was pretty intense.  Im guessing that it probably was a piece of falling space garbage.  Or something like that.  But the thing that bothered me was the size of it. It was a rather large green blur of light.  And also that afterwords i saw a pair of helicopters in the area. This may not be related to anything that happened (whatever it was), but who knows. Plus the idea that it could have been a UFO is a pretty neat.  I believe in them. And I sure wouldn't throw out a ufo sighting as the source of the odd green lightstreak.

At approximately 2100 hours (9.00p.m.) I took my dog outside for her to do her ablutions.  Whilst outside I looked out North into the night sky when I spotted what I thought to be a bright star just above the roof top of the house behind us. I continued looking and this light suddenly became brighter and it was moving.  Seeing this light, I initially thought that it may have been a helicopter or a plane headed due South.  However, this light was moving too slowly for it to be either of these crafts.  It was just one solid light with no flashing strobe lights that are present on aircraft and helicopters.  I then thought it may have been the blimp but this light was too high in the sky for it to be a blimp.  We live about 22 miles from Lindbergh Field Airport but this light was no aircraft per se as I see them every night and this was nothing like the behavior of an aircraft. This light continued heading directly South and every now and then, the light became brighter as if slowly pulsing.  Occasionally the light would diminish a fraction but then it would come back to its normal intensity.  I continued watching it and the speed was very slow.  At one point it seemed as if it had come to a halt in mid air, but then continued on.  As it got closer I became aware that it made an acute right angled turn as it headed East. This had my curiosity really piqued, so I went back inside and got our binoculars to observe this light more closely.  I was able to pick it up and once again I saw the light increase in intensity.  As I followed it with my binoculars, it suddenly vanished completely.  I lowered my binoculars to see if I could pick it up again with the naked eye but it had gone. The slowness of the light and the acuteness of the turn told me that this was no aircraft.  What it was I do not know!  I have also witnessed other sightings and my husband and my son have also witnessed a couple of sightings  with me. This light may have possibly been a weather balloon, a satellite,  the space shuttle or something along those lines, but I feel that is was something else because of the speed of it and also the angle of path that it travelled when it went East.

Travelling West from Philadelphia by car on the Schuylkill Expressway on my way home after work, noticed multiple orange flames, seemingly falling from the sky like a wobbling leaf descends. This sight was moving slightly from North to South as it descended, and I thought I was witnessing a plane crashing. Then to my astonishment, it stopped falling,stabilized [from the wobbling motion], and the [13] spurting tongues of orange flame I had observed, stopped licking out of their round-cornered, rectangular apertures, beginning to pulsate as colours changed to a hot electric blue-white light [behind the rectangular apertures,now].From this condition, the flame colours licked out again as orange coloured and returned to blue-white several times.When in the blue-white mode, where they ultimately remained, they always appeared to be behind the apertures, glowing calmly. All of this took place as I drove directly toward the thing's stationary position, later determined to be slightly South of the Conshohocken exit of the expressway.As I proceded closer to its location, the object could be seen to have a top side something like the tapering crown of a Mexican Sombrero, discernible by vertical windows suggesting that shape. These gave the appearance of back-lighted milk glass,with a steady non-kinetic light source, unlike the other lights aforedescribed. Those flame-lights were arranged around the lower edge of the object, ringing an apparently circular form at its bottom edge. Suddenly, as I approached more closely, the object took off at high speed, directly away from me, seemingly going from a standstill to perhaps 500 MPH, giving me the odd impression that it did not go through any intermediate speeds.At this point, I began to wonder if I indeed was seeing some new kind of plane going away with over a dozen engines, the rear of which I was observing.Then, without turning it came straight back to its former position, like a yo-yo returning to one's finger, and I knew this was no airplane! Still driving, by now I was almost under what I estimated to be its position, about 300-400 feet off the ground, at the exit area previously mentioned. Deciding to investigate further, I pulled onto the road shoulder when I estimated it was directly above me. At first, looking up, I saw nothing and thought it had somehow moved without my noticing it. Then I realized otherwise. It was a clear starry night and above me the sky was pure black for an area which I believe was 300-400 feet in diameter at the height I estimated for it. From beneath there was no trace of the perimeter flame illuminations, from which I concluded that their observed apertures were atop the bottom surface of what apparently was a gigantic discus-shaped object. The foregoing represent all of my observations. I exited the expressway at Coshohocken with the intention of stopping at the gas stations there to alert them to what was emplaced above them, but for some strange reason, I felt powerless to do as I had planned and felt directed to go straight home. When arriving there, I called The Norristown newspaper, The Philadelphia Inquirer and Willow Grove Naval Air Station to report this situation ,but was treated in all cases in a patronizing way as if I was to be more pitied than believed. After this, I took my wife and son with me to see this object, but By the time we arrived, it was no longer there,and they kidded me mercilessly on the way home . Nonetheless, I saw what I described to you and have no doubts whatsoever about it, since I had the luxury of observing this ""UFO"" continuously for 15 minutes, or more. My overall impression was that I had seen a craft whose propulsion engines were malfunctioning as it fell,that these engines were brought back to normal function when it stabilized, and that they were revved up and down for testing as it stayed in place and were then tested further with the out and back flight which appeared to me to cover approximately 5 miles from Conshohocken to King of Prussia ,PA and return.",2001-03-16T00:00:00,40.07978449612403,-75.28599922480619

Bright light of a  fast moving craft frightened me in the night on the Oregon Coast. I moved to the ORegon coast in summer of 1984.  I am guessing the date to be in October of that year.  I was up late.  My husband was asleep in our travel trailer which we were living in at the time.  An unfinished cabin was on our property, where we had our belongings stored, and our dogs were sleeping out there.  I walked over to the cabin, checking on my pets.  There was a window facing west to the ocean.  Our place is about one quarter mile up a hillside from the beach.  I looked out the window at the night sky, which is clear and pretty there when it is cold.  A point of light in the sky began to grow rapidly.  There was no sound at all. It grew brighter and larger, and closer.  I cannot tell you how I know that it was closer, I just know. For some reason it made me afraid (other than it was unusual)  The dogs moved from the middle of the room and crouched against the west wall, to the left of the window, looking upwards at the window and whining.  I could not hear any sound, but it seemed that they could.  The light grew so bright, it seemed to spread outward from a center point and lit up the entire sky.  Again, I don't know why I was so afraid, but I crouched down in the corner with the dogs against that west wall, so that I could not possibly be seen from the ""sky"".  This ""object"" seemed to be now very low in the sky.  From peeking out the window from time to time, it was my impression that it was moving very slowly to the north, but very near to the tree line.  Then the light seemed to be ""sucked in"" to the center point again. Then what was left at the center concentration moved suddenly and extremely fast in a Northwest direction and was gone out of my sight.  The dogs would not come out of the corner for some time.  I was afraid, and went back to the trailer and woke up my husband to tell him what I had seen.  He didn't take me seriously and just went back to sleep.  Eventually I managed to get back to sleep.  In the morning, I heard a radio report from the Salem area (towards the center of! the Sta te, about 70 miles away) that lots of people had called in the night before reporting seeing lights.  They were making fun of the reports, and I didn't hear anything else about it. If I could liken the craft to something that was normal I would describe it as a helicopter search light, except there was dead silence, and the light was so incredibly bright and actually ""grew"" outward to fill the sky.  I felt like it was ""searching"" for something.  dumn, I know, but it is the only way I can describe it.  I guess I got scared because my instinct told me not to let myself be seen.…",2001-03-16T00:00:00,44.45660000000001,-123.9414

I remember a couple of days before seeing the object, I had trouble sleeping, and was having wierd dreams. In my back yard, we have a drainage Ditch,and behind the ditch at that time, we had several thousand acres of farm land. My backyard faces the West, and beyond the farm land runs the highway enter- ing Brownsville,from North to South. I remember that a couple of nights before, while being outside at night, I would see a ball of white light on the other side of the ditch.  I could recall seeing the light barely over the brush along the ditch, but for some strange reason I didn't think about it. I remember seeing it several times, and it did stand out, but for some reason I didn't check it out. But then on that night, I Decided to take my dog,(a Great Dane) for a walk, I would walk her probably every other night that month, late at night. It was a cool night, and it was clear skies, I walked to the back yard, when again I saw this light, It apeared to be moving slowly up and down. This time I became aware of how this light was strange, and out of place. The light at that moment looked like a street light, I went to the ditch for a better look, as I got closer, I could not see it, because of the brush.  The Ditch on the other side is higher than the side I was standing on, so I was trying to figure out how I could get a better view.  As I stood there, this bright light shot up from where I had seen the light, It was the size of a golf ball at arms lenth,this is the best I could describe it.  It seemed to be rotating, and changing colors, It was not very bright, as bright as a 40 watt light bulb.  You could see like vapor, like when you look at gasoline, is the best way I could describe it, you could see the colors change as it rotated, I can't remember though which way it was rotating(sorry), but it was rotating horizontally. My dog also noticed it, she was scared but did not bark, She had her tail between her legs. I stood there for about 15 seconds, trying to figure out what it was, but then I became scared, And I ran inside the house thru the front door, with the dog. I remember telling my self, that no one was going to believe me about what I saw, So I ran into the bedroom and woke my wife up, I dragged her outside thru the sliding door going to my back yard. My wife didn't know what was going on, I guess I was pretty excited, but she saw it also, but this time, it was starting to move to the Northwest slowly. It seemed to be shrinking in size, It got to the size of a pea at arms lenth. I had built a elivated platform for my son, so I climbed it, and watched it, as it dropped behind some trees in the far distance Northwest of my home. At the time I didn't believe in ufo's, I was just a regular Joe, Didn't really give it to much thought, but now I have become a strong believer. Thank You, PS My wife was 6 months pregnant at the time",2001-03-16T00:00:00,25.96936205128205,-97.44768564102564

I lived in a house that is in a field, but surrounded by woods, it is the highest point in the town.  On a clear night it is absolutely beautiful, you can see everything in the sky, including all flight paths of planes crossing over you.  There was one person in the room with me, and my younger sisters were asleep in their room.  She exclaimed to me ""What is that out there over the trees?!?""  The forest started maybe 1/4 mile away from the back of the house.  I looked and I figured it was just a really bright star, but then I realized I had never seen that star in that position in the sky ever.  I thought this was really odd because my family and I would lay outside and look at the stars all of the time.  I got a pair of binaculars to get a better picture of it and I saw that it wasn't just one light, like a star, it was two lights very close together, it looked like the headlights of a car.  It sat there for maybe 2 or 3 minutes, and then all of sudden it became just one light instead of two.  I sat there and watched it with this other person, who I might add firmly did not believe in aliens or UFO's, for another couple of seconds.  Suddenly, the light went straight up into the air and hoovered at this new height for another 10 or 15 seconds.  I started to run around my house, turning off all lights, TV, everything electrical that was on.  In my mind somehow I think I was afraid that if it sensed electricity or something coming from my house it would try to land, seeing that my house was the only house in the middle of this big field.  I had never experienced any thing like this, I didn't know what to do.  At this point in time all we could see of it was this ""headlight.""  Then, it starts moving across the field in the direction of my house.  There was absolutely no noise coming from it, there was just complete silence outside.  I was standing out in the open on my back porch so that way I could clearly se! e what i t was doing; I was terrified.  It continued to move very slowly across the field, I am not sure how high it was off the ground though.  It finally crossed over the corner of my house, about 100ft. above me.  It was a circular or oval type shape, I could see a red dim outline of the craft, like it had red lights all the bottom if it. It was still completely silent.  It moved over my house and kept moving across the field, but to the left now heading towards the trees on the left of my house.  I ran to the big windows on that side of my house and saw it go over the trees.  All I could see of it now was the faint red glow.  It went up over the trees, it raised straight up again and then I could not see it any more.  The other person and I did not know what to do.  We knew that we should call somebody or report it but we didn't know who to call.  She called our local police station, they didn't really say anything.  I told my father the next day about what had happened and he confided in my that he had seen ""things"" out there at night before too, but nothing that close to the house or the ground.  That was the end of it.  I have not seen anything like that since then, I do not live there anymore, but my family still does and as far as I know nothing like that has happend again.  At the time I was 16 years old, and the other witness was about 24 or 25.  I have always thought that it was extremely possible for these things to happen, but like I had mentioned before the other witness totally did not believe in aliens or UFO's or anything like that.

On 05/06/01 at approximately 00:30 hours I had left my place of employment in the City of Longmont, County of Boulder, State of Colorado.  I was traveling in the left-hand lane of I-25 heading north bound from highway 66.  At approximately 00:48 hours I was north of the Mead exit cresting a hill.  Upon cresting the hill my attention was drawn to an abnormally bright white colored light in the sky north of my location.  At first I thought it was a commercial aircraft far off several thousand feet up in the air.  It should be noted that I-25 runs all the way to Wyoming and this section of highway goes threw both Larirmer and Weld County.  It is very unusual to see commercial aircraft flying in the air space of these Two County's, but I have seen commercial air traffic from time to time flying in these County's. I continued to watch the light and noticed that it never move to the left (west) or the right (east).  I figured that the light was either moving north (away from me) or that it was moving south (towards me).  As I proceeded down the hill I observed the light was now back dropped by the next hill.  I realized that the light was both closer and lower in the sky than I originally thought.  I continued now going up the next hill where this object appeared to be rather close to a bridge.  It should be noted that this bridge crosses over I-25 for east and westbound traffic.  The bridge is located south of mile marker 246 and part way up the hill.  The bridge also has no off or on ramps connecting to I-25. As I approached the Bridge the object appeared to be approximately 200- 300 feet directly above the bridge.  I also observed that there was a red colored light to the right of the white colored light approximately 30 feet apart.  In-between both lights I observed a very dark mass that appeared to connect the two lights.  At this time the object appeared to take on a shape that is similar to that of a cigar.  When I got closer to the object I noticed that the object had some depth to it.  My view changed to where I could see part of what I would assume to be the underside.  The black colored mass appeared to come from the red light heading in a north western direction (away form me) rounding off and headed towards the white colored light. With this new view it took on the shape of a rounded triangle. Just before I proceeded under the bridge I lost my view of the object due to the bridge and the height of my windshield.  I continued under the bridge and traveled approximately two tenths of a mile further and pulled over to the right side of the highway.  I exited out of the driver&#8217;s side of my vehicle and looked where I had last seen the object and it was gone.  I did not see any sign of the object around the bridge.  I looked to the east and west along the road connected to the bridge and I did not see any traffic.  The traffic on I-25 both north and southbound was light/ few vehicles and there were other vehicles present at the time.  I looked up to the sky and I saw no signs of the object or any visible signs of any air traffic.  I got back into my vehicle and went home where I then wrote down what I had observed. During this time I did not observe any running lights that one would see on aircraft be it rotary or strobe type.",2001-08-20T00:00:00,40.1703733197556,-105.08544969450101

To Wit: I went to put the trash out, as I was doing so, to the south of my property I saw an emerald green light in the sky. It was traveling from east to west, and doing so at GREAT speed. It ( as I saw it) came from my left, and went to my right, (I was facing south). I am a US Marine, not given to flights of fantasy. I have been observing aircraft for many years, as I am a pilot. The light was constant, not pulsing in any way. It was moving VERY fast. Then it stopped and after only a half of second or so it went straight up until it was out of my view. After stopping and changing direction, I watched the light for 5 seconds or so. In that length of time I believe it was extra atmosphereic,based on my ability to determine the size reduction and rate of same. It could have moved slightly higher and reduced it's size similtaneously, however this did not seem to be the case to me, and I had no sense of this possibility at the time. Not knowing the distance to target, I unable to extraplolate the size of the light or source of the light. My best guess based on my experience is 15,000 feet Mach 2.5. or approximately 2250 MPH. I have never seen anything even close to this before,and with 46 years of information stored herein, I have no idea what this could have been. It was not ""usual"" and was unidentifiable with the limited amount of information. It was not a conventional aircraft of any kind.It may not have been a craft at all.

I live 55 miles due north of RDU so it is common to see a jet every few minutes at these altitudes descending into RDU.  They are almost always going due south; this one was going south east.  That caught my attention first, I next looked for wings thinking this must be a jet but could not find any.  All I could see was a large cigar shaped white-gray object with a slight glow about it, the size of a blimp, but moving along at a  rate much faster than a blimp is capable of.

At approximately 00:45 on the 3rd about 3-4 miles south of Mercer WI. and directly infront of us above the road about 1 mile in the distance 3 BRIGHT Yellow -Orange lights appeared. They were ""stacked"" directly above each other. The size would be comparable to the size of your thumb nail when held at arms length, each light appeared to be about 3 - 4 times their diameter apart. The objects were framed by the trees that lined both sides of the road in this area and they appeared to be about 1/4 mile above the ground. They almost appeared to be a ball of flame as I tried to figure out what they could be. We approached for about a half minute at which time I pulled over to the side of the road to get my camera from the trunk of the car. At that time the objects were about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away, but as I pulled over to the side of the road the objects moved straight up and the distance between each of the objects increased to about twice the previous distance. As we exited the car the objects moved 90 degrees or laterally to our left in a westerly direction in unison about 1/4 mile, now positioned above the trees and the shores of the Turtle Flambeau Flowage (which we could not see) but knowing the area that is where we estimated their position. At the same time keeping the same positions above each other. After retrieving the camera my friend and I watched the objects for about 3 minutes, unfortunatly the camera I had was one of these disposables and was really disposable as nothing turned out, to fast of a shutter I'm sure. But when I started taking pictures with the flash the objects changed formation immediately and formed what resembled a perfect triangle on a horizontal plane with each light forming one corner of the triangle about 1/2 mile above the ground. We watched them for about another minute at which ti! me we de cided to proceed further down the road to try and find a better vantage point to view from. We moved about 1 mile down the road and came to a spot where the trees were a little further from the road, at no time did we loose sight of the objects. As we pulled to the side of the road the objects slowly started to rise at about 500 feet per minute (estimating) At this time I attempted to take another picture with out exiting the car. I put the camera out of the car window and snapped a picture, about 5 seconds later a Pickup truck pulled to the shoulder just a head of us in a spray of gravel. (This was the first car we had seen during this whole time)I pulled along side the other car the driver (about 27 years old) was alone in the truck and his first words to us were "" What the hell am I looking at, I've been watching those things for about 10 minutes. Am I glad I saw your flash go off I knew you guys saw them as well. No airplane can fly like that in 90 degree corners. This was really wierding me out"". At that time we got out of the car again and the lights began to rise more rapidly increasing speed as they got higher. And suddenly they were gone as if someone turned a light switch off, meaning they didn't rise and simply get out of sight. This whole time we heard no sounds at all, from the objects or nature sounds as well. My dog in the back of the car made no attempt to get out of the car like she usually does. We continued into Mercer at this time and as we entered the town we relized that the town was blacked out, no power at all. The time was about 01:00 when we reached my cabin and we had no power as well.

My wife and myself, along with a potential landlord, were inspecting a house and 40 some odd acres in northern to mid Bates county in Missouri.  After inspecting the house we walked the fenceline around the acreage and inspected the fence.  After stopping for a short rest we continued on and back towards the house.  By that time it was dark and once we returned to the house we signed papers with the landlord and he went on home.   Living in the city at this time we decided to stay for a bit to look at the stars and the milky way.  It was getting cold so we were preparing to leave.  I got into the car to warm it up and my wife came around and waited for me to unlock her door.   Before she climbed in she looked up towards the sky again to take in the view and she called my name.  I told her to hurry up and get in the car I was cold she asked if that was the ISS...  I got out and looked for the light crossing the sky and she pointed me towards the southeast horizon.  I thought to myself wow, finally I get to see it.  I caught the light in my vision and watched its ascent overhead.   As the point of light ran across the sky we had to turn and look back the other direction, towards the northwest.  As it streaked towards the northwest it stopped just above that horizon.   Originally we believed we had just lost the object to our vision and we were now staring at a star or something we decided to head back home.   My wife climbed back into the car, and I adjusted my Ham radio antenna from 40 to 75 meters.  I turned back one more time and looked.  To my suprise that 'star' was moving back in the other direction.  Back towards the South-South East.   I yelled at my wife to come take a look.  I didn't think the space station could manuever that way.  The light or object stopped at 30 degrees from our position in the sky.  We sat and watched it for about 5 more minutes and the light disappeared.  We climbed back in the car and talked about it abit.  We thought about what it might be, maybe an airplane or helicopter but it was too far out and moved too fast to be either of those.  And I know of no helicopter that can travel at that altitude or speed.   The thing that appeared odd to me was the fact that it turned back and came about a third distance back across the sky and stopped.  No space station or satellite I know of can do that.   I wanted to submit this in case someone else had seen the same thing, and maybe get to ask some questions or see if any radar had captured this.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,,

I had taken a friend to her storage shed.  It was early evening but still quite dark.  The moon was visible and next to it venus (I presume).    As I looked at the moon I noticed what appeared to be 3 small stars (very dim and white in color).  On closer observation I noticed an outline of a dark spherical craft.  The craft seemed to be very large and very high in the sky but was clearly outlined. the little lites changed briefly from 3 to 5 and then back the lights were on the bottom of the craft.  The craft was motionless and seemed to just hang there.  This thing must have been huge!  There was no sound or any motion.   I pointed the craft out to my friend and she glanced up and said that she thought that i was seeing stars.   We drove to my moms house and I pointed it out to my mother who was able to see the crafts outline as well.  It had remained in place for the entire 20-30 minutes that I observed it.  The following night and for the last week I have been looking for it and haven't seen it or any small grouping of stars that should have been present if that was all I was seeing.  I would greatly appreciate it if anyone else has had a simular sighting.  I expected that a UFO would be bright and saucer shaped not spherical and dark.  I had the feeling that it didn't wish to be observed and that it was observing something --- there is a great deal of military stuff in the springs like NORAD and the SDI-testbed and the consolidated space operations center etc..

It was a perfect night for just star gazing.  Both of us have been looking at the stars for years and are avid outdoors people.  We really never expected anything like this.  It's really hard to know who to tell when something so clear, real, and strange occurs. This was real.  We both saw something in the sky we had never seen before.  He (the other witness) was writing in a journal with a headlamp.  I was sitting in a chair next to him commenting on all the jets going by.  Then a white light moving in its own flight pattern caught my periphreal vision.  It was an object with a white light that was kind of like a fog light. The light seemed to go all around it.  When I first saw it I thought it was a plane.  It seemed to be coming towards me.  I knew there was no airport anywhere nearby.  I then said, ""What is that.""  He then stopped writing in his journal, turned off his headlamp, put on his glasses, and looked up.  In that amount of time the oject with the lights had stopped moving.  When he looked up it just hovered.  It seemed to be pretty far away and we could not tell its exact shape.  One thing that was interesting though is that there seemed to be nothing in between us and it.  It was above the trees.  It stopped when we both were looking up at it.  It felt like it was looking at us too--the strangest feeling.  It must have hung in the sky for about 2 or 3 seconds.  Then it took off at an amazing speed away from us.  It kind of went away at an angle,but once it made its move away from us, it was completely out of view in about 2 seconds.  It didn't just disappear though (as if it had turned out the lights), we could see the trail of it leaving and it was getting smaller, but then it was gone on this perfectly clear night.  Thi! s whole event took about 8-10 seconds.  It was simply fascinating.  Never had either of us even thought about such an event happening.  We did not feel that we were in harm though and look forward to sitting in those same chairs another night looking for its return.

I went into the house and told my brother about the star/planet, he looked out the bathroom window with me and at first thought it was a planet also.  After looking at it for a few moments, he said that's not a planet!  We grabbed my camera and a pair of binoculars and went around to the front of the house.  He looked through the binoculars while I took some pictures.  He asked me to look and see what I saw.  I described to him that I could see and object that had a bright white light in the center with red and blue/green lights on the tips and that the object appeared to be in a plate shape with a peak on the top.  Just at this time my daughter came home and we called her over to see.  Both she and her boyfriend described the same things we had seen.  I just could not believe my eyes.  I asked my daughter to go get my second floor tenant so he could also see what was in the sky.  He had the same observation as the rest of us.  Again looking through the binoculars I saw the object moving around rapidly but staying in the same area, which appears to be hovering in the same location for a long time. I again observed this sighting again the next night, but the object had moved northeast of my house.  My sister and her friend came over to see, they both described the same as all the others.  I went out again at 9:05pm with the dog, looking up in the dark starry sky I noticed several of these lights in different spots in the sky.  There appears to be at least 3 of these lights now hovering in the sky........I would really like to know what is going on.  I have now seen at least (4) objects within the last month.  One during the day as I travelled to work on the highway.  But I dismissed that as just an active imagination.  But now I and really concerned.

I am an advanced student of philosophy at an international educational institution. I am uncertain if my senses were decieving me or what, but waking up I saw out of my window what I thought to be a plane traveling at high altitude in a south-westerly direction. The sky was clear. Suddenly the blinking plane stopped. ""how could that be?"" I thought to myself. I then stared intently at the star-like object for several minutes. It seemed to me to continue blinking and began to shoot off what seemed to be a multitude of smaller ""energy bursts"". I went to get my telescope, and when I returned the blinking had died down and it looked like a bright star. I find it hard to accept that my retina or some kind of tiny eye convulsions would have caused me to see such a strange spectacle. Thus I am left without a solid conclusion, other than this has never happened to me while looking at stars or planes.

And right now it's a UFO, until I manage to identify it. Saturday March 17th 2001, visible from 1:55pm to 2:03pm. Trying to figure out how to call San Jose airport. Moving due south, spotted in Almaden Valley, from our garden. May have originated from somewhere near the airport, which lies almost due north of here about 5 miles. Height anywhere between 2000 and 10000 feet. No loss in height. No noise. Highly reflective on this sunny day with light clouds. Estimate speed over 100 knots. Visible for 8 minutes from zenith to 30 degrees above southerly horizon, when dwindled to a point. No course deviations observed. Wife saw it at zenith (90) down to about 80 degrees azimuth. Called me, and we both then tracked it until it disappeared into the distance. No time for telescopes or camera; too busy trying to figure it out (hey, I'm a virgin UFO spotter so sue me). Wife asserts (too late for me to tell by the time I got there): * triangular * not a hang-glider (too fast) * not a balloon (wrong shape) * not a parachute (no height loss) * something swinging from the bottom. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2:45pm  3/17/01 I used to fly small planes, so I can say that as an ex-pilot I'm mystified. I called the airport ATC. * Nothing reported from San Jose ATC in the tower, except for a helicopter taking pictures close to the airport. * Wind on ground around 12 knots, little to no gusts. (So unless the wind increased to over 100 knots at a few thousand feet, this wasn't flying unpowered, therefore.) * Visibility: 10 miles. (So - and this is very rough - 10 miles in 8 minutes = 75 knots roughly. Agrees roughly with my estimates. Also, I reckon the visibility due south was more like 15 miles, which makes my estimate of 100 knots even closer.). A nice sunny day with very light and intermittent clouding. No clouds near the object for the entire time we tracked it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6pm 3/17/01 I expected to be excited and/or elated or something, but I guess today being tax return payment day, my reactions are dampened! Also, my wife got the best view, and all I saw was a bright, highly reflective object receding into the distance. We agreed that differentiating between a high large object travelling fast, and a lower, smaller object travelling slower, is damned difficult with no other nearby skycraft as references! There's some more info left out which my wife and I pulled together: 1. It seemed not to be metallic, but rather the texture of bright white silk. 2. The assemblage hanging down and swaying was entirely white, and the same colour as the triangle. It was about the same length as the traingle's span. The hanging part appeared to consist of a single U-loop of rope/cable, whereby nothing (e.g. a load, a person) was noticeable at the bottom of the U. 3. The triangle was neither thick nor thin; maybe 10:1 ratio between span and thickness. It appeared to be a rigid body, unlike the hanging assemblage. 4. The prevailing wind, according to reports, was between 5 and 12 knots, at every altitude from zero to 10,000' MSL. It was in direction 310 degrees (out of the NW), which lines up pretty much with the observed course of the object. 5. We also discount a helicopter on two counts a) wrong shape b) no sound whatsoever. 6. The course of the object relative to our south-facing garden (from where we observed it) appeared to be about one half mile due east, so it did not travel directly overhead. 7. At zenith, when only my wife was observing, the angle subtended by the object was approximately that of an object of size 0.7 inches held at arm's length. When I observed it first, at roughly 80 degrees azimuth, it was about 0.3 inches, and dwindled down to a sparkling point as it receded. 8. At the time of the initial zenith sighting, my wife had been looking up because of the noise of a passenger jet flying by (to or from the nearby airport). If the object were making sound, this could have masked it until it was too distant to hear. Hypothesis: an electric hang glider?

We watched at least 20 of these pass by traveling in various directions over the course of an hour until we went to bed.

Saturday September 29, 2001 I was in my back yard looking at the few stars in the early night sky in Las Vegas Nevada. As I was looking toward the south I saw what appeared to be a grouping of helium balloons that some child must have lost. However, as I began to track this object across the sky it became apparent that my first impression was wrong. The object definitely appeared to be at a higher altitude than any normal helium balloon that a child would have released might be. At this point I brought this object to the attention of my father who it an experienced meteorological technician. He has worked for the Department of Commerce as part of the National Weather Service for almost 40 years. He tracks weather balloons almost every day. Taking that into consideration I assumed that he would have a theory as to what this object might be. We retrieved binoculars from our house so we could take a closer look at this object. On closer inspection of the object it appeared to have balloons at the top supporting a black triangular shape at the bottom. The balloons also seemed to be illuminated by a very dim light. The strange thing about this object was the balloons did not appear to be big enough or strong enough to support such a large object. We also confirmed that this was not a weather balloon. As I mentioned previously my father, who is an experienced weather observer, observed this object as I did and he was absolutely positive that it was not a weather balloon. We watched this object track to the southwest at a steady pace at about 20-30 knots. It appeared to be at an altitude of 10 to 15 thousand feet. It did not appear to descend or climb at all during the 20 min. we observed this object. We were both very perplexed and had no theory as to what this object might have been. After my father, a person who has observed the skies for 40 years, had no theory as to what this object might have been I considered worth reporting.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

When I saw the craft do that I knew that I just had to see it. So my wife and I went outside to see it and that is when I realized that it wasn't a plane. The craft started glowing and it was definitely a trianglular shape. When the craft stopped glowing it was gone and there was no trace of it. I'm not sure what it was. I don't think it was a UFO because I don't believe in UFO's.",2002-02-22T00:00:00,42.48885774647887,-71.15891690140845

What I saw was two bright lights moving in an unconventional fashion at 7:50pm on the 25th of February 2002.  They looked to be about the distance apart of one centimeter held at arms length.  The two white lights with hints of many more smaller lights between and around, likely part of the same object, moved to the left and then stopped dead before moving back to the right and continued in that direction untill it was out of site about 15-20 seconds later.  The two lights stayed the same distance apart and at the same horizontal orientation to each other which rules out a plane banking. As its direction changed the one in the lead that was the brightest grew darker, and the one now in the lead grew brighter.  Its position in the sky was very close verticaly to the tree line on the other side of a clear cut that is about 500 meters across. The object was in my opinion about 1/2 mile away.  There was no sound at all or blinking running lights like you see on all aircraft.  If it was a rescue helicopter from CFB Comox (the largest helicopters in the area) it would have been fairly loud from that distance and it moved unlike any fixed wing aircraft commercial/private/or military.  Im located just on the outskirts of Courtenay B.C. to the west of town and I was looking north. ((ADDENDUM SUBMITTED MARCH 23, 2002)) Oops.  I submitted another report to try update my first report.  Then I saw it said to email updates, so here it is.  I went into further detail on certain points, and I also belive that I now know what kind of craft it was.       ""I saw two bright lights moving in an unconventional fashion.  When I first noticed the light it was behind a group of trees that was blocking my view.  I moved my head around to get a better look through the branches. After 20-30 seconds I gave up and continued with my smoke.  A half minute later I looked back at it to see if it had moved enough for me to see it better.  It had moved, to the left of the group of trees.  I was curious what it was because it was brighter than a plane.  As I studied it I noticed that it was actualy two lights close together. They looked to be about the distance apart of 1 centimeter held at arms length.  The two white lights had hints of many more smaller lights or possibly a reflection between the two.  It moved slowly to the left and then stopped dead before moving back to the right(it didn't seem to excelerate, or decelerate. It was just moving or it wasn't, with no in between speed) and continued in that direction until it was out of site about 15-20 seconds later.  The two lights stayed the same distance apart and at the same horizontal orientation to each other which rules out a plane banking. As its direction changed the one in the lead that was the brightest grew darker, and the one that NOW was in the lead, grew brighter.  Its position in the sky was very close vertically to the tree line on the other side of a clear cut that is about 500 meters across from my backyard. The object was in my opinion about 1/2 mile away, but could have been much further as its size was hard to judge.  There was no sound at all(it was a very quiet night) or blinking running lights like you see on all aircraft.  If it was a rescue helicopter from CFB Comox (the largest helicopters in the area) it would have been fairly loud from that distance and it also moved unlike any fixed wing aircraft Commercial/private/or military I can think of.  Im located just on the outskirts of Courtenay B.C. to the west of town and I was looking north.      Since I reported this I found a video on the net of a sighting from Belgium of a triangle shape ship.  There video shows it from below, and also from the side.  When shot from the side you can only see two lights, again with more small lights or a reflection connecting them.  I belive this is the same type of ship that I observed.""",2002-03-25T00:00:00,49.662864583333324,-125.000978125

When we looked at them through my daughter's binoculars, we could see them better.  They were triangular-shaped, but without the bottom of a triangle - they were like upside-down V's.  There were two larger ones and three smaller ones.  They were just hovering over Robins AFB all night long.  I kept getting up to check to see if they were still there and they were. Around 1:30 am one of the big ones just left - it was there and then it wasn't & when I got up to look again around 3:30 am, there were only two small ones left. Finally at 6:22 am 11/29/01, there was only one left.

These things are sometimes long and oval-ish with orange lights on the underside, and I have seen some weird looking round ones, too.  They never show up in the late spring-early summer either.  They always start coming in late November and you can see them 2-3 times a week until as late as the last week of February/first days of March.

There were commercial aircraft in the LAX landing pattern farther north of the object, that may have seen it at around 2250.

Briefly, a friend of mine and I were walking backwards along route 36 near Keansburg, NJ, at 3 AM in mid-November of 1953.  It was unusually cold.  The wind was strong and from the NW, which is why we were walking backwards against it.  The location was roughly 100 yard west of a used-car lot (which is still there) and perhaps half a mile east of what was then Martini's diner.  The sky was bright with stars.  I don't rremember if the moon was visible.  A mile or two away, to our east, a line of treetops was outlined.  A brilliant silvery sphere rose slowly and deliberately up from behind the trees.  It was impossible to judge its size.  Relatively speaking it was about the size of a full moon.  Because the tree line was about one or two miles away, the sphere must have been of considerable real size.  It wobbled slowly upward and in our direction until it was almost directly overhead, then made an abrupt turn to its left.  By this time my friend and I had stopped walking and had begun waving and shouting at it.  It wobbled in the same falling-leaf motion until it disappeared over the horizon to the north.  All together it was in sight for about 9 minutes.  On its approach it covered an arc of about 80 degrees of sky, and about the same distance during its departure.  It was moving against a strong wind, was completely silent, and didn't change in shape, color, brightness or in any other respect except direction of flight, as far as we could tell.  Neither of us reported the incident.  It was not an ordinary object, not an airplane, balloon, blimp, space debris, satellite, or hoax --at least I can't imagine how such a hoax could have been perpetrated, or why, in the middle of the night in a deserted area.  It turned my conception of the physical world upside down. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Also, witness indicates location of the sighting was in Deming, NM, but states it occurred in Keansburg, NJ.  We suspect the text of his report is accurate, so we have changed the location to New Jersey in the box filled out by the witness.  We have invited the witness to have the other witness submit a report, as well, if that is possible.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP RESPONSE #1 FROM WITNESS)) Thanks for the prompt and flattering reply.  I'm grateful to finally have this sighting somewhere in the archives.  It's been bothering me for 48 years or so!  I was in high school at the time and didn't give it that much thought, but went on to become a skeptic, psychologist and trained observer.  It's made the burden of carrying this information that much heavier, since the experience matches up with nothing I've learned about the physical world or the mind.  As for my friend, ((name deleted) by name, I'm doubtful that I can find him.  It's been a long time.  I've heard that he spent a few years in prison and had become bald.   I'll see what I can do about contacting him.  If he's still alive I doubt that he's forgotten the incident.  I also know some others who have had sighting and will try to reach them as well.  Thanks again. ((FOLLOW-UP RESPONSE #2 FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport:  You can print whatever you like.  I don't know how much it adds to my credibility as a witness in this instance but I have two doctorates, one in cultural anthropology and one in clinical psychology, which together would seem to cover a lot of bases where the exotic and the bizarre are concerned.  Most of my career has been spent in research.  Of course ((name deleted))  name shouldn't be included.  (Just after this thing disappeared -- I don't want to call it an ""object"" -- he turned to me and said, ""Max, if you'd been alone and told me about this later I would have said right away that you were bullshitting me.""  That's verbatim; this stuff is pretty clearly etched in my brain.)  I just did try to find him, actually, and located someone with his name living in New Jersey.  I sent him an email last night but have had no reply yet.  I'll let you know if anything else emerges.",,40.442600000000006,-74.1326

I watched the lights move toward me. I just thought it was a helicopter. I had the truck window down and begin to realize I couldn't hear any noise and the lights were moving closer. Curious I pulled over and stoped the truck. The lights were getting quite close by now and I still couldn't hear any noise. So I turned the motor off and called to my wife who was sleeping in the sleeper. I got out of the truck and realized that craft was directly above me. The craft set motionlessly about 20 feet above me. The craft was cicular in shape and the edges were curved up like a ball. It was about 100 feet in diameter. The bottom of the craft was made up of hugh metal sheets that looked like they had been exposed to supreme heat. The craft set directly above me for about 5 minutes. The hugh craft hovering silently above me was to much I begin to get scared. As I started to get back in the truck the craft started to move away. As I said before the moon was so bright I could see for miles in the open desert. The craft started moving and within seconds was out of sight. All of this was done without the slightest sound. Unforunatly my wife didn't wake up fast enought to see the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)),2001-08-12T00:00:00,,

We got out of the truck and stood beside it watching as the light stopped directly south of us in a field. After awhile, the light 'winked' out. Windows, lit from within began rotating in a clockwise fashion. Some sort of huge object slowly 'swallowed' the lighted object from west to east, very dark and silent.

It took off at about a 45degree angle to the west,southwest at an encrediably fast speed till it was too far to track, just disappeared into a pinpoint somewhere up among the stars. Then a second light came in ,same direction, from the east, and stopped right where the first one did. It did not 'wink' out however, just sat there a few seconds, then shot off at that high rate of speed at about a 70 degree angle into the west, southwest sky as if in pursuit of the first one.

I am a sales professional and the other witnesses are business owners and real estate investors, all in our mid-thirties.  There had been some nearby thunderstorms during the afternoon and early evening, with sporadic sprinkles and a cool breeze.  At 7:20 the sky was partly cloudly, with more storm clouds beginning to develop and move in from the mountains.  As I was facing east, I noticed a tiny black dot in the sky about 20 or 30 degrees above the horizon, and appearing to move west very slowly.  I observed that it was not a bird, so I said to my friends, ""Look, there's a UFO"" and pointed.  I said it was probably a helicopter, but whatever it was, at this point it was a UFO, and my most skeptical friend said, ""Yes, exactly, it's an 'unidentified flying object,"" with a little laugh.  It ""drifted"" our direction much like a balloon would, and initially, that's what I judged it to be.  As it got closer to being overhead, I could see that it was actually not a balloon.  It was moving in a very deliberate fashion against the wind. The clouds were not moving fast by any means, but they were slowly drifting eastward, while this object moved steadily westward.  I grabbed some binoculars from inside and another of my friends had binoculars in her car, so she ran and grabbed them, and we watched as the object flew directly overhead.  Only two of us were incredibly interested in the sighting, so we looked at it through our binoculars.  I considered it to be football-shaped, and she thought it oval.  It was a dark reddish-brown colour -- very solid and not self-luminous.  But as it went over, we both saw a pinpoint light flash on the middle of the bottom surface a few times.  ""Did you see that flash?"" I yelled, still looking through the binoculars, and she said, ""Yes, I definitely saw a flash!""  At that point, we both felt sure that this was not an explainable event.  We cou! ldnt' fi gure out, of all things, what would present itself like this.  Not a plane, not a helicopter, not a balloon, not a blimp, but an apparent ovoid-type craft with a single light which flashed just a few times, which we could only see when it was overhead.  It still appeared to be ""floating"" like a balloon, without slowing or changing directions, but more with intention.  From the time I spotted it to the time it disappeared into the clouds to the west, it was probably close to 5 minutes, though we didn't keep track on a watch.  We both estimated the altitude of the object at between 1 to 2 miles, but it was hard to judge.  I figured it must have been about 20 to 30 feet in length and probably 2/3rds as wide, and it was traveling in the direction of it's longest length.  Again, the true size is hard to judge, but the apparent size was approximately one centimeter at an arm's length as it flew overhead.  When we lost sight of it, we both chatted excitedly about what we had seen for a few minutes, and then I spotted another apparently-identical craft directly south of our location, moving west.  It was on a trajectory about 20 degrees south of the first object, so it did not pass directly overhead as the first one did.  We lost sight of it within a minute as it flew right into a cloud, and never did catch this one through binoculars.  But it looked like the same type of object and it was moving at the same apparent speed as the first one, and in the same direction.  Once again, I looked at the clouds to confirm their movement, and they were driftly slowly eastward.  So whatever these UFOs were, they were deliberately flying westward at a steady rate of speed.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

I  witnessed a very strange object today on the skies of Los Angeles on the west horizon. It was a very bright object, a intensely and brightly glowing object, moving at nearly at the speed of fast low flying airplane. It was moving in an zig zag pattern and left a long trail(zig zag). This object suddenly disappeared in a fraction of second as if it dissolved into skies. This event took place, I mean I saw it at 6.25 pm 15th March 2002 for nearly 30 sec,it may have been visible for more time. I am sure it was not a air plane, or a missile or weather balloon or meteor, because all of this make a straight smoke trail and this object made zigzag trail. Other thing  which suggested that it was an unusual object was the way this object disappeared in a fraction of second. The trails of this object could be seen clearly till 6.55 pm, till it became too dark. This object was moving from North- north-west towards south and the trail could be seen starting from same directions. Other details: 1: Though it is difficult for me to tell you the exact altitude but I can explain you in relative terms. The point at which the object vanished from the skies (6.25PM), I could see the moon nearby rising at the same point (6.40PM). Assuming that the object was directly above the sea shore, which is around 11miles straight from the place where I live and applying Pythagoras theorem the distance above the earth comes out to be 8.4 miles taking 35 degree angle and 6.9 miles above the  earth taking the angle as 30 degree. 2: Taking West as the horizon the Angle of inclination of the object must be around 35 degrees at the point where it diminished. 3: I was just adjacent to University of Southern California from where I graduated, at the gate  of my house. (Latitude = 34.020N Longitude = 118.29W approx.) I believe that the object must be above the pacific ocean or could be within the coast, but for sure not too much within the coast at the time it vanished. 4: At the time when I saw this object I was coming from the University, walking, after playing tennis there and when I saw this happen I was just infront of my house. 5: I didn't hear any kind of sound coming from the object. 6: The color of the object was like very bright halogen lamp of some 10,000 Watts seen from a distance of 20 meter (bright yellow), and in the same way it illuminated the large part of the surface surrounding it. 7: Yes there was one of my friend who witnessed the with me the things they happened.",2002-03-19T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

It had a bright white light at every corner and one in the center,  and a few small blinking lights.  It appeared to be black in color and did not make any noise that I heard. I saw a similar craft late winter/early spring of last year hovering in the sky above my house.  A second or so after I saw it, it moved away. It was perfectly triangular in shape but it had a light in every corner and one in the center and was black in color.  It made a noise, but it was more of a deep rumbling than the sound made by any jet engine I've ever heard.  A few days later another friend of mine saw it early in the morning hovering above Old Hickory lake.  I suspect it may have been an Aurora aircraft. I also think the one I seen last night may have been a secret government aircraft, but I've never heard any rumors about an aircraft matching the description of the one I saw.

lights in a seemingly semi-circle pattern; an 'X' outline on the vessels underbelly with white lights and a red light,Hamilton,ON,2002-01-18T05:45:00,light,2 minutes,"Occurred : 1/18/2002 05:45  (Entered as : 01/18/02 5:45) Reported: 1/23/2002 12:35:35 PM 12:35 Posted: 1/29/2002 Location: Hamilton (Canada), ON Shape: Light Duration:2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/021/S21518.html,"lights in a seemingly semi-circle pattern; an 'X' outline on the vessels underbelly with white lights and a red light I was partying at a friend's house on Friday January 18. Everyone had fallen asleep by about 5:00AM and i was the only one left awake . I decided to clean up my friend's rather attrocious house and this required taking the garbage outside to the garbage bin. It was a somewhat clear night with only a few clouds in the sky.  There wasn't anyone up and the streets were silent. As I placed the garbage bags into the bin I noticed a bright light far away on the horizon. I remember only glancing at the sight as I assumed it was merely a plane or chopper. It should be noted that I had previously been a skeptic when it came to UFO sightingings. As I turned to enter the house the light began an unbelievable ascent into the sky. I say unbelievable because of the rate at which the object could climb. It was at this very moment that I first entertained the notion of this vessel being an unidentified flying object. The light seemed to be emanating from one source but if I glanced away for the briefest moment the light appeared to be made up of mutiple lights that were arranged in a semi-circle pattern. The object had risen to an enormous height in the sky and I thought it was going to disappear into the night when suddenly it began a descent with the velocity at which it had previously risen. I remember a feeling of fright coming over me. As a rational person I was terrified at the notion that something inexplicable could exist, and yet here it was before me. The object appeared to be coming in my direction as it descended. I lost sight of the object for a second and then it re-appeared directly overhead. I estimate it must have been about a mile-and-a-half above the ground. It sliced through the clouds effortlessly and as soon as it had appeared overhead, it was gone. The underpannel was marked with an 'X' and had white lights outlining this shape. There appeared to be a red light moving around the object in a circular pattern. I remember hearing a low buzzing sound that accompanied the vessel as it flew overhead. ! I was co mpletely overwhelmed and spent the remainder of the morning debating whether i had actually seen what i had thought i had seen and whether or not it would be worth telling anyone at all.",2002-01-29T00:00:00,43.23776070381232,-79.86514418377321

My fiance and I were walking from our house to our car and looked up in the north-western sky and saw an orange ball travelling westbound. As it was travelling, smaller orange lights were dropping from it. The smaller ights looked almost like sparks and we at first thought it was a flare from a flare gun. Once the object travelled out of site, a second identical object was seen coming from southern sky heading northbound. This object was not dropping smaller lights as the other one did though. While the first object was visible, my fiance ran in and grabbed our digital camera and several shots were taken of both objects. Unfortunately, the detail does not show up in the picturers.
