I thought it was a fireworks flare someone shot but it did not burn out just started to come my way.  I ran to get my camera on tripod and was glad it was still there when I came back.  I focused in on it and caught a few seconds of it before my camera went out of focus as it climbed into the clouds and out of sight. The strangest thing which I did not notice until I viewed the film, was a light similar to the one that I had centered in the film is off to the right lower corner of the frame.  Thing is I was trying to zoom in on the center light just as it went out of focus, but the light in the right hand corner stays constant and even quickly moved out of frame just after the main light moves up into the cloud and up and over the city.  It was about 11:30 pm on June 30,2012 just a few minutes ago.  It doesn't seem I explained enough what seems strange to me, what I mean to get across is how can the light in the right hand corner stay constant when I am zooming in on the center object.  Seems to me it should go out of focus just as the center object did.  Then strangely enough it moves out of frame with the characteristics of a ufo.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,48.93148260869566,-122.72577391304348

On Saturday night, November 17, 2012, between 6:10 – 6:25pm (EST) my wife and I saw about 20 large, bright, glowing reddish-orange spheres (or “fireballs”) in the evening sky, over a period of approx. 15 minutes from our front porch in Hampton Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.  The sky was perfectly clear, with low humidity (the Dew Point was about 25 degrees F) and the temperature was 38 degrees F.  There was a bright, waxing crescent moon to the southwest. When I initially stepped out onto my front porch, to let my dogs out, I noticed two pairs of large, very bright reddish-orange glowing lights that were roughly spherical and could be described as “fireballs” that seemed to “float” in the sky, although they were clearly moving slowly in a straight line from the east-southeast to the northwest.  As the first pair got closer, they appeared to get a little bigger, until they were about double their initial size.  As they got directly overhead, they appeared to gradually fade, until they eventually disappeared, somewhat like a light dimmer.  Over the next 15 minutes, my wife and I saw another 15, or so, identical “fireballs” rise over the treetops of the mountain to our east-southeast, always travelling in pairs, in groups approximately 30 to 60 seconds apart, and always emanating from the same spot on the eastern horizon.  They all travelled in the same straight line, toward the northwest, seeming to “float” in the sky, but! making slow progress to a position directly overhead in a leisurely span of time of about 45 seconds to 1 minute, before they all gradually faded away over a span of about 10 seconds.  Since the mountain is about 1 mile from our house, and it took the “fireballs” about 1 minute to get directly overhead, I would estimate they were travelling at about 60 miles per hour.  They seemed to be fairly low in the sky, and I would estimate their altitude to be about 2,500 to 3,000 feet above us.  Their reddish-orange glow was constant – that is to say they did not “blink” like the lights on a plane or helicopter. There was no tail or flames – just a steady glow.  The way they seemed to “float”, or “hover”, seemed somewhat like a helicopter, and the way they arose over the horizon, always in pairs and seemly in a type of intentional formation, seemed to both my wife and I reminiscent of the helicopter scene in the movie “Apocalypse Now”. These ""fireballs"" made no sound. About 5 minutes from my initial sighting, I decided to call 911, to find out if other people in our area had noticed and reported these mysterious glowing lights.  The 911 operator said no one else had called, and suggested they might be a meteor shower (which they were not; meteors move much faster, are much smaller and burn white hot, not glowing reddish-orange, like a fireplace ember).  She connected me with the New Jersey State Police Barracks, who dispatched a Trooper to our house.  By the time the Trooper arrived (about 15 minutes later, around 6:35 pm), the glowing lights has vanished.  He was very nice, but said no one else had reported seeing the lights.  My wife and I would be very much interested in knowing if anybody else reported seeing these glowing lights on the evening of Nov. 17th – they were the most unusual things either of us have ever seen and we would like to know an explanation for them.  My wife is a Registered Nurse and I am a Civil Engineer and! Geologist, and we have an intense curiosity to understand natural phenomena.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,,

But he distinctly saw 8 orange, dull colored lights in the distance and could not hear any noise, then they all started to disappear one by one.   This happened approximately at 9 PM Eastern Standard time during a dingy colored full moon on a clear night. Temperature is in the 80s at the time with about 95% humidity.  There were more mosquitoes than average out tonight and I recall some strange activity among animals in the area. This actually reminds me now of a sighting I saw myself about 2 or 3 months ago while driving towards Wilmington on 95 North, probably a few miles from exit 7. I remember driving and seeing a strange rotating craft appear on my right with 3 distinct lights, it was hard to see, but it appeared that one of the lights was changing colors from red to green and I had my windows down but I could not hear any distinct afterburner sounds.  I was driving most likely around 70-75 mph and I lost the craft as trees began to appear in the foreground.  I have also witnessed strange crafts/lights in the Florida area.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,39.65195779310345,-75.71214262068966

The craft was either Navy from NAS North Island or Marine from MCAS Miramar.  Craft had the usual blinking red and white lights with the normal loud sound identifying it as helicopter.  Aircraft from both air stations fly east out to desert and return on a daily and nightly bases. When I looked up I clearly saw helicopter being paced just to its left side by a bright turquoise colored light.  The object was silent and appeared to easily keep pace with the military craft.  The UFO seemed to fly smoother, faster and at some point tended to overtake the conventional craft as we watched both fly into the night towards a mountain range.  The sighting was relatively close and not as high as some of the aircraft often seen operating in the area. This sighting reminded me of Russian Bear bomber fly- bys observing the aircraft carrier USS ENTERPRISE during operations in the Indian Ocean back in the mid eighties.  At that time I was part of a NAS North Island Helicopter squadron attached to the ship during a Western Pacific cruise.  Whenever Russian aircraft fly by the ship, we send up jet aircraft to closely escort them away.  I personally never seen any UFO(s) during any WESPAC cruises I ever been on.   Also Wednesday’s UFO sighting marked the only time I ever seen any aerial object of any unusual or turquoise color.  Both crafts were not as high up as the ones I witnessed in 1995 and the sighting a couple weeks ago in Lakeside.  After this sighting I asked the off-going guard and others have they ever seen aircraft with turquoise colored lights, and the answer was always, ""No, never,"" or words to that effect. Finally, the only other UFO sighting I’ve ever been present, occurred back in 1971 during operations in the Gulf of Tonkin.  It was a no-fly day and a friend from North Dakota and I was at the bow on the flight deck.  It was a clear night and very quiet up there.  We were lying on the deck looking up at the stars when he mentioned that he noticed two white lights, flying very high and fast.  He said both lights flew parallel to one another before suddenly speeding away in opposite directions, lightning fast.  I looked for the objects but apparently they had vanished before I could see them.    We never discussed UFOs with each other prior to that night.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,32.9017,-116.89330000000001

We both looked up and stared intently, and then upon further staring, we both realized the object had no flashing lights common and mandatory with air planes and helicopters, or any type of aircraft for that matter.  As it got closer we both realized this was no aircraft we had ever seen before, it was round, fairly large, it looked like a red bubble with red glowing lights all around it.  Kind of like a nucleus.  It was not a meteor or comet or swamp gas or any of that other nonsense the Government tries to make us believe, and it was not in any flight path for Newark airport or Teterboro airport.  I know the flight paths very well.  I see airplanes come past all day long,  I know their exact flight paths, this object also had no ""sound,"" totally silent,  it was to see the least eerie but yet quite fascinating!   The object flew over us then kept going fairly fast, then a few miles away it just ""vanished"", poof it was gone.  My son was fortunate and smart enough to whip out his Galaxy S cell phone and record a good 25 seconds or so of this UFO. And what is really great is it passed an airplane going in the opposite direction so you can see the comparison and to top it off New York City was the backdrop skyline of the UFO, so it is perfect for skeptics.  It can be aligned perfectly and has a plethora of points of reference to prove it was definitely a real UFO!   We kept looking for an hour afterwards but we did not see any more red glowing objects jutting across the sky!   This was truly an amazing experience, I can't explain how totally and utterly great it is to experience such an event.

I had just arrived home in Aurora, IL with my wife, mother-in-law and two girls right about 8:30 pm. It was already dark outside being that it was mid-November. We had groceries in the car that we had to unload them before my wife was to take her mother home in Naperville, IL.  So we all got out of the car, the girls went inside followed by the rest of us carrying the groceries. I came back outside by myself to get the rest of the groceries. As I walked down to the car that was parked in the middle of the driveway, I noticed an orange ball of light with blurry edges come to view on my left moving south to north in a perfectly straight line. It was moving at a pretty good speed and awfully low which is why I stayed fixated on it!  All of a sudden, a second identical ball of light showed up right behind it! By then, the first ball of light was right in front of me, but disappeared behind my neighbor’s house that was also in front of me. I then turned by attention to the 2nd ball of light that was following the first and I watched it as it began to move in front of me….Just as I stayed transfixed on it, I noticed yet another ball of light pop up behind it that looked just like the first two and chasing the second ball of light. It was then that I knew that these were not planes! All I can say was that they were bright orange balls of light chasing one another. I then instantly realized that these were not planes! Planes simply do not behave like this; they do not chase each other in this manner or fly so low.  I then ran into the house through the garage and I frantically told my wife, who was in the kitchen, to come with me and to make it fast because I had to show her something before they disappeared. She was actually pretty startled by my sense of excitement. She came running out and I pointed out the two lights. By then, the 2nd ball of light had just began to peek out again from being out of view due to my neighbor’s house all while the 3rd ball of light was just about to be covered by my neighbor’s house.  Suddenly, we both then noticed that an identical 4th ball of light appeared flying in the same manner, path and height as the other 3 balls of lights that preceded it. All 4 objects looked identical, flew in the same speed and height all while following each other and were very low. They were so low that they should have made some noise, but they were perfectly silent. They made no sound whatsoever. They all appeared to by flying along US-30 which would put them over in Oswego, IL air space which is the direction I was facing. As all of the objects peeked out from behind my neighbor’s home, they changed their direction all heading west towards Oswego at which time they simply disappeared in the distance.  My wife and I were left dumbfounded by what we just witnessed. After the last light disappeared, we simply got the rest of the groceries and came back into the house.

This is my second report, a duplicate mind you.  I wanted to add a bit more detail, I also sent an e-mail to director@ufocenter.com with a short video I recorded, but I just found another e-mail at the bottom of this page I'm going to also send it to:   Was informed to give more information, and I hope this is a better report.   I sent an e-mail to the Lake Zurich Patch – not sure if I’ll get much there – I haven’t a clue to who to contact at the FAA, so I wish I could be a of more help on that front.  I don’t frequent this site or know the procedures very well.  My hope is others may also report the same thing or a similar occurrence in the area.  I mean there were A LOT of these orbs/lights up there and unless I just happened to be in the exact right place at the right time and nobody else was, I find it hard to believe nobody else saw these odd things in the sky.   I also shot a brief video I’ll enclose for your viewing.  I’m afraid it didn’t come out very well, but you’ll at least get the color and the jist of what I saw.  I wish I could have filmed it in a way that showed them moving, my apologies!  Here’s my 'more in depth' report:   At around 6:15 (18:15)  Facing directly North I witnessed a mass of at least 12 orange/red orbs of lights moving, one after the other, sometimes in almost equal distances from each other, left to right across the sky into the overcast sky.  I gather this would mean they were headed in a southeasterly direction.   I think it’s important to note they seemed to hold a line formation, or follow each other in sometimes equal distances from each other as I mentioned.  But they did not adhere to this formation strictly.  For example, one of the orbs/lights seemed to speed up (or accelerate) to one of its neighboring orbs playfully.  It passed it and then slowed down to match the speed of the orb it passed.   None of the objects stopped completely, however.   I lost contact with them as they travelled into the overcast sky to the east.  I don’t know if that gives an approximate altitude, but they were certainly above the clouds!  They were also moving faster than any plane or vehicle !  I’ve seen before.   Their light was quite beautiful, in subjective words, almost like looking at flickering stars.  I was told they may be balloons of some kind, but I think the best objective evidence or observation going against this is the fact at least one of the orbs clearly maneuvered and accelerated.  (My point of reference was the orb it accelerated to.)  If there's anything else I can do let me know.   Again I'm not really sure who to contact at the FAA, etc.  I don't think we even have a phone book lying around!  If you guys could help me out with this I'd appreciate it.

The temperature was 55 degrees.  There were no clouds over this area of Dallas, and the stars were clearly bright and visual in the background.  There was virtually no light pollution over White Rock Lake this evening and the lake was still and dark.  White Rock Lake Park was mostly deserted in this area, however there were several other people walking along edge of the lake.  Apparently they did not notice the object. I was driving with my wife and south on West Lawther Drive on the West side of White Rock Lake.  White Rock Lake is rimmed with large residential estates on the West side of the park, all facing East and overlooking the lake.  West Lawther Drive winds around the perimeter of White Rock Lake Park on the West side. The orange red light was moving from the East to the SouthEast across the 65 degree horizon and in the general flight path approach for Southwest Airlines into Love Field Airport to the West of White Rock Lake.  There were other airplanes in the approach for Love Field Airport in the general vicinity over White Rock Lake.  The orange-red moving light was noticeable and unusual because there were no strobe lights or white lights as are common with commercial or private aircraft.  The orange-red light appeared in the sky at a 65 degree angle from the road and the light source was the approximate size of the commercial aircraft in the area.  The orange-red light was not moving rapidly, or erratically, but rather deliberately on a particular path and at a speed in common with the other aircraft in the vicinity. The orange-red flying object was not a star, planet or meteor. After viewing this object move through the sky and over White Rock Lake for approximately twenty seconds, the object faded and vanished in mid-air over the lake.  Upon closer observation, the orange-red light appeared to have a composite light source of multiple lights. Given that this area of Dallas is restricted airspace and in the approach path for Love Field Airport, it was highly unusual for any flying craft to have no strobe, and to have turned off its lights and or disappeared. The disappearance of the orange-red flying craft was not immediate, and it appeared to have diminished in size before vanishing, leaving one with the impression that the source of the light gained altitude at an unusually rapid speed and not on a trajectory common with traditional airplanes.  This process took less than several seconds. The sky was scanned for several minutes in an effort to locate the object, however this was unsuccessful. I am a graduate of the University of Virginia and Southern Methodist University and have experience piloting private aircraft.  I am familiar with the appearance of aircraft making an approach to Love Field Airport in this vicinity, and of the identifying lights required of aircraft, and can attest that this object was not a commercial, private or conventional military aircraft.  Furthermore, I have observed meteors, comets and other natural celestial phenomena and this object was neither. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thank you for the reply.  This was a very strange experience.  I intend to contact a few Southwest Airline pilots to ask around if any of their colleagues saw the same on their approach tonight.

It doesn't appear ""natural"" and I do not believe it to be-- as it always is in the same area (starting out at early evening, each night) and by now it certainly should have changed position after this many months. It is bright as if it is generating its own light. Later on, around 10-10:15 the next time we look (it is as if the moments we look away, it decides to move) it has moved lower towards some trees from our vantage point. Within a half hour later it is behind the trees. We go in around 11 pm to go to bed and as we head in to the house, we can see it is still ""glowing"" behind the trees.

While sitting on the back deck of my house I frequently look into the night sky at the stars.  An orange, what can only be described as “fireball”, caught my attention.  I alerted the other 4 adults on the deck to what I was witnessing and they saw it clearly as well.  I’ve witnessed the ISS and Iridium flares many times and this fireball was neither.  What caught my attention as well was the trajectory it was taking, moving from the Southeast to Northwest, which is odd for most satellite movements I’ve witnessed over the years.  It moved at a much slower speed than the ISS would, giving me the impression that if this was a satellite it was at a very high altitude.  The fireball seemed to have a darker center than its surrounding orange haze and about 2 to 3 times the brightness of Venus over the past few months.  Over the course of about 20 seconds the fireball slowly faded to a single point of light, no brighter than a typical satellite seen traversing the! skies, and then finally disappeared toward the horizon. Then, 90 minutes later a second fireball appeared directly overhead and once again I alerted the event to the other 4 people on the deck.  This fireball was much brighter and you could definitely tell the center was darker with this one.  It had the same Southeast to Northwest trajectory.  Again, over the course of about 30 seconds it started to fade out.  But, unlike the first one, it did not fade out to a point of light but instead what appeared to be a black solid object with mass.  My girlfriend was very intrigued by this fact as was I.  I assumed both of these objects were space debris burning up in the atmosphere during a re-entry event.  It had even crossed my mind that perhaps I was seeing the same object given the 90 minute time-span, about the time an object such as the ISS would take to make a complete orbit.  But again, thinking about it the objects appeared to be moving too slow for that to be plausible. Normally I would have just dismissed these sightings as possibly the most intense Iridium flares I have witnessed, burning debris or some sort of satellites I have not seen before. But, after discovering this web site and posting a report of something I saw back in the early 80’s I started reading about the number of fireball sightings since 2010 and thought perhaps my report would be relevant.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,41.3598,-83.1255

Often at my house, since there is a clear view of the sky, I look up and hope to see a shooting star.  On clear nights I often do.    So standing outside my friends home I decide to do the same.  I'm looking south and up to Orion's Belt.  I tilted my head back a little to see above me and I see many objects whizzing around.  The objects are red-orange in color and about twice the size of a star but only a fraction of the brightness.   As bright as something on the edge of a street lights view.  The objects flew like insects fly with sharp and fast darting movements.  The objects were moving quickly and as they were moving around they also all started moving south in direction and within two seconds had formed a large V shape consisting of about 7 red orange objects and a line of 3 following on the left side.  There were no streaks as shooting stars.  There was no sound.   The formation of red orange lights continued what seemed now seemed slowly but smoothly on a southern course gaining height and flying towards Orion's Belt.  I did not look away, I reached for my phone to record video not looking away at all, but it did not load until the objects were out of view.  My friend showed up the literal second they disappeared.  I was still staring up in the sky and I yelled for him to come and look.  By that time the objects in the sky were gone.

I started observing what I assumed would be planes or helicopters, 6 in total, but because it was so dark and no outline was visible, I couldnt figure out what they were.  I then started to look at the lights, figuring there would be a flashing pattern of some kind.  There was no flashing, rather a steady stream of orange light that looked foggy for lack of better words.  This was not due to the weather as it was a clear enough night where the lights were sharp as was observed simultaneously as a smaller plane, headed north east, was very sharp like an led bulb.  It was easy! to look at that plane and see what it was and gauge an elevation and direction of flight, but these other things just kind of hung there for awhile and one by one disappeared from sight.

The sun had just disappeared behind a dark strip of clouds which extended low across the western horizan.  There was also a large blanket of dark clouds overhead which extended westward just far enough to leave a horizontal strip of much brighter and clearer sky between the two dark cloud banks.  With the sun setting behind the lower cloud bank, view of the western horizan was quite clear. In the area of clearer skyline, I suddenly noticed an unusually long, thick, white and roughly-textured chemtrail.  It was descending southward at an angle from the lower edge of the overhead cloud and then sharply turned back to continue angled descent toward the north.  The turn was so sharp that the chemtrail, just beginning it's northward descent, was beginning to form a ""V"" tipped sideways.  I also noted quite visible shadow outlining of the chemtrail, but I'm certain that the sunset occurring in the background was responsible for that. As I said before, the lower area of the chemtrail was just beginning it's northward descent.  Fascinated by the unusual formation, I realized that the lower section was being formed as I watched.  I can only speculate at how far away this chemtrail was from my location.  But Nebraska skies are typically clear for great distances and therefore, I'd speculate that it was forming over the south-western Nebraska airspace between McCook and North Platte. Because of the distance, I could not descern what was forming the chemtrail.  However, the object was obviously descending very quickly, disappearing behind the lower cloud bank within a matter of less than 15 seconds from initiation of the turn.  Given my estimation of the distance being nearly 100 miles from my current location, whatever was creating this formation had to be traveling very fast.  For a moment, I wondered if it were a meteor.  But those do not reverse course.  As soon as the object disappeared behind the cloud bank, the! entire chemtrail, which later remained remarkably solid in appearance until full sunset, turned black.  Again, I assume this was due to shadowing from the sun setting behind it. Now these are the reasons I think I was seeing something unusual.  First, the airports across this region of Nebraska are limited in aircraft size and do not typically handle large aircraft landings.  The angle of descent of the object made it appear as though it were indeed in the process of landing.  Smaller jets which are typical to airports in this region only rarely create visible chemtrails.  While larger jets do fly over the area on a regular basis, they appear to be at a much greater altitude, make no obvious descent, produce only thin and straight chemtrails, and only make gradual turns.  Additionally, I home school my teen son and we frequently watch videos on flight, space exploration and physics.  What I witnessed strongly reminded me of videos I've seen of the space shuttle descent.  But I have no explanation for the sharp turn. Total observation time covered 25 minutes travel time.  Total observation time of the actual partial chemtrail being formed was less than 15 seconds. While it is always possible that I was simply seeing an unusual aircraft maneuvering through our air space, my instincts tell me otherwise.

Turning to the window, I observed a set of bright colored lights, red and green, moving slowly across the sky. They were an unusual color of red and green, like no lights I've ever seen in the sky before in all of my forty plus years. These lights were constant, not flashing or blinking. What I was seeing was obviously not a helicopter, plane or balloon.  It was utterly strange both in its appearance and in its motions, which were unlike the motions of any conventional object seen in the skies.  There were two light sources, one red and the other green, which were aligned horizontally to one another and which retained a constant spatial relation to one another as they moved across the sky. I saw no actual object, just these two lights moving together in very close and fixed proximity to one another, as if they were emitted from the same object (if indeed there was an object). Astonished and curious, I ran outside, not stopping to put on my shoes or coat.  I stood in the snow wearing just my socks (I wanted a good look, and time was short).  I ran outside because the lights were passing directly over my house and the window view would not have allowed me to watch the mysterious ""object"" (if these lights were emitted from an object). I sensed something being emitted from this ""object"" which was not light, which was very mysterious, and which I do not know quite how to describe or explain.   Perhaps I was feeling sub-audible sound waves, which my body could feel though I could not hear these waves?   I had the strange thought that somehow this thing was aware of my observation of it, but I must admit that this is just a speculation.  I have no actual evidence for this, and might have merely imagined this. I felt as if I were affected mysteriously by the thing, but just how I cannot say.  I felt something strange and perhaps impossible to describe. It affected my senses, especially my hearing, which seemed to be strangely diminished, as if some sort of sub-audible, low frequency sound were emitted from this ""object."" The size of the apparently connected lights varied as the ""object"" moved across the sky.  At maximum, at its nearest approach, would be contained by a two inch ring held at arm's length from my eyes. At that moment when I had a feeling that the ""object"" were aware of my observation of it, it turned and reversed course, its flight behavior utterly unlike any object I've ever seen before; not fitting with helicopters or planes, etc.  The ""object"" did not appear to emit sound audible to my hearing, as a plane or helicopter would have under similar conditions. I told my partner (we live together) about this experience by phone, and we talked about it further when he returned home.  As we sat together in our living room discussing it, I was facing a window.  Then it appeared again!  This was well over an hour later, but the time is uncertain. (I didn't look at the clock.) I pointed it out to my partner, who also saw this ""object,"" but only through the window, and at greater distance than the closest proximity of my observation earlier that evening. It was unusual enough an experience that I decided to use the internet to explore whether others have seen and reported this, perhaps in the news.  I used search engines to explore this question, and this is how I came to discover this forum for posting such experiences.",2013-03-03T00:00:00,35.661082683982684,-105.95390714285715

I saw out my back windows (facing west) a large bright yellow light. It was on a path to come right over our house, so thinking it was a helicopter i got up and walked out the back door to watch it fly over. Once outside i knew it was not a helicopter because there was no noise – i yelled for my grandson and my daughter to come see what i was looking at. Points to note: I live in the northwest region of a major metropolitan area. There are famer  fields a short distance away (to the west the direction of what i saw) – Also i am northwest of an major international airport and during my sighting i could see a commercial plane off in the distance in the same line of sight that we were looking at. (they were landing from the west that night – flying east on approach) There was not a cloud in the sky it was a beautiful night with a beautiful full moon off to the south. The large yellow light seemed bigger then what a helicopter or plane light would illuminated in the beginning.( My grandson who is  5 said it was a fire in the sky).  The large yellow light then gave way to a green and red light which was decreasing in size.  Although it was still coming straight towards us, it was not a perfectly straight line that it travelled. It seemed to move from side to side ever so slightly.  The red light was getting smaller and for a few seconds the green light seemed to be a straight line of green light going through the red light. (still not any noise whatsoever). The green light gave way to only the red light which continued to shrink in size until it was almost out of sight. At this point it changed direction not heading towards us but turned on a 90 degree angle and started heading north. Now it get hard to explain – the small red dot now seemed to be part of a larger translucent type of oval object that if you were not looking right at you probably would not see.  The oval did not glow although it gave off the smallest shade of light – It was a different colour than the night sky, my daughter and i watched it until it went out of sight behind trees. I do not know what we saw other than to say that i am a keen observer of my surroundings – & i have never seen anything like this before.

I recorded this 10 minute video using my Sony Cyber Shot H70 Digital Video Camera using the best possible quality at 720p with Bionz technology and zoomed in as close as possible using 10X optical zoom.    THIS IS NOT A HOAX, nor is it ANY kind of crappy CGI effects either.  This footage is 100% authentic and i have the original film still on my 4GB TDK SD memory card which is now kept in a safe and secret location.  This is the best sighting and footage captured of a UFO in the year 2012.   What makes this event unique and special is that the space ship craft appears to be morphing, changing size and shape as the lights in the video appear to be all over the place from one to another,   ALSO changing colors from standard white to BLUE and possible other colors too.  The object appeared to be moving at a steady speed before vanishing behin! d a tall apartment tower block next to some mountains...

We dropped our gear to make a fire and surveyed the night sky.  To our surprise we saw some orange glowing globes floating in a fairly straight line down the coast.  They were approximately 30 degrees up from the horizon.

We saw airplanes and shooting stars during the evening which did not compare to the size of the globes.  The globes appeared to be! at least ten times larger than the shooting stars and had no tail.  They were several times larger than the lights of any of the airplanes we saw.   We could not tell the distance from the beach.

Triangular in shape, fast, and absent of sound. My girlfriend and I were enjoying a cigarette before bed after enjoying a beautiful evening outdoors.  The weather was perfect and stars were clearly visible in the nights sky.  Just as we were about to walk in to call it a night, I noticed a shooting star streak through the nights sky, and pointed it out to my girlfriend.  Almost immediately following this the neighbors began having a bit of a verbal dispute and we decided to listen to the drunken barrage coming from next door. We stayed very quiet and made sure we were not noticed.  I happened to be gazing up at the heavens and listening when the sighting occurred. I thought a satellite very high in the atmosphere was passing over head initially, until the distorted image made itself apparent.  The size of this object was larger than any plane and well under 1000 feet in altitude.  Even during the neighbors bickering and our attempts to be quiet, I let out a yell of excitement and pointed to this massive, cloaked aircraft floating along at an incredible clip with absolutely no sound emanating from an engine.  Not even a hum. How I could be so fooled to think that initially this incredible technological marvel was a satellite thousands of feet in the air is incredible.  Once it became clear to me that this was an immensely sized UFO cloaking itself with the nights sky I was Damn near hysterical.  My girlfriend was unable to spot it, even following my fingers direction.  I think it simply fooled her vision as it had mine initially.  Within the span of time of roughly 10 - 15 seconds it had disappeared from our line of sight due to tree lines. The object was moving directly North West towards Highway 41 and Austin Straubel airport in Green Bay.  I cannot stress enough that the size and shape of this craft were abundantly clear to me.  I had 2 drinks over the entire duration of the evening, and at the time of sighting this object, I was completely sober and coherent.  The craft was an elongated triangle with rounded edges cruising at a very high speed, low altitude, and without a sound. Just typing this report is not enough for me at this point.  I need to understand what this was.  Either a highly sophisticated government project, or (no offense to our human intellect) an extra terrestrial craft, which I find to be more feasible.  Please let me know if anyone else had a sighting, or knows of anyone that may have seen this.  I will be contacting Austin Straubel tomorrow to see if their radar had caught something out of the ordinary. Honestly, it's hard to be skeptical of anything going forward.

It was hovering 1/2 mile south of Ray Road and somewhere east of Alma School Road, though it's hard to tell how far away it was.  It was a clear night, the moon was bright and just past full, and was located about 15 degrees to the south and about 5 degrees above the object. Because I had seen this twice, and in the same part of the sky, I set my camcorder on a tripod, turned it on, and placed it on the porch around 11pm.  On June 15, 2012, I captured the object again, and this time from the start.  However, it only appears as the orb and does not first exhibit the line of lights as I had seen before.  Near the end of this second video, some lines are noticeable going into the object from the left and right side near the bottom. This has to be something explainable simply because it keeps appearing at the same time and in the same location.   Nobody else appears to be reporting it, and if I didn't have videos of it, I wouldn't be either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness states that the date of the sighting, indicated above, is approximate.

I saw her outside and asked what she was looking at.  She explained that she wanted to hear what these aircraft sounded like.   I joined her outside on the deck to check it out.  We were unable to hear any sound like jets or helicopters.   We see a lot of aircraft from our house, which overlooks Greenlake as a lot of air traffic comes in from the north when the south wind prevails.  The breeze we had this night was from the north.  The sky was clear for the first time in days and we were able to see a series of orange orb - like lights that seemed to come up from the NE horizon, maintain speed as if it was an aircraft and head south while gaining altitude.  We could see 2 or 3 at a time.  They did not blink or flash like aircraft usually do.   As they got about due east, they would fade out and new ones would appear coming from the same direction.   I ran upstairs, got my little camera and took a few photos and a little bit of video while we watched for approx. 10 minutes.   At one point, we could see a small aircraft with its flashing lights that appeared to be much closer to us than the ""orbs"" heading south.  We probably saw 15-20 lights in all. It would be very difficult to tell the distance – but we both figured at least about 5 miles away – but it’s only a guess. After the sighting, I turned on the news, thinking I’d see some explanation, but nothing was reported.  Checked the net first thing this a.m.; nothing there. We have a clear view of  Greenlake and the Cascade mountains from our deck , kitchen and upstairs and had even commented earlier in the day how clear the view was.

It appeared to be a star, but was much much brighter than any other star, and looking closer, I saw that the light source was 'twinkling' various many different colors other than white, mainly red, green, and blue. I cannot stress how much brighter this light was compared to the other stars in the sky, including the big dipper which appeared large in the sky and was directly overhead.  I also cannot stress how colorful the light was.  I was literally in awe trying to explain it to myself. It was not a radio tower, with a distinctive, predictable white or red blinking. It was not a helicopter or an airplane, as it was completely stationary in the sky and appeared to be very far away.  Only the brightness of the object could have made it appear to be within the atmosphere. In awe of and unable to explain what I was looking at, I went back inside to grab some other people, but when we went outside the light was gone. I'm not sure what it was.  One of my theories is that I witnessed the images of the death of a star, a supernova, however many light years away it was, that were just now reaching Earth.

It was obviously not an airplane and my thought was it was probably a large white balloon.   I took out a pair of binoculars I had with me to get a better look at it.  Balloons typically have strings attached and rock a bit due to being heavier at the bottom but this did not.  It just appeared to be a white orb....at first. The object then seemed to stop moving west and seemed to begin to ascend a bit, then remaining suspended in the same location for about 10-15 minutes.  During this time it would occasionally slowly change from white to glowing orange, and back.  It did this two or three times.  It then began to move back in the direction from which it came, and then towards me.  I believe at this point it was higher than it had initially been.  It changed to orange one more time, and back to white, and then I lost track of it after I put the binoculars down to rest my arms. I don't believe this was a balloon as it did not exhibit a string or characteristic rocking.  I believe the orange coloring was emitted light rather than reflected light, because the sun was not low enough in the sky to cause an orange reflection, the change from white to orange to white occurred slower than expected if it were an object turning such to reflect light, and when objects in the sky reflect light, the intensity usually increases to a bright point quickly, and then decreases quickly.  This object did none of these things. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2013-02-18T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

On Saturday evening, Feb 16, 2013, I was driving to the grocery store between 9:00 and 9:30 PM.  I was not wearing my watch. It was a cold night, and rather dark (except for street lights and the moon). A number of airplanes (airliners, I presume) were in the sky, landing or taking off from the MSP airport, located towards the east. There is no military airport in the area, but Navy Reserve and Air National Guard planes used to be based there (and possibly still are - I don't know).  Many decades ago, the Navy based Panther jets and some other planes there, and the ANG based F-89 Scorpions, C-119 Flying Boxcars, T-33s, and some other planes at their side of the airport. [Note: Some models of the F-89 were capable of carrying the Genie air-to-air nuclear-tipped guided missile.  I don't know if our local F-89s were equipped with any Genie's. The Genie went into service in July, 1957. The F-89 is now long obsolete, and the Genie probably is, as well.]  The point is that our ""civilian"" airport has not been purely civilian, over the years, and there's a chance that some of the ANG Scorpions carried nuclear weapons. Not too likely, but possible. As I proceeded down Noble Avenue, a few blocks from home, I noticed something in the sky in a southeast direction, viewed between obscuring trees. There appeared to be a clump of stars and lights. I noted that if some of them were stars, they were unusually clear and bright - like one would see in the country - not the city. I vaguely recall that the pattern of stars looked like the Big Dipper, but it could NOT have been the Big Dipper in such a southeast location. I mention it only because it attracted my attention - not because I think the Big Dipper moved. Then I noticed that some ""extra stars"", so to speak, were orange. I have never seen orange stars before, and doubt that any exist. Curious, I pulled over as soon as I could (there was no traffic), and viewed the scene between the trees while stopped. I saw 3 orange lights in an arrowhead shape slowly moving westward - possibly slightly north (west-northwest).  For a movement reference point, I used a utility line (probably a cable TV line or phone line), and watched them as they slowly passed over the utility line, with the point of the arrow head leading the way. There were no red-white-green navigation lights or anti-collision lights visible (strobe lights), nor any flashing red lights on, or near, any of the objects. I did not hear any noise, as far as I know, but any noise would probably have been drowned out by the several airliners visible in the 25-mile vicinity.  (It looked like a busy night for air traffic). Airline passengers could probably have seen the lights if the plane was northbound or southbound, by looking up and towards the the east (when I saw them). After perhaps 15 seconds, they disappeared either behind some light clouds or a tree (I don't remember), so I headed to the nearby school parking lot to get a better view, in case they were still visible.  Unfortunately, they had vanished, probably behind a large area of broken clouds.  I remained there in my car for a few minutes, but never saw them again. Once I arrived at the grocery store parking lot, about 5 minutes later, I did scan the sky for a while after exiting the car, but just saw the usual broken clouds and the moon.  It was very cold, and I didn't stand there for long. I don't know if the lights were connected to a large object. All I saw were the orange lights, and didn't notice any stars being blacked-out.  In terms of observing, the conditions were terrible, but at least I saw the silent, beautiful lights for a little while.  ================================================================== ==================================================================  [NOTE: Peter, the directions on your web page are almost impossible to read. In fact, I could **NOT** read them.  They are tiny red letters on a gray background.  I had to do a copy-and-paste of the requested date format to a TXT document, and enlarge the letters to read:  ""Use MM/DD/YY format.."" I guessed at the formats for the other boxes because I couldn't read those tiny red letters, either. If your webmaster designed the page, he did a TERRIBLE JOB!!!!  Making instructions legible is BASIC and ELEMENTARY, and is not ROCKET SCIENCE.  You should have him fix it with much larger font and some other color.  In fact, you could lighten or eliminate the gray background.  It doesn't need to be there.  But the gray background could stay if the tiny red letters are junked - as they should be.  The black letters stand out well (oddly enough) and are large enough.  What was he smoking when he designed it???  I'm running Internet Explorer V8 (IE8) under Windows/XP SP3.  The view size is 100%.  When I enlarged it to 150% size by using the ZOOM tool, I could STILL hardly read the red letters!!

They moved silently, at first at a low steady altitude.  They were to the west of me, not directly overhead.  We live close to a major airport (CVG) but these were not moving in an usual direction for normal air traffic patterns and also there is not any commercial air traffic at 1130pm on a Sunday night at CVG.

It was somewhere between 1:40-1:45 am.  I was looking at the stars noticing that the sky was very clear.  I was looking at Orion's belt when a very subtle ""shift"" or motion near it. It was very subtle, but as I focused my attention on it, I noticed it was a perfect v-shape. My instant thought was that it was geese because of the shape, but as I watched I was thinking to myself ""no way"" because it was travelling too fast, and the shape was a PERFECT v with no fluctuation. It appeared to be a solid V-shaped object, based on the subtle line of the edge I could distinguish. I could only for certain see the V edges, and not sure about a third edge. It appeared solid and uniform.  I also could not make out any individual birds or wings, nor was there any sound that you would hear when geese fly by overhead. There was no sound at all.  I have never seen a flock of geese fly so perfectly in a v formation and that quickly.  It was  black on black against the night sky. I could barely make it out and would have NEVER noticed if it hadn't come into a very small field of vision while I was looking at the stars. Even as I told myself it must be geese, something about it... I can't put into words ....made me feel like it definitely wasn't. It spooked me. In those few seconds my mind was racing to rationalize it. the V was, however, flying south-east, a direction I assume geese would fly this time of year. But it seemed to be a very large dark triangle/boomerang shaped object flying about the altitude of a regular plane and travelling quickly, maybe similar speed to some planes. I'm not good at giving estimates on size, or even distance in the sky, so could be unreliable on measurements. I only got about 4-5 seconds of being able to see it before it blended into the night sky/too far away.  If it were geese, it seems like they would have been low enough to hear AND see (full or nearly full moon), and the speed was too great. I've never seen geese fly that perfectly in unison, either.  Maybe it was military aircraft??",2012-10-30T00:00:00,30.594153829787235,-96.30467468085106

A shower and breakfast thirty minuets earlier, had me wide awake and ready for my workday.  My first thought was that it must be stars still visable in newly lightening  dawn sky.    I continued  my normal route for another mile and could still see the three bright lights in the distance.  I then pulled into the almost empty wall mart shopping center parking lot and stopped at a point where I could view the lights with no obstructions.   The viewpoint at this time looked as if the three lights were lining up perfectly in the distance in a verticle line.  It appeared as if they were becon lights on a new super tall cellular tower or something of that nature.  Thinking for about thirty more seconds as i continued to observe the lights, that becon lights for towers are red and flash so that wasn't it.   The bright white lights dissappered all at once. I obsreved the skies in that direction for about three or four more minutes and saw nothing else, but the beautiful morning sky.  I have no idea what the objects are, or were.  I can honestly say it was very cool and made my day whatever it was.  I have lived in this area for my whole life and it was really unusual for the morning skies around here.

Shortly after I stepped outside, I observed several (approximately 5 or 6) orange or red round objects in the sky to the north of our apartment.  For purposes of orientation, I can say that the objects were visible north of the intersection of Allen Rd. and Willow Knolls Rd. over that area’s car dealerships (Lexus, Toyota, Nissan).  The objects were in some sort of pattern, possibly a diamond shape.  At first I thought the pattern looked like a fireworks display of some sort, but I heard no explosions.  In fact, I did not hear any noise at all coming from the area.  I pointed the objects out to my wife and she began trying to take photos and video with my cellular phone.  Unfortunately, upon review of the video, the objects were not visible.  We also saw a male exit a vehicle up the road (unknown how many passengers we! re in the car) from our apartment to look at the objects, but we did not speak to each other. As we continued to observe the objects in the sky, we noticed that some of the objects would suddenly fade away.  However, we also saw new orange/red round objects rising up from the ground in the same area north of our apartment.  While they were ascending, I noticed that the objects hovered in a manner that was somewhat similar to helicopters. But, I have never seen helicopters move quite like this and I can’t imagine why helicopters would be forming patterns in the sky at night.  The rising objects then joined the other objects before they also vanished.  By about 2305 hrs, all of the objects were gone.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,40.73239708939709,-89.61464490644491

Then smaller lights started appearing out of no where, and within 5 minutes went for smaller orange/red lights into these large lights hovering and would slowly move then stop and hover some more all while turning brighter and brighter and larger, almost like they were going to burst.

They all shined bright orange and all together in the same area together, kind of in random positions and moved around slowly and smoothly. they all started to disappear after 1 minute or 2 fading away and left only one.

I went out to my porch for a better look and was shocked to see a line of 7 or 8 red lights (about the size and brightness of Venus- only red) going from the West quadrant of the sky to the North quadrant of the sky. It was taking each of them about 20 or 30 seconds to go from due West to due North.   Once they got to due North the red lights would just hover in one place, which confirmed that they weren't airplanes.  Naturally, I assumed they were helicopters, but I couldn't hear anything and they just kept coming and coming from some point in the western sky  to this area in the Northern sky where they would sit stationary in a cluster.  After about 10-20 seconds of not moving, each red light would just go out, but then more would come to take their place. The cluster of stationary red lights never got bigger than 5 or 6 lights ! hovering together at a time.

I noticed a flashing red light in the sky and figured it was a plane, since there are always planes from O’Hare in the area.  When I looked closer I saw that it had no other lights, it was simply a flashing red light which I don’t remember ever seeing on any plane before. Then I told my friend to look and he saw it too, it was quite obvious.  We watched as it flew in a wide arc towards us.  As I said I see plenty of planes all the time.  It seemed to be at a pretty high altitude, not at a really high cruising altitude but definitely not low like a landing plane would be. It seemed to be moving pretty fast too. Once it was facing us, we could make out that there were 2 blinking red lights side by side, clearly one singular object.  Eventually it went directly overhead and we could see that there were 2 much dimmer lights in roughly the same places as the red ones.  These lights were blue or green, one was slightly brighter than the other.  From far away you couldn’t see these lights at all. I couldn’t make out any kind of shape of the craft. When it was travelling overheard we started to hear a jet engine, but it was pretty quiet and seemed to be emanating from far behind the aircraft, I assume because it was travelling at a high speed. It went on traveling west to east, in the direction of Lake Michigan until it was out of sight.  My friend and I waited outside for 5 or 10 minutes when I noticed the same flashing red lights again, at the same altitude, but this time they were traveling in the opposite direction.  It seemed to make the same wide arc as before but in reverse, eventually flying out of sight to the south or southeast. Currently there is the nato meeting going on downtown and the last few days I’ve heard plenty of military helicopters around this area and these lights just make it much weirder.  I can’t say for sure that these lights are related but it doesn’t seem like a coincidence, especially considering that whatever I saw was apparently staying over the area.

Not an aircraft! First off, I have been working in the aviation industry for the past 12 years, so I know what an aircraft looks like. What we saw, was not an aircraft!  Further more, I have a keen interest in astronomy and often spend time star gazing, this was not a meteor fireball either!   I was standing outside having my evening cigarette, when I noticed a large (street light sized) light moving fairly fast (about 6-8 seconds to cover an arc stretching 20 deg off the horizon from the West to 30deg on the eastern horizon, 45 deg inclination) overhead.  I immediately called my wife and she then had a couple of seconds to observe the object as well.  We both agreed this is not something normal. The light was closer to red than orange, flashing slightly in intensity but never disappearing. No sound accompanied the object.  The sky was mostly overcast, I would say 7/8 coverage with broken patches at various heights.  It seemed like the light was higher than the lower cloud base which I would estimate at 1000' AGL (5'500 AMSL) but still shone through. Given the size of this fireball object, if it was an aircraft or helicopter, your would definitely have heard its engines. This thing w absolutely quiet. Whilst watching the light pass, a commercial airliner passed overhead and we had a brief moment where we could directly compare the light to the aircraft.  The crew in that aircraft must have seen it too! The lack of sound from the light was in complete contrast to the sound of the aircraft passing.  You could clearly make out the shape of the aircraft as well with the various navigation lights. The light moved from the East towards a Western direction in an arching line, then out of sight behind tree cover. I swear, I've never seen anything like this before! Yes, logically the red port light of an aircraft would fit the angle we were seeing this object, but it does not account for the size of it nor the manner in which it shone. The best way to describe it, is like a ever so lightly flashing meteor fireball on a clear sky without the distinctive tail and accompanying bits breaking off from ablation. ",2012-12-20T00:00:00,,

Dozens (if not more) of people called local news outlets to report them.  When the news outlets contacted RDU airport, they were told that helicopters were conducting ""military exercises"" and that there was ""no threat to public safety,"" and ""nothing to worry about."" Witnesses (myself, my adult daughter and my sister included) all saw unidentified craft that sometimes hovered, sometimes darted, and that moved at times with incredible speed.  Some of the crafts had only white lights, some had only red lights, some had only intermittent strobes and were completely dark for as much as three to five seconds at a time. First we saw three unidentified craft over the area near Six Forks Road in North Raleigh.  They had white lights and moved very slowly at first.  As we continued to watch them, the left and right aircraft turned off their white lights and turned on much dimmer red lights, at the same time the middle craft became very bright white.   Then they all three went almost dark, and suddenly sped from the Six Forks area, crossing over Falls of Neuse Rd and moving over toward Atlantic Avenue/Capital Blvd at an incredible rate of speed, then suddenly slowed down and resumed moving slowly, at very low altitude, and again with white lights. We then left the area and travelled toward Durham on I-540.   Suddenly the sky was filled with white strobe lights!  The lights would go dark for as much as three to five seconds at a time - there were at least 12 to 15 of these craft and they were moving slowly and at a low to moderate altitude (1000 feet?). While viewing these, three triangular shaped craft with red lights only appeared back toward the airport, at a higher altitude and approximately 45 degrees away from the objects with the strobe lights.  The strobe lights appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly - the red objects were moving more quickly, toward the southwest.   Soon two longer craft appeared in between, shaped almost like long-wing gliders, with a row of white lights down the central part of the object and red flashing lights on each end.  We would occasionlly see commercial airliners landing and/or taking off, and these were obviously not similar to those. At no time did we hear any noise from any of the objects, even those we were closest to.  For the further objects we were not close enough that we would have expected to hear anything.

I looked up at the sky and saw a bright, red light which seemed to be traveling upward.   At first I thought it was some sort of flare, but the light quickly became brighter and traveled in my direction.  I quickly went to get my grandmother to show her the UFO.  She briskly walked outside and looked at where I pointed, and she stood there staring with intense curiosity at the object.   At this point, the object seemed to be almost directly above us, but it seemed to be going higher and higher.   Then, wanting even more witnesses, I ran to my house to get my mother.  I excitedly told her there was a UFO outside, and she followed me back outside. The object was now farther away, more towards the south.   My mother ran inside to get a pair of binoculars, but by the time she returned, the object had almost completely faded away.  This all happened throughout the course of approximately three minutes.

They seemed to be completely still except for the lights blinking.  They were blinking primarily white with intermitting red.

I went out fishing last night on the Kankakee River and miles off into the distance I could see a pretty severe storm moving southeast.  Within about 30 minutes the storm was about 10 miles from me with huge clouds billowing over, it was about this time 22:00 I noticed a very dull blue oval/ circular object just sitting there beyond the clouds and lightning...  I kept my eyes fixated on the object hoping that lightning would strike and help illuminate the object so I could see it better.  The odd thing was that this is the middle of the night, the object was not bright but it was distinctly blue in the night sky, almost like some kind of aurora... every time lightning would flash the object disappeared for about 1 minute and then returns to the same location in the sky.  It moved from left to right. after the object had been sitting there in the sky stationary for about 5 minutes lightning started crashing everywhere as the storm got closer to where I was at, bu! t this time I could still see the object, it never disappeared... this may sound crazy but then things got uncomfortably weird for me, being that I’ve had a sighting about 2 and a half years ago in Monticello Indiana.  But anyways, lightning started crashing around this object only though it was lightning I have never seen in my entire life.  The bolts that would flash were a nearly perfect cylindrical shape, no thunder at the time and minimal wind. after this ""circular flashes"" it appeared if the blue object had almost double it original size, yet still sitting there almost as if it had slowly transformed... these weren’t like average lightning strikes because the never went down and they never went up, just these circular flashes. By now the storm is starting to get bad but the object still remains, intrigued and wanting to continue to watch out I sit out there for about another 10 minutes still seeing these circular lightning bolts, my best description of the lightning wou! ld be that it was a fire orange color and when it'd flash it w! as like an outline of a circle... the object eventually became its original size again about the size of an apple if you were holding it out in front of your face.. As I was packing up all my belongings to head inside I started to hear a humming sound, it wasn’t loud, a soft subtle hum.

I wented a photograph of the Waterury Clock Tower and the city of Waterury, CT. I drove to Waterbury Hospital on a hill to shoot towards the tower. I didn't really notice anything unusual. Just a clear starry night. I took the first photograph and somethig didn't hit me right. I looked at the back of the camera and there were specks on the picture. I sword I tripoded should of been clear. So I went to whip out a lens cleaner and a white car with a black gentlemen in an expensive suit drove up. He asked what I was doing? I told him,"" I wanted a night time shot of the Clock Twoer and Waterbury."" He said,""Oh, Alright then... Be careful"". then drove off. I drove to several more locations taking photographs. I think I have these ojects in at least 10 photographs. I'm a professional photographer. I have photographed at night. I repointed the camera and clicked off three more photos after the man left.  Then I left that spot.  Specks in all of them. I was disappoited! . Then drove to a street across the street from Kennedy HS:  Saw a view of the city. Took some shots. Also Off of congress st and that area.. In one of the photos  noticed what I thought was a thumb spot. With what looked like vapor coming from ehind the tree. I checked the lens it was clear. I Cotinued on my way to Wall St. I spent two hours photographing that night. I didn't go up to Holy Land the area spooked me so I turned around. I would shoot and something would just hit me wrong so I'd back up take another shot. So many locations I have three shots of the same photograph. I just figured I sort it out when I got home. I got home looked at the back of the camera noticed the specks pulled it in. It wa 3:00am now. I thought I was seeing things. Went to ed put the photographs on the computer called teh newspaper. They said in light of what happened at Banta Lake two weeks prior they wanted to see the photos. I asked what happened? She thought I was kidding. I told her I do! n't watch much t or read the newspaper. I go to the library. I! 'm a rea der. She asked to see the photographs.I e-mailed them to the newspaper. She said there photographer said street light. I told them he didn't know what he was speaking about. She said wind dust motion. Then she said,""I really think you need to send these off to nasa."" I did. My friend directed me to this website and suggested reporting it. I didn't see anything unusual. Except a man in very well dressed at 11:30 pm. I have extremely good hearing. I was bothered that I didn't hear his car. Come or go for that matter. I also didn't recall seeing his car in the parking lot or leave it. Very unusual for me. Especially at that hour of night. When I would look up at the sky it just seemed like bright yellow stars. Maye a bit brighter than normal. But Not sure as we've had so much rain; it could of just seemed brighter. When these photographs are blown up you can make out a ring of what appears to be bright light around a disk like object. I really thought it looked almost mirror im! age in one shot when I blew it up I realized there wre more. I intially thought 3-4. But I realized there were 9-11. I wen tout to get these photographs for my sisters website. Her book will be coming out in Jan. So I really needed these to be spotless. I just wanted city shots and go home. On some level I think I was processing something wasn't just right as I was gettig annoyed by the crap coming across the lens. It definitely made for a longer night than I anticipated. I can literally recall thinking; now I've got extra work to photoshop this crap out of here! Great! Once I saw what I had I did't touch those photographs. That's it. Sorry not much help. It seems there are different shapes ad also from a photograph on your site I may have more of them than I originally thought in these photographs. Also, I didn't really hear anything. Other than it wa a very busy night for the police it seems. The sirenes were laring it seems all night long. Which was wierd. I don't really! recall seeing a lot of people out. But the cop cars were ever! ywhere i t seemed. Especially in the Wall Street and Cook Street areas of the city. I do rememer turning off the car radio because of static. Also, I did notice a lot of yellow and blue stars in the sky that night",2012-05-13T00:00:00,41.55679782082325,-73.03441525423729

The disappearance of the object/craft is always at the same point from our perspective, being nearly due east.

I will note in all seriousness however, that twice in the past few years I mistakenly asked my son to get a camera and  each time I did this, the objects disappeared and did not reappear for many months.  I will let those of a more evolved intelligence deliberate on why this happens.  However, I will not make that mistake again; as in to attempt to document on film such an object and simply enjoy it for the show it provides us.",2012-11-04T00:00:00,34.68,-93.6301

I then noticed 3 aircraft that appeared to either be traveling in formation with the white object, or chasing it, coming up from the North of the object. After about 10 seconds, I could make out individual strobes on the 3 aircraft, and a blinking red light on just one of them.  The original object was solid white, not blinking or pulsing, and did not have any red or green lights to it.  The intensity of the white light never varied. About 10 seconds after this, the aircraft on the Northern end of the ""formation"" of 3 sped up, and placed itself on the Southeastern tip of the formation, and closest to the white object. About now, I could make out the body of the aircraft that appeared to be in the middle of the formation, and saw reflections from it’s strobe on the bottom of the airframe. The objects proceeded directly South, with the white light leading the group and the 3 aircraft in apparent formation back to its North, Southeast and West.  The 3 aircraft following the unblinking white light never once overtook the (object), but stayed to its North, East and West, even when the Northern aircraft sped up to overtake the other two!  I cannot say for sure, but, I thought I could make out some type of structure to the object emitting the white light, because of the moon shining onto it.  Also, I cannot prove this, but, it kind of looked like the 3 aircraft in pursuit of the white light were staging themselves in position to visually observe the white object.  That is just my appreciation of what I saw, and how the 4 objects were traveling in relation to one another. This did not appear to be a satellite, and it certainly was not a planet or a star!  The entire time I observed the white light, and the 3 aircraft following (or chasing it), was about 90 seconds.   My sighting ended when the lights went behinds a light cloud haze.

Time was between 5:30-5:45pm EST.   Sighting took about 3 seconds, it almost looked like a shooting star (but a bit slower) and the most intriguing part was its shape and rate of speed.

While coming out of an establishment on Union Rd near Genesee St, I observed a orangish, red, glowing round object about 800ft in the sky.  During the first moments of observing this object, I was carefully trying to figure out what it could be.  There were no strobe lights on it and no other colored lights, and it made no sound.  I first thought that it could be someone on a self-propelled hang glider with a light attatched to it, or even a hot air balloon; until I noticed the object almost come to a complete stand still in the sky with no loss in elevation.  Right at that moment out of the corner of my eye, from the right side, I noticed a second similar object moving quickly towards the first object that was hovering. It looked like the first object had waited for the second one to catch up.  Right when they got closer together, they both began to rise in unison. It was right at that time that the Buffalo Airport was landing planes and without realizing it at first, these two objects were in the glide path of the jet that was about to land. The pilot of the landing jet had to see these two objects as they were in his direct line of sight while he was landing.  The Buffalo tower must have seen them also.  So these two round glowing balls of light rose up to get out of the way of the incoming jet.  As the jet passed underneath them, they continued to rise at a high rate of speed; disappearing in seconds.  These two object had intelligent motion.  First, one slowed down and waited for the other; then they rose up to get out of the way of an oncoming jet, then they ascended at rate of speed never seen before into the night sky.  No aircraft, glider, hellicopter, or balloon could have did what I seen these two objects do.",2012-06-20T00:00:00,,

It seemed to be turning towards me at the time and was at about my 10 o'clock.  The light it was emanating was reminiscent of the light from Venus in early morning.  My first reaction was that it was unusual but then I considered the possibility that it was a helicopter or airplane. It’s movements changed from stationary to large dramatic circular motions.  The light would also change from small (appeared to be 3 small lights) to one big wide and much brighter light.  I tried to find a good place to stop but could not so I hoped on the 5 north and pulled off on the next exit.  I watched it in my rear view mirror the whole time.  I pulled to the end of a dead end street and attempted to get some video of the object.  There was another person parked not far from where I stopped.  I watched it continue to bounce and dance in strange patterns with its ever changing brightness and altitude. I filmed with my camera phone zoomed in as far as it could go.  Unfortunately it does freeze several times but the movement is still apparent. I was approximately 1 mile north of where I first spotted it.  As I was heading back to my car the other car that was parked pulled up and the gentleman had a video camera.  He addressed me by saying, “ what the hell is that thing?”   I told him I didn't know but that I thought it almost looked like a kite with lights attached.  He pointed out that it was really large as it was clearly viewable from over a mile away.  He said he was heading south to attempt to get a better view. I did the same and got on the 5 south back towards Dana Point.  I watched it carefully and its movement became incredibly dramatic with major altitude and brightness shifts.

One and as soon as the second was lit then the third.  Then the first faded, then the second, then third.

On Sunday July 1, 2012 in King county just outside the city limits of Seattle, Washington, at approximately 10:50 pm, my husband glanced out of the front window and made an unusually strong exclamation ""what is that"" so I immediately turned around to look out the window as well.   We have large picture windows which join at the NE corner of the house in our living room and we were each seated on either side of the end table with lamp situated in the corner of the window.  I saw a large glowing yellow/orange kind of shield shaped object with a flame in the middle moving fairly swiftly and smoothly at tree level I jumped up to move quickly to the windows on the side of the house and and back patio windows to watch the object move past the side of our house toward Renton, which borders the west side and back of our property.   It continued to move evenly seeming self propelled until it was behind a tree in the back SE corner of our property and I could see it glowi! ng through the branches until it was gone from my sight.  I almost thought it had slowed, but I believe it was probably traveling a little more easterly away from us. I had never seen anything like this before and was surprised at the size and how close to us it was traveling. I was most fearful of the flame in the middle if it were to be caught in the trees or even land and start a fire.  I told my husband that the only thing I could even imagine was like a hot air balloon, but there was no balloon you could see and it was not that large.  I have never seen a hot air balloon in this area and that time of night, the size and close proximity to the houses and trees made no sense. It looked to be maybe 3 to 4 feet tall give or take and I would estimate the angle when I point to where I first saw the object to where it disappeared to be about 165 degrees and the sighting lasted maybe 30 to 45 seconds.  The front of our home faces north possibly slightly northwest and the object was traveling from the north heading toward our home heading south probably slightly more southeast. We had a call that night that my brother-in-law had just taken his wife to the hospital emergency room on Sunday night at 10:36 pm,  so that was certainly weighting on our minds until we knew she would recover and then I began to think more about reporting what we saw shortly after the call so that it might be helpful in someway.  Hopefully I have given useful information. I wonder if this could have been some kind of lantern launched inappropriately?

I experienced a psychedelic flashback while staring at the ""star"" and walking, where I was trapped walking in place(the road beneath me was moving, and a fence I was walking by was still panning past me), and the star seemed to be the only object that was normal within that period, which seemed like eternity.  Terrified, the thought of the star being a UFO and inducing my trip occurred to me and I was able to come out of that state. I'd been observing the star for a good 4 minutes. After, I'd walked past a tree that had blocked my view of the object, and once passed the obstacle, the star was gone.

I was on the back porch of my home looking to the north,north east , away from the moon which was approximately 180 degrees the other direction and below the tree line. This is my largest view of the night sky as i am mostly surrounded by very tall trees.  I was sitting facing this direction and noticed 2 bright reddish orange lights emerging over the tree line at 30 degrees off compass north, which is my horizon and the lowest tree line in sight. The lights appeared about an inch apart from my point of view moving from what appeared to be an East to West bearing.  The lights were bright but not as bright as Jupiter which was off to my right which i see regularly and is often the brightest object in the sky other than the moon.  The sky was completely clear, and i could see stars on the tree line/ horizon in the background, as well as a few passing/blinking planes in the same approximate area as for comparison. I am very familiar with the air traffic around this area and am very familiar with the the flight paths over this area as it seems to be a relatively high traffic area for planes.  However this was nothing like anything i have seen for myself before.  The 2 lights we diverging and disappeared in about 10-15 seconds.  They seemed to be ascending horizontally rather than any sort of decent, as possibly a flare would have, and were moving at a steady rate.   The relation to each other was about 12 o’clock and 5 o! ’clock top to bottom, as if a plane was on an extremely high banking maneuver, although the lights seemed much too far apart and to quickly moving to be one object. I quickly determined that these lights were not connected because they seemed to be drifting apart from one another while holding their bearing of East to West while moving at their own independent rates of speed.  When i stood up out of curiosity and took about 3 steps forward, about 10-15 sec later, 3-4 more of the same objects appeared as the 2 before over the same spot heading in the same direction.  My house is situated on a hill and i immediately went up the hill to gain a better perspective and as i did a total of 6-7 lights appeared moving in this similar direction.  I grabbed my iPhone and began recording what i could.  It was completely dark so i didn't know if they would show up or not, but despite the neighbor’s patio light glaring against the camera i managed to capture s few of the lights.  Unfortunately i stopped recording on accident when i starting moving up the stairs to the top of the hill, so when i got to the top i started another recording.   Although ! you can make out some of the lights in the video it really does no justice to the sighting as i was filming on a phone at night and had a bad glare.  I happen to be a videographer/ video editor and hesitate to post the footage due to its poor quality even though some of the lights are visible in the video it is certainly not a definitive piece of evidence in any way as to what these lights were or really even their bright reddish orange color. Mostly it will serve as documentation to myself that it actually happened. With in about a minute all of the lights disappeared in front of me, not in any kind of sequence and although they were flying in some sort of formation relative to one another,  there was no recognizable pattern.  These lights were not blinking but had some sort of vague pulsing regularity that never stopped until they disappeared.  There was also no noise whatsoever before the sighting, during or after.  I stayed for about 20 min examining the sky for any further explanation but had no further sightings.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,34.04023923444976,-84.34734832535885

I live in Brooklyn, New York.  Right across the East River in Williamsburg, giving me a clean shot of the Lower East Side, Manhattan and the surrounding skyline from the roof top of my apartment building.  To the Northeast I can see the Queens-based La Guardia airport and almost directly South is JFK.  I sit outside a few times every night to have a cigarette and pay very close attention to the sky and I know what conventional aircraft look like.  Since it’s NYC I’ve seen plenty of military craft as well, aircraft that the normal Joe-Schmoe doesn’t see every day.  Anything from F16 Fighter Jets, Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopters (when the President is in town), Chinook helicopters and once I even saw an Osprey flying over the East River Harbor.  Long story short, I’m very used to seeing unconventional craft in the sky as well. I stepped outside onto my roof for a cigarette around 12:30am, as I normally do (since I don’t smoke inside my apartment) and when I looked up, I noticed how bright the stars were.  There aren’t many nights in New York City when the stars are visible.  There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and I was enjoying being able to see Orion’s Belt as I puffed away.  Then it came into my line of vision.  A very mysterious craft or UFO that flew directly over my head!  Now I can see planes flying into both Airports nearby and not once has any commercial flight flown directly overhead of my building.  If this craft was the size of a normal commercial flight, then it was flying at a severely low altitude.   It was very hard to comprehend the size, especially because there was no noise.  If it was a large commercial flight then it was way too low for FAA regulations, especially this close to Ground Zero (9/11).  The best explanation from what I directly witnessed, is it was flying at a high alt! itude and was just immensely huge, possibly the length of a football field.  It was in my line of vision for around 7-10 seconds before it disappeared behind the Williamsburg Bridge.  I ran down the fire escape on the side of my building praying that I would catch a glimpse of it again once it passed the bridge, or at least see some FAA lights.  Nothing.  It was gone, as so were my chances to photograph it. The best way to describe it is the typical V-Shape that is pretty common in UFO sightings.  There were 5 lights.  One at the tip, then two down each side, perfectly symmetrical and at a perfect angle.  The lights were very large, circular and the light emitted was diffused, almost as if they were behind a haze.  Remember it was clear enough to see Orion’s Belt directly across from Manhattan, so it was a crystal clear night.  Other planes that were further away by miles had sharper looking lights and were more visible.   I was glad that I was looking at the stars or I would have never seen it because of how muted it was.  There were NO FAA lights on it whatsoever.  No headlights, no beacon lights, no red lights and definitely nothing flashing.  The lights that were present were a very soft white-yellowish color and did NOT flash. The body looked to follow the contours of the lights although it was hard to make out a solid surface.  It was almost like you could see through the! craft while just making out the signatures of its edges but I couldn’t see the stars behind it.  There was no sound what so ever.  It seemed to fly at a high speed very effortlessly. When I had realized what I had seen it took my breath away.  My heart jumped straight up into my throat and I actually had a hard time breathing for a minute and I think I mumbled the “f” word to myself a few times.  I am 100% convinced that what I saw, I was not supposed to have seen.  It was very faint, lasted only for a few seconds, and was unlike anything I’ve ever seen in the night sky or in my life for that matter.  I’m not saying that it was extraterrestrial, but if it wasn’t then it was some sort of top-secret aircraft that hasn’t been disclosed by the government.  It is something that I will remember for the rest of my life.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

The sun was quite bright overhead - not visible to me.  Ahead of me were high flying clouds approaching from the south (they then totally dispersed, on the trip back they were nowhere to be seen.)  These were, again, HIGH flying clouds. I was going 62 miles per hour (I know this because I watch my speedometer carefully and the car in front of me was a bit slower than usual).  I had reached (approximately) the mid-way point (mile marker 96-95) between Saugerties and Kingston exits which are eight miles from one another.  I’m unsure the exact direction since the road has many wide curves but it was the southbound lane (two lane thruway, I was in the right hand lane).  It was approximately 11:50 AM (I checked the car clock a couple of minutes later at 11:54).  I noticed a very bright, gleaming object reflecting sunlight.  It appeared in the sky immediately to my left in front of me (impossible to know how high it was.)  It was not low flying, it had no wings or rotors, and if it were at a cruising altitude of a commercial airliner, it would have been huge.  It flew much higher than a small plane could or any helicopter, it was not a dirigible or anything easily identifiable.  As directed, if I had to compare i! ts size to that of the sun (mid-day) it appeared flatter top and bottom, and perhaps 3/4 as wide. It drifted ""slowly"" (in an easy manner) more toward the center of my windshield (this all took place in 7 to 10 seconds), stopped, rocked two times (like a plane rocking its wings) and slowly and smoothly went back to the original position.  It was metallic (which caused the sun to reflect off it as I stated) and shaped rather like a disc (saucer).  The road then curved widely and treed area came between me and that portion of the sky for several seconds (perhaps another eight) before I could get a glimpse of that piece of the sky again (which was extremely identifiable because of the formation of high flying clouds in an otherwise crystal blue sky).  The object was no longer visible.  When I reached my destination and parked, it so happened that the formation of clouds was directly in my line of vision.  I was able, standing still, to see that they were quite high.  A commercial jetliner was climbing to cruising altitude (I am 40 miles from both Albany and Newburgh airports, so planes climbing are commonly seen).  The plane appeared to be almost at cruising altitude and was quite high.  It entered the cloud structures and I lost sight of it.  I believe that the object I saw while driving also got ""lost"" into the cloud structure which explains why it was suddenly no longer visible (as the plane was suddenly no longer visible).  This suggests to me that the object I saw was flying as high as, or close to, the altitude of the commercial jetliner (since the same formation of clouds provided cover for both, once entered).  The most interesting aspect was the ""rocking,"" a lazy but precise maneuver, before it went back toward the direction where I had first seen it.  It was oval, as I said, rather like ( ) but with brackets top/bottom and very bright due to reflected sunlight.  It was obviously under control (the rocking indicates that to me) and was being deliberately maneuvered.

At approximately 10:10 pm my wife busts through the kitchen door and yells at me to come outside immediately to see these ""strange lights"" in the sky.  It took me a minute to realize what she was even talking about, and I asked her to wait a moment so that I could grab our Sony video camera.  I don’t know why I thought to grab the camera other than I know my wife well enough to have seen how obviously amazed she was at what she had witnessed.  She stated that as she was coming down our street and approached the stop sign at the top of our street she witnessed three red lights in the sky to her left as she was driving north.  She said she did a double take and at first thought they were lanterns, but then realized they were too high in the sky. We proceeded outside into our driveway and she pointed to the sky in a SW direction from our home.   At first I wasn’t sure what I was seeing and it took a minute to gather myself.  I saw three orange/red orbs in the sky.  They were moving in a northerly pattern across the western sky.  They were moving in a triangular formation, and unfortunately, the lead orb vanished before I could get my video camera on.  Once the camera was on I focused on the two remaining objects.  They proceeded in a stacked formation across the night sky, but made no obvious sound. I have lived nearby and visited many military bases my entire life and have served in the Navy at NAS Norfolk, so I feel relatively comfortable distinguishing jet aircraft in the sky, even at night.  I live near a small local airport, and can hear planes and jets taking off and landing from my home.  There was no such noise.  I did hear the sound of a jet engine to my rear, but it was nowhere near the objects and soon dissipated.  I have also seen enough programs regarding UFO sighting and debunking to know that a reference point is important, so I made sure to include my homes trees in the lower portion of the video I was taking. What struck me most about the objects was the lack of sound and the fact that the light they were emitting was constant, not blinking, as you would typically see in a commercial or military aircraft.  In addition, they were way too bright and large in reference to our location for us to have not heard the engines, assuming they were jet aircraft.  We watched the objects move across the sky for approximately 45 seconds, at which point they were obstructed by the rather large oak trees in my backyard.  My wife and children were still in the driveway in her vehicle, so I had them drive me to the next clear vantage point, which was just next door, approximately 50-60 feet.  I tried to focus on the objects, but could not get the camera to focus due to ambient light coming from a streetlight directly to my rear.  In the second video I shot you can still make out the orbs moving at approximately the same speed in a north/northwest direction. At this point, I was more concerned with getting what I was seeing on camera than I was with continuing to watch it with my naked eye, so I hopped in the van with my wife and kids and had her drive me to the next clearer and darker part of my street.  This was approximately 50-60 yards down my street from my home.  I jumped out, focused the camera, and remember asking my wife to turn off the headlights on her van.  Shortly after starting the third video, I saw the lower light in the formation “bug out” in a northwesterly direction at a ridiculous speed.  This can be seen in the video footage.  I was shocked at how quickly it disappeared, but kept my camera focused on the remaining orb and closed in on it with my zoom lens. I want to be clear at this point that I was using a Sony Handycam, with a Carl Zeiss lens and HD resolution, not a camera phone.  What I saw next was the most amazing thing I have ever witnessed.  My family and I saw the object begin to change shape in the sky.  It didn’t elongate or anything, it just seemed to change its exterior.   In my video footage, you can see it very clearly as it appears to transition between pointy in one direction to round in another.  I can only describe it as looking like a child’s “top” spinning in the sky, but the point moves from bottom to top to side.  The shape was rounded on edges at time, and you can hear my wife in the background saying she sees the same thing I am witnessing with my camera.  Almost as soon as my wife said she could see it too it also disappeared just as the previous orb had.  Then entire encounter lasted approximately 5 minutes.  I returned outside periodically during the night, but saw nothing unusual in the sky. I am neither a UFO expert nor an aircraft expert, so I am not claiming 100% that what we saw was a UFO, but I do know that I have never in my life seen objects  maneuvering  in the sky the way these objects did.  I have never seen a ""UFO"" before, but I am convinced that is what I saw until someone can prove me wrong.  This phenomenon was witnessed by my wife, both my children, and myself, and as I write this the next afternoon after the sighting, I am still not sure if I’m excited, scared, or amazed.. perhaps all three.  I look forward to hearing from someone from your organization.  Thank you. PS--I will forward the video footage by email if possible, if not I will mail it to you.

Then I realized it must be at high altitude & therefore the light must be extremely bright.  I kept my gaze set on it; soon, I noticed this light was not flying in a straight path as an airplane would.  Rather it was travelling in a curve, as though a half-circle. It was moving very slow - slower than any airplane, especially one with such high altitude, would be flying.  There was no sound of an aircraft engine at any time.  It took about 3 minutes to circle (from my left-facing to right-facing).  I then noticed another similar light which at first I reasoned could be a star I had not noticed before.  I always look to the sky when I step outside & had previously noted the position of Venus and what was possibly Sirius or Polaris to my north-facing.  I couldn't see any other stars when I had first walked outside. The first light seemed to be headed towards the new light.  They then merged to where I could only see one light.  That light then disappeared.  Although I was astounded I didn't mention this to my roommate or his girlfriend in fear they wouldn't believe me or think I was crazy.

They had appeared in that location and would reappear in different spots around that vicinity for about thirty seconds.  All of the streaking motion was in the vertical axis travelling downward and left shimmering white tails behind them.  There seemed to be an initial moment of rapid activity from when they appeared and were performing some type of quantum like relocation behaviour to different spots and then making the downward streaking motions releasing light or energy.  At this point it was too rapid to pinpoint them as craft or energy and we could not make a count of them. After this initial period was over, there were two craft that could be seen as steady objects moving side by side across the valley and over the mountain.  They primarily gave off a sequenced white flashing light as they moved along. It was bright white just like the streaking, but much more softer and not shimmery.  A small red light could be seen on the objects at the low points of the flashing.  They moved slowly at a moderate altitude and gave off no sound at all as it was very silent out also.  After they disappeared over the mountain ridge to the south, we were discussing how incredible it was too see such an object and it's initial performance, and a third one appeared in the same spot in the quantum bouncing and vertical downward streaking motions and immediately travelled at a lower altitude than the first two with a path directly overtop of us and our fire with the same flashing light and a moderate flying speed.  Due to the lower altitude of this craft and it being directly above us, I was able to see a blueish green soft hued glow in a disc shape as it was directly above us.  This craft passed over and continued in a straight line towards the mountain ridge where the first two had gone.  About 10 to 15 minutes after those craft left our area, on the opposing ridge of the mountain they had disappeared behind, I saw a green streaking meteorite enter the atmosphere along the ridge and then crash on the other side of the ridge.  I was tempted to ride over to see what it was but it was still not sunrise yet, and didn't know the trails in the area well enough alone. We stayed by the fire for a bit after the meteor to see if there was any other activity.  There was a point of some noise from birds awakening in the morning, and one moment where I thought I heard some strange noises coming from across the river in that direction, but they seemed more cerebral than aural.  There was a brief moment after that when we both felt watched and were too nervous to leave the fire even for a tent twenty feet away.  Things seemed to calm themselves from there and we both retired before the full sunrise started.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,,

Two brilliant red round objects emerged from the North, flew towards us in unison, and then changed direction to the west.

The five of us were trying to figure what this was, but only figured out what it was not.

Two minutes later the 2 bright red lights appeared again in same place that I saw the 1st set of two - in the North.  I was thinking that what I saw did an elliptical type track - from the north, headed south, turned towards the west, and then circled around to its original position.

I saw a UFO the evening of October 31, 2012.   At least it was U by me.  It was very large, cigar shaped (fatter in the middle) with three large red lights on each of the two ends.  I only saw it from one angle.  It moved toward me, it tilted slightly a few times (after I waved at it), then it went sideways, then it went back in the direction from which it had come, without turning. It was just after 7:00 p.m.  I was sitting in my bedroom with just one low night-light on near the floor, watching TV, with all the windows uncovered so I could see the lights on the islands across from me.  (I live on a huge body of water in the state of Washington, 100 feet above the water, with an almost-180-degree view of water, and islands many miles away from me.)  It was a lovely night, clear, still, well lit by the near-full moon that was just beginning to rise. I see planes across the way all the time, over land;  the only aircraft that fly over the water are recreational, flying low, usually only in summer and during the day and usually only amphibian planes.  The only aircraft that fly in my direction are military planes (sometimes) and helicopters (quite often)—and those are really loud.  Once I saw one of those black triangular military craft, flying so low and slow I wondered how it could stay up in the air.  I’ve never seen a military craft fly over this area, staying over the water like this. This was way different.  So, I was sitting there watching TV and saw out the window some red lights flying slowly, quite low, across the water, coming almost in my direction (if they had continued this course they would have passed me to the North).  There were two groups of three red lights, big, with a wide space between—too wide for them to have been wing lights.  If they were wing lights, the plane would have had to be five or six times bigger than a 747.  Helicopters, I thought.  But I don’t recall having seen red lights on a chopper. The two groups of red lights were flying in such synchronization I thought, wow, if those are choppers, the pilots are amazing.  So I went to the window to watch them.  They stopped moving and hovered.  Then I thought, what the heck is that, and went outside in the dark and walked across the lawn to the fence, at the bank above the water.  No noise.  If they were helicopters, I would have heard them. The sky was bright for night, with high white clouds far above.  I could make out a faint outline connecting the red lights, kind of a cigar shape, fatter in the middle. Then I thought, cool, I think it is a UFO.  I put up a hand to beckon them to come closer to me ;-) The red lights began to wobble, as if the “cigar” was tipping back and forth, like plane wings would do if the pilot were goofing off. Then they moved sideways, and then they started moving back in the direction from which they had come—without first turning around, they just started moving away.  I watched them until they disappeared in the distance. UFO or … silent helicopters?  Does the military have silent helicopters with red lights?  It’s possible that my vision fooled me, that I didn’t see the cigar shape—but I doubt it.  If they were indeed two silent helicopters, they flew in perfect synchronization … and, they would have turned around.  So, I’m sure it was a very large cigar-shaped craft with three red lights on each end. I’m 62, female, retired family law paralegal.  No mental problems.  IQ 138.  This is my first sighting of a UFO.  I wish I had got a photo of it, but I didn’t want to take the time to go back inside and get a camera, wanted to see it for as long as I could.

Immediately, I noticed several, strange, colorful objects in a formation in the Eastern sky and informed my girlfriend of it and to watch this as well.   Each of the five individual objects in the formation, emitted, random colored displays of blinking lights, red, violet, blue, green and yellow as each object maintained an ascending, staggered, stair-step “Staircase-like” ariel formation of one object after another.   Each object seemingly appeared to be ""disc-like"" in shape, and each was tilted at a 45 degree angle (to the right) and each object was pretty equally spaced apart within the formation as they appeared to remain stationary in the night sky.   What I also noticed at the same angle of ascension to this formation, higher-up in the sky there appeared to be a single solid red light that seemingly hovered there.  I looked above and around the red light to determine if there was any associated structure but could not see anything but the suspended red light.   During the first 15 minutes of this events observation it became apparent these five objects were slowly descending, one-by-one while maintaining their angle and group formation.  The red light above did not descend with the other objects and maintained its position as the objects continued to descend far behind a high-rise building in the distance from where our 6th floor, Eastern facing apartment is located in the city.   One by one the objects disappeared behind the building in the foreground and seemingly into the mountains in the distance.  As the last object descended, out of view the red light moved off into the distance into the mountains maintaining a level departure before it suddenly performed some quick and erratic maneuvers, during the last few seconds of observation in the distance and disappeared from view in the mountains. During this sighting we tried several times to take pictures and record the event onto digital devices including a Blackberry, iPhone and an Nikon digital camera, but the objects could not be seen in the view finders.   I used my thumb at arm’s length to evaluate the size of each ""disc-like"" object in the formation and established that each object was about ½ of one thumb nail in size from my distance to the objects.  I estimate the objects were at least 4-5 kilometers away from our location and the objects when they were first noticed were all high above the height of the 30-story building they all eventually descended behind in the distance, 50 minutes later.   To the East of our location in the background is the Tianshan mountain range that stretches around the city of Urumqi to the East is easily visible during the day from this location, so it’s likely from our observation point to be the region or area where these objects descended too. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone (Skype) with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and credible.

I would honestly write this off as just a misidentification except for the fact that for several months, my wife and I have been seeing black, dual rotor helicopters flying relatively low to the ground very fast from the south east to the north west, always in pairs and never with any markings.   These helicopters again appeared within 30 mins of seeing this object.  On a side note, I love listening to you on Coast to coast am and do appreciate the work that you do.

First I thought it was some people wearing bright clothe while working in the field.   Seconds later I realised that this object was moving around the field in random direction so I thought it was maybe some kind of plastic shopping bag flying around with the wind.  I dropped off my heavy backpack and puled out my video camera, and zoomed in to the object. It was around 12:15 UK time and air condition wore qua-it fogy and/or cloudy. Tan Hill is 294 m above see level and this (where filming took place) approximate location is at around 250 m above see level I guess. Due to the cloudy and the sunny condition, visibility was very poor and I could barely see anything on my camera LSD monitor. For those who photograph may know that mixture of sun and thin cloud can make you blind at some point, and this condition in photographic terms called spread light. Also was qua-it difficult to find farm building it self on the monitor, but I was very happy this building was there, which I used as orientation point to zoom in. For better framing I kept looking in to the field and back to the monitor, and soon this object looked like have melted out from my view, perhaps plummet in to the ground?

I looked out and saw two very bright, large, fireballs moving across the sky, one some distance behind the other.  They seemed to be travelling the same path, at the same speed, as if one was following the other and they were moving from away from my house, towards the southwest. Immediately, I thought they could not be planes.  They were both very bright – their interior color was white/gold and the outer part of the balls was bright red, with a star-like, flaming appearance.  They did not look in any  way how planes look in a night sky – no flashing lights, only one glowing ball, as opposed to several small lights, etc. Because they appeared so unusual, I wondered if the thick glass of my window was distorting the light and causing the flame-like appearance and the color separation of the white/gold and red.  I went downstairs to a window that I could open that does not have a screen in it, and the balls looked exactly the same – bright white/gold interiors and red flame-like edges.

The first object flew extremely low and was very bright, unlike an aircraft’s lighting.  It was glowing as if on fire, a reddish-orange glow and was completely silent.  At first we thought it was a paper light that had a candle inside that caused it to float in the air because of how low it was and the glow coming from it.   We then we realized it was traveling at the speed of a plane or faster and could not understand why it would be silent yet so illuminated.  There was no logical reason for this aircraft to be undetected without sound yet brighter than any aircraft either of us had ever witnessed. If it was military and was made to be silent why would it look like an obvious glowing ball in the sky?

Then at approximately 0030h EST, my wife, my neighbor and I witnessed another orange-red object cut across the sky from east to west.

It was flying extremely low, approximately 10 meters from the ground.  As it cruised over me, it made no sound.  There was no heat emitted, it was clearly a triangular shape, illuminated by orange-red lights.  The entire object was glowing.  It appeared to be big enough to hold just one person.

It moved slowly from the west to the east, soundless and flickering.  At first I had thought that it might be a meteor but it was under the cloud cover and going about the speed compared to a larger jet at 30,000ft.  I first noticed it almost straight up and slightly south.  I called my wife out to see as well. As it continued on, total of 90-120seconds, I looked for the red,green and white lights usually found on aircraft and saw none.  To me it looked like what a campfire would look like from a distance, only flying.  As it descended off into the east, disappearing either into the cloud cover or just vanishing, my wife noted that it had split off into 2 balls and appeared to have something connecting them.  I had noticed that when closer it seemed to have an orb of some sort around it, but that could have been like what you would see around a fire, hazy kind of orb, not sure how to describe it. We live 10 miles from Seatac Int'l Airport and 3 miles from the Renton Airport so we are not strangers to aircraft, shortly after this fireball disappeared, a jetliner crossed over head, above the cloud cover and I could hear it clearly.  As with the smaller craft, they can be heard for a time before and after visual contact is made.  This ball made NO sound at all.  Why I didn't think to take a picture is beyond me. Here is the info from the National Weather Service:   1 Jul 11:53 pm PDT WINDS :WNW    SPEED:  7    VISIBILITY:  9.00  I haven't yet been able to get the cloud cover elevation, but they were low, this morning they are high and the jetliners are at their usual elevation heading N, as they always do.

I immediately called me wife from around the house so she could see the display as well.   As we watched the glowing orb it began to move laterally across the sky and grow in intensity.  As it moved, my wife and I stood in awe and contemplated the possibilities.   It was moving from west to east as I said: ""It can’t be a firework its moving laterally, it can’t be a flair because it has not gained or lost altitude.""  Then the object slowly stopped and made ! a sharp 90* turn heading north.  We both commented on the fact that it made no sound   At this point I believe my wife was a little freaked out and she refused to watch any more.   I continued watching as the object slowly traveled north until it was obscured by my low view.   I noticed that during the 2-3 minutes this event lasted almost no fireworks from the nearby area could be seen or heard going off, as if everyone else in the area was also fixated on the same phenomenon.

The two closest to me looked like they changed their forward motion to moving straight up in altitude.

Their color also changed to a white and sometimes bluish white and then disappeared. I then noticed that the other lights were changing motion the same as the first had but not in the same sequence.

As I was fumbling through my purse for my house keys, my husband was behind me looking back at the sky. I had just seen a shooting star when we were exiting our vehicle, so he was trying to spot one too.  Suddenly, he said ""look at that!"" When I turned around I saw a white light that was flying across the sky over a distant mountain. It definitely was flying at a slower speed than a shooting star but it looked like something similar.  I had enough time to turn around and witness it along with my husband.  All of a sudden, the light grew much, much brighter and in my opinion appeared to ""blast off"" from the original speed it was flying. In my husband's opinion after the object lit up it looked to him like it flew down or landed somewhere but it happened very, very quickly.

My friend and I were walking home from downtown Riverside, CA. At approximately 10:05 am  today, May 21, 2012.  I looked up and saw a round white orb floating/hovering in the sky over Mt.Rubidoux...just a little to the right of a small dead tree on the side of the mountain. To be honest, I was just planning to look at the mountain as I have a thing for mountains. I looked at the orb like floating object for a moment and finally told my friend to look up as the object appeared to just be hovering.  After about 20 seconds, I decided to pull out my Kodak Play Sport Camera...that I always carry with me as I love to take pictures of my surroundings.  I started filming; however, I did not have my glasses on and could not see anything through my view finder, thus I only took a 19 second video clip from this vantage point.  The friend I was with suggested, I take still photos rather than video (which can be heard on the video) and then look at them when I get home to se! e what the object is by zooming in on the object if I actually got it in the picture frame. At first, I thought...maybe it is a star...but I love looking into the sky at daytime and night time, yet I have never seen a star in this location at this time during the day. Due to the brightness, maybe it could be a meteor...but this had no tail, nor did it appear to be moving. Then the idea of a plane was in my mind...but again...this object was hovering...it was not flying in any direction when I first started my observation.  Eventually, I thought it could be a balloon...but again...the object just hovered....it did not move up or down nor did it move side to side...it was stationary for at least 10 minutes before it began to very slowly move in a northward direction. I then thought...maybe it is a weather balloon...but again...it did not move and it appeared to be too low for this type of activity. Additionally, the object was too high to be a hot air balloon. The object itself over the 40 minute time frame appeared to be round but could change from triangle, square o! r diamond shape. Now over the next 40 minutes, my friend and I walked from Mt. Rubidoux …to the Carlson Bark Park and across the bridge to a fast food place (Baker's) on Mission Blvd.  After exiting Baker’s we walked up to Limonite.  During that walk, I took 12 still pictures from different locations and 2 separate videos...one being 19 seconds long and the other being 39 seconds long.  I personally would have watched this object even longer and taken more photos and videos if my friend was not wanting so much to get home before the heat became unbearable...after all, we were on a 6 mile walk.  Yet in the time we did look at this object, it did eventually move northward very slowly...in fact, we went into Baker's and when exiting about 10 minutes later, we could still see the orb nearing the mountains near Ontario or Fontana. Also, during our viewing, I saw at least 2 airliner (jets) fly by...so commercial jets did have an opportunity to witness this object as well.  As far as making any noise...neither of us heard anything.  Eventually, I lost sight of the orb once I got to Limonite and the sun was in my eyes...making it too difficult to see at this point.  However, I do have to say, when I got home and looked at my photos something interesting appears. Remember, at the time, I saw only one object...and that is also noted in the first 19 second video; however, in my first still picture...there is a second object off to the right and when zoomed in you can see a very solid object and yet when I took my second still picture...the second object is gone. We are talking literally seconds from picture to picture and I did not see or hear anything at the time. Yet for this object to be missing in the video and then in the first picture but not in the second picture it had to be traveling so fast that we j! ust could not have seen it. That is it. So yes, I do have pictures and videos from different locations and I used trees, telephone poles, light poles and the mountain as reference points...so it can be verified by qualified researchers. I also did not erase them from my camera, so if real scientist would like to observe it and get the data and meta data from the original pictures and video they have that to reference as well.  I would send in the pictures and videos but I only want them studied and verified by qualified professionals at this time until I can get proper copyrights on the video and photos.

The plane's flight path was from the West of Motrose heading roughly Southeast on a Glide Path, for Hobby Airport Houston , Texas, as it's most likely destination. I was watching the inbound aircaft, which I estimate was at an altitude of around 4 or 5 thousand feet, I noticed 2 more objects flying , in parallel formation to eachother , in a direction of South to North , just West of Montrose.  They were at an estimated altitude of 10 to 15 thousand feet.  The night was partly cloudy and the stars were very visible in the background.  The objects were much larger than any star or planetary obect in the background, but far smaller than a full moon. I fairly certain on my estimations of distance and altitude.  The size noted, was maybe 1/20th the diameter of a normal full moon. One aircraft, the most easterly of the 2 , was slightly in the lead. The objects were not moving at an exceptional rate of speed.  They were steady in flight characteristics, on a straight and level flight path. Both were uniform in color, though , the color observed , was a dull reddish orange glow, pointing perpendicular to the ground. The colors and round shape of the orange glow, reminded me of the shape and color of after-burners on a jet, but not as intense. There was a dull outer ring of orange next ring was darker and center of object again a dull orange. It is possible , these were a type of vertical lift for the propulsion system of the aircraft. As I observed the objects maintain a consistent and steady flight path, the trailing object began to slow fade to black.  This did not take more than a few second.  The leading object followed in this fade to black procedure.  At that point neither object could be observed in the sky.  At no point did I ever note any lighting consistent with Civilian or Military Aircraft.  I do note that the area the objects began to fade in was clear of clouds, stars were visible, and was maybe a mile or 2 away , as the bird flies.

We arrived at that location at approx. 9:45pm, about 30 minutes before the fireworks started.   As we waited for the show to begin, we witnessed a small orange light liftoff in what appeared to be the vicinity of the airport, possibly a bit north of it and quite possibly farther off than we suspected.  It definitely was not a firework of any sort.  It kept the same constant brightness and size the entire time we watched it.  It rose slowly at first and at a point that was about even with our line of sight (we were about a hundred feet in elevation above the valley) it stopped and hovered for about 5 to 10 seconds. It then continued rising in elevation at a faster rate than before.   Within about 15 seconds it was very high in the sky, about 70 degrees in elevation.  At this point we lost sight of it, either it went out or entered into the cloud. I can't be sure which. About 10 minutes later, another light that looked exactly like the first one, was flying towards us.  This time it was coming in from the North.  I pointed it out to my wife and she also saw it.  Soon after this it seemed to stop forward motion and sort of hovered and went a bit higher at the same time, and a few seconds later either went out or went into the cloud. At no time did we hear any sound from these objects.  There were many commercial planes flying over head heading East after having taken off from SeaTac and we saw one private plane, all of these had the normal lighting and we could hear each one of them, but not the curious orange lights. All in all these lights seemed to be pretty small and not that bright, and with all the fireworks going on I doubt anyone else saw these.  I also don't think I would class these as fireballs, like you talked about on C2C or Jeff Rense recently.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,47.29995649484537,-122.18088288659793

I immediately went out on the deck and looked to the Southwest toward the Ocean.  (Later verified as 266 degrees SW)   There I saw 12 orange lights in a pattern 3 across at the top, then the next 4 was to the right, then 4 down in a straight line.  There could have been another below the tree line.  They were stationary, but while I was watching the pattern shifted a couple of times, but was still stationary.  It was very quiet and we did not hear any engine noise. They all started to slowly move away towards the NE and went behind a tall Redwood tree in my neighbor’s yard.   I then went to the door on the N end of the house and could see them moving away to NE and they disappeared about 2:40 A.M.  My wife said she had looked out about 2:05 A.M. so they were in view for about 35 minutes. Each of the objects looked to be about one half the size of the moon in the early morning sky.  I would guess the size was equivalent to 8 morning stars.  The shape was spherical.   We live on the Rio Del Mar side of Aptos about 800 yards from the Ocean and I estimate the objects were about another 800 yard over the Ocean, or approximately a mile from the house.

When I walked outside some more rose over the tree tops. I saw 12 in all. They moved around some, but at first they were in a pattern.

I happened to look up very slight to the west sky (estimate angle of view 20 degrees from vertical/directly overhead) and saw a number of red/orange balls of light ‘floating’ at unknown altitude in the direction of the wind (NNW), but more quickly than the light breeze.  Initially, there were some half dozen or more in my line of sight.  At least one suddenly disappeared, as if a switch was thrown.  I did not see any flashing of lights; only a steady red/orange glow.  The size of the balls were similar to if one were to hold their hand straight out from their face holding a dime against the sky.  They all appeared to be the same size, suggesting also same altitude. Looking to the NNW sky, I saw many of these same objects approaching and flowing in steady procession, most of which were in line, however several were to either side of the main line.  The procession continued for several minutes.  Their speed appeared constant, with a velocity that would cause one to traverse the entire sky, horizon to horizon, in perhaps one minute.  Again, they were all of similar size and color. I awoke my wife, and she witnessed three of the objects in full view. The first procession/grouping that I witnessed numbered approximately 50 or more.   The time span of this was about 5 to 8 minutes, and my wife caught the very last of these.  A few minutes later I returned outside to take another view of the sky and saw several more before they all disappeared, and I saw no more of them. While outside with my wife, I witnessed a bright flash of white light in the north sky.  By bright, I mean it was a quick, intense flash, as if a light bulb suddenly burned out and ‘flashed.’ I happened to be looking right at that particular area of sky at that moment, as that is where the procession of red/orange objects originated from.  There was no evidence of any planes in that area of the sky.  After the flash of light (which I can only liken to a camera flash), there was no more activity I saw in that area of the sky. It was the only flash I saw.  I am at a loss to explain it. The objects were completely silent.  I could not (nor could my wife) hear anything at all that resembled propeller or jet aircraft noise. I had a 3 watt LED flashlight with me when I was viewing the objects, prior to awakening my wife.  At one point prior to my wife arriving outside, I saw a ‘shadow’ floating overhead, and I immediately put my flashlight upon it.  This flashlight is bright, but it is a small hand held light with perhaps only a 150 meter effective range.  I was able to place the light directly upon the shadow and illuminate the underside of it.  It appeared to be a flat, disk shaped object, but oddly the trailing edge seemed to have more of a heart shaped appearance (e.g. a stencil heart that a child might draw with a pencil).   This object was very low, given my light’s ability to cast light upon it.  It vanished a mere two seconds after I put light upon it.  I did not see where it went; it simply vanished from view.  At the time, it had passed directly over me, and was moving quickly toward the southern sky. I live in the traffic pattern/approach to an airport, to the west of my home.  Air traffic never comes over from north to south, and I am quite aware of what airplanes in the night sky look and sound like from the ground.  These were not planes.  I have never before seen anything like this.  Nor has my wife.",2012-08-19T00:00:00,,

About 8 pm MST, I was outside walking the dogs and noticed a very bright and big light in the sky about 10 degrees to the West of true North from my vantage point, and about 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  The color of the light was a very very pale amber, but I couldn't discern any clear shape.  I would estimate it was two or three times the size of Venus at its biggest and brightest.   I did not hear any aircraft or unusual noise.     The light continued very bright for a minute or two, and appeared to move very slowly straight upward (compared to fixed points on some telephone poles and nearby mountains) during this time.  Then it faded to a small dot of the same color in about 8 seconds, but then grew bright and big again.  It stayed bright for about another minute, then again faded into a small dot that this time vanished entirely.   However, I could make out one or two very dim red lights in the same place, and these lights began to move smoothly faster, at a speed that one might expect or a small aircraft or helicopter, heading due West at the same altitude, in between the clouds.   I lost sight of the lights when the headlights of a car came around a bend in the road. The temperature was about 48 degrees, wind was very calm, the moon was bright enough that it was easy to see shadows and objects.  There were a few low, thin clouds in the sky and the light seemed to be in the midst of them. The object lacked any flashing lights and made no noise that I could detect.  This area has mountain ranges to both the east and west, and it's easy to hear planes or helicopters flying between them at low altitudes, even from some distance, as the noise reverberates. This is my third sighting of a potential UFO in this area;  the other two sightings were in the fall of 2010.  I go outside with the dogs two or three times a night, and, since 2010, always look carefully for anything out of place in the sky.   Since 2010, I've only seen one other oddity until tonight, and that was a bright but not extraordinarily bright object that hung in the sky in apparently fixed position for about 10 minutes, but then I heard what sounded like a sudden loud jet noise and saw a jet with flashing lights nearly pass over my house at low altitude and head due South.  I wondered at the time if that particular jet might be a Harrier-like aircraft doing reconnaissance for the Defense Department or Border Patrol, given this area is close to the border with Mexico.  Tonight's object was much, much bigger and brighter, and I never heard any noise, or saw anything that resembled a jet, airplane, or a helicopter.",2012-12-21T00:00:00,31.5541,-111.0361

I used my cell phone to look at google’s sky map of celestial arrangement of the planets on the historic evening , finding Jupiter and Orion, the Moon and Uranus quite visible in the sky.  Many stars very brilliant in the cold night.  I put away my cell phone , went inside and got shorts on for hot tub.  I returned to get in , and instantly was visually drawn to a magnificent light in the low sky just above the rooftop of my backyard neighbors. Just above my neighbors rooftop I saw a bright brilliant magnificent blue light revolving on an object in the sky.  I tried to decipher what kind of craft it was immediately as I live near military base JBLM and see frequently, aircraft in sky, especially helicopters.  Instantly I started realizing this object was neither, by its unusual motion and the shape and changing colors!!  Its shape, as I focused, was that of an oval shape with a funnel bottom.  It moved quickly from right to left, faster than anything I’ve ever seen , pausing, then left to right, again pausing as it slowly moved farther away and lower in the skyline .It had a pendular curve to its motion also, back and forth.  All the while the most amazing light emanating from it, changing though, from blue to bright white.  But, this Light was Rectangular, pronounced along the length of the craft . I would say the craft was rotating its orientation rather than its lights changing , because it was constant, like white lights in front and blue in rear . Suddenly , as I stared , I recalled a similar incident my wife witnessed nearly 3 weeks prior in the same location.  I broke site for a quick moment to yell in my house to my wife to come outside. I returned to viewing object , trying to decipher more about its make up , seeing more clearly its shape , and realizing more and more this was not aircraft. My wife did not make it out in time to see as it disappeared on horizon beyond rooftops . this happened approximately within 7 minutes I’d guess.  I instantly told her what I witnessed questioning it with what she had seen 3 weeks prior.  As we talked we confirmed each others sighting as the same thing.  We continued the next morning to discuss shape size and color, individually confirming each others belief of what we saw.  Because of this, I’ve decided I had to report in hopes others have seen, and that possibly, others will watch for more occurences as my wife and I are now interested in doing . Also, I state that this is no way a Star !!!  It was a craft of some type, and upon viewing it, you would understand and agree easily. Thank you!",2012-12-21T00:00:00,46.942,-122.606

Again, they had this peculiar 'independent' wobble, or as if each individual light were ab! le to move back and forth, side to side, planes can't wobble like that, at this speed they would have been ripped apart.  Meteors fly with a trajectory of motion and can't wobble back and forth like that. It is a cold 39 degrees outside here in Bozeman Montana, and I'd find it hard to believe that they were 'ball lightening.'  Strangest thing I've seen in the sky. Don't know what else to tell you, perhaps someone else has seen this for a longer period of time than I did. I can't honestly say what to make of it at all. I waited a few minutes to see if anything would re-appear, but I saw nothing.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,45.70981012145749,-111.05357489878543

Shawn Yardley, director of the city’s Department of Health and Community Services, described what the two saw as ""bright orange dots at cloud level."" ""They looked like Christmas lights, but they were orange,"" he said Friday, still looking for answers to what he witnessed.  ""They took up about a quarter-mile of sky and they stayed in place. It wasn’t fireworks, because they stayed in place."" Yardley was on Interstate 95 near Waterville and said the fire-colored orbs could be seen on the Oakland side of the highway. ""People were pulling off the road to look at them,"" he said.  ""If my daughter hadn’t been there to witness the same thing, I would not have called. I’ve never reported anything like this."" Police and fire officials in Waterville, Winslow and Oakland, as well as the Maine State Police, said they took no reports of balls of light in the night sky, and the National Weather Service reported no unusual weather that could account for the lights. ""A string of lights [in the sky] is a very common UFO report,"" Alan Davenport, director of the University of Maine’s Jordan Planetarium, said Friday. Some prior UFO reports have proved to be aircraft flying away, he said. They appear to be stationary because they are so far away. ""That is what their taillights would look like,"" Davenport said. Yardley’s wife, Rita, asked him why he didn’t take a picture of the balls of light with his cellphone, and he said he couldn’t because ""I was on the phone."" The National UFO Reporting Center, which has nine postings on its website from Maine for October, has taken reports of orange ""fireballs"" from all over the world.  There were no postings on the website for Thursday night. There also are a couple of YouTube videos posted of people filming orange lights in the sky. Yardley said he’s not sure what he and his daughter saw, but he did expect others in the area to file reports.

I was only 12 years old.  I have only told about three people of me and my friend’s Experience.  We lived in rural Benton County.  I was spending the night at this friend’s house.  We were going to camp out in a ravine in the pasture behind his house. We went out at around 6:00 PM and had just started a small fire. As we were putting wood on the fire I noticed a big black object in the sky to the west of us.  It was heading in a southward direction.  We were trying to figure out what kind of plane it could be.  When it changed direction and was headed right toward us.  Being kids as we were we started thinking it was the DNR coming to get us for our fire.  (Quite a silly thought now that I am older).  We were trying to put out our fire as it approached we realized this was no plane it was Black as night, triangle shaped, with three lights underneath one in each corner they were like spot lights very bright bluish white light, and one white light right in the middle.  There was no sound coming from this object. And it was moving very slowly between 10 and 15 mph. My friend and I ran up under the tree on the hill. This thing was about half the size of a football field. The leaves on the trees were moving a lot but I can not remember if I could Feel a wind or not. I could see the lights coming through the trees.  The very next thing either of us remembered was running up the hill until we reached the fence, we were scared and nervous.  We watched this object Flying of in a southeast Direction toward Cedar Rapids, and Palo.  We raced to his house and when we entered the clock said 12:07 AM.  Now mind you the place we were going to camp that night is only about a five minute walk to the house and with in sight of the house.  I cannot say what happened in the time between about 6:25 PM and 12:07 AM. I can go with out thinking of this all year but even now 28 years later this occupies my mind in the last week of July and the first week of August.  And here it is I am writing this on July 29th.

On 15 June 2012, in Gainesville, FL, USA, (29.7N, 82.7W), beginning at approximately 22:50 and continuing until 23:00 EDT, my wife and I observed approximately 15 separate amber to orange-amber-colored glowing objects (orbs) that traversed the sky from northeast to southwest. There was no moon, a thin, high cloud cover we’d had at sunset had by then completely dissipated, leaving a cloudless sky. Winds were calm with the occasional light gust from the N (according to weather station MC9837, closest to our home:  http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/WXDailyHistory.asp?ID=MC9837&month=6&day=15&year=2012)  My wife and I are amateur stargazers and I had just finished drift-aligning our 203mm diameter Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope in preparation for some DSLR astrophotography. My wife was visually observing Messier 13, the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules, and I was readying my Vixen flip mirror camera mount. I happened to look up and saw two orange-ish/amber lights passing almost directly overhead, just south of the zenith and very near the star Arcturus, in a southwesterly direction and seemingly in a line approximating NE to SW. I did not notice them until after they were to the west of the meridian. Our view of the sky is limited by trees surrounding our property, and we only have a clear view 60 degrees above the horizon to W, 15 degrees above the horizon to N, 30 degrees above the horizon to E (but with a large tree partially obstructing as high as 50 degrees to the NE), and about 20 degrees above the horizon to S. Thus, my view of those first two objects ended very soon after I saw them as they disappeared behind the tall trees to the SW. I got my wife’s attention with an exclamation along the lines of “what the hell was that?”, and when she looked up from the telescope, since it was pointing ENE at Hercules, she noticed an amber object through the trees just rising above our neighbor’s roof line (about 15 degrees above the horizon from that orientation) almost exactly NE. We soon saw a second such object, same color, and slightly to the north of the first. Our view of these objects was intermittent as they passed behind tree limbs, but the entire time we observed them we could see them climbing higher in the sky, passing just north of the star Vega, as they appeared to approach. As they cleared the tree we could see them clearly, although they simply appeared to be featureless orbs of light, larger than a point source (therefore unlike a star), but smaller by far than the disc of the moon. As these objects passed the meridian on a general SW heading, one of them seemed to fade, then briefly brighten, then fade out completely before the other one, whose apparent brightness hadn’t varied, disappeared from view behind the trees to the SW. The entire transit, from the moment we first observed them until they were lost to view due to the trees to our west, took about 30 to 45 seconds. Almost as soon as the pair of objects passed overhead we saw 2 more such amber lights moving through the trees, originating at almost the identical spot where we saw the first pair, and also travelling SW at about the same rate. They were soon joined by a third amber light a bit to their north. All three of these objects tracked somewhat further north than the first set of objects, but still travelling from NE to SW and at the same apparent speed as the earlier objects (transiting in about the same amount of time). We continued seeing objects such as these appear above the roofline to our NE, watched them arc overhead, sometimes in pairs, sometimes singly, sometimes in threes, for the next 10 or so minutes. In all, I would say we saw at least 15 distinct objects, all of them tracking from NE to SW, some further N, but most nearly overhead. A few of the objects we initially detected above the roof line (at least 3) disappeared completely before clearing the tree and emerging in clear sky. Another one, in an initial group of three, faded out and then re-appeared as its companions crossed the meridian to the W. The apparent rate at which all of the objects arced across the sky did not seem to vary.  They all took about the same amount of time to cross our field of view. It is impossible to estimate the altitude of these objects without having any referent to their actual size. None of them showed any type of blinking navigation or anti-collision lights as do aircraft.  We could not detect any sound from their passing; no noise of engine, no whoosh of air, nothing.  I was able to capture some short video of a couple of these objects, but the capture was made using a handheld cell phone, and so is of poor quality. I’ll close by saying that my wife and I both hold advanced degrees.  She is a Professor and I am a research scientist, with over 40 peer reviewed publications as either first or contributing author.  We are sober, intelligent and well-educated individuals who stand to lose respect and credibility by making claims of UFO sightings.  Yet, that is exactly what we saw.  These objects flew across the sky, and they are completely unidentified.  We can’t speak to their origin, but neither one of us has ever seen anything like them.",2012-06-20T00:00:00,29.646086792452827,-82.38107610062893

The object appeared below the clouds that were present; and it moved silently.  I estimate that it was approximately 5, 000 feet AGL.  Nevertheless, it was in between the ground and the clouds present.   The orangish-red orb was followed by 14 other objects that followed the exact same flight path as the previous one.   This all occurred just prior to the start of the firework show; and I observed two of the objects go black and I could see their outline in the sky.  I could remember thinking that they looked like about the shape of a quarter.   I had no success obtaining accurate weather information from the FSS, NWS, NCDC and others.

I had brought my camera along, Cannon 3.5 mega pixel in the Auto mode.  I wanted to take some vista shots and some shots of my side-arm delivery that is very spastic, lol.  On the 6th (I posted the wrong hole # on my report to CTC website) hole my neighbor took a sequence of 3 pictures (the 3 pictures took less than 3 seconds to take) of me doing my drive from the tee box….. the first one shows my bad form and the white disc already going the wrong direction,lol.  The second one shows me finished with the drive and the disc has already landed.  The third picture is of me staring out in the direction of my errant shot and surveying the trouble I had gotten myself into, lol.   We ran into a young rattlesnake on the next hole, it went on its way and we went on our way.  Other than that, an! uneventful round of Frisbee golf, lol,lol. Well, on Thursday, the 24th I downloaded the pictures and went through them to delete the ones I didn’t want to save.  When I got to these 3 pictures I was blown away by the third one for sure.   In the first one, you only see my white disc and the clouds in the background, the second one shows me finished with follow through and the disc just landed, only the clouds in the sky.  The third one, it looks like I’m staring right at the UFO.  But I did not see it, nor did my neighbor who took the shots and we didn't here anything.  But the digital camera did catch it.  When I magnified it with my Cannon Utilities program it showed a lot of detail of the craft.  I submitted it to CTC on the 25th, they posted it on the 26th in the photo of the day section.  I’ve had 3 e-mails from people saying it was a Tiger Yellowtail Butterfly….. my simple magnification shows a craft, not a yellowtail butterfly.   How come the first 2 didn’t have the butterfly in the picture field? I’m hoping that you will be able to further enhance it and give me your feedback.  It appears to be ¼ to ½ mile away and about 500-1000 feet high, I’m guessing.

First of all my name is ((named deleted)), I'm 17 y/o and I live in Houston.  I've never believed in UFOs before in my life until last night.   At 7:30pm me and my mom left Houston to drive to my grand parents ranch in Copperas Cove Texas. Along the drive around 11pm, Thursday, December 20th, we saw a pulsating bright light in the distance; the light would  change between completely bright and completely dark in 1 second intervals.  I noticed  it looked odd,  although at such a far distance it was hard to call it anything other than a plane. So I disreguarded it, and kept looking at the landscape.  Suddenly, I heard my mom shriek and I looked out the windshield to my upper left hand corner; what I saw almost looked completely unlike anything I've ever seen before outside of movies.  A five to six sided hexagon looking ship was seemingly hovering almost directly above our vehicle.  Imagine sitting in the passenger seat and looking up to the left through the windshield, the object I saw was about the size of a gold dollar, so I am assuming it was no further then a half mile above our heads.   The only time you could see what it clearly looked like, is when it was iluminated, although it was hard because it was flashing in 1 second intervals like a strobe light.   The object was gray on the bottem and each corner of the shape had a light.  I could tell that the object wasn't skinny, it looked like a hotel in mid air, the size of it was jaw dropping.   As soon as the UFO was no longer in view outside of the windshield,  (Directly above us, but blocked by the material on the roof of the car), I grabbed my moms phone and crawled to the back of the car and began to film.  By this point it seemed as if it had covered a vast amount of distance.  Note that there were atleast 4-5 cars behind us on the same road.  The name of the road we were on is Highway 36 right outside of Cameron, Texas. Even now I am having a hard time believing my eyes. The way it was moving was completely unlike anything I've ever seen before. There was no noise, there also was trail of gas or any type of fuel in its wake.  Leading me to believe that it wasn't some massive oddly shaped plane flying at a low altitude.  Once again I never in my life have believed in alien technology or UFOs of any sort.  Attatched are zoomed in screenshots of the video I took, and a video. In Stevensville on December 19th there was a sighting and the video resembles mine almost exactly.

My first thought was that it could be a plane, helcopter or a signal tower with unuasually bright lights.  We continued to watch it when suddenly it was RIGHT ON ABOVE of our SUV!  There are few words that will effectively relay to anyone that wasn't there just how large and utterly surreal looking this thing was.  It was shaped like an octogan with flashing lights on all sides.  It looked like a building floating in the sky. It had debth/structure to it that's hard to put into context.   I was in shocked and as a mother I became fearful this thing could be a potential threat considering how close it was.   So I stepped on the gas to get a! way from it. I was driving way over the speed limit and not looking back when it occured to us to take a picture or video.  My son was in the back filming what was left of it at that point.  Both my son and I were just floored by what was happening.   I'm extremely dissappointed we didn't think soon and capture the object in solid form.  When we first saw the object it was about 400 meters above us, close enough for us to realize its enormous size, hexagonal shape, and its grey/concrete color.

I was trying to see which direction it was moving, and it looked like it was heading up at first, but as i kept looking it was heading downwards which made me wonder if it was a meteorite or something that entered our atmosphere.  But as it got lower it turned from the original hollow “()"" shape to a solid circle.  That’s when I knew it was something weird, because there was no jet stream behind it or anything... and then it kind of hovered in place, and looked like a bright star. It then got ! really small like it was going further away from me, and then grew bigger a few seconds later like it was getting closer again. It was moving in all different directions; up, down, left and right…I knew this because I was measuring the gap between the object and the sun. It was early, so the sun was not harsh on my eyes.  I wanted to call the police or something but didn’t know who to call.  The only explanation I could think of for it being the “()"" shape when i first noticed it, was if it was going at super sonic speeds into our atmosphere, giving that effect from such a far distance... I did not take a picture because it was too far away and would have just looked like a white speck on my camera phone.

The reason I finally chose to report is, I wanted to be reassured of what I’ve seen and find out more info. I do believe in other worlds that are out of human reach. I will only report the latest sighting, which was today December 21, 2012, at approximately 1:00 P.M. Pacific Standard Time, of three bright white sphere shaped objects at 309 NW degrees down town L.A. As they hovered, they formed triangle shapes, and alignments, some were in straight lines, and then they would go around each other and form yet another triangle.  I have drawn a pattern of which they were forming. In the order they were formed and directions. Finally, a darker (Golden Black) bright object (can’t quite describe its shape) showed in the middle of the formed triangle, and that’s when they stopped hovering, formed one last straight line.  Darker object started vanishing, followed by the three white bright objects, until became way too far to be visible. Last but not least, it’s has always been a hypnotizing experience, where I can’t look away and my surroundings seem to have vanished.  Each of my sightings lasted about 6-10 seconds, yet it felt timeless. Thank you so much in advance.",2012-12-21T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

As I was driving through the Sepulveda pass I noticed a bright white light.  I believed this to be a very bright star at first impression.  I noticed it moving very slowly from the West heading East over the freeway.  It moved slower than a plane or a helicopter would travel and then as I proceeded to start driving almost directly underneath I could tell then that there were actually two unidentified flying objects. At this point in time now (approximately five minutes after my initial sighting) I could tell that there were two objects; one craft was distinctly triangular in shape and had a different colored light at each corner. One light was red, the other was green, and the other was a faint greenish/whitish color.  The lights were going off in an irregular pattern. The other UFO was hard to look at, as the two white lights on it were so bright, I was not able to tell the space of the object itself.  Both of the UFOS were now absolutely stationary in the sky directly over the 405 freeway near Westwood.  They were not moving at all for approximately five minutes, and after that point my car had driven far too south on the freeway for this scene to still be in my view.   I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I was able to see people coming out on their balconies in their apartments whom were also pointing at the sight I was seeing.

The people across the street were alarmed at my pulling over so quickly and after I asked what they had seen, as they were also searching the sky, they admitted that they hadn't seen anything but had heard a sound, like a whistling associated with something moving very fast, and were already looking for what had caused the sound.

The were moving faster than an airplane, but not nearly as fast as a shooting star. All of a sudden the one on the left made an immediate 90 degree turn and within the blink of an eye went due west and was out of site - the object on the right remained stationary. I then went and rang our home doorbell repeatedly and told my wife to look and she was in disbelieve - it was literally right above the tree line.  Then all of a sudden another pair of these objects appeared in the distance and started to get closer to the first object that remained - then all of a sudden the first object disappeared instantenously.  When the next two objects got to the approximate position of the first they remained constant and then over about 5-10 seconds disappeared. As this was g! oing on, I quickly went over and got our neighbors and told them to look and more importantly confirm what we saw so it could be noticed by someone outside our home.  After it was all said and done, there were ~14 of these objects that came to the same position, always in groups of two, and then vanished into mid-air. There was absolutely zero noise with these objects and they were extremely bright with a reddish/orangish coloring.  Given we live extremely close to Dulles International Airport and have planes from all over the world both military and commercial flying over and around our development, I/we can attest these objects were definitely nothing that were man made given the shear speed, no sound, and brightness. In fact, a plane flew over about 10 minutes after these objects disappeared and you could easily make out the strobes and the sound at 30K+ feet.

As it crossed over the eastbound lanes of 495, it changed its courseand also increased its speed, and started heading west, alongside the highway.

It could have possibly been a large hot air balloon, except it changed course very quickly, and also sped up, which seems unlikely.  It also maintained altitude for the 1 minute or so that I saw it.

I was one of 3 people who were grouped together to have a picture taken,  and the rest of the group were sitting in a circle around the fire.  Movement in the sky caught my eye and I looked up to see what it was.  A bright greenish blue ball of light with an orange colored tail was shooting across the sky.  I shouted ""Look! look! look!"" and each member of the group followed where I was looking.  We all watched as this object shot across the sky and out of our direct view in an East to West direction. I will attempt to put it into perspective.  As I am looking out at the Southern sky, picture it as the top half of a clock (9 to 3).  The view of the first 1/3 of the sky is obscured by a garage and trees.  The object comes into view for me at about 11 o'clock and travels across the sky and is out of view by 2 o'clock. The object made no sound.  This whole encounter lasted only about 3 seconds. I recall having the time and foresight to call out ""take a picture"" as the object is at about the 1 o'clock position, but the photographer is so mesmerized and shocked that she was unable to get a picture taken. We discuss and verify what we each saw.  Later, another couple came to the house.  We tell them what we saw and they both verify seeing the same thing from where they were in downtown Bemidji.  Their description was very similar to what we described and they were about 3-4 miles South of where we were. Trying to put the size of the object into perspective is difficult.  Two different groups described very similar objects yet were 4 miles apart.  So the object had to be quite large and quite far away.  Yet the object still looked quite large in the sky.  In comparing the size of a star or the moon as one looks up into the sky, I would have to describe the object as being about 1/4 the size of the moon. So besides the obvious, out of the ordinary color, this object was large enough to not mistake it for a shooting star.  I thought of a meteor because the orange colored tail made me think it would be hot, but it seemed to be maintaining its altitude as it shot across the sky, and not in a downward trajectory.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,47.50319459459459,-94.68763918918918

The next days or so I looked at the moon again and appeared that the Star on the base of the triangle moved on the right side of the moon.  I was amazed and took another picture. In mean time I took some pictures of some piece of furniture in my home and happened that I need to download the pictures and I downloaded the pictures on the computer. I looked at the pictures of the moon taken and for my surprise I noticed in one of the moon’s picture that there are at least two objects which we did not see with naked eyes.  The objects do not appear to be plains, helicopters or stars. They appear in my picture to have a con shape; the objects have the same shape.  I would like the NUFORC to investigate and conclude about those objects.  I wish to get an answer to these objects in my picture.  What are those objects?   I will not send the picture; I would like you to get first in touch with me if you are interested to see the picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

On the evening of April 2, 2012 at about 8:35 PM EDT, I set up my camera on a tripod to photograph the near conjunction of Venus and the Pleiades star cluster.  I was using a Nikon D7000 camera with a 18-105 mm lens set at 105mm. Commencing at 8:41:28PM, I took 6 photographs at approximately 15 second intervals over 73 seconds.  The exposure times ranged from 15 seconds down to 3 seconds.  I was shooting with an f-stop of f11 and an ISO of 6400. The camera remained in the same position for all 6 exposures. At the time, I noticed nothing out of the ordinary either with my eye or through the viewfinder.  When I later downloaded the pictures into Lightroom for processing, I received a tremendous surprise.  Below and to the left of Venus in the first exposure, there was a blue elongated oval of nebulosity about 20 arc seconds in diameter.  The object proceeded to move upwards and to the left in each subsequent frame until, after 6 frames it had covered a distance of about 1 degree of arc . What the object was, I don’t know.  I do know, however, that it was not a lens artifact.  Lens artifacts don’t move.  Right after I took these pictures, I moved the camera to the south and photographed the constellation of Orion with no extraneous objects.  If the object was in the atmosphere, i.e. a high flying aircraft, it would have been long out of the frame in 100 seconds.   If it were in low earth orbit and moving at a similar velocity to the ISS, it would still have been out of the frame during the elapsed time of the shoot. Later, I overlayed the photographs with a piece of tracing paper and registered the object in each frame to the background. Fig 7 shows the path of the object over the elapsed 100 seconds of the event. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter,  Thank you for getting back to me.  I've also posted the sighting to NASA's Space Weather website and MUFON but have received no reply from either one.  I photographed Venus and the Pleiades the following evening but there was nothing there that wasn't supposed to be.  Unfortunately, I was having problems with camera's auto focus, was tired and forgot to use manual focus, so those photos were trashed.  This camera is only a few weeks old and is quite different from the Nikon F that I have been using since 1965.  I do have some thoughts on both what it was not and what it may have been. What it was not: 1. Lens flare.                              2. An atmospheric craft.                                     It showed no running lights; It was too slow except for a helicopter and                                      again, no running lights.                              3. An object in earth orbit.                                     Too slow. Too big? Under power?                              4. Cloud.                                     Weather was clear.                              5. Weather balloon.                                      Not unless it was illuminated by blue spotlights.                              6. Japanese paper lantern.                              7. Reflection.                                      Of what off what?                              8. Spotlight.                                      Illuminating what? There were no clouds and judging by that evening's                                      sunset, very little atmospheric dust.                               9. Venus.                                       Venus was right next to it.                             10. Swamp gas.                             11. Meteorite.                             12. Bolide.                             13. Comet.                                       If it was, I want it named after me.                             14. Another planet. What it possibly could have been.                             1. Ball lightening.                             2. Some other sort of electrical discharge.                             3. Ion flux.                             4. Some sort of plasma effect.                             5. Something blue shifted.                             6. Heated gas containing traces of copper, selenium, indium or arsenic.                             7. Aurora?                             8. Very small Noctilucent  Cloud.                             9. ??????????????? Honestly, I am as mystified as you are.  As I said in my first email, I photographed this thing unintentionally at an ISO of 6400.  The camera was a lot more sensitive to light than the eye. I'm including a blow up of the object, as far as Lightroom will allow me to enlarge it.  As you can see, the pixels at the center are hotter than those toward the edge and there is a faint but distinct halo around the blue glow.  This thing is anybody's guess.  Please feel free to publish the sighting on your website.  I am curious to see if anyone else has any ideas.  You can contact me at any time if you have any further questions.  I know I do.

Conditions were clear and cloudless, sky still midnite blue, not yet black, and not yet full of stars.  We paused in our labors to admire the high jet contrails in the eastern sky, which still glowed a bit, catching the last of the light. Facing East, the object appeared from the South, first one, then two, and finally three tiny but intensely bright red lights, so bright and pure red, they made me think of a laser's intensity.  These were NOT beams, but strobing point sources of a light wavelength so narrow it made me think of a red Helium- Neon or diode laser.  These were unlike any civilian or military running lights either of us had ever seen; nothing to indicate port, starboard, or leading edge.  They were arranged in a rough equilateral triangle, one corner either canted toward or away from us.  As we quickly ran through the possibilities, we told each other to remember as much detail as possible; this was something unique!  As the object soundlessly moved in a straight line from south to north, we each noted its appearance as it drifted over the contrails.  My wife's impression was of a vague solid triangular object with red strobes at each corner floating ABOVE the contrails, which would make it enormous.  My own impression was of a skeletal triangular structure with the same red lights at each corner, passing in front of them contrails, which would still render the object rather gigantic.  There was a rather large gap between each light, notable because all planes must maintain high altitude over the Sierras, and thus their running lights appear close together.",2012-06-14T00:00:00,,

The fireball made a 90 degree turn and headed east.  Suddenly, the light went out and we watched the object free fall.  The object was much bigger than an airplane and it was falling freely, sort of wobbling about.  It seemed to be between Teton Village and the town of Jackson.  There were a few clouds in the sky and we watched it pass a couple of clouds until it got to a very dark cloud and we lost sight of it. We headed on our way home, north on Highway 89.  Suddenly, a fireball was coming towards us! It was large and not very high in the sky.  In fact, it was not higher than the mountain we were driving next to.  There were several other vehicles on the road that had to be witnessing what we were.  As it passed over us, I could clearly see a fireball with a short trail of the fire behind it, lighting up the rear end of the object it was coming from.  The object was round; saucer shaped.  My daughter, being the passenger in the car and able to look longer than I; she saw several pink lights surrounding the fireball.  Ten to twenty pink lights surrounded the fireball object.

It moved erratically for around 20 seconds (back and forth, in circle)and then seemingly acquired a steady high velocity (no apparent acceleration; so it must have been extremely fast)and went north-east.  Didn't see anything after that.  Perspective might have been wrong, but it seemed to be at an altitude of around 1 Km, maybe more; but not much more, because there was a line plane nearby and it was obviously much higher than the object. Judging by the looks of it, the object's speed must have been of several hundred Km/h.  If my estimation of the height is correct, the object must have been around 5-20 meters in diameter. We didn't hear a sound.  The object didn't seem to emit any light. It looked like a dull white sphere to us, but it's possible it was of slightly different! shape.  It didn't emit anything like flames, smoke or any distortion, like an animal, a plane or a balloon would.

I was gazing at the stars out of the passenger window when I began to see flashes of light and a cluster slowly begin to form.  Some lights were flashing bright like a camera flash, while others were dim. I would have to guess that dozens of these lights had flashed randomly during this time.  There were 2 separate incidents in the cluster of flashing lights, they looked like a bright orange ball that appeared like an explosion that stayed a round shape and disappeared.	One appeared to have been closer than the other and/or much larger and these two lights were a few seconds apart.  The light show seemed to be contained in an area that seemed to be within a 100 miles wide, my apologies if this not specific enough. I convinced my husband to pull over and he saw the the light show as well.

Not more than fifteen minutes later, I begged my husband to pull over again because I couldn't believe my eyes.  As we stood on the passenger side of our vehicle, we noticed the lights getting brighter and flashing faster.  After a couple of minutes we realized that the lights were moving towards our direction. We saw white lights that were in sets of two, one light above and one below. As they got closer we saw the lights flew in a very tight and incomplete capital letter ""T"" formation, meaning some areas of the ""T"" were missing. There were a few lights flying outside the formation as well. The lights flew over us with the top of the ""T"" flying directly over us at an angle from right to left. They made no noise that I could hear and were rectangular in shape. They were small, about the size of small plane. The ! lights had an LED appearance to them meaning the light was distinct but not very bright. They flew so close together that it appeared that some of the lights in front looked like four lights hooked together. From the time we were able to make out that the lights were flying towards us till they flew away from us and out of sight took about four minutes.

The light went off at some points and than on while it continued to move around the area of my house (within 3-4 miles as i was trying to watch it, the light was not always on). The reason i know for a fact this was no ordinary flying object to our knowledge of aircraft is for a few reasons. 1) the object circled and zig zaged over the hill in the back of our home at a speed that would be impossible for any pilot to handle. 2)  The object at one point was directly above my home about 600-700 yards (hard to say how high, but not high enough for an airplane in our area, but high enough not to hit any trees or anything by far.)   When it was overhead there were no blinking lights indicating it being an aircraft of ours... the only lights were a mix of yellow/orange (again i cant explain the color, almost as if nothing ive seen..).  Needless to say when it was that close to my home over the biggest tree in our yard, i ran back to the house to make sure i wasnt going to be the next person with an abduction story or something like that to be the town crazy....  Anyhow if anyone else saw this light/lights in the sky please report it on the web.  I could not have been the only one who saw this.  It was fast moving, and did not always have the lights on as if it were moving sometimes without lights..?  but there was something out there that is a fact.

Sitting outside star gazing, and notice an object moving that looked like a star. Watched it and noticed its movement was not a straight projected path and it was almost dancing.  I began to flash my lighter in the air in hopes to make some sort of communication.  It would stop while I was lighting my lighter and as soon as I quit, it would make a real quick movement as if it were saying hello back. 30 mins goes by of watching and I see another one moving across the sky in the general area.  I watch for another 15 mins, then my buddy came over who was on his break from work and he noticed another one.  We shortly realized that their were roughly 25-50 ufos in the sky, with more creeping up on the horizon and they were all moving.  Then I noticed that every formation was some form of a triangle. Around 4 I see one ufo zoom out of the sky as if it dissappeared, it looked like a shooting star, but I watching it from start to finish. Around 430 I noticed the same! ufo i was attempting to make contact with was directly on top of me because it was the brightest one, thats how i noticed it in the first place. I ran around my pool several times and each time it would move where I would be.  Around 505 it was beginning to get daylight out but there were still a couple formations still visable, one being the first one I witnessed. I noticed that it was not just one bright light, but also had two dimmer lights that made a triangle shape, that I only noticed when there was more daylight.  I began to flash my lighter while waving, and did for a good 20 mins.  Every time I flashed and stopped, it would make its move back letting me know they see me.  But this time I got to see the full triangular craft in midflight.  The only way I can discribe its movement is just like the old video game astroid, the bright light was always pointing to the direction it was moving forward, but could also easily slide backwards. Around 515 am this one craft was! the only one remaining in the now blue sky.  I began waving m! y arms i n the air as if I was telling it to come closer, and it centered up right on top of me and began to slightly decline in altitude. It was visable enough for me to see the whole shape, sheer size, and its stealth, it made no sound. A little before 530 am, it began to climb back up into the sky and vanished.

On Saturday, August 18, 2012, three of my neighbors and I (total of four people) were outside on the corner of my neighbors townhouse having a little fire and talking.  I was the first to notice a firey orange light floating high above in the sky.  I looked up and said, ""Hey everyone, look at that1""   One person asked, ""What is that?""  I did not know nor do I still know what it was.  My first instant thought was could it be a bag on fire, because it was floating but it's floating was a steady course from north to south.  My female neighbor was worried it would land on her roof and catch fire.  However, after a second of looking at it it was clearly not something on fire because there was no flame, spark, or smoke and it made no noise or sound whatsoever.  It was clearly a neon-orange orb-like object.  The same exact color as fire, but in the shape of a sphere.  I was so amazed at it that it did not occur to me to take any photos of this one.  It conti! nued to floatfly in a steady direction from northeast to south until it seemed to get dimer and finally vanish in the distance high above some trees and houses. My other neighbor walked by (now a total of five people) and we told her what we saw and we began to speculate as to what it was. Moments later (within a minute or two), a second glowing orange orb appeared traveling in the same direction exactly like the first one. This time, I grabbed my Canon digital camera, which I had on hand and I zoomed in and managed to take two photographs of the orange orbs. This second orb also became dimer the further it traveled away and vanished into the distant. I have never seen or witnessed anything like this ever before in my life.  These two orange orb-like objects were too big or close to be stars in space and were too symmetrical in shape and neon-orange in color to resemble a shooting star.  The had no tail or streak to indicate being a comet or meteor and although they were minutes apart from each other they both floated/flew in the same North-to-South course direction.  They traveled as a steady pace. They appeared as though they were floating in motion, thus discounting the possibility that they were comets, meteors, or shooting stars. I saw nothing to indicate that it could have been a hot air balloon.  These were fire-like neon-orange orb-like objects, emitting no sound or noise as they traveled across the night sky over were my neighbors and I live in Grand Chute, Wisconsin, right on the outskirts of Appleton, Wisconsin.

Finally the first object faded overhead at some distance, the 2nd and 3rd approaching began to separate, they originally approached close to each other.   The 2nd came straight over head.   As it did I detected a circular shadow against the clouds and a dark segment circulating clock wise within the shadow.

It was not falling like a shooting star, but moving horizontally.  Unlike the first sighting, this one had no trailing “cone” shape behind it, but otherwise it was identical.   It produced no trail, like a shooting star or comet.   It moved in a straight line fairly quickly, like the speed you would of a plane flying across the sky.   But I have seen planes flying across the night sky with their navigation lights flashing at regular intervals.  This was definitely not a plane.  The object was basically round and orange in color, but it shimmered or flashed but not regularly – the effect was more like it was an irregular shaped object spinning around fairly quickly.   Maybe it would be akin to wrapping aluminum foil around a rock, hang from a string, spin it around, and shine a bright orange light on it.   Anyway, it tracked across the sky and then it gradually diminished in intensity and eventually faded from view.

They came up in a scattered sort of line, like a massive roman candle but a little quicker in pace of appearance. One went higher up in the sky, a set of three formed a near equilateral triangle to the bottom right of the first,  and the last set of three formed a very wide obtuse triangle to the immediate right of the first triangle. They were as bright as Jupiter was during its peak this year, glowing red with just a little bit of yellow around them, but they were a significantly larger source than Jupiter. They were a solid source of light, and they were moving visibly east and began to cross HWY 65. I watched them disappear behind the buildings as we turned and traveled north, but when I got home a minute later I ran inside to get my boyfriend. When we went back outside all 7 were dimly visible from my parking lot due south and much smaller- the light source size was a third and they were just pricks of light, no longer glowing.

I work in the Health Care Field and my friend is retired and worked as a English Second Language Teacher and with Canada Rail. Esquimalt Lagoon, (Colwood),Victoria, B.C. At approximately 11:00 pm  PST I drove to the Lagoon in Colwood with a friend along Ocean Boulevard from Island Hwy.  I kept seeing a very bright light on my  left,drivers mirror but no actual light in the mirror itself.  In the rear view mirror there was no vehicle nor light of any kind.  On the right mirror side I saw the shine of light around my mirror as well periodically.  I felt like a vehicle was following my SUV.  Only when I asked the friend if he could see this vehicle did we see for a short while one bright light and one small yellow light in the right mirror.  My friend said looks like it could be a car with only one light then it did not show up in the mirror. When we arrived at the Lagoon a minute later and pulled in I did not notice the vehicle go by but assumed I had missed it or it had stopped on the road. We sat and talked awhile and all of a sudden two blue lights (very blue) were gliding smoothly over the ocean towards the USA. I could not see if the lights were attached and if so the craft would have had to be very big or if they were individual crafts.  It was very dark out.  These lights were very low to the water, travelled without noise, were not at all erratic in movement and did not move the water surface.  The water surface was lit in large spots by lights from the Shipyard/Dockyard which was quite a ways away but are so high they light up the water at a distance and no disturbance showed on the water by the blue lights. These lights were a fair distance apart did not blink at all and seemed to travel one behind the other simultaneously.  All known craft do not seem to fit into what we saw.  Helicopter or hovercraft should have exhibited noise, or water movement or both.  Planes do not travel that smooth nor do helicopters.  Too smooth also for speedboats.  The speed also does not fit any other craft. These lights disappeared as they got close to the USA. I have mentioned the lights on my car as they may have been some anomaly as well as I can not figure why on such a curvy road I was unable to catch glimpses of a vehicle or at least some light in the rear view mirror or a beam in the side mirror not just around it.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,48.456685618166524,-123.38397199327164

One emitted a ""search light"" &  they all disappeared in depth int Marina Del Rey, CA just before 11:00 pm.   My husband and I had just laid down to go to bed.  We have a clear view of flight path for LAX.  Looked out our window and saw two glowing orbs that we thought were helicopters that were approaching, possibly looking for someone in the peninsula area, which is not atypical.  They were not moving very fast, they had an odd glowing red light unlike an airplane or helicopter- the orbs were slowly pulsating rather than blinking and the light was much brighter than any landing gear or anything.  I thought they were possibly far off on the other side of LAX, but an airplane had just taken off and clearly passed behind one of the orbs.   A third orb appeared and was in line of the other two.  The first orb turned towards the sea, and a fourth appeared in line behind the third.  I thought it was weird that they were so close and yet there was no sound like you would expect to hear from a helicopter, so I jumped up to observe them.   The first one, which had turned, was no longer red (perhaps the red was only in front) and proceeded out towards the sea in a straight line until the light simply disappeared into a pinhole size.  It was not like a shooting star, it simply faded like it disappeared in depth.  The fourth orb appeared to be about over the water channel and a light suddenly appeared to illuminate a large area (perhaps over the water) to the east of the orb, BUT there was no light trail emitting  from the orb, there was no visible  ""spotlight"" on the red orb, and the illumination was pinkish purple.  I watched these orbs turn out to the sea, and one by one they slowly shrank into pinhole size lights before they disappeared.  The orbs never appeared to bank and did not follow any common flight pattern.  I thought perhaps they were small planes, yet a small plane pasted a few minutes later- you could hear the small plane and it did not appear to shrink as the orbs did about ten m! inutes before.  Last night was extremely clear, and all the ai! rplanes in the area were flying in typical patterns, they banked out over long beach as typical and never appeared to shrink and disappear as the orbs had.  This was an unexplainable phenomenon.  I have grown up flying in small planes, including at night time, and these orbs were nothing like airplanes.  They flew low like helicopters but had no sound.  The light they emitted was so bright you could not actually see their shape.  The light that the fourth orb emitted over such a large area should presumably come from a visible spot from the craft- there was no ""spotlight"".  These orbs disappeared more quickly and in such an odd fashion that it looked like an optical illusion… The pictures you have posted over the marina with the glowing orbs look like the same ones that were hovering over the Marina last night…..",2012-11-04T00:00:00,33.978093939393936,-118.43761515151516

I was outside on a break at work, it was about 7:15pm.  Weather was perfect, bright blue sky with hardly a cloud to be seen.  Upon exiting the building I looked to the sky, as I usually do (I’m fascinated with looking up, watching airplanes, looking at stars etc.) I noticed two planes very high heading west, one behind the other and a little offset.  I watched for a few seconds and turned my attention to my phone to do a bit of web surfing.  After a couple of minutes I again looked toward the sky, but this time I was in for a surprise! When I looked up, I saw something I can’t explain.  There was a bright white object. The shape was somewhere between a cigar and a cylinder.  Actually, it looked like a pill capsule.  Take the fuselage of a plane, remove the wings and tail and cap both ends with a dome.  That’s what I saw. I was on the east side of Columbus, OH and fairly close to the airport. Keep in mind, it was broad daylight when this occurred.  The “object” was traveling from south to north in much the same way a blimp might travel. (silently gliding across the sky)  The altitude was really not that high, I’m guessing around 5’000 ft. It was low enough to see that it did not have wings, and that it was not a blimp, but it was just a little too high to see any clear detail. (as in windows , doors etc.) A pair of cheap binoculars would have revealed something I’m sure.  That’s how close it was. I watched the object pass over as it headed north.  I’m guessing it was about a half mile east of my position. Hard to tell though because I don’t know the true size of said object.  From my perspective I’d say the size was somewhere between a private jet, and a commercial airliner.  The moment was very surreal. I just watched in amazement. I did think about taking a picture with my phone, but I knew the picture would only reveal a small white blob in the sky, and wouldn’t prove anything… I would be made fun of by friends when trying to show it. In hindsight however, I wish I had taken that picture!  The object continued heading away from me to the north, and after I had my fill of watching it, I again returned to surfing the web. (I knew I had just witnessed something extraordinary, but there was nothing else to see)  After reading a couple articles in the news I decided it was time to go back inside. I took one more look to the sky, and low and behold, there it was again! It seemed to be on the same trajectory, only this time, it was headed back to where it came. (south) I couldn’t believe it. I watched for a few seconds and decided I needed a witness. I went back inside, and yelled for one of my co-workers. I told him to hurry, you’ve gotta see this. We were back outside in about 15 sec. I pointed to the sky and said “What the **** is that?!!”  He was without words. I had him confirm what I saw.  Me:  “do you see wings?”   Him: “no”   Me: “is it a blimp?” Him: “no”  Me: “what do you think it is?”  Him: “I don’t know” We watched it head further to the south for maybe 30-40 sec. and then it changed course a bit and headed roughly south east and then accelerated (gradually, but firmly) off into the distance. Im very glad I called for him. I have no idea what I witnessed. I very much like looking to the sky, and I do every time I go outside. I live in the flight path of Port Columbus and I am accustomed to seeing different types of planes as they come in to land. I’ll admit I’m no aviation expert, but like I said I’ve always been fascinated by flight, and I watch planes every chance I get. I love to read about the mysteries of this earth, and in doing so, I have read enough to also be a very skeptical person. However, this is one thing I cannot explain.  To me this was truly an Unidentified Flying Object. From where it came, I do not know, but I am very glad to have witnessed it. I have searched online every day since and have come up with nothing. Surely somebody saw it, and I would like to hear other accounts.",2012-04-18T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

Shape:  Bright, light blue orb changing into hazy light blue “Hershey kiss” / teardrop with plume-like halo  On the evening of April 3, 2012 I stepped out of my west-facing apartment to walk to my car when a bright bluish “star” captured my eye.  Usually when I walk outside at night, I take a minute to observe the night sky, so I noticed immediately something was out of place. This bright object was moving approximately northeast to a northwesterly heading, to the right of where the sun sets. It was moving at prop airplane speed about 35-40 degrees from the horizon (I’d guess 5000’ +/- AGL).  As the object moved in a slight downward arc, I noticed it forming an ever- brighter sapphire blue plume emitting from its central light which at the same time was fading slightly. As I saw a change happening, I knew this was absolutely no plane, and ran back in my apartment to grab my camera.  I got :25 seconds of footage with my point-and-shoot Canon in which you can only make out a blue fuzz ball.  It was dark and I couldn’t tell exactly where I was aiming, but I captured a little of the blu! e light.  As I watched/filmed, the object took the shape of a Hershey kiss turned on its side, (some would say teardrop) point facing its forward direction. The hazy halo/plume reminded me of the sort of vapor a rocket emits in its trail, but this plume did not fade or get any larger, and it stuck with the object as it traveled. As it “plumed out”, the light continued on its heading, not getting any larger or smaller, just a little dimmer until it disappeared behind the mountains. If you held your thumb out at arm’s length, it was just smaller than your thumbnail at its largest.  Usually when an object moves away, it gets smaller, but this object did not do that, so perhaps I witnessed it moving laterally.  I’m typing this less than an hour after the sighting so it’s fresh in mind, and I’ve also created a Photoshop rendering of the object on its path and the shape changes it made as I watched.",2012-04-18T00:00:00,39.179,-80.0792

At approximately 11:35 PM, I notice a bright, glowing orb in the southern sky, looking toward Pine Grove Mills from Lemont.  Having seen orange orbs in the past and knowing what to look for, I knew it might be something out of the ordinary, so I stopped to observe the object before entering my house.  I watched for about 30 seconds, noticing that it was absolutely motionless.  Then after this duration, it began to move slowly from left to right, right to left, then left to right again, much like a leaf or feather would fall toward the ground.  The object then continued on a perfectly straight line due south beyond the horizon and out of view. The night was clear. I posted an ad in the open forum at Craigslist in an attempt to get others who might have seen the object around that same time, but no one has yet stepped forward, other than to ridicule.

There was still some light from the setting sun allowing a small portion of the sky to still be visible.  We live a few miles north of Zanesville, Ohio.  We heard some neighbors shooting off fireworks, so we went out to see. We looked to the west and saw one bright circular orange object moving from left to right. At first we thought it was one the rockets from the fireworks that had yet to burn itself out, mind you the fireworks had stopped going off at this point.   But it stayed lit and moved in a straight line, perfectly smooth. It appeared to be low in altitude and moved from south to north. It would estimate that it was between 30 to 45 degrees above the horizon. The object appeared to be a little bigger and brighter than Venus.  My first reaction was that this was the ISS space station, because the object seemed to match the speed and was not flickering in any way.   But we looked it up and saw that the station was over the Atlantic ocean, which means it would have been on the eastern horizon moving away from us.   I pulled out my phone and took a video of the object.  It was already halfway across the sky when we got out there. It lasted 1:30 -2 minutes tops.  As it moved farther away, it appeared to dim, and then completely disappeared, my guess is that it went behind a cloud.  But the clouds appeared to be cirrus, meaning they were quite high in altitude. I looked up the weather for our area and saw that the wind speeds were calm (less than 5mph) and SSE.

Seven Changes in Fifty Steps or Less!  I was walking back home from the convenience store just across the rural road.  Our not too long driveway is almost directly  aligned with the driveway of the convenience store.  In other words, a hop, skip and jump away from my door. As I was almost out of the parking lot to go and cross the road, I looked up and seen a silver white airplane that was about  the size of a commuter plane.  I wondered what it was doing flying so low in this area.  It seemed to be over the bush  between our road and the road behind our backyard.  This ""plane"" began changing form. Between these distinct forms, it was difficult to see any form distinctly changing except for when the ""helicopter blades""  seemingly went back into the form before it finally became cigar shaped.  Instead of looking like playdough being reformed  by invisible hands, instead, it was only grayish or hazy with an indistinct moving form on the outline of the shape.  Between  indescribable shapes between the indistinct shapes, it did keep a white silver changing shape body of the same size as the  original ""plane"".  The final cigar shape was about the length and fullness of the original ""plane"" body.  I only stopped looking  at it once, briefly, to make sure I could safely cross the road. All of this shape changing took place in the length of time it takes for about fifty steps tops.  The thing remained a silvery  white color throughout the different shapes.  Despite hurrying up, I lost sight of it when it went behind the trees in the  backyard. The different shapes and order are as follows:  1.  Very low flying airplane shape.  It was so low that I thought it was unusual and kept watching it.  It was faintly  luminescent whitish silver in color.  The ""plane"" began to lose its details somehow yet kept its shape somehow.  I could not  seem to really get a grip on its form as it began to change enough for me to catch on that I could be seeing something unusual  that I should just watch instead of trying to make sense of it.  It was astonishing and my eyes kept trying to make sense of it  between shapes. 2.  Three pronged shape without the full body of the airplane shape.  It more resembled the thin body of the musical triangle  only the three lines formed a wide bird foot or pronged triangle shape. 3.  A spinning bangle bracelet type shape attached by a few thin rods to a shape changing smaller thing at the bottom.  It was  sort of like a snow cone shaped frame attached at the point to an egg or some form that always kept changing shape. 4.  At the top of the snow cone frame appeared a large oval light.  It was also silver light and while it seemed like a light, it  did not  illuminate the still very bright early evening that would soon become twillight. 5.  A clear helicopter form that at one point seemed upside down as the small shape at the bottom of the snow cone became  bigger.  It was a definite helicopter form with the whirly blades shape above it.  I do not know if the blade shapes were  actually whirling.    Rather, I was watching as the nose of the ""helicopter"" became more detailed in its shape.  In contrast, the  spinning bracelet from which the light appeared in number four appeared to be moving in a more obvious way. 6.  A cigar shape with a few small shapes with/or little projections on the body of it.  7.  These little shapes on cigar shape disappeared right before it went behind the trees.  It was then just a smooth white silver  cigar the last time I saw the UFO.",2012-05-29T00:00:00,42.593,-82.3885

A friend and I were sitting at a community lake while a slight storm went on outside. There wasn't a lot of rain, but there was a lot of lightening.  The clouds broke on and off.  We were sitting inside the car when we thought we saw what was a star in between some clouds in a clearing.  We both basically disregarded it for a while, unsure that it had any significance.   A few minutes later (10 or 15) my friend noted that there was something strange about it.  He thought he saw it move. We got out of the car to get a better look (it was no longer raining, just sprinkling) and the “star” was incredibly bright.  As a reference, if the moon were full, this spherical object would be half its size and very very bright. It was a yellowish light, and it did not blink.  The object was a good distance away (north west in the distance), and it was difficult to really tell what its size was.  We studied the object for a good time. It appeared to spin, and one side of the sphere was brighter and you could tell when that side faced the other way.  At this point it hadn't done any extreme movement, it was more of just hovering with some slight cradling side to side. It was cold, so we both got in the car to continue watching it. We sat for a while and both at the same time saw it dart to the left quite quickly and precisely.  We then got out of the car to watch more, very intrigued.  To our dismay it very quickly went away, making a few more side to side movements before being so far away that we could no longer see it.  We got in the car, determined to follow it.  We couldnt, and inevitably came back to the same exact spot about fifteen minutes later.  It was very far away now, and on a different part of the sky completely.  Once again, we watched it make a few small, quick movements, before darting away into the distance.  I'd like to add that neither of us were on any drugs or could be counted as an unreliable source. Whatever we saw, it was in fact there, and not a hallucination. We tried to rule out every possibility, and we were left with some sort of UFO.",2012-04-18T00:00:00,37.7307,-89.906

I thought it had left but I watched the spot it was in for a few more seconds and it reappeared as bright as it was before and stayed there for 30 seconds to a minute and then it went away again.  It disappeared then reappeared 10-15 different times as I was making sure I didn’t lose sight of it so when I got home I could show my relatives.  They sat and watched it with me and we all saw it disappear and reappear many more times until we finally went inside but we never saw it leave so it could have been there for the next hour or so. This light didn’t move and it had a kind of shape to it but I couldn’t make it out because it looked so far away but it was so bright.  I honestly think it was some sort of craft or energy. I was relieved when it disappeared in front of my relatives so I wasn’t the only one who saw it.  It was definitely high in the sky because clouds were passing in front of it and dimming the light very slightly.,2012-04-18T00:00:00,35.403269041095896,-80.62708465753425

A UFO appeared, and was changing  right before my eye’s.  I had been outside looking at the stars.  The sky was dark, clear of clouds, and the moon hadn’t risen yet.  I came back into the house and sat in the recliner to watch television.  I am looking at the TV right next to the full sliding screen door to the open porch directly in front of me.  The view of the sky from where I am setting is jet black. Suddenly a red circle appeared. It was large not small like a star.  I’ve never seen anything like this in the sky.  The color was like a dark red ripe strawberry.  As I ran out onto the porch it changed right in front  of my eye’s.  There was a orange red deep crescent thicker in the middle and tapering at each upward point .  There were two perfect circles watermelon colored  above each point of the crescent. It was moving in a vertical position horizontally  across the sky.  The size of the circles were like the size of a pencil eraser compared to a star ,and the depth of the crescent was at least  three times as long as the circle’s size.  Next there appears  a  frame of light yellow gold in the shape  of an elliptical with the circles midway of the yellow gold frame there appears to be cup like indentations on right and left top, outlined by the yellow gold frame.  The frame appears to be equal in height above the circles as the orange red crescent is below.  The size is now ! much larger now. There is nothing visible in the center. The object is slowly moving behind the treetops , the tree is approximately 40-50 feet tall.  I can see light   Through the trees.  The glimpses I can see it seems to have changed position .  I can see it more horizontal to the ground with white in the center.  At this point it definitely looks like a craft.  It’s gone behind a taller tree and all I can see is light coming through the tree for a couple of seconds. Then I see it again this time clearer.  I see two  bright  white large rounded cylinder shaped protrusions in the center  with a deep red circle on either side.  It is tilting toward me as it passes from behind the tree. It seems extremely close like two hundred feet or less, and its large.

Between 11:30pm and 12am I walked out to the front porch to have a smoke and noticed a incredible bright lite directly north of my position over the General Motors plant that seemed to be level with a red lite from a cell phone tower on the north end of Marion IN.  From my view point it looked to be no more than 200ft from the ground and stayed at that position for about a minute and a half.  The lite was flickering... kinda what you would see from a candle but was much more intense, and the colors were a bright orange,red and a bluish green.   My lady and I often look at the nite sky and from where we live at out in the middle of a corn field we can really enjoy the open skies without anything nearby restricting our view.  So after about a minute of watching this I call to her to come outside and take a look.  It had seemed odd that it wasn't changing position at all, that and how very intensely bright they were.  It is not often that there is not a b! reeze in this area... the wind is a constant.  My first thoughts were that of one of those oriental sky lanterns but like I said the lights were much to bright to be a flame from one of those and if it were that or of a balloon I believe it would have a steady climb rather than just staying in a fixed position.   Shortly after my lady came out to observe this with me the object began to rise, I'd say close to 400 to 500ft the lights quit.  It wasn't a dwindle or a slow fade, they ended immediately.  I say they and lights but all 3 colors were coming from one fixed spot.  I live very close to the Marion municipal airport and get to see planes coming in and out every day but there really isn't very much traffic at nite. The Marion hospital has a green and white chopper that is often seen coming from the far north east traveling towards a slight west by south west towards Kokomo and its engines are quite recognizable.  What I was seeing could not be heard from my location.  If it were! a plane coming in or out I believe it was insanely low and it! seemed to be only 3 to 4 miles north of us... if it were a plane at that distance we would be able to see the wing and tail strobes.

I turned onto the next side street, and immediately realized the object was moving east.  I exited my vehicle and watched as it crossed the sky when suddenly two more lights just like it entered my plane of view.  They were moving at similar speeds and in the same direction.

I brushed it off as a bar having a search light.   Then I noticed that the angle of the light beams was parallel to the ground, horizontal.  This confused me and as I looked closer I realized it wasn't one light but two, like a light house. The two light beams were radiation at 180 degree angles from each other and both moving in a 360 spin, seeming to come from the same point within the cloud.   The beams of light were very thick and seemed to go on for many miles in each direction, the light cloud coverage illuminating with the light and showing the beam very clearly.  I brushed this off as I knew there is a small airstrip in the area.   This morning I google searched what I saw and found a similar report on this website so I thought I would put this information out there.  This struck me as unusual because the light source seemed to be coming from a fixed position and the beams of light were undeniably moving at a set rate.   The only explanation I could come up with is that it was a search helicopter that was in a spin, but this lasted the entire time I was within sight of it, and it never seemed to change elevation (and had two beams).

My occupation as a truck driver did not prepare me for what I witnessed in the sky, behind where I live. I believe that my life-long interest of aviation however, has given me the ability to observe and determine the differences between conventional and non-conventional aircraft in flight. It was 02:05, Atlantic Standard Time, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, when I stepped outside and into my back yard to have a smoke. I was looking at the stars, as I often do, when they’re visible. That’s when I saw one of the stars moving at a fairly high rate of speed, South-East to North-West. Of course, I thought this to be a shooting star at first but the rate at which it moved through the air seemed too slow to be that. Then, to my astonishment, I noticed that the object was emitting a pulsating white light that engulfed it approximately every four seconds. The pulsations were also smooth. That is to say that it was like a dimmer switch being turned completely up, then back down again, to the almost off position. This dimmer effect would last about a second and a half between intervals. The object pulsated like that three times as it traveled across most of my field of vision. It emitted no sound even though it was completely silent in my neighbourhood. If the object had not done what it did next, I wouldn’t have been able to guess its size or its altitude. When the object moved to the far left of my view, it suddenly made an extremely sharp right-hand turn, North-East. No aircraft that I’m aware of could make such a turn at the apparent rate the object was traveling. I have never seen anything like it in my life. The object then disappeared into a nearby cloud.  I waited for it to emerge but it didn’t. Approximately ten seconds later, and to the right (South-East) of the cloud, there appeared a tremendous white flash, as if from a giant camera.  It was not lightning.  It was something else. Then, it was gone. The cloud appeared to be fifteen hundred to, two thousand feet from the ground and so I believe that the object was moving at a similar altitude as, it did not appear to change altitude during this observation.  I will admit that I do not know how far from my position the cloud was. At any rate, I should have been able to hear something if this was a conventional aircraft. I didn’t hear a thing.",2012-06-20T00:00:00,44.67892469512195,-63.55159817073171

I noticed lightening out over Sarasota Bay to my south, so I was watching the sky and noticed some strange lights to the north, moving too slow to be a plane. So, I took my dogs down a street that had a clear view of the sky and saw at least 4 triangle shaped ships crossing the sky. They appeared to be maybe 3-5 miles away, over the north end of Anna Maria Island and they were moving west to east, as though they had just come in from over the Gulf of Mexico. They were moving in concert with one another, obviously following each other. They were very large, wider than the clouds and they appeared to be traveling “upright” because I could see the triangle shape clearly as through it were facing me, rather than having the flat side facing toward the ground. Each one had very bright red lights on each corner of the triangle that were steady and fainter white ones directly beside that flashed on a steady! rhythm, blinking on and off every couple seconds. They were moving in and out of cloud cover, but I was able to observe them until they crossed out of sight. I would estimate that I had a clear sky view spanning probably 8-10 miles wide. It took the 4 that I saw at least ten minutes to pass out of my line of sight completely. I took a video with my cell phone of the last one, which is very shaky and hard to decipher because I was also trying to hold my dog's leashes in the other hand and they were running and pulling on me.

Logansport, IN This is a copied article, posted as requested. These articles cover rare information on SETI signal SHGb02+14a  [Article 1] Mysterious signals from light years away  19:00 01 September 2004 by Eugenie Samuel Reich  In February 2003, astronomers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) pointed the massive radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, at around 200 sections of the sky. The same telescope had previously detected unexplained radio signals at least twice from each of these regions, and the astronomers were trying to reconfirm the findings. The team has now finished analysing the data, and all the signals seem to have disappeared. Except one, which has got stronger. This radio signal, now seen on three separate occasions, is an enigma. It could be generated by a previously unknown astronomical phenomenon. Or it could be something much more mundane, maybe an artefact of the telescope itself. But it also happens to be the best candidate yet for a contact by intelligent aliens in the nearly six-year history of the SETI@home project, which uses programs running as screensavers on millions of personal computers worldwide to sift through signals picked up by the Arecibo telescope. Absorb and emit  ""It's the most interesting signal from SETI@home,"" says Dan Werthimer, a radio astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and the chief scientist for SETI@home. ""We're not jumping up and down, but we are continuing to observe it.""  Named SHGb02+14a, the signal has a frequency of about 1420 megahertz. This happens to be one of the main frequencies at which hydrogen, the most common element in the universe, readily absorbs and emits energy. Some astronomers have argued that extraterrestrials trying to advertise their presence would be likely to transmit at this frequency, and SETI researchers conventionally scan this part of the radio spectrum. SHGb02+14a seems to be coming from a point between the constellations Pisces and Aries, where there is no obvious star or planetary system within 1000 light years. And the transmission is very weak. ""We are looking for something that screams out &#145;artificial',"" says UCB researcher Eric Korpela, who completed the analysis of the signal in April. ""This just doesn't do that, but it could be because it is distant."" Unknown signature  The telescope has only observed the signal for about a minute in total, which is not long enough for astronomers to analyse it thoroughly. But, Korpela thinks it unlikely SHGb02+14a is the result of any obvious radio interference or noise, and it does not bear the signature of any known astronomical object. That does not mean that only aliens could have produced it. ""It may be a natural phenomenon of a previously undreamed-of kind like I stumbled over,"" says Jocelyn Bell Burnell of the University of Bath, UK. It was Bell Burnell who in 1967 noticed a pulsed radio signal which the research team at the time thought was from extraterrestrials but which turned out to be the first ever sighting of a pulsar. There are other oddities. For instance, the signal's frequency is drifting by between eight to 37 hertz per second. ""The signal is moving rapidly in frequency and you would expect that to happen if you are looking at a transmitter on a planet that's rotating very rapidly and where the civilisation is not correcting the transmission for the motion of the planet,"" Korpela says. This does not, however, convince Paul Horowitz, a Harvard University astronomer who looks for alien signals using optical telescopes. He points out that the SETI@home software corrects for any drift in frequency. Fishy and puzzling  The fact that the signal continues to drift after this correction is ""fishy"", he says. ""If [the aliens] are so smart, they'll adjust their signal for their planet's motion.""  The relatively rapid drift of the signal is also puzzling for other reasons. A planet would have to be rotating nearly 40 times faster than Earth to have produced the observed drift; a transmitter on Earth would produce a signal with a drift of about 1.5 hertz per second. What is more, if telescopes are observing a signal that is drifting in frequency, then each time they look for it they should most likely encounter it at a slightly different frequency. But in the case of SHGb02+14a, every observation has first been made at 1420 megahertz, before it starts drifting. ""It just boggles my mind,"" Korpela says. The signal could be an artefact that, for some reason, always appears to be coming from the same point in the sky. The Arecibo telescope has a fixed dish reflector and scans the skies by changing the position of its receiver relative to the dish. When the receiver reaches a certain position, it might just be able to reflect waves from the ground onto the dish and then back to itself, making it seem as if the signal was coming from space.  ""Perhaps there is an object on the ground near the telescope emitting at about this frequency,"" Korpela says. This could be confirmed by using a different telescope to listen for SHGb02+14a. Possible fraud  There is also the possibility of fraud by someone hacking the SETI@home software to make it return evidence for an extraterrestrial transmission. However, SHGb02+14a was seen on two different occasions by different SETI@home users, and those calculations were confirmed by others.  Then the signal was seen a third time by the SETI@home researchers. The unusual characteristics of the signal also make it unlikely that someone is playing a prank, Korpela says. ""As I can't think of any way to make a signal like this, I can't think of any way to fake it.""  David Anderson, director of SETI@home, remains sceptical but curious about the signal. ""It's unlikely to be real but we will definitely be re-observing it."" Bell Burnell agrees that it is worth persisting with. ""If they can see it four, five or six times it really begins to get exciting,"" she says.  It is already exciting for IT engineers Oliver Voelker of Logpoint in Nuremberg, Germany and Nate Collins of Farin and Associates in Madison, Wisconsin, who found the signal.  Collins wonders how his bosses will react to company computers finding aliens. ""I might have to explain a little further about just how much I was using [the computers],"" he says.  Ref: http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6341-mysterious-signals-from-light-years-away.html?full=true   [Article 2]  Radio source SHGb02+14a  Radio source SHGb02+14a is a source and a candidate in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), discovered on March 2003 by SETI@home and announced in New Scientist on September 1, 2004.[1]  The source was observed three times at a frequency of about 1420 MHz,[2] which is expected to be a frequency used by extraterrestrials due to its proximity to one of the main frequencies at which hydrogen absorbs and radiates photons.  There are a number of puzzling features of this candidate, which have led to a large amount of skepticism. The source is located between the constellations Pisces and Aries, a direction in which no stars are observed within 1000 light years. It is also a very weak signal. The frequency of the signal has a rapid drift, which would correspond to it being emitted from a planet orbiting nearly 40 times faster than the Earth around the sun. However, each time the signal was detected, it was again at about 1420 MHz, the original frequency before any drift.  There are also a number of potential explanations for this signal. SETI@home has denied media reports of likely extraterrestrial signal.[3][4] It could be an artifact of random chance, cosmic noise or possibly just a glitch in the technology.

I was standing outside my house on Chicago's Far Northwest Side approximately twenty minutes before midnight on Father's Day, 2012.  I routinely see two stars on a diagonal line in the southwest sky each evening and, when I glanced up into the sky, I thought I saw these stars in a new position.  But I was in error; the 'stars' were visibly two pink or purple lights, approximately two to three inches apart (using my fingers as a measuring instrument), one directly behind the other.  The lights didn't blink, but they weren't constant, either.  They appeared to pulsate, and the lights were rather dim.  From the moment I first noticed them, their transit took approximately twenty to thirty seconds.  I couldn't detect any shape of aircraft, there was no sound, and visibility was very good - no clouds or other distractions were in view.  Given the precision with which the lights were following one another, I originally thought they might be emanating from one craft.  But the second light suddenly picked up speed and either 'joined' the first light or flew frightening close to the first light as its 'wingman'.  I have no way of determining the altitude these craft were flying but, given the clear night, lack of sound and inability to detect any shape behind the lights, I would assume they were flying at a very high altitude.  And if this is the case, they were indeed traveling at an enormous rate of speed. I live a few miles from O'Hare International Airport, and my family and I are accustomed to seeing aircraft in their final approach and take-off from the airport every five minutes or so almost constantly.   The sky was quite busy tonight with inbound/outbound aircraft, but these hazy pink orbs were not coming from O'Hare, nor were they headed toward the airport.  Their flight plan was very obviously in contrast to any local aircraft traffic in this area, and could very well have posed a hazard to navigation for the surrounding pilots. These were not helicopters, flares, ultralights or any other aircraft known to me.  I am unaware of pink or purple lights used on any commercial or private aircraft, nor am I aware of any FAA regulations permitting such colors to be used within extremely close proximity to the nation's second-busiest airport. I would very much like to uncover exactly what these lights were.  I am a veteran Navy intelligence officer and have two combat deployments to my credit.  I have over sixteen years worth of experience with a wide array of aircraft, and yet I have never seen anything like this before.",2012-06-20T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

I was watching it for a good ten minutes and it would disappear behind nothing, then reappear.  I was at my exit in Carr Colorado and pulled off of the road on the off ramp.

One directly above the other.  It was not a plane, and it was not dark so I knew it was not a star.

I started driving again and got onto highway 85 and looked back over where I had seen it, and it was there again. Same size and same position.  Might have been the weirdest thing I have ever seen. I can not explain it. It changed shape a few times by size. I would love to know if anyone else saw this. I dont think it was a plane because there were several more and they did not look like this.
