It wasn't much farther above the treeline and must have been less than a quarter of a mile away from me.

I just saw two UFO's.  Night, Sept 10th, 2015, at approx. 8:15 pm, Antioch, CA.  A red, round light and a blue, round light traveling directly east, from west.  I thought they were Mylar balloons at first, about 50 feet up, but traveling too fast and strait and the wind is coming more from the north/north west.   Then I thought âbirds?â I thought they were balloons reflecting light from the street lamp.  I soon realized (about 1 second after they came out from behind my tree and about 3 seconds after first sight) they were not balloons or birds, as they had their own light source.    Then the red one changed coarse slightly but both kept moving quickly to the east in very strait paths.  When the red one changed course for a moment it seemed to be a very precise, yet playful movement.   They crossed overhead and out of sight towards the horizon in Antioch in about 10 to 12 seconds (total sighting including tree obstruction for 2 seconds).  They made no sound (that I could hear).  I was not sure how high up they were, so also not sure how big, but given the minimum distance they moved, they seemed to be going fast.  They seem to fade away before reaching a normal distance of low visibility and while still above the horizon impediments.  The sky is clear.   My neighbors are almost always on their front porch so I went across the street and asked them and one of them saw it too.  They exploded in a flurry of slightly intoxicated explanation and agreement that one of them had just mentioned it, saying, âI guess youâre not seeing things.â  The girl saw it as it was already well past the zenith and closer to the horizon.  She also said she only saw a blue one, which I thought was strange because they were only a few degrees apart after going into the distance, but that was from my line of sight, which should not have been much different than hers.  Maybe the red one faded out before the blue one, I do not recall.  It seemed to go one or two miles in! about 13 seconds, but that is guessing that it was as big as a house and about 600 to 1200 feet up.  It may have been 200 feet high, very hard to judge.  It looked about the size of a 20 inch balloon just above the telephone pole.  It was exciting.  So exciting, it may have happened in 6 or 7 seconds and just seemed like 10 or 12 seconds.",2015-09-11T00:00:00,37.98853003802281,-121.7887855513308

I noticed a very bright light moving rapidly from the south.  As it was nearing closer into my field of vision it was displaying erratic fly patterns.  Zooming side to side before stopping and hovering, then moving quickly back and forth and stopping again, no noise.   I ran inside and got my wife to come outside and also grabbed the binoculars.  When I focused on the craft I could clearly make out 3 white lights and one blue light lined up horizontally.  The blue light toward the left end.  There were no flashing beacons or red lights displayed.  We sat there and watched it for approximately 3 minutes and my father said it had to be a drone.  I asked if he had ever seen a drone and he said no.   The craft disappeared behind the tree-line and he left to go home and I went inside to take a shower and my wife came back inside and said it was back while I was in the shower and I ran outside! with only my towel on, as I was making my way to the door the power went out.  I opened the door and my neighborhood and perhaps the city of Mayflower was in a blackout and there was the craft just hovering in the sky that was changing different hues of blue.   The power then came back on and the craft continued to hover for about 2 minutes then disappeared.  Caught on video with an I-PAD.  Weird stuff. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Greetings Peter Davenport,  I received your reply from my other email address.  The video was shot with an IPAD as stated and is very shaky and grainy as my wife was shooting it and kept moving around.  You can clearly see at one point how the street lamp was barely glowing after the power went out and then was brightly lit suddenly when the power came back on.  I am no authority on such sightings and it very well could have been a drone, I guess, but it moved really fast in from the south and the height was hard to judge but looked to be a half mile to a mile up and the movements were very precise when shifting directions.  Considering this event was witnessed with a power failure also led me to believe it may not have been a drone.  Again it could have just been a coincidence.  Also our house is located right under a street lamp that kind of hinders the quality of the video.  You can clearly hear us getting excited when we witnessed the event.  I am skeptical of sending this video to anyone because I wish to remain anonymous as well as have our voices muted in the video or altered if I do send it to you.  This is my wife's second sighting at this address but my first.  Her first sighting happened (with no video) in the fall approximately two years ago in the daytime when she witnessed a huge cigar like shape that was holographic/translucent in physical form that passed right over the house with no noise.  As it passed over, the power lines that ran in front of our house shook violently according to her.  According to her this was craft of no earthly origin, that much she is certain of.  No one else apparently witnessed the event and I had a hard time believing her, maybe not so much now.  This object also came out of the southern hemisphere.  Just some noteworthy info..there is an air force base not to far from here (20 miles or so) also.  The Jacksonville Air Force Base as well as Camp Joseph T Robinson, a military training facility are both in close proximity to each other and our location.  Please respond to this email if you need to contact me.   ((END ADDENDUM))",2015-09-11T00:00:00,34.9741,-92.4312

We were looking for shooting stars and satellites.  I have been an armature star gazer and into astronomy for over 15 years.   We noticed what looked like a satellite moving sporadically and seemingly unintelligibly. Its ability to change direction, increase speed, and stop, was unlike I've ever ever experienced in my life.  Clouds became patchy and light which hid the object on us several times yet the object stayed in the general vicinity of the sky.   When the object became unable to see from a small cloud I noticed that there were actuall many such objects in the sky.  They became easy to pick out due to their consistent light yellow tinge they had; not a bright white like your average satellite.   At this point we realized this was exceptionaly abnormal and awoke anyone we could in the house and visibility was decreasing due to dawn beginning and cloud cove! r. My sister was visiting and saw them.  My wife (in my experience is not the best at spotting stars/satellites/shooting stars) couldn't pick them out, but in her defense the cloud cover was getting dense and I could only pick out one obvious one to show her which she missed.  Some objects seemed to operate alone yet some seemed to be in a disorganized group of three.   Best part is this happened ten minutes after telling my brother about a satellite I saw way up north that moved from side to side and that I couldn't believe my memory cause I saw it when I was maybe 7 years old and I wish I could see something like that again to validate my experience.   I am a ufo skeptic, I don't necessarily believe in aliens, I think most people who see ufos are nuts, and I always wished I could see something that would change my beliefs.  I don't know if my beliefs are changed but that was the most bizarre and unexplainable thing I've ever seen in the sky in my life.   I stayed up till the sun was up and they became no longer visible.  They left the area tre! nding wi thout a straight course to the west.

I then noticed many many many small, round objects start to appear from directly in line with the sun.  It was almost like they were ""warping in"" and moving passed in an easterly direction.  The were pretty much balls of light, some moving slower than others, some zipping around lower in the sky.   I started counting the smaller balls of light and lost count after 50+.

On July 26th, 2015, at approximately 18:30, my family witnessed an object in the sky which somewhat resembled a Ferris wheel.  The object was at a distance too high to see the dimensions, but the on and off brilliance was what first caught the eye of my oldest son who is 15.  I told him to keep his eye on the object while I ran to get my binoculars. Upon returning the object had moved very little, but was headed in a westerly direction towards the mountains.  Once I focused in on the object with my binoculars, it was a little difficult to stay steady with it because of the distance factor, however, I did have a few moments I could see the object clearly. The object appeared to be the shape of a disk and looked like a Ferris wheel because of the light pattern displayed with one bright light in the center with straight lines of light going to the perimeter of the object.  At the end of the straight lines of light on the perimeter, there were other points of light. The object was in a very slow tumble which varied from moment to moment.  Not like a ball rolling end-over-end, but fluidly changing its roll in different directions.  The lights were fading in and out almost at a constant rate; sometimes brighter and sometimes dimmer to the point it almost disappeared from sight.  I tried zeroing in on it with my cell phone camera, but the distance was too great.  No sound.  The object slowly moved further away in a westerly direction until it was out of sight.  Total viewing time was approximately 4 minutes.  The object did not make any noticeable sound. From my vantage point, I would guess the object to be moving in a westerly path down 120th Avenue intersecting Sheridan Blvd. In the area the object was seen, no clouds were present at that time.  Temperature was approximately 94F. One thing to note: We had a neighborhood power-outage about 30 minutes later which lasted about 3 minutes. I did my best to re-create the object on Paint.

I want to contrast the flashing red light brightness, color, and size of the planeâs lights to the lights we witnessed.  1. image002.png  2. image004.jpg  3.image006.jpg  At approximately 10:15pm Sunday evening, July 26th my friend and I came up to my rooftop to have desert and watch the sky. As I sat down at the table placing the fruit bowl down, Alison was looking East and brought the bright red light to my attention. Flying from the eastern sky from my rooftop in a northernly direction were 2 objects with very large red lights. What was different about these two objects were the lights, initially. There was only one color and one light on the flying object unlike the airplanes passing overhead, which at that time the sky was very busy with air traffic compared to most evenings.  The red light was a much deeper, denser, fuller red than the airplanes passing by. It did not have a flash-like quality as Iâd normally describe the airplane light flashing on and off, but was more like a slower turn-on, turn off characteristic to it, like a fade-up and down, rather than an abrupt flash on and off.  As seen in photo 3, I took a shot of a passing plane with red light flashing on its left wing. Iâd describe this as a flash on and flash off, and very bright. The plane is low enough to see its wings as well, as it flies in an easterly direction over my rooftop, ascending as it flies east. My guess is that this plane is 2000 feet high.  By contrast, the UAP was first noticed in the Eastern sky flying North. There were two of them. One was either smaller, just in front of the larger red light, or it was moving parallel to the larger red light but further away in the distance, thus appearing smaller. The small red light on the first craft, which initially made me think it was a lot farther away, had a red light slightly larger than the one on the plane flying over my rooftop even though Iâd guess it was flying 5000 feet high and many kilometres away. The larger red light, which flew slightly behind the first one, was perhaps the size of the 2 lights on the plane or more. Maybe three or four lights together in size if we use the plane as a cross reference. The red color was slightly deeper, darker in color to the red arrow I have drawn on the photo. It was a red that was rich, deep, and somehow different to light on a plane, which always seem to have white as the base, no matter if red, blue, or green. No othe! r flashing or pulsing color was visible, like on an airplane. One light, deep red, and with a slow on and off quality, not like the flashing quality of the airplanes. There were also a few moments where the on-off quality of the red light was irregular, as if disappearing altogether and then appearing on the same path in the sky but farther ahead.  As the two objects flew North, it looked like the smaller one continued north and the larger one turned left sharply or towards the west. The curve in my arrow in picture 2 is close to where the object banked a strong left turn. The smaller red light in front seemed to continue north but it disappeared from our vision. As the larger red light made its sharp turn, it sort of did an zig-zag move, or an âSâ shape turn before continuing north of the city but in a westerly direction. Also within seconds of that âSâ shaped turn, I noticed a very bright white-blue flash in the sky in the North, not much more than 1/2 inch distance in the sky from the rd light. It resembled a jet coming in for a landing with bright headlight on, but additionally, this bright flash seemed to me to be larger in an up/down size than wide, like a slit of some sort but it was extremely fast in its flash with no lingering quality.  As the larger red light continued towards the west, approximately under the Big Dipper now, we noticed that the little red light was there again, just slightly in front. We commented on how it could have reached and caught up to the large red light since they seemed to veer off in different directions at the point in photo 2 where the large red light made its turn from the northeast towards the west. It just appeared. This time it was moving ever so slightly in front of the larger red light as they were now heading south but in the western sky from my rooftop vantage point, which for people from Toronto would be in the direction of the International airport now. They were moving at a speed faster than the jets flying overhead, perhaps twice the speed as the jets were coming in and taking off from Pearson International Airport to the west of the city from my location.  As the 2 red lights continued south they again banked left or towards the east, as if doing a large circle around the city perimeter. As we looked to the south sky as the small and large red lights made their way east, the angle or distance between the 2 red lights gave the appearance as if they were almost touching, with no space between them. At that point I ran downstairs for my iPhone but when I came back up, they disappeared into the eastern sky where we first noticed them. I looked at my watch and it was 10:27pm. Perhaps 5 to 7 minutes later than when we first saw them.  I go up to my rooftop almost every evening to observe the sky, sometimes with my star chart to see where the different planets are or even the ISS passing overhead, which I have photographed on my iPhone. In all the years I have been living here and observing the plane routes and stars overhead, I have never seen red lights on a craft of that kind before, ever. Thus this report and the curiosity to know if other sightings from Toronto were  reported about 2 deep red lights circling the city from a 7 to 15 km radius of the centre of the city where I was located.",2015-07-31T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

The following is her account of the encounter.....  She was sitting in our vehicle in a dark parking lot, waiting for me to get out of work to pick me up.  Suddenly the parking lot began to light up with a bright amber color.   This got her attention so she got out of vehicle and stood on the running board looking up in awe and unable to believe what she was witnessing.  2 UFO's that were different sizes, one really big and one small, they were clear circular-shaped objects with amber fire inside of them and they were descending from the north of Lawton and completely silent and floating much like helium filled balloons and then they were hovering at tree top level for just about 2 minutes and then they filled in with red fire and rapidly floated high in the sky almost straight up but with slight angle northward back to where they came from.   Also, Mom said she felt bad because she was wishing that these UFO's wouldn't go away because she wanted us guy's to get to see them too.  The following is what myself and 2 other guy's seen at exactly 11 P.M. when we clocked out of work and walked down the (wind tunnel) out of Welch's right up in the sky in our line of sight we seen 2 bright red light's, one big and one small moving northward (away from us) to us it looked like 2 planes following each other, it was kind of unusual/odd but we all passed them off as airplanes in the distance.   Not until we made our way to the parking lot did we hear my Mom's account of what she had just seen did we realize how unusual this really was!  This was not airplanes, helicopters or hot air balloons.  So it had to have been Alien Spacecrafts !!!!  I believe that these Alien's were curious about the area there because of the Lawton water tower and all of the giant outdoor round-shaped juice storage tanks at Welch's so they came down to check it all out.",2015-09-02T00:00:00,42.1349,-85.8425

At around 12:30 am Saturday morning (August 29th, 2015), my boyfriend and I were sitting on our patio, when we both noticed the sky looked peculiar.  I mentioned how we couldn't see the moon at all and he and I experienced the first of three immense flashes of light.  We both felt this light was some sort of a scan.  It lit up evertything with a fullness and completion I have never seen before. After this flash, he and I looked into the sky above Cooper Mountain and saw a large glowing orange circle.  We both initially assumed it was the moon.  We continued examining the orange circle and realized it was the most perfectly round shape.  We sat and discussed how peculiar the air felt and in an instant the orange circle was no longer visible.  We waiting to see of it was cloud cover and it was clear what we saw vanished as quickly as it came. He and I felt quite odd.  I went inside and looked at the clock.  Two minutes had elapsed and it felt like an eternity. After researching orange circular ufo'S and other reports on huge flashes of lights, we returned outside with my cell phone. We never saw the orange circle again, but just below where it had been we saw a blue glowing light.  One could say it resembled a star.  Twinkling, gliterring and mesmerizing.  To our eyes it appeared blue or silver and would twinkle in and out of visibility and clarity. At 12:48, we experienced another flash of all encompassing light. The blue twinkle started to appear red.  It would alternate between green, blue and red. I recorded video on my Samsung Galaxy phone camera.  My camera was focusing on this object, clearly focusing. Upon closer examination we discovered the following variety of shapes and colors:  1) Blue rectangle  2) Red cylindrical  3) 2 green speheres.  My boyfriend and I repeatedly asked one another for validation.  We saw precisely the same things. During our time simply gazing up at the object it moved slightly right to left, flittering it seemed, and from it we saw smaller balls of light flying off and we saw these smaller balls return to it and hover close to it and again fly off at a speed unfathomable to our minds. The last huge flash of light was around 1:30 am. The object in the sky was gone at 1:45 am. My boyfriend and I felt an electric energetic sensation well into the night, and I found it difficult to take my eyes off the sky.",2015-09-02T00:00:00,45.4835597,-122.8374352

Orange glowing light in sky that responded to my flashing light.,Inarajan (Guam),,2015-07-13T02:00:00,light,,"Occurred : 7/13/2015 02:00  (Entered as : 7/13/15 2:00) Reported: 7/13/2015 9:03:21 AM 09:03 Posted: 7/17/2015 Location: Inarajan (Guam),  Shape: Light Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/120/S120365.html,"Orange glowing light in sky that responded to my flashing light. So, I am writing this story on behalf of my boyfriend..  This past experience he just had will be number 3 of profound experiences with unexplained phenomena happening.  I will briefly explain his first two encounters.   His first was when he was working over in the desert in Borrego Springs, CA.  It was around 9:30pm, him and a friend were just leaving the fitness area in their complex.  Something caught their attention in the sky, and what started as one light, turned into about 15 lights over a 30 minute or so time span.  Some were moving in more of a straight line, but then some were freely moving through the sky in more of a zig-zag motion.  Towards the end of the sighting, two of the lights were headed toward each other, one from the east and one from the west.  They were parallel to each other, one slightly above the other.  And one the two lights met in the sky, they stopped.  One light flashed to the other.  My boyfriend said it was as bright, and as fast, as the flash from a camera, and not over a second later did the other light seem to flash back to the first.  And as soon as it stopped flashing, the light on top shot straight into the sky and disappeared, and the other continued heading east in the sky.  As him and his friend stood there, baffled and confused at what they just saw, they continued to watch the sky.  A few minutes later, you hear (but not easily see) a military jet flying out over the sky in the direction the majority of the lights were traveling, almost as it was chasing after it. His second experience I was there for, so I can personally explain what we saw.  This was my first experience, or at least the first one that seemed undeniable.  By this time, we were now living in Guam.  A place with barely any light pollution, LOTS of stars in the sky, lots of planes and military planes/helicopters/stealth planes/etc..  But as much as there is military there, we still feel that what we saw was not military at all.  We were standing out back of our house, it was our last night staying there..  A fast moving, far away light was moving through the sky and caught our attention almost at the same moment.  As our eyes continued following it move through what looked like the stars,it was so high up, suddenly it almost seemed to shoot up INTO the sky like in hyper speed, and disappeared.  Not even a second later there was a bright flash (that made me think of his first experience in CA) like a camera flash and then it was all gone, nothing.  Over.  SO WEIRD.  This was the first time I had an experience (and I've always been a star gazer/believer) but this moment was like no other.  It left us both speechless, amazed, confused.. so many thoughts run through your mind seeing something so unexplainable. So, I have always wanted to share these stories because I am one that feels we should all share our experiences because right now, after all of this, it just leaves me feeling (even more so) that we have no idea what goes on in this world, our governments, our military advances, or just the fact that we are not alone.  My entire life I've wanted to have an experience, because I felt like it would help put my eager mind at ease.  But after seeing what I saw, it only leaves me with more questions, but a definite feeling of knowing. So- the reason I shared these stories now, is because my boyfriend just had another unexplainable experience last night that just seems too profound not to share. My boyfriend is a fisher((man)), through and through.  Casts out during the day and night, free dives..  he spends a lot of time alone walking the reef at night looking for fish.  And last night, he found a lot more than that.  From the messages he sent me today:  I also saw a UFO flashed my light at it it got bright zoomed away from me out to sea I started walking inside because I got freaked out a little and when I turned around it was pretending to be a star, but there were no stars besides that one and maybe 6 others I saw it traveling south to north bright orange light  When I flashed it it moves east fast when I turned back to look it re appeared and was still But was reflecting of the water And I kept looking for my iphone and didn't feel it in my pocket until I got to our floor  And the flying thing saw that I saw it and took off It was more intense than beret go because it was closer it was a very very strange night I honestly know  beyond a shadow of doubt that we are not the only life form in the universe A military vessel would not respond to a 4.75$ flashlight  It seemed absolutely ridiculous that it was able to see my light I don't think human eyes could've seen that shitty light at that distance it was just above the horizon Which means it was probably over 20 miles away I have no idea how Highup it was an altitude but you can only see 16 miles on the ocean before the curvature of the earth Is too much to see further  I honestly walked away once I start react to my light because it seems so impossible and the fact that it was reflecting off the water is super weird because it's crystal-clear night tonight and that star is not there  When I walked away checked for phone and looked back it was static Not moving And was bright enough to reflect on the water From very far It's hard to know how to feel honestly   --and when I asked him after it happening to him so many times, how it makes him feel--  I wouldn't really care except it's been three times in my life that I've seen something that tells me we know nothing about what governments/military technological advancements or plain and simple we're not alone    So its easy to see why now, after all this time, I felt it was time to share these stories.  But I hope in reading this, it helps you feel you found some answers, or some kind of confirmation or knowing that we are not alone.. we don't know everything that goes on in this world.. we may never know.. but theres something out there, maybe trying to let us know this very thing.   Take from this what you will, but I know for me- the fire inside that I feel to know the truth is still burning strong, and I know someday things will be made more clear for us. I just hope with the way that our world behaves, they are here to help us and we don't screw it up.",2015-07-17T00:00:00,,

Lights remained for two to fifteen minutes in one spot, varying in brightness then typically moved off eastward and north toward the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains and brightness diminished until gone.  A few times the entity left in a more northerly direction, directly away, towards and above Aptos, growing faint to gone from view.   After the spot was left vacant for several minutes, another red light would appear faintly, and from our perspective, usually over Aptos (due north), and then grow in brightness as it came again to the same spot over the marine canyon and west of Moss Landing.   When we arrived at our coastal outlook on Del Monte Beach at 10:00pm, about 12-miles due south, we initially saw three entities hovered in an east-west line along the marine canyon, from 5 to 8 miles west of Moss Landing, at different heights, maybe 500 to 1500 feet above the water.   At first we thought they were mast lights on an historic ""tall ship,"" but they were too far away so the scale of the ship would have been huge.  Visual clarity was confusing with high clouds, but after several minutes, we could see there was no ship, just lights holding reasonably steadily, though not rigorously in place.   Though spaced apart a mile or less, when one began to relocate, the others moved in an apparent coordinated fashion.  One left and another would return and locate at the same spot over a 1.5 hour period, with one, two or three visible in collateral locations, of varying and changing brightnesses, at any time.  Or one would leave and the adjacent entity, already in view, would take its place.  The spot was occupied and vacated at least ten times.   Several aircraft were observed in the same direction but we could not determine if there was any interaction with the entities.  We could not make out any shape, yet the light generally appeared spherical.  At least once, while the entity was at its brightest, it appeared that a light was beamed downward at an angle, from the entity toward the ocean.  The beamed light was an extension - a ray - emanating from and connected to the spherical light entity, and tapering toward its end.  The length of the ray appeared to be three to four times the diameter of the entity at its brightest.  It appeared to reach at least half-way from the entity to the ocean surface, yet at our distance away this was uncertain.   At other times it appeared as though the ocean surface was being illuminated by a moving flood light in the immediate vicinity of the entity, yet the moving flood lights were faint and we were unsure that we actually saw this at our distance.  This were not as the beamed light noted prior, which was relatively spectacular.   We have no information of how long the entities were present before we arrived.  Sightings subdued by 11:30pm: no more than one or two, less bright, short stay time at the spot and longer vacancies.  No entities were visible when we left. Observers are a bakery manager and a registered engineer.",2015-07-17T00:00:00,36.38391818181818,-121.84402222222222

On July 17th, 2015, at 23:00 I was out for a bike ride.  Upon riding down a dead end street at about 23:20, I could see a truck shining a bright halogen spot light up into the sky, as they were bringing attention to something.  There were 6 residents pointing up in the sky.  I noticed they were pointing at a red/orange fireball moving up from the ground up into the sky about 2.5 miles away.  I rode my bike back one block and went down a dark, dirt path in a undeveloped part of town, where there were no background lights, completely pitch black.  This area has no obstructions and overlooks a inlet of Lake Michigan. I climbed up on a sugar sand hill. I saw 1 orange/red round fireball climb up from, what we local residents call âThe Bluffâ a 200ft elevation change on the west side of the city.  The fireball climbed to approx. 500ft, it then started forward motion and began a huge sweeping left hand turn out over Little Bay De Noc.  After moving across the water, it gently faded out and disappeared. As soon as it was dimming out of sight, I noticed 2 more rising up 1 after another, from the same location as the first one. They 2 made the same sweeping turn at about 1500ft to 1800ft. I have flown in a Cessna around this area before. At one point there were 4 flying. Although they flew the same circuit, it was not the exact speed every time. There were some small variations. This continued for at least 20 minutes. I was quite interested in watching this, as this was not my first time observing these fireballs. Last summer I had a much closer sighting. This being my second sighting I was not so shocked to see the fireballs, this time I took more time to get a description of them. As I squinted at them, they appeared to have a central upside down âVâ with 2 round points at the bottom of them. They have a bizarre flickering effect, almost like the âlicking of flames, from a fireâ with the âVâ in the middle. They seem to pulse between red to yellow. Both elements put together, it looks like a cross between a bright filament in a clear light bulb and someone puffing a cigarette at night, a very smooth red/orange/yellow pulse. After spending 8 years in the military, I have been around both F-16 fighters and numerous helicopters. These things are absolutely silent, no distant âJUH,JUH,JUH or ROARSâ at a 2.5 mile distance. I can determine a few things, these are not: fireworks helicopters private planes commercial planes helium type âFire Lampsâ RC planes / 4 blade RC drones, to far away to control by radio. They just have too much speed, and the point of origin that they start from. With everything going on in the country, they might be some type of testing of new observation platforms that we donât know about.",2015-07-23T00:00:00,45.8809,-87.0504

The undercarriage had bands of reddish/orange light that went the length of the aircraft, unlike any aircraft Iâve seen or researched.   The craft sped up once it had passed us and disappeared quickly behind the tree line.  Whatever or whoever it was intention, and slowed down to look at us, for what reason I do not know.   Later, we tried to rationalize what we saw; we do live about 30 miles from the Gainesville airport, however this came from the opposite direction and was definitely not on course for it like every other plane we see. Could this by chance be a secret military plane undisclosed to the public?  And if so, why was it in our area, and why would this theoretical secret craft be so brazen in exposing itself to the two of us?",2015-08-27T00:00:00,29.811923636363638,-82.48849636363636

There were a lot of mosquitos, so I told the girls to get back in to the car.  I had set the telescope on my trunk and was trying to get the moon in to focus.  The telescope wasn't of high quality, and I got frustrated that I couldn't maintain decent focus. On our return trip home, my youngest said ""OOH!  Look at those planes!""  I looked over and saw nothing.  My oldest had similar results.  The youngest said ""Geeze, you guys, they are right there!"".  I leaned over and looked and there were not three planes, but one solid craft approaching us at a relatively slow pace on our right side.  I pulled over and it passed us.  Immediately, I rolled down my windows.  It was dead silent outside, save for the sound of crickets and frogs.  Both girls got kind of freaked out due to the fact that they are no strangers to air shows and know what jets sound like. The object proceeded in a direction that most likely would have led it out between Rochelle and Byron.  It was at most, 700-1000 feet above us, but likely lower than that.

Just as the object passed over our roofline, I took the dogs in and called for my fiancee to corroborate the sighting.  She immediately came outside, but by that time the object was not viewable from our backyard.  As I started around the side of the house for a better view of the southern sky, she called me back, saying that 3 objects were now visible in a roughly NW direction. I got back in time to witness all 3 of these objects one at roughly 290 degrees magnetic and the other 2 at approximately 310 degrees magnetic.  One of those 2 seemed to be slightly lower and to my right of the other, but since they looked to be far away I was unable to determine how close in proximity they were to each other....one could possibly be lower to the horizon than the other.  She also stated that these 3 objects emitted the same phenomena that I witnessed with the first object, but they did not do it in unison.  She stated to me later in the evening that at least one of the objects got close enough to our home for her to see that it was roughly triangular-shaped. I immediately ran inside for my phone, and by the time I returned only one of the objects was visble (I found out later on that the 3 we observed had ascended into the sky and vanished, and this was in fact the 5th similar object).  This one emitted the sparks/flames as well, but only once while I viewed it.  By the time I pulled up the camera app on my phone, it was already beginning it's slow ascent into the night sky, where it eventually vanished like the others that my fiancee observed. Neither of us heard any sound at all coming from these objects, and we could not explain their appearance due to a) there was no evidence of blinking lights as you normally see on an airplane; b) they all appeared to hover momentarily in their movement, which planes cannot do; c) despite the fireworks being shot off in the neighborhood, we are both very familiar with helicopter sounds and as I stated previously we could not discern anything sound at all coming from them; d) I don't believe they were drones...being a drone owner myself I have yet to see a commercial product that is capable of carrying a payload heavy enough to emit sparks/flames even once, much less multiple times as was the case with the first object I sighted, and these objects ascended before vanishing rather than landing, and finally; e) there is no possible way they could've been fireworks as the first one followed a path across the sky without descending, and the footage I was able to capture shows I had th! e final object in view for over 1:19 minutes - which no type of firework is capable of sustaining.",2015-07-06T00:00:00,,

Her back yard has a great view of the Steel Stacks (old Bethlehem Steel plant turned into a public event center).  There was a fireworks display for the 4th of July which was just beginning. I noticed an odd light off to the north, our line of sight to the Steel Stacks being in an ENE direction.  As I watched, it moved in a slight arc and then a straight line where it slowed and hovered.  I pointed it out to my friend, who acknowledged seeing it, but was more interested in the fireworks display. As I studied the object, I was able to see a central brighter cream-white colored light surrounded by three smaller cream-white lights arranged in an equilateral triangular form about the central light.  Occasionally I was able to see a red line going from one of the outer lights to the central light.  There were no flashing red or green lights, and no noise, although between the professional and amateur fireworks it was hard to hear anything. After hovering for 30 seconds to a minute the object just faded away and disappeared.  It did not fly off or move from its hover position. There were aircraft in view, as the Lehigh Valley International Airport was in our view.  This object did NOT resemble any aircraft flying that night.  I did take a photo of the object, but it is indistinct. My friend and I are both in our late 50's, both professional people, and we both have spent a good deal of time outdoors both day and night.

On the evening of July 4th, not long after sunset, my girlfriend and I were driving West on Business 40 (we had just passed Interstate 40/Business 40 split) and noticed a bright, glowing orange orb passing in front of us above the tree line at approximately 50-75 ft above the ground, moving in a direction from our left or out of the south, towards our right, or to the north.  We both noticed it immediately because both of our eyes were transfixed at the sky because we had just witnessed a lot of fireworks just above the tree tops as we drove out of Greensboro heading towards Winston-Salem, with it being Independence Day.  My first thought was that we were viewing a falling ember from an exploded firework cascading down from the sky, however it was quickly evident that this wasn't true because the small craft was clearly flying in a trajectory perpendicular to our vehicle not losing altitude. We were both very intrigued and I quickly looked in my rearview to che! ck for other cars, and slowed down to get a better look.  The orange light kind of resembled a flame almost like an oil lamp, with a distinct glowing orb surrounding it.  The only thing that I could reasonably think that this small craft could be was a drone, possibly attempting to get views of the evening fireworks, however several factors lead me away from this assumption, because there were no houses or business around the area. It was a darkened and desolate portion of the highway, with trees on both sides and neither myself nor my girlfriend saw any wings or any identifying signs that would lead us to believe it was a manmade drone or craft.  Drones typically need the operator to be fairly close, and with no homes or side streets anywhere near the area a drone seems unlikely, especially when it was fully dark and a drone would seemingly have no photographic value in darkness. Both me and my girlfriend were very interested in what we had saw and neither of us could explain! it. There is no possible way it was a firework or ember acting weird or caught in the wind, it was definitely flying.  I wish I would have had more time to view the craft and contemplated pulling to the side of the roadway, but more cars were coming up behind us and the vehicle was close to crossing the tree line on the northern side of the road.  Neither of us can identify what we saw, albeit briefly.",2015-07-06T00:00:00,,

A bright silver object that looked like a lifesaver appeared to the right of the cloud and then it quickly darted back into the cloud formation.  If I held my arm out the object would have been the size of a pencil eraser end.  The center circle was well defined as was the outside edge.  The shape was perfectly round.  The inner ring appeared to encompass 2/3rds of the entire object.  The center was darker.  I saw small flashes in the cloud, not like lightening but like dots.  I do not know if these flashes were from the object or from the sun glinting off of the object.  I then took my camera out and took photos but I did not get a good photo of the big one I saw but! I did get one of a much smaller dark silver sphere.  No birds or bugs were about,  I think due to the 90 degree temp and high humidity. I will email the pic.   P.S. the dog was not impressed.

I could not have been the only person in this area to see this as the object was very visible in the sky. I have seen shooting stars before but it has been three years or so since Iâve seen one.  To the best of my memory shooting stars are much, much higher in the sky and are also very different in color from the object I saw tonight, and certainly not as visible.   The object I saw moved so fast and disappeared so quickly that it was over and gone in a matter of seconds. I donât know what the object was that I saw tonight but I was very excited, and a little in a little bit of fear. I ran into my apartment to tell my older brother who was spending the night and also my wife who was in bed. I have been looking up and watching the sky for many years and have never seen much more than a few shooting stars until tonight.",2015-08-13T00:00:00,42.26863925549915,-71.80715499153976

Was standing in my back garden with my wife looking north between 00:30 and 01:20 to view the Perseid meteor shower.  The sky was cloud free with good visibility, and there was no wind. During this observation period I saw 11 shooting stars, 4 aircraft, and one UFO. The UFO was first seen by us in the north East at 00:40, and moved parallel and close to the horizon (approx. 15 degrees elevation) across our field of view towards the north west.  It was internally illuminated, but not as brightly as the aircraft we also observed at other times during this sky watch, equivalent in brightness to a second magnitude star.  The UFO light was not a point source, it appeared more as a very small diffuse orb with brightness varying slightly as it moved, and it left no trail.  Colour was white with a tinge of orange.  It moved generally in a straight line, but with some up and down movement too, and after moving an angular distance of about 45 degrees from our right to our left it stopped abruptly, remained visible for about 2 seconds, then blinked out.  Brightness of the UFO varied a little throughout the observation period, but not with the regularity typically seen from flashing aircraft lights. The most puzzling aspect of this sighting, which clearly marked the UFO as something out of the ordinary, was its apparently high velocity. In comparison with the shooting stars that moved rapidly with angular velocities of around 10 degrees per second, and the aircraft flying over at cruising altitude moving about 0.5 degrees per second, the UFO moved at an estimated 4 degrees per second having taken about 10 seconds to cross our field of view. The UFO was certainly not a conventional aircraft. I would estimate that conventional aircraft which typically fly at 200 to 600 knots would have had to be relatively close to us to have displayed the high angular velocity observed, perhaps no further than a few hundred metres to a kilometre in distance.  If this had been the case the noise of the engine(s) would have been clearly audible, this UFO was silent.  Furthermore, when the lights of a conventional aircraft appear to stop moving in the sky, when it enters a turn and starts moving away or towards an observer, a significant time elapses as the aircraft completes the manoeuver.  When this UFO stopped moving it did so immediately. The UFO also did not resemble in any way a shooting star, meteorite, or a satellite.  It certainly was not one of the Perseid shooting stars because it's trajectory was aligned about 90 degrees away from the path of this meteor shower in the region of the sky where it was observed.",2015-08-13T00:00:00,,

My two young daughters and I were at Clark Creek park in Salem, Oregon, 07/14/15 at around 5:10 pm.  The sky was clear and blue with a few clouds and it was a warm nice day.   I looked up near the southeastern part of the sky and noticed a stationary white object that was round, and had a sort of white or metallic look to it.  It might have very slowly moved while we observed it, but I can't be sure.   I had my Canon camera with me at the park, so I started to film it, and it was hard to keep it steady because my kid started crying, as most toddlers do when the stroller stops moving.   My 5 year old was talking about it as we have talked about ufos in the past and she was very interested in it.   It disappeared right before our eyes after only being there for a few short minutes, and we continued walking in the park picking berries.  I looked up again to see and it showed up again in around the same area of the sky.  It sort of had a translucent halo around it that was very! hard to see but I noticed it nonetheless.   It disappeared again and we were pretty excited.   A regular big white airplane showed up and flew past the area we had sighted the ufo, maybe the same height in the sky as well, and according to the size of the plane I'll guess that ufo was maybe half the size of the plane and a much brighter shiny white color.  I have witnessed and filmed some other objects before, and my husband and I are very interested ufo researchers.  He has college background I have graduated high school and we're intelligent and read a lot.  This type of sighting only has me feeling they will be back again.

It was moving horizontally from North to South and spotted between Cana Island and Baileys Harbor, WI. Object was first glimpsed while flying past a window that is approximately 11'-6"" high off the finished floor. The object appeared to be an orange/red sphere, about the size of a risen full moon, and appeared to be flying just above the tree tops. After spotting it in the window, I ran out onto the deck and watched it fly over head and then behind the trees to the south, headed in the direction of Baileys Harbor.  As it moved south, I could still see its glow but could no longer see the sphere. It was probably visible to me between 30 seconds to a minute.  Long enough for me to get out of the door and onto the deck.  It seemed to be moving quickly. No sound was noticeable and there was no light trail behind the sphere or no aura around the sphere, that I could discern.  Just an orange red ball flying horizontally and low through the night sky.  It was a very interesting sight and something I've never seen before. At this time, I have not been able to find any reference to this fireball sighting by anyone else in the area.

Star-like, no blinking lights.  Cont. movement and short periods of complete stillness. Beginning around 3:55, I went outside for a cigarette and as is my custom, craned my neck staring at the sky.  Spotted the popular three star triangle, and the waning moon to its left. Viewing from the SW to SE skies, directly above me.  In Homestead neighborhood right next to OHSU hospital. It started with one object, I assumed was a star shifting its light.  Then it began to move sporadically, circling and zig-zagging... slowly drifting upwards and to the right.  I used the moon as a still-object to make sure I wasn't seeing things. The longer I watched it, the more it moved.  No blinking or flashing lights.  Quick, sporadic movements in short spurts; sometimes in longer spurts.  Sometimes it grew still. Around twenty minutes into the sighting, while moving in circular motion, a smaller light spat out from it and vanished. I also find it interesting that during this 40 minute time period I saw two very large meteors and several much smaller ones. I report four objects, as there were two other much, much dimmer objects nearby moving in similar fashion. The third appeared after one of the large meteors, zig-zagged a small amount, and then moved on much like an airplane straight across the sky. The other three sightings were not as spectacular as the first, which remained... even after I ran back upstairs to grab my camera. Of course, since the light is the size of a star it was impossible to capture on my digital camera. Also worth mentioning is that last night, my roommate (who also witnessed this sighting) and I were driving home and saw what can only be described as a carousel-like ship.   Rotating slowly and moving slowly, with alternating white lights fading in and out.  They were not blinking, were not airplane beacons and were not red or green. Just white.  Rotating, or spinning, and moving across the sky in a diagonal manner. I am hesitant to label this immediately as a UFO, as it could very well be a drone.  However, due to the strange optical lights, fading alternately; and after doing a few hours of research on drones and their lightings, I found that most drones have stationary or flashing lights much like airplanes... not this gentle, soft fading white lights in alternating fashion. And lastly, on the fourth of July during fireworks, I also saw three star-like objects much like tonight's sighting: sporadic movement and quickly disappearing.  These sightings lasted mere seconds, unlike tonight's sighting in which the first object remained for 40+ minutes. In conclusion, tonight's sighting of the continuous object with sporadic movement: spat out a smaller light that vanished.  A few times very vague trails with its quicker movements.  Wish I had binoculars or a telescope.  Will invest as I seem to be sighting more and more UFOs lately.",2015-08-06T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

My family and I went to see the July 1st fireworks (for Canada Day) in Calgary that were scheduled to be between 10:45pm and 11:45pm that day.  They were being launched off the Centre Street Bridge in Calgary, so we decided to go to the Sunnyside Bank Park and watch the fireworks from the top of the hill to get a good view (on Crescent Road NW near 2nd Street NW).  I remember looking at the time on my cell phone and at 10:51pm I made a comment to my wife that they were late with their fireworks. Within a few minutes of that time, the fireworks had started, and they lasted approximately 15 minutes.  Once the fireworks finished, I waited for maybe 30 seconds to see if any more were coming, but all there was now was smoke above the Centre Street Bridge.  I looked at my cell phone again and the time was 11:09pm.   I made another comment to my wife that they were liars, as I was expecting fireworks to last an hour.  She laughed, and shortly after that she asked me, ""What is that green light up there?""  I looked up in the sky and saw a green stationery star-like object in the sky, hovering probably above Centre Street (not directly above us, just slightly east from us) and it was north of the Centre Street Bridge.  I don't know exactly how high it was, but it there was cloud cover and the object was still below the clouds.  At that moment when I first saw it, I didn't know what to think, as it was stationery.  In my mind I immediately related the light to some of the fireworks from before (although it was hovering and not rising and falling like a firework) or maybe a helicopter with a green light (I didn't hear any helicopter noise either, but the object was very high). The object hovered in that spot for several seconds (10 to 20 seconds), then suddenly it shot off in the south east direction at a speed that I had never witnessed any airplane do before.  It shot off several kilometers in the south east direction within 1 or 2 seconds, the came to a sudden  stop, and it hovered again for several seconds.  My heart immediately jumped at that moments, as I suddenly knew that whatever this was, it definitely was not a firework, a helicopter or any other conventional aircraft known to me. The light then suddenly vanished, as me and my wife started talking to each other in great excitement about what we just witnessed.  The light appeared again, I reached for my cell phone to start recording, but as soon as I had the phone ready, the light vanished again, and we did not see it after that. When my wife first noticed the object, it was hovering lower, then it shot up with incredible speed and became stationery, at which point she drew my attention to it.  I had missed the first part when it ascended, and I only saw it shoot horizontally across the sky.  It was Canada Day fireworks and there were thousands of people scattered all around to watch the fireworks. My wife, my 16 year old son and I all saw the object.  The people standing behind us saw the object.  Since there were thousands of people present, I'm sure that many others saw the object.  I hope that many more reports from that evening are filed, as I'm sure there are countless other witnesses to the event. It was just a light in the sky and if my wife had not pointed it out to me, I would have missed it.  Due to that fact, I'm sure that majority of the spectators did not see this light, but those that were looking up in the right direction would have seen it for sure.",2015-07-03T00:00:00,51.04237871352785,-114.05744246242263

I'm here in Virginia visiting close friends when I spotted something unusual in the night sky!  We'd spent the 4th enjoying the celebrations etc..  However, around 8.45 to 9 pm, I realised everyone sleeping, so I decided to go out into the back yard and watch a local fireworks display. I was sitting there enjoying the show when I spotted what I thought was an aircraft in the night sky. It was visible over the house in a north-westerly direction and I estimate at about 35 degrees from the horizon.  Again, still thinking it was an aircraft, I ignored it and continued watching the fireworks. A few minuets passed when I realised it was still there; at which point I assumed it was a very bright star which, I found unusual as the night sky was a cloudy.   Nevertheless, I continued to watch the firework. Suddenly, I'm estimating a little after 10pm I heard a firework land out front.  Now at this point, I knew everyone was sleeping and the garage door was open, so I figured I'd better go close it.  However, just at that moment, I glanced up at the star and watched in amazement as it just shot off across the sky and out of sight heading from it stationary  north west position in a west-south-west direction.

Around 8:30 PM on September 1st, 2015, my significant other and I witnessed some kind of craft hovering over the center of our city.  We were facing North, and we live at the top of a hill in our city.  We are both in our early twenties and work most of the day, so we spend most of our time on the back porch at night.   That night we witnessed what I can only describe as a black ""twinkie"" with reddish-purple lights on both ends, and a very bright blue light in the middle of the craft, situated at the bottom.  The lights on the side would change from bright red to a very deep maroon, almost purple.   There was no reflection on the actual craft itself from these lights, although there were halos of the same colored light around the craft.   We watched it for at least a minute, as it was motionless.  I thought it to be a satellite or some kind of plane, but then it began to move.  The movement was erratic, moving in zig-zags and up and down at an extremely fast speed.    We watched it move for about 45 seconds, until it came to a halt.  It moved slightly upward and then just seemed to disappear.   My significant other and I have witnessed this kind of craft in the same location before, once on July 22nd, 2015, for about 10 minutes at 10:45 PM, and once again on July 15, around midnight, for less than 5 minutes.

The spiral was to the left of my car and the shape was pointing in that direction and directly above me.  I kept thinking maybe it's just a break in the clouds and all I'm seeing is the night sky.

No star had a reflection in the water but one.  I attempt to seek the star creating the reflection.  To my slight right on the opposite bank we were sitting, one of the stars begins to shift oddly in the sky and I immediately let my two friends know that one of the stars was not a star. We kinda freaked out a bit because its flight pattern was abnormal from what we generally are exposed to in the sky.  Plus we just learned something!  As it reached the near edge of the other side of the river, we got a decent look of the lights.  (Well, any view is a decent look.)  It was, oddly enough, the shape of a Mercedes Benz symbol minus the circle.  All I could explain it as is just three streaks of light coming from one point in the sky as it settles above the trees.  It sat there for a while, and then it just went up until it was out of our view.  After that, three more followed suite. All were the same shape. There was one of the same shape to our left higher than the others.  As time went by, it descended down and just stood still.  Felt like we were being monitored, but just slightly.  We kept a visual on it the minute we saw it.  It stayed with us the longest out of all. About 1:30, we see one of them descend behind the trees with its lights shining brighter and closer than before any of the others.  No more were seen afterwards.  The sky was quickly covered in clouds around 3:00.",2015-07-17T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

It was moving fairly slowly at first, almost hovering when I first saw it, but then it picked up speed and disappeared behind a very large stand of trees on the adjoining property. At first, I thought it might be a blimp for a second but when it speeded up, it moved faster than a blimp is capable of; I've seen a few of them over the years and this object speeded up more rapidly than a blimp can.

I walked out front of my house in Rocklin, California, around 2 am on Monday Morning, and I noticed a distant star like object that seemed to have a glowing tail.  At first I thought I believed it to be a star, but then I noticed it was wobbling and appeared to be falling.  It was glowing from red to blue, at which point I ran inside to get my mother and my nephew to make sure they saw the same thing I did.  They came outside and confirmed what I was looking at.  The star like object was wobbling back and forth while changing colors.  Then it appeared to throw tiny sparks out of the northern end.  We concentrated on this object for a while trying to figure out what it was.  Our perception led us to believe it was taking place in outer space because the physics are not possible due to earthâs gravity and atmosphere.  We knew it was not a star or a plane, we did not know what it was.  We were bewildered by what we were looking at and we started looking around the night s! ky at other stars. Then we saw something truly remarkable.  A large black object which had 3 bright lights shaped as a triangle with a red light in the middle, and it was hovering for a couple minutes directly north of us. We started to point at it, and were shocked and were not sure what we were looking at, then it started to move, and it flew directly over us. This object made little to no sound, which did not make sense considering how big the lights were, at that point we knew we were seeing something unexplainable. This object flew right over us, picking up speed until it moved behind a tree and then it was gone. The triangular object moved much faster than normal planes and helicopters. This object was almost silent and we are not sure the distance to the ground because the lights were huge and very bright. Once it passed the trees we lost track of the object. We focused our attention back to the original star like object. The star like object was still hovering and ch! anging colors while the triangular shaped object was gone. Abo! ut 1 min ute later we saw what seemed to be a helicopter that made a circle around the area we saw the triangular object. The helicopter was loud and had normal looking lights thus we believed it to be a helicopter. Also a few planes flew in that direction afterwards, again, they were loud and contained normal lighting, and the speed of the helicopter and planes were normal. The triangular object moved faster than both the helicopter and planes. The triangular object also was silent compared to the helicopter and planes that came next, (Almost like they were tracking this object) We believed the helicopters and planes were tracking this object because they flew in the same direction and made a circle around the star like object in the distance. We must have sat outside for 45 minutes at least trying to figure out what we saw. The Star like object in the distance was still hovering/and blinking which looked like it was falling. But did not actually fall, we watched the star like objec! t grow dim until it to was gone. At this point the night sky was silent again, we decided to go back inside our house, and none of us were sure what exactly we saw. The craziest thing was how big the lights were on the triangular craft like object, and the red light directly in the middle, we are still not sure what we saw. We cannot explain it.  We all agree we have never seen anything like this before.",2015-07-23T00:00:00,38.81477261146497,-121.27164267515924

On 2015-07-20 at approximately 09:05 hrs my family and I were at Glengarry Park in NE Edmonton, AB.  My children were playing on the kids equipment and I was speaking with my wife while keeping a watchful eye on them.  The weather was mainly sunny/clear with a few clouds and approximately 20 degrees Celsius. I happened to look up in the sky, which was very bright from the sun.  Something caught my eye and I focused in on what I can only describe as an object which appeared very high in the sky.  I watched as the object appeared to be still, bright white, and not moving.  I could not make out a shape but it appeared very bright and circular.  I quickly pointed and told my wife to look up, which she did.  She was able to focus in on the object quite quickly.  A moment later, we both noticed the object was not alone.  At first we both observed 2 more objects which between the 3, formed a triangle.  Then I observed a fourth object to the left of the triangle, and then another to the right.  The objects began moving to the NE at varying speeds.  At this time, I noticed one of the objects appeared to go from a bright white to a bluish color, and another from white to a hint of orange. Throughout the event, most of the objects appeared to go in and out of focus.  At times we had to look away and then back in order to find them again.  One object though (the first one I saw) was always easy to spot.  In fact, this was the only object that decreased altitude and came significantly lower than the others (this happened about 5 minutes after first spotted). My wife and I estimated approximately 7-9 objects were seen during the event which lasted approximately 25 minutes.  During the event my wife and I attempted multiple short video recordings on our IPhone devices.  At the time, we did not think the camera was picking up the objects as we could not see them on the screen.  The glare from the sun and reflection on the screen made it impossible to see anything.  We did our best guesses in pointing though and upon review found some clear footage of one of the objects and a faint view of at least two more.  She was also able to zoom in on the clearest object but found it would not focus. At one point during the event, while observing the object and preparing my camera to take another recording, I noticed a passenger jet travelling in the direction of the clearest object.  I was able to get a recording of the object and jet in close proximity to each other.  It appeared the plane was lower in altitude but it's difficult to say for sure. Both my wife and I have never seen anything like this before.  The objects would change directions in an instant and appeared to go from very fast (faster than the jet) to not moving at all.  We also noticed the objects were making various triangle formations as the moved.  As well, at no time did we observe a jet stream or anything emitting from the objects.  The park where the event occurred is approximately 10 km SW of Canadian Forces Base Edmonton on the north end of the city. Our backgrounds, I am a retired police officer and my wife is a teacher. We are very interested in having this video analyzed to find out what we saw on this day.",2015-07-23T00:00:00,53.52298881322957,-113.5039614461738

My family and I just moved out of downtown Ann Arbor, to a more rural city outside of AA called Saline.  The portion we moved to is very rural, with neighbors a good distance apart, lots of open space, but most importantly, very little city light pollution.  Tonight is the 2nd night in the house, and I had just finished unpacking a load of equipment from some boxes, and decided I'd take a seat on the freshly moved couch.  It was roughly 2:45am. I hopped online on my laptop for about 10 minutes, when I got an urge to look to my left out of a window in my home, which faces to the west.  I immediately spotted a very odd pulsating set of white-ish lights that would occasionally flash and change color just above the tree-line behind our neighbor's house.  For scale reference, the window is on the western-most wall in our house, and our neighbors house is roughly 150-200 yards or so past the window through a large open field. I immediately grabbed my phone and started to record video of the light that initially drew my attention.  I noted the time when I turned my phone on as 2:57.  The color of the light when I began recording changed to translucent red.  It was at this time I noticed via my video display as I recorded that there were other reddish lights exhibiting similar behavior with flashing red color to the south of the object I was focused on.  My immediate gut reaction was that what I was seeing was 1 very large single object with potentially many smaller objects accompanying it.  I zoomed out and then back in, and this time when the image came back into focus there were two grayish white blobs/shapes slightly closer relative to me than the lights were, which were also still present ""behind"" the blobs in my view. For a short period following the two blobs appearing, I continued to record, occasionally zooming out and then back in, or shifting the angle of the camera back and forth attempting to gain better focus, etc.  The two blobs went away, and I was back to the original single light-source for a period.  I decided to ask my wife to wake up and look, mostly in an attempt to see if I was crazy from being tired from the move, or if I was really seeing and recording whatever this was. After saying her name once, I zoomed out for a moment, then zoomed all the way back in.  As I did this, I was shocked to see 5 clearly defined blobs pop into focus out of nowhere, at the same location and distance the lights were seen at!  After getting over that shock, I realized the lights were also still visible, but I had the distinct feeling that at least 3 of the new white/grayish figures were sentient beings of some sort, as if suddenly a wall become invisible, exposing them.  My wife by this time was next to me viewing this all along with me.  To me, it seemed like at least 1 (the one on the far right) of these white/grayish ""things"" was moving what appeared to be a head at the end of a thin neck or something. I continued to observe this scene for several more minutes, with at least one more smaller white/grayish thing becoming visible below the others.  All the while I would zoom in and out to confirmed to myself that the size of these were shrinking/growi! ng as I did so, proving that they were there in the distance roughly where I had been watching the lights. Then suddenly, they disappeared.  I kept rolling, and zoomed out.  Once I did, I noticed the lights still present, and began to zoom back in, when I again noticed more white/grayish shapes/things present.  This time though, the shape was much different, and as crazy as it sounds coming from a non-religious person, there now appeared to be 3 distinct white/grayish objects present: 2 smaller objects on either side of a larger center object, with the larger center object looking strikingly like what my brain told me an Angel should look like, with arms raised in front of it wearing a white robe...  very, very weird feeling at this point that was incredibly different than the entire event up to this point. I changed my position slightly now, from where I was standing, and zoomed out.  I could visibly see that the white/grayish things were changing positioning in my view, and it appeared like 1-2 more ""joined"" the others.  There were now 6 distinctly visible, in 2 rows of 3.  Also worth noting, the lights that originally drew my to discover all of this were still visible and flashing/pulsing during all of this.  This brings us roughly to the 10minute mark of the video.  Near the 11min mark, more action takes place. At the 11min mark, the white/grayish objects are now gone, and there appears to be other ""ships"" or something visible, along with 3 circular objects appearing to be lights present on the object to the left of the view (with an additional object to the right of the view).  The white light-like objects were solid, but the two ""ship"" like objects were translucent and ""glittery"" to view.  I stayed watching these for a short period, then shut down and went outside to attempt to view.  Unfortunately I did not record when out there but was able to still see the object(s).  I had an intense feeling of being watched as soon as I stepped outside, which is why I didn't record -- I got back inside immediately after the feeling was way too intense to stay out. Important to note:  I do live in the landing flight path of a small local airport.  I can say with strong confidence given the ~12-13min recorded stationary time + 5-7min after recording that it remained, this was no small aircraft landing anywhere.  The objects that were observed were all relatively stationary other than the noted movements during the 12minutes described above and recorded.  After which, they moved beyond the tree line and I lost sight. This all took place between 2:55am and 3:08am Eastern Daylight Time.  FlightAware shows no Arrivals to the local airport mentioned at the times observed, nor anywhere near them. I have uploaded the video to youtube and can provide a link if requested.",2015-07-03T00:00:00,,

(Until I had this experience and went online to research where to report it, I had no idea that there have been so many UFO sightings, especially on the 4th of July of each year.)    After watching the city fireworks from our back balcony, I noticed a bright red, round light floating from east to west,across the southern sky.  It had no sound, and at first I wondered if I was seeing a satellite.   But it was a bright red, bigger and brighter light than a satellite, and it looked to be be much closer.  Its light intensity seemed to get a bit brighter and dimmer alternately, but still remained a bright red.  It looked like it was at the altitude that a low-flying plane would be coming in to land, but it floated levelly and had no small navigational red or white blinking lights on it, like planes do.  (We have planes frequently flying over our home, heading to the local airport for landings, and this appeared very different than those.)   As it passed by our house, it finally seemed to turn ""outward"", (away from us and the earth), and it quickly just faded away and was gone. The whole incident took approximately 15 seconds, but seemed much longer. As I was trying to make sense of what I had just witnessed, I noticed another red, round light to the left (east) of the first one, in the same area that we'd watched the fireworks just 10 minutes prior.  This red light was the same shape, color and intensity as the first one.  It hovered briefly rather high in the sky, then just descended, going straight down, towards land.  It went behind the treeline, whereby I couldn't see it any longer.   This whole incident also took approximately 15 seconds.  Like the first one, this light had no additional navigational lights like planes do.  It was silent, and seemed to have a smooth, ""floating"" quality to it. I was so baffled and almost flabbergasted by the sight of these two objects, that I did not even think to try to take a photograph.  I was in this kind of momentary ""time warp,"" where I was just awestruck by the whole experience--not really understanding or knowing for sure what I had actually just witnessed. I have never before witnessed this type of phenomenon, nor have I been a person who has an unusual interest or intrigue with UFO's.   Because it was late and my husband had already gone to bed, I had no other witnesses to this event.",2015-07-06T00:00:00,41.977694906621394,-91.6758648556876

This happened in the late 80's.  I was about 14 at the time (I can't remember the year exactly).  I was outside in my parents' backyard in Nominingue, QC, on a summer evening.  It was after sunset and the sky was getting dark, but not dark enough to see stars yet. What I saw was a luminous circle West of me at an elevation of about 30 degrees.  The circle was light blue and about the size of a light bulb seen from 10 feet away.  The object was not very bright.  The best way to visualize it is to imagine a circle of daytime blue sky in the darker sky. The object was rising slowly at about half an inch per second from my point of view.  There was no noise at this point.  I got to watch the object for less than 10 seconds and then, it exploded.  It broke apart in chunks that started tumbling in free fall, leaving turbulent trails the same light blue as the original object.  The trails faded within a second. A few seconds after the explosion (I'd say 3 to 5 seconds), I heard the muffled sound of a blast, much like the sound made when someone ignites a gas stove.  I deduced from that that the object couldn't have been too far away.  There was no sound or vibration related to ground impact. The funny thing is after seeing this, I just went inside the house and never spoke of it with my parents even though I used to talk about UFOs with my father once in a while.  He had a few sightings of his own in his younger days.  Also, even though I can remember the details of the sighting quite clearly, the memory of when the sighting actually took place got fuzzy from the get go.  I always found that to be quite peculiar.

No wings, no running lights. My one and only UFO sighting happened nearly 30 years ago.  It was a mild fall Oklahoma night in 1981, somewhat cloudy.  I was outside in the yard of my boyhood home when I noticed what looked like a white shaft of light, angled at about 45 degrees, casually hovering up and down in the sky against the eastern horizon.  Methodically, it would rise and then, slowly, steadily, it would drop, and then rise again, repeating this pattern, while I strained to figure out what it was. After performing the up-and-down hovering motion for a few minutes, the object instantly and noiselessly darted from the eastern horizon to directly overhead, stopped in midflight, and then shot back near to its starting pointâwhere it continued to hover briefly before starting a sequence of movements across the sky, zipping from one horizon to another, stopping, starting, hovering, dartingâalways maintaining a 45-degree tilt. After about 10 minutes of watching (or being watched; I wasnât sure which), I grabbed a pair of binoculars that I knew to be in a vehicle parked in the driveway. After a few frustrating moments of trying to train the binoculars on the object before it moved, it finally settled into one spot in the sky, almost directly overhead. As it hovered silent and stationary overhead, I could clearly see a cylinder shaped object, the color of polished aluminum.  It glowed from the inside out, illuminating the sky evenly all around it.  There were no windows, no running lights or gear, no wings. It was smooth and polished, one piece, solid. As I held the binoculars steady, the object suddenly vanished.  But as I continued to focus the binoculars on the same spot, seconds later, the object reappeared as suddenly as it had disappeared.  Moments later, it began to dart around again. Finally, the object sped away toward the south, gone within a couple of seconds, without a sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were near the Bloomfield exit when we first noticed it, and we both knew it was something strange, as we have driven that route our entire adult livesâ¦  It was far away, but apparently enormous, judging by the tiny pinpoints of aircraft lights from the planes which flew in every direction in close proximity to the object (Close to Newark Airport!).  I wasn't sure what I was seeing, my first thought was that it had to be the penthouse of some building lit-up for a party, but it was so impossibly bright I couldn't imagine anyone wouldn't be immediately blinded!   We continued down the parkway and it was obvious that other drivers were seeing it too, because everyone was driving erratically, even my girlfriend was all over the road and I was sure we were going to crash.!   We managed to stay on course, watching the object grow larger and more detailed the closer we got.    By the time we reached our exit for Rte. 78 around Hillside/ Union, it was smack-dab next to us, and as we rounded the exit ramp there was a line of about 15 motorcyclists pulled over to the side, jumping up and down, screaming and pointing to the object!  Now that we were next to it, I could see that it was hovering right above the tree-line, and it was HUGE!  It was a soft sided triangle in shape; lit-up a fluorescent green that was more intense than any green I had seen before; it had a red light on the top that seemed to pulse like an organic heartbeat, I could feel it pulling at my chest with each pulse, that was the thing that terrified me the most; and it had a small, red flashing light on the bottom.   I kept yelling at my girlfriend to pull over, but she seemed disoriented and took the wrong exit, going the opposite way as the location of the object, as well as her home.  She proceeded to get us lost in an area that we were familiar with, but it seemed that we were both disoriented now and common landmarks became unrecognizableâ¦  After a while we did make it back to her house, where I promptly jumped in my car and drove home in confusion of the night's events.  For weeks I tried to find a rational explanation for what we had seen, but really there was only one ultimate answerâ¦ We had seen a UFO!!!!  And so had hundreds of other people driving in NJ that night, but of course it never made the news.  I did hear that it was reported to the national database, and that there were reports of a similar object the following night over Basking Ridge.",2015-07-10T00:00:00,,

It was about 9pm and I decided I would go out for a late evening walk, since the weather was nice.  I get about 2 or 3 blocks from home when I hear a peculiar sound.  I stood there at the corner of the street listing to this.  It clearly from the sky, but I couldn't tell which direction.  What struck me odd was that this was unlike anything I heard before.  The sound didn't sound like traffic, or weather, or airplanes, or factories, etc. In fact, it sounded like something from a horror movie!  I looked up and down the street if anyone was out to hear what I was hearing, but everyone was inside.  Nonetheless, this sound made my hair stand on end, it was really unner! ving. I decided to end my walk early and head back home.  After about a week or two I forgot about the incident until late in the year I heard some people talk about this on the radio.  People the world over had been experiencing these sky sounds and even some has posted videos of it on You Tube.  It's a real deal, and it's very ominous sounding.

I would sit there, facing west, around 5pm, sometimes for a couple hours.   Anyhow, as I'm looking at the afternoon sky, and it was still bright and sunny out, I noticed a very bright light, low in the sky, close to the horizon.  Day after day it was there.  On first blush, I though it was a very bright star- but at 5pm in the afternoon?!  The moon wasn't even out!   As I had the habit of coming out to watch it, it would bob slowly off in the horizon, to the point that it would slowly move down, out of view, (the trees were blocking it from view).  This happened over the course of months. Now as this was going on, I noticed that when after it rained, craft slowly flying through the clouds, slowly lighting up really bright, then dimming.  But they stayed in the clouds.  I could barely make the shape of the craft.  There was several of these craft at any given time (after a rain storm).

Report#3-  This encompasses the year of 2013. 1) Spring 2013 (approx May 19th or so), evening:  I was walking home from the library and it was evening, about 7pm. It was getting dark.  As I'm about a few blocks from home, I noticed a really bright light in the northern sky. I initially thought it was a plane and dismissed it as being so, although it was still somewhat peculiar.  Around 11pm, as I'm taking trash out to the dumpster and settling in for the night, that really bright light was still there! I had to get a good look at it.  So I walked to the local softball field where I always have been able to get a good view at the night sky.  As I'm walking there while looking at the light, it was not 'twinkling' as a star does, but pulsating.  And every time it 'blinked' it changed color-blue, red, green, yellow, white, and so forth.  I finally got to my location and I stood there for 45 minutes watching it pulsate.  It was bigger and brighter than any star I've ever seen.  I can't tell if it was out in space or 'local' to my are! a.  At one moment, there was a bright blue flash directly below it.  Unfortunately, I could see the horizon since trees and houses blocked the view. I would've stayed out all night to watch it, but I had to go to work in the morning.  Incidentally, it was gone the next night. 2)  Bright, large light in the western sky that would move slowly down.  It didn't twinkly so much as it would pulsate.  It would appear in the blue of sky and would get brighter the darker it got.  It would move slowly, down, diagonally, out of view after two hours.  I experienced this all year in 2013 and it disappeared in early 2014.  IT'S NOT VENUS, nor is it a satellite or space station, I'm certain of that.  It has reappeared in 2015, but it is not as bright or as large, but it still moves.  I've also seen it do some strange things.  In 2013, as I'm sitting out there waiting for it appear, a white orb that sort of blended in the bright blue afternoon sky, flew from the east, over my head, and take its place in the western sky.  It was the same thing, because it would slowly light up the darker the sky got.  I've also seen it move at an alarming speed and come to a dead stop at it's spot in the western afternoon sky. 3)  One day in 2013, summer, I was walking down the avenue to the store, this was around noon, and I happened to look up in the sky (for no particular reason) and noticed white orbs flying in and out the clouds. I stood there several minutes watching this. When I came back from the store, they were gone. 4)  This was big one for me.  It was Friday before Labor Day 2013.  It was around 8pm and it was getting dark. I went out to my usual spot to watch the sky.  I initially didn't see anything out of the ordinary, and the bright western light had already disappeared. After 15 minutes or so, I thought I'd head back home, since it was hot and muggy. After walking about a block from my spot, I look over my should an see something truly out of the ordinary. A string of red/orange orbs appeared low in the sky and moved up, in a diagonal direction. Occasionally, the orbs would make 'shapes' as they flew up in the sky.  Anyhow, they'd reach their position in the sky and blink (or 'pop') out.  After each one would pop, there would be a dull purple sparkling effect that would fly off in the opposite direction.  This all happened over 15 minutes or so and was completely silent.  At one moment as I'm watching this, a helicopter flew over my head directly towards the orbs but I couldn't see if any! thing happened since trees and houses blocked the view.  I called the police department to ask if anyone else saw what I so and I was told no. However, the next day, I scoured the internet, and some people in Illinois, Ohio, and even Egypt saw the very thing I saw on the same day and about the same time. In fact, videos of these orbs can be found on You Tube. Anyhow, I came out the next day to see if they'd reappear. Nothing happened like the night before- HOWEVER that Saturday night, as I'm sitting there waiting for something to happen, a sound from the sky returned and it got real loud (it seemed like it was right above me)- but this time it sounded like white noise. The duration of this was maybe five minutes. As I'm looking at the sky for the source of this sound, I latched on to one red/orange in the southern sky. As the sound ended abruptly, this red/orange orb blinked out at the same time.  Like I said, something strange is going on. 2013 was a big year for me on experiencing these things. These sky sounds are real, and I'm convinced it's not HAARP but something paranormal in origin. And I think these orbs are linked to these sounds.  But these are real things and not a hoax. 2014 was a quiet year and I didn't experience anything too out of the ordinary. But 2015 seems that things might be ramping up again. The western 'star' is back. I've been seeing strange lights slowly light up and die out low in the horizon.  I never in my life thought I'd see a UFO, let alone nearly in my own back yard. Plus I'm experiencing these things on a regular basis (though it seemed to peak in 2013) and still experienced a shape-shifting bronze object on 7/2/2015 late morning and in the bright blue of sky.  Something really odd is going on. More people need to keep their eyes on the sky, because they'd probably see this stuff as easily as I have been. I don't know what it means. But I'm thoroughly convinced it's something paranormal in original, maybe even supernatural. And I'm confident airline pilots are seeing these things left and right. And I KNOW the government is aware of this stuff, certainly the things I'm seeing and hearing 2011-2015. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Around 10:20 pm on the night of 7/21/15, my friend and I were sitting on the back porch stargazing when we encountered a very slow, low-flying craft coming from the east.  We live in a fairly close proximity to a National Guard bombing range so we've seen our fair share of strange planes and all manner of aircraft, but this was by far the most interesting and unique encounter we've had to date. The craft was triangular in shape, with a single white light on each corner and a blinking red light on the middle of the underside.  What really struck us about the object is that it was flying incredibly low, much lower than other aircraft we've seen during military flyovers, and of course much, MUCH lower than any commercial airplanes that regularly fly overhead.   The second striking feature was the speed at which the object was moving--it was easily the slowest moving craft to ever fly overhead (and that's really saying something in A10 and AC130 territory!)  It took approximately ten minutes to completely disappear from our line of sight. The thing that seemed to differ from other reports that we've read since our encounter last night was the noise level.  While others seem to describe similar encounters as quiet or silent, our craft was quite loud, emitting a low rumble that could be heard even after it was out of our sight. As an interesting side note, shortly after that experience, we saw on the local news that a Blackhawk helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at a relatively local airport--connected?  In any case, the craft is welcome to fly by any time it wants, it was a wonderful experience.",2015-07-23T00:00:00,,

That part of the day when you can see very clearly. The slight rise on the Kiln stretch.  You have very straight and flat road for over 2 miles. As soon as I we were on the Stretch I noticed a disk shaped flying hovering over some pine trees on the south side of the road.  I asked my wife what in the hell that was.  We were driving straight for it.  It was totally clear view.  My wife was very very concerned.  I stopped the car between 1/4 and 1/2 miles from the disc.  I told my wife would be back in a few minutes.  She was very unhappy with my proposal. I jogged down the highway to a spot where the saucer was just to my south about 200 to 250 feet. The saucer or disc was perfectly clear.  It was motionless 15 feet or so ever the pine tree forest. I stood in that spot for at least 5 minutes.  The saucer was a dull silver in color. On the outside edge.  Just over the edge was a series of colors of yellow, blue and red areas.  Like windows but you can't see thru. Only seeing the colors could you notice the shimmering of the saucer.  No sound at all.  This thing took off straight up like you can't imagine.  I jerked my head up. In about 1/10 of a second if was roughly 40,000 feet up and gone.  It is usual for birds to be making chirping sounds.  During this time the woods were silent.  I have had nothing happen to me that some report. We never reported to anyone. Now I am a firm believer. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We had noticed what we thought was a single engine plane stop in mid-air, and go backwards. We continued our walk when the craft appeared above us where we stood and watched it lower itself right above us.  It was a black metallic saucer shape disk with bright light directly in the center of the craft.  It made no sound and seemed to just want to observe us.  After many minutes the craft ""flipped"" and zoomed away in a streak towards due west. We continued our walk when the craft came back and hovered over us as before.  It would zoom away due west and come back to us several times. We didn't feel threatened for some reason and welcomed this strange occurrence. After about two hours, we went home and discovered we had missed the debate.  Between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter who were in Cleveland that night. Days later a local Cleveland reporter came to our house and explained that another group of teenagers walking home from basketball practice on the west side of Cleveland were witnessing the same thing, simultaneously. The speed of the craft took mere seconds to go from the Northeast where we were to the west side, an hours drive by car. The craft was low enough while hovering that we could determine its metallic smooth black color and the lights that blinked in the center of the craft. The flying saucer was about the size of a commercial jet if you drew a circle around the wing span. Why this Space craft spent so much time going back and forth from my sister and me then to the west side and back I really can only guess that maybe they were just having a curious look. At the time, my daughter was only four years old, and I wasn't about to encourage an invite by these unknowns. I remember speaking to the craft and wondering if they really knew what we were saying. To this day I remember the incident vivid,y, as does my sister. Looking back, I feel blessed to have had an interaction with possible being from another planet. I know for sure it was not one of ours.  This spaceship traveled at speeds that could have traversed our whole country in a matter of minutes. There were no cell phones in those days for which I regret.  But I would definitely identify this type of craft easily.  No sort of dome on top or bottom.  A saucer.",2015-06-24T00:00:00,,

This was strange because there is elevated ground in that direction that would make a small plane flight way too low and hazardous.   I proceeded to turn east on 32nd street to head to my house, which would bring me just to the South of the area I had spotted the object.  It was about Â¼ of a mile East of Perkins road, and just about 50 yards North of East 32nd street.  My view of the object (landing lights) had been obscured by a hill and the tree line as I drove the mile to my exit from the first sighting.  The object did not move at all while I observed it.  My assumption at this point was it would be a helicopter hovering over the field for some reason. Once I turned onto East 32nd, I could see that the object was again in view, and hovering about 75 feet off the ground, further above the tree line than I had first imagined.  It did not take me long to get to a clearing in two tree lines, in which a wheat field was present.   Now I was able to see that about a dozen âlanding lightsâ were spaced almost evenly apart, giving the object a distinct rectangular/box shape.  Having been into aviation I thought a helicopter that size and shape could only be something like a CH-53 Sea Stallion, but there are no Marine or Naval Air assets anywhere close to Stillwater, Oklahoma, and I was only used to seeing UH-1 Hueys, CH-47 Chinooks, occasional AH-1 Cobras, and civilian aircraft in the skies.  As I got close I could not hear anything, having ridden in large helicopters before, and been around them while in the Military (later in life) I realize how much racket they make.  There was no wind this night, which is unusual for Northern Oklahoma.   I decided to place my car in neutral, and then turn off the engine, so the only sound would be the tires on the blacktop.  My windows were down because it was still warm outside, and my car did not have any air conditioning.  There was complete silence, other than the sound of the tires on the blacktop, and the tall Johnson grass on the side of the road was not swaying around.  There was no rotor wash from the blades of a helicopter, nor the rotor slap that would have been audible.  When someone is this close to a helicopter the rotor slap often generates sound waves so powerful that a person can âfeelâ them as well.   At this point I realized it was not a large helicopter and I began to panic, as I was quite familiar with the UFO phenomenon from early age.  I quickly turned the car back on and threw it back into drive and sped off towards my home.   Just on the off chance it might be a blimp of some sort, I peered over my left shoulder as I was travelling east of the object and looked at it as it was now in front of the âhazeâ or pink skyline of the City of Stillwater.  The air is rather dirty in that part of Oklahoma, and even small communities have skylines that are shrouded in a pinkish layer of light pollution at night.   In addition there were thick clouds that night, and the ceiling for the clouds was low enough to reflect a lot of the light pollution.  This should have provided me enough difference to see if there was a structure above a âgondolaâ that would have been on a very large blimp.  But all I could see where the bright blue, white, and red landing lights that gave the object its distinct box and/or rectangle shape.   The combination of bright skyline, low cloud ceiling, and the angle of the object should have made any giant gas containing structure of a dirigible visible as a dark shadow against the background.   At this point I accelerated to a high rate of speed, and proceeded to go home, which was about another two miles east of this location.  The home I lived in was perched on a hill, and when I got out of the car and looked to the West, I could see the object just above the trees. When I got inside, I went into my Father's room and attempted to wake him up and see if he would come and observe it.  He was tired, it was way past his bed time, and he did not believe in âUFO nonsenseâ so despite my frantic state, would not get out of bed or listen to what I had to say. Because it was above the tree line, and I had no other reference points, my guess to its size is simply that. It looked about the side of two greyhound busses set side by side.   After calling a friend who lived in town and telling him about it, I was brave enough to walk out to the edge of the yard and look west to see if it was still there, but it had disappeared. This happened sometime in the fall of 1989 or 1990, but I do not remember the exact date.  Another friend talked me into going to the wheat field and looking it over the next day, but it had been plowed sometime in the past couple of weeks, and was soft from rainfall. We saw nothing in the general area where I observed it to be hovering that would indicate that it had landed. No sounds were heard from the object. Because that was and still is a sparsely populated part of the area, I knew no one to ask to see if they had observed it as well. In addition the fear of ridicule meant only my Father, and a couple of close friends knew about the encounter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

He agreed and suggested helicopters.  But, then we both said that did not make sense either.   Before we could think much about it, all but one of the lights were just instantly gone.

On Saturday, May 30, 2015, at approximately 8:00 PM, over the Green Valley area of Henderson, NV, my wife and I got in the car to go out and eat, like we do every Saturday night.   We got in the car and turned around the corner just a 100 ft from our home and a bright light caught the corner of eye and I looked up and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  There was a huge triangular shaped black ship with seven large bright lights on the two sides of the V-shaped front.   I could see the ship up close, as I am sure it was below 1000 ft elevation and still daylight. It had been a rainy and overcast day in the Las Vegas area and it appeared that the ship had just popped out of a low cloud bank.    My wife couldn't see it, as she was sitting on the other side of the car, so I stopped and asked her to get out and look up, but just as she started get out, it disappeared.  It was like someone turned a switch and it disappeared before my eyes.  I had a clear visual look at the ship for about! 45 seconds.   The ship was large with a 300 to 500 ft long triangular sides and looked like a flat black wing which seemed very super sonic.  The unusual thing was the lights, they were not mounted on the superstructure.  There was a rigging made with black pipes attached to the fuselage that held the lights and protruded out from the ship about 10 feet.  I questioned how they could fly through the atmosphere at high speed with lights like that.   There were seven lights, one right on the point and 3 each down each side.  They were large,  rectangular, the longest length vertical.  They were 3 or 4 ft high and 2 or 3 ft wide.  The ship was moving very slow, less than 30 miles an hour and there was no noise of visible engines or intakes. I am very familiar with the B2 bomber, as a saw it fly over very low over us at at the Rose Parade, several years ago.  I also had the opportunity to stand under it at Nellis AFB during Air Force air show a few years ago.  The  ship I saw was bigger than the B2, possibly two or three times the size.

Beside it I saw an immensely, intense glowing orange light, spherical shape, almost like a fireball.  I told my husband to immediately stop the car and back-up.  He did and I jumped out of the car and clearly saw a bright, bright, bright orange ball.  They were off toward the eastern sky, not too far off as they appeared in the same proximity of where I had just seen the firework explode.  (They were not directly overhead.)  Followed close behind was a second orange sphere, identical to the first, and! following the driving line of the first ball.  Then, trailing just slightly further behind, was a third sphere.  All identical in color. The most unbelievable, intense glowing orange I have ever seen.   My husband was on the driver side and keep telling me to take  picture.  I wanted to but just felt that if I moved my eyes the objects would be gone before I could figure out how to get a photo.  I watched for maybe 30 seconds.

On the evening of July 4th at around 11:30 P.M.  My wife and I were standing on our deck in our back yard watching the neighbors firework displays.  I looked to the east, through the trees and saw what appeared to be a solid orange light moving in a south, southwest direction at a speed relatively close to an to a commercial jet. A couple of months ago I made a report to this site about a triangular object with an exceptionally bright solid white light.  As that object moved to the south and disappeared, the light turned to an orange and the object disappeared.  The orange light on this craft was exactly like the light of the triangular craft from my first report. I realized it was something different when I noticed that it had no blinking lights and was definitely not part of a fireworks display.  I quickly pointed it out to my wife and she was somewhat baffled as to what it could be.  She only caught a short view, maybe 5-10 seconds before it disappeared behind the trees.  I ran into the house, grabbed the binoculars from the table and ran out the front door to pick up it's trajectory.   Once outside, I immediately, picked up the object but just as I put the binoculars on it, it disappeared completely. I lowered the binoculars to see if I could see it with a wider field of view and I spotted a second light of the exact same type, coming out from behind the trees and following the same course as the original, but it appeared to be further in the distance as it looked somewhat smaller. I started to raise the binoculars again and this light also disappeared. I scanned the area just the same and one thing stood out, the sky was completely cl! ear where both objects disappeared and the stars in the background were completely visible, there was no obstruction to block my view of either object.  The whole incident probably lasted right at or under one minute. These two objects were coming from the northeast and they disappeared very near to where I lost sight of the first object back in April. As with the first sighting, these objects made no sound. When I asked my wife what she thought, she said that they looked similar to lights on an airplane but she agreed that it was weird that they wouldn't have any blinking lights or that their lights would be orange. It's possible that rising smoke from all of the fireworks could have given them an orange hue but about ten minutes later a commercial jetliner crossed the path that they had taken and it looked white with two blinking lights. It was very clear that the lights that we saw were completely different. The lights, even in orange looked exceptionally bright.  I stated in my first report that we live near joint base Lewis/McChord and we've seen plenty of military traffic go over our home. This was nothing like anything we've seen. I scanned some other reports from our general location and noticed that I'm not the only one who has described similar objects. Just wondering if they could be testing something at the base? This base isn't normally known for that I kind of activity but I have a limited knowledge of what they do there on the Air Force side.  The sky was clear, no wind and just for the record, I don't drink, do drugs or take medication of any kind.  I'm not saying that these things are extra terrestrial, most things have a logical explanation, but this one has me stumped.  If you have any suggestions I would be open to hear them. Until then I guess I'll keep looking in that area to see if this happens regularly.  One last question regarding the lights. If there was no obstruction in my view, which there was not, I have never heard of an aircraft, much less two, that suddenly turn off all of their exterior lights when flying at night. If it were a plane, why would they do that?",2015-07-06T00:00:00,47.14574063670412,-122.2924202247191

Submitted by:  BBecker ufomig@yahoo.com   My experience occurred on the night of Wednesday, 6/17/15.  My youngest daughter and her fiance were staying with us from out of town that week, and they had gone out for the evening, leaving us with their dog, Mosby, a Yorkie.  My wife and I had been watching television in our living room.   I noticed that it was 9:00 p.m. Central time, or getting close to the top of the hour. Keeping with my routine, we made our way to bed to settle in for the night.  After quickly getting comfortable in bed, I heard Mosby bark.  We called him, but he didn't come in to answer our call, so I climbed out of bed and saw him setting patiently at the front door, which indicated to me that he had to go out.  I pulled off his ""diaper"" and hooked up his leash and took him outside so that he could take care of business.  I recall the weather conditions seemed uncomfortably warm and humid that evening.   I began to look at nearby house and street lights and I thought that it looked unusually haze. I then at the sky, and noticed the moon and a few stars. The stars seemed evident, but they too were hazy because of weather conditions.  I then looked nearly straight up over me.  As I was looking up, I saw a flash of light.  The duration was only a second, but since I was viewed it straight on and not out of the corner of my eye, I felt it was not a trick of the light caused by my eyesight or glasses.   The flash, or streak, seemed very bright, brighter than the moon, with the intensity of lightning or an electrical flash. It was silent.  It would be difficult to say for sure that it was streaking, as it was so quick, but the flash seemed to indicate a movement to the north (it was almost directly above, perhaps a little to my east).  The flash seemed defined in its edges, and not subject to the haziness of the other lights and heavenly bodies I had observed.  While I did not get the impression that it was close to the ground, it seemed large...I would measure the width of the light by holding my hand straight out above me, with my arm extended fully and holding our my index finger...the flash was the width of the tip of my index finger.   The length of travel seemed to be half the length of that index finger. It was so fast, I questioned as to whether I actually had seen this.  It did not seemed similar to any other meteor, comet, or natural object I have seen before.  It did not resemble any man made object with which I am familiar.  The flash seemed very similar to that of an object I watched for minutes back in the 1990's when I resided in Festus/Crystal city.   This object moved with intent, up, down, and sideways with great speed, hanging in the air near the ground, high in the air, until zipping off to the west with a flash...exactly like I witnessed most recently.  Because of my previous sighting, I feel strongly that the object I viewed this month was not viewed as it had been in motion, but had been hanging directly above me, and zipped away as I looked upward in it's direction.   After the sighting that night, I could not arrive at a comfortable conclusion as to what I viewed, and I decided it best to take the dog back inside.  Mosby had not acted out of the ordinary during this time.  My trip outside lasted five to ten minutes, perhaps.  I told my wife what I had seen, and we went to bed.  I mentioned it to my daughter the next day.   Later in the afternoon on Thursday, she read the news article on Facebook from Fox 2 news regarding the Affton lights.  While I found that video compelling, the only similarity between that incident and what I viewed was the time of occurrence.

Prior to leaving I bought a brand new GPS navigation unit and we tested it out in town prior to our trip knowing it worked well.  Our navigation unit directed us toward Augusta, GA.  Our kids fell asleep at about 9pm. At precisely 01:28am 29 June 2015 on HWY 1 south heading north approximately 7-8 miles south of a gas station at 10525 HWY 1 south, Wadley, GA, 30477.  Our radio began to get real static so I turned it down when my wife noticed a very large object flying left to right coming toward us.  I looked up to the left and hit my brakes stopping our truck to the side of the road.  The object appeared to be approximately 250 meters in length 60 meters height and was approximately flying 200 feet in altitude and was spurting sparks from the rear of the object.  The sparks were jetting out about 50-80 meters in a pattern of controlling thrust. My wife and I had a very good look at the object closer than anyone else on that highway considering there was no vehicles in sight.  The object had a dim glow of a orange around it, vague but noticeable.  The objects exterior was metallic but appeared to look like oil on water effect to it and appeared to be fluid like movement over the metallic body of the object.   My wife and I watched in disbelief in what we were witnessing as it moved left to right the object decreased in altitude as it was over the highway then began to increase in altitude after it crossed the highway right overhead of us.  We watched as it increased in altitude and penetrated some clouds and accelerated out of sight through the cloud cover quickly. I got back on the road and processed down the highway way feeling a bit shook up with a mild headache trying debunk what it might have been.  Too fast for a blimp, too slow for airplanes, no sound but mild humming, too big to be any aircraft or helicopter, and so on.   About 4-5 miles further up the road a semi truck had stopped on the side of the road on the southbound lanes and a car with a guy getting back in their car as they saw what we saw.  I stopped at the first gas station on the right and told the guy there what we saw and bought a few things to proceed on our road trip.  An hour later our navigation system malfunctioned telling us we were at our final destination in the middle of nowhere at a church.  My wife mentioned that we have been driving 9 hours which steamed to me to be a long time for the amount distance we cover.  I stopped and powered it down and reset it to Colorado Springs.  We got back on track and we stopped to sleep in north Atlanta area just after 6am. My stomach was upset and I did not sleep well nor did my wife. We got up late afternoon and got back on the road. 6 hours after being on the road my trucks transmission began acting up and we had stopped.  I messed around with changing my truck's transmission settings through all the functions for about 15 minutes and it eventually corrected itself.  I have had on an off headaches and upset stomach since witnessing this object.  My truck has been acting odd as well, check engine oil level, check engine, and a large chip in the windshield not noticed before. I have receipts and time lines. I am capable of drawing and painting a visual representation of what we saw but my art supplies are packed away until we find a home to buy so Iâm limited as to what I can do for the time being.  The image of that object is vivid in my mind to good detail so I will have produce a visual reference at a later time. Please keep in mind I am active duty military.  Iâm speaking of this only because I have not yet been told not to and forced to sign non disclosure orders as I have been forced to in the past.  My MOS has  presented me with more than a few of incidents in similar situations.  I have always had been approached and forced to sign the nondisclosure orders.  If you need anything else someone needs to get here and talk to me soon. Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite objective and serious-minded.  We wonder whether he and his family might have been witness to the re-entering satellite, reported for the same time and date over the Midwest and East Coast.  However, in a second conversation, the witness states unambiguously that he believes that what he witnessed with his family was not a re-entering satellite.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM MR. TED MOLCZAN, SATELLITE TRACKER)) Hello Peter, I received the meteor camera data this morning.  A quick review indicates that the re-entry passed roughly 3 to 4 min. earlier than I had estimated from the orbital data.  This reduces the discrepancy between the reported time of the sighting and re-entry to about 1 to 2 min.  Taking into account the Earth's rotation relative the trajectory, the earlier passage shifted the track closer to the witness, resulting in roughly a 10 to 15 deg higher elevation above the horizon than in my earlier estimate.  Therefore, their view of the event was even better than my earlier estimate. I hope to complete a more thorough analysis of the meteor data in the coming weeks, but I do not expect the results to materially affect my finding that the re-entry is the most probable cause of the UFO sighting. Regards, Ted ((END ADDENDUM))",2015-07-10T00:00:00,32.8688,-82.3924

I was on Delta Airlines Flight 1667 flying from Atlanta, GA, to Myrtle Beach, S.C.  The aircraft was a MD-88 and I was sitting in seat 19E on the starboard side of the aircraft, several rows forward of the wing, which I could see on the right side of my window when I leaned forward.  We took off an hour late at around 22:29.  There was an overcast of Cirrus-stratus or Alto-stratus clouds.  The full moon was not visible through this layer.  There were no lower clouds and city lights were plainly visible without obstruction during the initial climb out after takeoff.  There were no reading lights in use near me.  There were also no electronics in use with illuminated screens nearby that would have reflected on the inside of the window. Shortly after takeoff the aircraft leveled out and the lights of the city were plainly visible with a definite darker area extending out to the horizon visible under a slightly lighter sky over that.   At this point I was looking down at the city lights, when I noticed a light separate itself from the rest and begin to move.  It was a banana yellow color and was moving upward at a slow and steady pace.  There were no other details to it.  I could not judge its distance from us.   As it moved, it appeared to be heading on an opposite course to ours and was climbing at an angle of approximately forty five degrees.  From my perspective it moved from the lower left of the window to its upper right corner where I lost it to view.   The light became obscured by the leading edge of the wing and then reappeared over the rear upper edge of the wing or wingtip.  All this time which was probably a minute or so the light did not change in brightness or flicker.  The color stayed the sa! me and so did its speed of ascent.  I was unable to observe the object further as it went out of my limited field of view even by shifting my position. I don't know if anyone else on the aircraft saw this.  There was no apparent reaction. The young man sitting next to me on the left was listening to music and not looking out the window.  This whole thing occurred to quickly to try to get anyone's attention. During the initial takeoff before we leveled out there were other aircraft visible.  This light or object did not exhibit their characteristics.  I have flown numerous times at night and have seen plenty of aircraft leaving or arriving at airports.  This was not one of them. Its apparent point of origin was not from any airport. It was an urban environment.  Shortly after this we began to ascend again and banked for a course change.  I checked my watch and it was now 22:35. I am sixty two years old, male, and was travelling alone returning home from a family related trip.  I am a retired social worker and business manager.  I am an amateur astronomer and avid sky watcher.  I have no clue what this was.  I only know what it wasn't.  I considered raising this issue with the pilot upon landing at Myrtle Beach, but decided to avoid that and take this approach instead.  I don't know how he would have reacted, but I did speak with him about the natural fireworks of distant thunderstorms visible to our south during the flight at higher altitude which he was also quite enthusiastic about.",2015-07-10T00:00:00,33.808705515846256,-84.38988231962239

These lights were more or less in a line stretching  about a fourth of the way across the sky as I watched them slowly move southward.  They were not tightly spaced but had about same space between them: K One........Two.......Three/ Four (these two were one above the other with roughly the same ....... spacing, and seemed to be trying to get closer to each other) then........Five. They must have not been that far away from me because they were quite bright and bigger than stars. I don't know where they came from I just saw them there in that line slowly moving north. At a certain point (which oddly corresponds to where the visibility from my vantage point is unobstructed when  looking at that part of the sky), the light of first object suddenly went dark, and after that when each of those objects reached that part of the sky they too sent dark. It seems that they may have continued on but moving east now ( but I could not be certain).This sighting occurred in Tampa, but in the Temple Terrace/Thontosassa area. These objects moved slowly, and I estimate I watched this for at least three minutes. I wondered if anyone else saw them? As watched it felt almost like they were putting on a show just for me as it took so long. I looked on-line, and it may be possible they were some sort of sky lanterns ( Chinese lanterns) as they are that color and move slowly. I can't be certain. I did not hear of any being launched. But it is a possibility. I always look up at the night sky and have never seen anything like what I saw ever before. However, there was a night  in the  summer  of 2009 in which I saw on roughly that same area of the sky  where the lights went off  in last nights sighting; a strangely churning white cloud ( at night).  I remember because I have NEVER seen a cloud churn and billow so fast.  On that night I got a chill because I was driving home listening to a man tell a story about Moses and the cloud appearing in the mountain, when, as I pulled into my driveway, I saw this strangely churning cloud directly in my line of vision.  It was late at night also and the synchronicity of what I saw  and heard made me run for cover inside my house. So for me, I guess,  that area of sky is indeed mysterious.  I softened wondered if behind that churning cloud was a mother ship.  Odd that the lights should disappear when they got to that part of the sky...",2015-07-23T00:00:00,28.006814358108112,-82.47646101351351

On June 18, 2015, at around 9:30 pm, my dad noticed a red light hovering in the sky.  It was in the distance (roughly 20-30 miles away) and was roughly about 20,000 feet in the air.   Then a second light appeared close to the first.  We thought it was the wing lights of some sort of plane, but the distance between the lights would have meant the plane had the biggest wingspan weâve ever seen.   Then a third red light appeared and we realized it was three separate objects.  They all hovered in a horizontal line.   Almost immediately after the third light appeared, the first one quickly dimmed and disappeared.  Then the second light dimmed and disappeared.   After that, the third light began to rapidly fly straight up hundreds of feet in only a fraction of a second.  Then it instantly came to a complete stop.   It began to fly around rapidly in all different directions.  It would take off at speeds faster than Iâve ever seen a plane fly, then instantly stop and hover in midair.  It didnât need any time to accelerate.  It would fly erratically in the air, changing directions 180 degrees in an instant without having to slow down.  It could have flown circles around any airplane or helicopter with ease.   After a few minutes it just disappeared.  About 20 minutes later, the three red lights appeared again, in the same order and formation as the first time. The first two lights disappeared in the same order as before, and the third light proceeded to fly erratically, but for a shorter time than before. Then it disappeared.  After another 20 or 30 minutes two red lights appeared again, in a horizontal line, but were much farther apart. This viewing is harder to explain. They hovered in place just like before. Then, slowly, a second red light flew out from behind each of the two lights (on the right side of one light, and on the left side of the other light). Then another light came out from the behind the other side of each light (on the left side of one light, and on the right side of the other light), which equaled two sets of three lights. At this time all six of the lights were in a perfect horizontal line, with a set of three lights that was a far distance from the other set of three lights. Then, the two outer lights slowly flew back in behind each center light, and the center lights became much brighter. The two outer lights continued to fly back in from the center lights, and back out from the center lights, causing the brightness of the center lights to increase and decrease. Then they ! all disappeared.  Finally, about another 20-30 minutes later, one red light appeared in the sky, much farther than where the rest had appeared. It hovered there for about one minute, and disappeared.  This happened when we were camping in the middle of nowhere in the Nevada desert. We estimated the lights to be coming from in between the Monte Cristo Range and Lone Mountain, which is between Coaldale, NV and Tonopah, NV.",2015-06-24T00:00:00,,

We were sitting in chairs at the western edge of the Sabino Canyon parking lot and had just watched the fireworks display that  Ventana Canyon Resort puts on for guests.  The sky was heavily overcast over the mountains so when I saw a bright white light appear over the mountains just to the west of the radio towers, I thought it best to turn on my 5X night vision camera and see what it was and I began recording. It was actually 2 lights nearly together in a stationary position far out over the mountains which was easy to tell since the lights were in focus but the radio towers were not since they were closer even though still a few miles away.  Immediately when I turned on the camera, there was a big blue flash near the right side of the lights.  I then zoomed in on the lights and the 2 lights gradually became three in a perfectly spaced row. My camera was mounted on a tripod so the light appeared steady and not moving in the video and that can be gauged also by its relation to the top of the mountain seen below it.  Clearly these lights were in the sky and are not on the mountain itself.   There were big flashes of green lights both near the lights but also well away from them.  Later a similar set of lights appeared out of nowhere next to the original lights to the left of them and when they did the original lights themselves flashed as a large green light. This second set of lights then began to disappear and became a single red light that could be seen moving towards the original lights before it went out.  While trying to get my camera in a better focus there was suddenly a flurry of large flashing lights on all sides of the original lights. The original 3 lights continued to stay in the same place in the sky for a few minutes more and then my camera ran out of memory.  The lights didn't do anything unusual after that but eventually just turned off abruptly.  After about  half an hour the lights came back on in the same location with one bright white light appearing and then 4 more gradually forming a straight line of lights.  They did the same large flashes of light and they appeared to move independently from each other. Lights were seen suddenly appearing and coming from the sides towards the row of lights.  This display lasted several minutes and then just like the first event they all went out like a light switch had been activated.

My whole family observed it and we wondered if it was the ISS passing over.  My son quickly checked on his phone and saw that the ISS was over the ocean.   We continued to observe what we presumed to be a satellite until it slowed, abruptly changed direction to the east, paused, then moved around quite erratically before coming to a complete and motionless halt.  After a few minutes, it moved to the east, and then turned north and came almost directly overhead.  It slowly moved back to the southwest and âparkedâ.  It stayed there and appeared simply as a star until we left and went home.  My son and I were so intrigued, we watched it the whole time instead of the fireworks. I wondered at first if it could be a drone and what we were observing was positioned lower in altitude than we initially perceived, but its peculiar movement, silence, and perfectly motionless âparking â for an extended period of time, make me think ânoâ.

I was outside of the truck and noticed a craft coming from the northwest and it flew directly over me and continued on in a southeast direction.   The craft was flying at maybe 1,500 hundred feet, and incredibly slow, and was completely silent.  The craft was shaped basically like a giant ruler, and had large square shaped lights on each side.

July 4, 2015.  My wife and I viewed groups of unusual red lights moving across the night sky over Novi, MI, and other areas of metro Detroit on July 4, 2015.  The sky was clear and the temperature around 78 degrees with the usual stars in the sky very clear and visible.  No planes overhead either.  The neighbors were firing off fireworks as usual for the Fourth of July holiday. Our Aunt, who lives in Westland, about 8 miles south of us, called at 10:17 PM on July 4, 2015, saying she was seeing strange red lights in the north sky moving slowly and methodically from west to east.  So we went outside and looked into the south-southwest sky and saw a strange looking red light in the form of an orb or circle moving slowly across the sky from west to the east.  Then about 6 more started appearing, one at a time, in the same sky moving from west to east.  They moved slowly and then eventually formed a ""C"" like formation, but about 3 minutes later they moved into a J like formation.  After another few minutes the lights started to move towards each other and then started fading two lights into one.  Each of the six lights in turn moved to the next highest in the sky and the two became one and then the next one left doing the same thing fading into the next highest red light until there was only one red light left.  When there was only one red orb left it slowly faded away without any sound or exhaust.  I even used binoculars but they just appeared to be a bright red light.  They did not have any shape like a plane or helicopter and there was no sound coming from these red orbs. After this first group faded out or basically travelled to the east out of sight we went onto our back deck and observed more of the same in the north sky.  The exact same thing happened that we observed in the front yard.  One at a time, travelling from west to east they were bright red until eventually forming another C formation that eventually morphed into a J like formation in the north-northeast sky.  After a couple of minutes one at a time they started flying slowly into the highest light and each in turn disappeared into it.  When only the one red light was left, it slowly faded away and then nothing else was seen in the sky anywhere.  After the fireworks were finished by 11 PM the red orbs had stopped showing up.  It seemed like the red orbs were somehow trying to react to the fireworks going off in the sky.  But the red orbs were much higher in the sky then any fireworks that were fired into the sky.  The red orbs by the way they were moving must have been under so! me kind of intelligent guidance.",2015-07-10T00:00:00,42.47510648648649,-83.47834486486487

Red/orange on top and bottom w/green lights in the middle.  Steady, then moved, then shot up and away. There were several people (friends and family) outside at several stages of inhibriation remaining from the 4th of July fireworks that ended 1/2hr prior.  The sky was overcast with some bright stars and, I believe, the constellation Sagitarius visible directly above.  I'm not sure of exactly which one, whatever, but I then looked NW along the ridge line, we live along the Kanawha River Valley, and saw the UFO. It was a bright red and orange egg-shaped object, no more than 2-5mi away, in a stationary position and that is when I went for my iPhone 5s and started to record video after all were in agreement that it was what I was seeing.  In the video you will hear a female voice describe its movement, but it remained in a still position for a few minutes and then headed along the ridge line toward us.  As it came closer I was able to notice the lights in the middle and they were a greenish color, the lights were extremely bright so it was hard to be certain of the middle color, but from there it appeared as if the top and bottom were disjointed leaving me to believe that it was also ""wobbling"" as it was in motion. After the motion it once again stopped for a few moments and I got a straight on look at it once again. It was now in a steady position as if it were ""checkin us out,"" and from there it headed straight upwards.  Now to explain the ""vanishing"" is kind of hard to detail due to it being night and also being unaware of the specific cloud cover, but I can only give two theories as to what I saw from there.  Regardless of clouds the lights were so bright that it would have been hard for the clouds to hide so much of it so easily right away.   What I saw is it looked like it dissipated as if it went through a ""worm-hole"" kind of like Einstein explained in his Theory of Relativity and the 4th plane or dimension.   I'm not a UFO enthusiast and I'm not college educated, but I am a Navy veteran and was taught attention to detail, so that is the basis for the recollectionâ¦",2015-07-10T00:00:00,38.6095,-81.9264

There were several planes in line to the north and northeast of me heading towards the Los Angeles airport.  And they was a police helicopter west of me; but what I saw south of me was not a plane nor helicopter.   It was not a Chinese lantern.  It was low, about the height of a police helicopter and was silent as far as I could tell.  It was traveling about the speed of a helicopter, but no noice coming from it.  For the first 10 seconds I could hear the police helicopter west of me and further away, but when the police helicopter flew further away, I could not hear it and could tell the object I was seeing was silent.  The object was closer than the police helicopter had ever been. What I saw was first heading about north, towards me.  It was a very odd color. No one looking at it could confuse it for the landing lights of a plane.  It wasn't solid yellow nor was it solid orange; but almost seemed light swirling parts of yellow and orange; mostly orange.  For just a few seconds, I thought a plane was on fire.  It then was moving eastward towards La Habra.  I am not sure if it turned, or if it was always moving in an arc.

The red light was not directly on top, but near the top.  It was not blinking, but a solid light.  The red light was much smaller compared to the yellow/orange light. The last 10 seconds of the sighting, as it was heading about east, I could see a very black tube-like craft.  This blackness, at least from my angle, did not reflect the city lights.  In this part of Los Angeles county, the sky is not pitch black due to so many city lights.  So the craft was darker than the sky.  I could not make out a shape for the black craft.  But I could tell that the craft was about twice the size of the yellow/orange light parallel to the ground and about the width of the light. And then then it just turned off.  First I thought, maybe it disappeared behind some haze, but no, I could see a few stars where it disappeared.",2015-06-24T00:00:00,33.90197022900763,-118.00775343511451

On July 5, 2015, (Sunday) at 4:30 PM CDT, my son and I were hanging up new flags on my flag post.  He was hoisting up the flags, so I was looking into the sky, watching them go up.   Much to my surprise, right in my line of sight, a UFO was passing overhead.  It was traveling from due South to due North at what appeared to me to be a very high velocity.  It was snow white with no visible markings or lights.  I had a very clear view of it before it disappeared out of my sight.  I could clearly see  it for about 5 to 10 seconds. If it was the size of a 747, I would estimate the altitude at 2500 to 3500 feet.  My gut feeling is that it was much  larger than a 747, and was at an altitude of at least 40000 feet.  It was traveling at an angle of about 70 percent from the plane of the earth.  At speed and angle traveling it looked like it was heading into orbit.   To our South was a large bank of white clouds - the north was deep blue clear sky and very clear visibility with no haze or air pollution.   After I have had time to reflect on it, I think it may have been cloaked white, while it was in the clouds, and not cloaked to blue in time not to be seen.  At rate of speed and angle of ascent, it could not have left the ground more than maybe 10 Miles South of my location. and there are no known airports or military base in that area, It had two short stubby wings in the front, about 10 to 15 percent from the front of the fuselage.  These apparent wings were only about 5 to 10 percent of the length of the fuselage.  Very short and nothing like I have ever seen before - almost like the were just stabalizers while in flight in the atmosphere,   The front of the craft was rounded like a normal plane,  The rear was also rounded  and only about 25 percent as wide as the front.  There was absolutely no tail gear on it that I could discern.

We had our windows rolled down, & though there were some fireworks noise, we didn't hear any noise from this orange object, though it went over/past us. After the fireworks ended, we got back on Hwy 23 heading north.  In about 5 miles, suddenly the orange glowing ball came from the east (which was Lake Huron side), & crossed the road ahead of us, flying west.  Then, two more came across, closer together.  A fourth one was back some distance, following the other 3.  We didn't see what the first ball did, but the 2nd & 3rd, after crossing the Highway a short distance, & where we could still see them above the trees, started to slow & then hover.  They waited until the 4th orange ball caught up & joined them.

It was so unusual that i called my son over to have a look.  \ As he did the red light seemed to have a bright white spotlight behind it.  The spotlight then gave way to the red light, starting the size of a speck, and ending even smaller.  Never bigger than a star in my eyes, faded gradually but steadily back into the night.   I tried to film such encounter but only voice feed remains.  I tried to stay calm, do the right thing.  But, what is the right thing?  What do i do now?  What does this mean for me, exactly?  What do i do?  I am excited to hear of ANY progress and was most certainly excited to get your call tonight.   Cant wait to hear from you again!

The main object appeared round, but seemed to have a significant electrical charge as the object had a surrounding cloud or sphere of charged particles that was roughly half the diameter of the moon with the brighter center portion being about as bright as Jupiter initially and comparable for relative  size from my vantage point.   It appeared to moving within the Aurora Borealis as the sky itself was clear, but the cloud of particles (assumed) is what made it distingly different as the visible stars and planets did not have that hazy appearance about them.   The center slowly faded in intensity at about the halfway point of it being visible, but the cloud remained illuminated of about the same color as the Aurora Borealis until it moved into a curtain of aurora as b! right as the object was.

While observing Northern Lights, we (2 people) saw a large oval shaped mass of what appeared to be clouds, moving slowly across the sky directly overhead.  It looked as if the âcloudsâ were surrounding something slowly moving through the sky but we were unable to see any specific object.   It was moving slower than a commercial plane and appeared to be at a high altitude.  No lights could be seen coming from the mass.  The mass was large, almost as if a spotlight was shining in the sky but there were no clouds in the sky to be observed.   It was moving in a very straight north westerly direction and eventually dissipated in the distance.    One thought was that something was reflecting down on the atmosphere from space, like a reverse spotlight, such as the space station but in checking online the space station was not in our area.

It was approximately 1000-1500ft AGL.  I was able to determine that it was airborne, and not on the ridgeline above the canyon.   As it came towards me, I was watching it intently and I thought it was actually a series of 4 closely spaced intense white lights, as if it were mounted on a light bar, but as it approached, the beam became so intense, while directed toward the ground, that I reflexively looked away to shield my eyes from the light.  As i looked back up, it passed above the roofline of the cab and I lost sight of it.   If this was an aircraft, it was operating in violation of FAA regulations, as it had no navigation lights visible.  I would estimate the speed to be comparable to a helicopter, which it may well have been.  The Army reserve has a helicopter unit in Pendleton, I believe, but they are required to fly with nav. lights on at night.  It's possible it was a utility company helicopter working on a powerline or something, but why no navigation lights?

My gut feeling was telling me this was all wrong.  It would have been a massive ship.   The other sighting was when I was camping with my Boy Scout troop at Skunk Cabbage on an overnight hike.  We liked to go night hiking only using our flashlights when we had to.  On one of these hikes, we whitnessed a ball of white light descend into a canyon.  We walked to where we saw the light decend, standing on the edge of the canyon wall.  The light was there, shining down to the ground, the trees were lit up around were the light was shining and were swaying a bit like it was really windy where the light was.   What was weird was that there was no sound or wind where we were standing.   We all ran back to camp scared.  Our scout leader said it was probably a helicopter.  I never believed it was.

They went to opposite horizons, 'bounced' back next to each other and seemed to dance around each other, before shooting back up and out of sight. This happened very fast.  I remember well having enough time to say, ""Mom! MOM!"" and she said, ""I see it!""  And we had a few seconds left, silently staring at these things in disbelief.  They moved very quickly.   I also remember it being a clear day, and before the 4th of July, because I specifically remember watching fireworks thinking the whole time maybe that was it but nothing even remotely resembled these things, and there was no sound or the car we were in drowned out any sound there may have been.  I didn't want to check that they had a haze, but it may be worth mentioning they sort of glowed..  Like I said they were like balls of light. I was ten years old when this happened, my mother was just a stay at home mom.  But I remember that day very vividly and have always wanted a chance to tell someone experienced with these things in hopes of finding out exactly what those light things were. My father was in the air force, and his father in the navy..  When I told them this they said they must have been flares until I described the way they moved and how quickly..  Both swore flares do not behave that way. I did have two experiences since that definitely took me back to that day, but neither compared to this incident.

Black discoid object flying from E to W, observed early afternoon from residential roof top during clear sky over north side St. Louis city, Mo.  No wings, no lights, just steady trajectory across sky until out of view over western horizon.  There were many local black birds in the windy sky directly over neighborhood, but none at ufo's altitude.   It wasn't moving at extreme speed, but should've at least been traveling a few hundred mph due to the lack of time it took to cross the entire visible sky over head.  It was gone in at least 10 seconds after gracefully soaring right across the open sky.   I thought it was a big black bird (or hawk possibly) sailing a high wind current at first, but as I watched without distraction it never exposed any wings or showed any obvious biological identifiers or movements.  From my visual perspective, the ufo flew in a straight line at a steady speed.  I was not a gigantic object, but couldn't have been any smaller than a car.  No identifying marking or designs, at least from my distance.   While watching I tapped on window to attract my nephew, but he had just left the house.  My wife came by, but didn't come on roof as she was preoccupied and I still wasn't sure what I was witnessing.   I reluctantly did not pull my cell phone out quick enough to access the camera once I realized i was witnessing an anomaly.  As soon as it disappeared over the western horizon, I went back inside + informed my wife why I had nocked on the window.

That account took place about 2 years ago, the same week my step son took pictures of an entire mass fleet of glowing orb like ufos moving out across the night sky from an unknown location he witnessed with many other residents at his fathers previous apt complex way out in O'fallon, Mo.  We still have the picture he took with his cellphone.  There were no other airplanes in sky, as usually there are as we are under the direct path all airplanes take to taxi Lambert Airport.  The ship also did not glow or perform any other apparent actions/activities. These accounts are  astonishing even if they are all just drones or black military vehicles.  They are apparently becoming more obvious publicly. I am an US military veteran.  As a child I studied all kinds of jets, vehicles + technologies into my adult life.  In the field of creative arts I have also studied much structure, anatomy and behaviors of many things.  I am extremely positive I have witnessed these specific anomalies + anticipate more disclosure +/or public observations.  Hopefully, I could not have been the only one who witnessed this last event.  You never see this stuff over the city, ever.  I've been waiting to see them for myself a long time, but am not convinced these are directly alien, even though I do not rule out the possibility due to all cultural histories.",2015-06-19T00:00:00,38.62382493417588,-90.30852769878884

We could faintly see it moving higher as the station was approaching its position.  It seemed to pulse as it was rising.  It was dimmer in luminance then a satellite would be, and then was not visible, then flashed and continued rising. Once the ISS passed the position of the flashes, we stared at the sky, but could no longer see the light.  I scrambled it hit the shutter button again to take another photo.

I knew they were not planes because they were not moving and you could not see the outline of a airplane as you could will the other planes flying by.  I watched them until we went down hill and they were covered by the tree line.   About 1 minute later, I could see back over the trees.  Both objects had disappeared from the place I had just seen them.  Thinking it was nothing, I returend looking out my window to the east.

It looked like I giant star, bigger than any star or planet I have ever seen In the night sky.   My mother looked out the front windshield and saw a second large star like object.  That was when we knew it was not a planet or star because it was so large and it kept getting bigger.   This is the point where I started to cry because I relized what I was looking at.  About 30 seconds after the second shape was seen my mother watched the shape to the east get smaller and smaller and I wached the north shape get smaller and smaller until they were both gone.

At 10:33pm I saw a faint satellite coming from the NW and heading SE.  Since most satellites I see usually are flying either N-S, S-N, E-W or W-E; I guessed it was probably the International Space Station.   As it got closer to being almost directly overhead, I noticed there was not just one light, but a second light traveling the same path and speed.  The second light was the leading light and was dimmer.  At an arm's length, the 2 lights were only the width of my thumb apart.   I checked the time when I saw the 2 lights.  It was 10:33pm.  I went inside and checked the ISS TRACKER web page, and sure enough, the space station had passed by San Diego at that time.   I have seen the space station pass overhead several times, but this was the first time I saw another craft by the space station.   I checked the NASA web page, and there was a Russian space craft docked with the space station earlier in the day.  In fact, they had a planned and successful space burn earlier in the day to change the space station orbit.  The article I saw did not mention if the Russian space craft that was docked at the space station was planned to undock yesterday.   Maybe someone else can figure out when or if the Russian space craft left the space station before my sighting.   Anyway, I have pasted part of the NASA article that was posted on June 18.  The International Space Station got an orbital boost this morning after a docked Russian re-supply craft fired its engines for four minutes and eight seconds.  One more re-boost is scheduled for July 10, when the station will be at the proper altitude for a new Soyuz crew to dock at the end of July.  The crew onboard the orbital laboratory conducted a wide array of experiments today looking at such things as radiation, liquid crystals and life science.   The trio of station residents also continued more eye checks with assistance from specialists on the ground.  One-Year crew member Mikhail Kornienko participated in the Matroyshka and RADI-N studies monitoring space radiation and exploring how it affects station crew members. 6055 : 08 : 39 : 00 Station Time in Orbit  Benefits to You NASA Astronauts Headline Public Events in Washington Area.

On 6/19/2015 at approximately 4:45pm I was driving northbound on US 19 in Clearwater.  Event occurred during the duration of time it took to drive between approximately Drew Street up to SR. 580. I noticed a single light grey-almost white craft flying very fast from east to west, very high in the sky.  Gauging by its position in the sky, it appeared it could have been over Palm Harbor/Oldsmar area. Initially mistook as a high altitude aircraft heading to Tampa Airport, when it started glowing extremely and unnaturally bright for approx. 5 seconds, as the bright light dissipated, it resumed a more normal greyish looking oval craft.  During the brightest part, it looked more circular in shape. Even in daylight, it was extremely bright. A few seconds later I noticed a translucent dark haze appeared to materialize and grow around the craft.  It was perfectly oval around the craft, and much larger than the craft.  The growing dark haze around the craft started losing transparency, and the craft became more obscured and very dim to see. The dark haze around the craft moved with it at the same rate of speed.  There was no contrail from the craft, nor did the surrounding haze have a contrail, say as smoke would if an engine blew on an airplane.  The craft became very difficult to see due to the thickening dark haze surrounding it, and when it flew into a nearby cloud, it did not come out. Less than a minute later, an actual high altitude airplane (appearing to be) heading for Tampa airport flew on what appeared a very similar flight path.  It had a contrail, when it banked, I could clearly make out airplane wings, unlike the craft preceding it. It also appeared to be flying at a much slower rate of speed than the first object.  The airplane appeared to enter the same cloud as the first craft, but it came out the other side, whereas the first craft did not exit the cloud on the other side. I am unsure if anyone else saw this.  I was driving on US 19 in the construction areas, and when I was able to pull over, it was gone.",2015-06-19T00:00:00,27.962023177842564,-82.7516170553936

(This was previously reported years ago and it is shown incorrectly in your database as occurring on 7 January 1980, rather than correctly on 7 June 1980.  Please revise.)   I was part of a group having lunch at a Wendy's restaurant with 8 others.  I was a local college student.  One man had his Ph.D. in history.  Two were recent high school graduates with one of them to enter MIT 2 months later.  The others were high school students who though they watched the UFO, didn't seem at all much interested in what was happening. The restaurant was in a shopping center parking lot on the south side of I-240, facing north, about 150 feet due east of South Pennsylvania Avenue.  I and three others were positioned inside at the table next to the window facing north.  The others in our group were scattered towards the middle of the dining room. The weather was above 90F with a clear blue sky and a stiff southerly wind blowing between 20 and 30 mph.  This location was directly between Will Rogers International Airport 3 miles to the west/southwest and Tinker Air Force Base about 7 miles to the east. The professor at my table looked out the window and said: ""Look at that!""  We looked up and out the window to the north across the frontage road and the highway to see a floating object just on the other side of the highway.  It was hovering about 25 feet above a field and no more than 200 feet due north of us.  The field to the north side of the highway was at least a 20 acre vacant field with houses on the north side of the field, Pennsylvania avenue on the west side, and the I-240 highway on the south side.  The field nowadays has been built up with several businesses.  Many cars sped along the highway, and I didn't notice one car slowing down to look at the object. The object was easy to size relative to the cars speeding by and was a football shaped, titanium colored metallic appearing ""egg shaped football,"" about the width of a stretch limousine, while not as tall.  Picture it in the proportion of a football with no visible means of propulsion engines.  It appeared to be morphing on the left and right side in a way that it was slightly narrowing and then lengthening.  The titanium colored skin appeared to be rotating on the horizontal axis and then next on the vertical axis.  All of this again while morphing in width from end to end.  I must say I have no idea exactly what it was as I've never seen anything like it. The object was, as I've stated, floating above the field in a stationary position while we commented on it.  The professor stated that this was the second time he had seen something like this as the previous sighting was many years previous when he lived in Springfield, MO.  He then was driving outside of town with another man and they saw a cigar-shaped object above their car.  No further information on that cigar object is available. Before continuing, the reader must understand that I was a builder and flier of radio control model airplanes and knew extensively all the particulars of aerodynamics.  I later after college worked for Boeing in Industrial Engineering and Manufacturing Research and Development. I first thought ""could this be a reflection in the glass?""  So, I cupped my hands around my face against the glass pane and it looked the same.  I then got up and went outside into the parking lot and it looked the same without any sound, other than the howling south wind.  I knew in no way could it be a balloon of any type with that wind howling as such and the object remaining stationary.   I next walked about 50 feet due west to get a different sight angle relative to the sun.  It looked the same.  I even waved at it to cross over the highway towards me!  It didn't move.   After about 1 more minute, it started slowly moving straight west parallel to the highway about 5 mph.  I went inside.  We watched it continue west about 150 feet until it got to Pennsylvania Avenue, and it curled to the north.  It traveled north on the east side of the street and started inclining at about a 2 degree ascent while gradually gaining speed.  I'd estimate it was eventually moving at nearly 60mph.  It continued straight north until it disappeared out of site over the city. Years later, I worked with many manufacturing techniques and materials at Boeing.  We manufactured titanium parts using a ""super plastic forming"" method for the V-22 Osprey and F-22 Fighter, which resulted in much the same appearance as I saw reflected in the outer skin of that UFO.  No skin seams or rivets - just one smooth continuous outer skin surface.  Another manufacturing method that comes to mind is the now popular 3-D printing.",2016-01-23T00:00:00,35.47186177914111,-97.52630349693251

Yesterday was really foggy in Colorado.  On my way back from Boulder, I saw at least 3 blocks from my house 3 red lights up in the sky but in a shape that would add up to the shape of a UFO.  I laughed at myself for thinking that but as I watched it it was going VERY fast for an ""airplane""  I thought it was a jet but the red spaced out lights made it look much bigger than that.  It was higher up in the sky and was traveling about (my guess) 6 or 7 times faster than an airplane.  The solid red lights started to blink rapidly and then rhe ""object"" literally went so fast to the right my eyes couldn't keep up with it.  It just ""BOOM"" flew to the right and was GONE.   I tried to search for some reasonable explanation for what this thing was.  It wasn't an airplane or jet so the only other thing I could think of was some sort of m! ilitary craft like those really huge ""silent bombers"" but where I saw this ""UFO"" is not anywhere near a military base.  And I gotta tell you (with my expierience living right next to a marine base) this did not move as fast as one of- what I saw.  So, to kind of wrap it up here, I do believe now that what I saw wasn't something that should have been seen, and I'm going to have a really hard time trying to unsee it.  But to make something clear, I think that there are oher planets out there- more- beyond our imagination, so maybe this thing that I saw is just an airplane to some normal people like us.

My one and only UFO sighting took place in Freeport, NY, on a mid-week evening around 7:15 in February of 1953, 1954 or 1955.  I was 10, 11 or 12 at the time.  It has been so long ago that Iâve forgotten some of the exact details.  Arbitrarily, Iâll say it was Wednesday, February 10, 1954, but it could have been a Thursday night or a Wednesday or Thursday during the following week or one year on either side.  I was alone walking south on Pennsylvania Ave. on my way to our church for choir practice.  It was a pleasant February evening - seasonally cold in the high 20s to mid-30s with no wind. As I was about to step off the curb and cross Lena Ave., I noticed a light, some distance down the street to my left.  It was about 800â east near where Lena takes a dogleg to the left.  The object seemed to be spewing a profusion of yellow-white sparks.  Two brothers around my age lived in a house on Lena just beyond my line of sight.  I quickly concluded that it was probably they who had just set off a rocket aimed straight down the street toward me.  I stopped and waited for it to approach. At roughly 120â from me, it became clear that it was not a common firework.  The object was a grey metallic rocket-shaped object about 6â to 8â long, 4â to 8â in diameter.  It had what seemed like small guidance fins at the rear, proportionally similar to the Redstone rocket of the day but possibly less pronounced.  A profusion of yellow-white sparks continued to issue from the object but the exhaust was not a focused blast like a rocket motor.  It most closely resembled the crude special effects of the lazy exhaust emitting from the fictional fleet flown by the forces of âMing the Mercilessâ in the 1940s Flash Gordon movie serials.  It was not silent.  The exhaust made a moderately loud sputtering sound at it passed.  This object was moving too slow â about 10-15 mph â to sustain flight. It flew directly down the middle of street about 20â-25â above the roadway.  It continued west past me, maintaining the same altitude and heading.  It passed closest to me at a distance I estimate at 25â to 30â.  About 400â west of Pennsylvania Ave., Lena Ave. begins to a long dip.  Rather than continue straight ahead on the same trajectory, one which I could have monitored for at least a half mile further, the object paralleled the curve of the road until it was out of sight at about 500â to 600â from where I stood. During this event, there were no vehicles moving along Pennsylvania and Lena in either direction.  After the object passed out of sight, I noticed a middle age woman walking south on the opposite side of Pennsylvania about a half block from Lena.  I called out to her asking if she had seen anything just then.  I donât recall whether she responded to my question or just ignored me, but in any event she didnât confirm my sighting.",,40.6489,-73.5825

At due north in the sky on 12/6 at 7:45PM, three people witnessed a bright glowing orange roundish object, approximately 30-45 degrees from horizon in the northwest sky.  Two minutes after first observing the object, it separated into two pieces, with the smaller piece at 5:00 relative to the larger.  The smaller piece dimmed after a few seconds of appearing and went out and the larger piece continued to glow orange.   After a few seconds, the larger object appeared to decrease in size and brightness.  Then the larger object dimmed and disappeared.  After a couple of seconds, it suddenly brightened to same original intensity and then after a second or two it dimmed back to a faint orange glow.  It then disappeared again.  While this was going on, a strong beam of light from the North East flashed from the ground toward the object.  This happened a couple of times for a period of a few seconds.   Within a minute of the orange object disappearing, in the same gener! al area, we then saw what appeared to be a white translucent jellyfish like object, which at first was traveling slowly in a due south path directly towards us.  It came almost directly overhead and it slowly took a north easterly path and continued to take that path until it disappeared from view.   All three of us got a good look with binoculars.  Under the binoculars, object was pale white, translucent, shape-shifting.  It looked like a jellyfish that can change its form. The shapes were not discernible, nor symmetric, almost like random shapes, but very broadly changed from being roughly spherical to more flat and back to spherical, with protrusions sometimes coming out.  Was very easy to see changing of shapes with the naked eye as well.   Seemed large maybe 50 to 100+ feet in diameter, but very difficult to say how large with any confidence.   The changing of the shape appeared to be unlikely due to wind alone (like a balloon) as far we could tell considering very low wi! nd speed (we looked online and there was a 4mph gust north eas! t wind). There was no wind we could feel (trees were completely still).  The object was changing shape much more quickly than what seemed possible due to wind alone.  Object also seemed to be moving noticeably faster in the northeast direction than what seemed possible by wind alone (although the low wind was blowing in the direction it disappeared from our view).   Estimated altitude, very difficult to say, no clouds for altitude reference, but probably between 1000â4000 feet.  Jellyfish-looking object disappeared from view after ~2 minutes of initially seeing it.   This witness testimony was written by all three witnesses within minutes of the event.   A cell phone video was attempted but could not get the objects in focus.",2016-01-05T00:00:00,37.705,-121.45771535947712

Very close to Drove was the so called ""Drover Heide,"" which is a large open area with a lot of heather and little birch tree groups. It used to be a military training ground for about 200 years and it was strictly forbidden to enter it ( it was also very dangerous because of old ammunition that was everywhere). At the other end of the Drover Heide was an American military base with the type ""Nike"" defense missiles. As kids we used to play on the drover heide and in the woods around it and when the military activity got less in the early '90's, I started to go searching on the drover heide first just for old musket lead balls, but later, I also started taking artillery and mortar grenades home (I used a cheap metal detector).  I then disarmed them and later blew the explosives up at night in the forest with some friends (just for fun and bragging rights). I know now that this was extremely dangerous and also illegal, but when I was 16, it was my hobby and important to me. One day I was searching at a dangerous spot again and heard a strange noise.  I could not tell exactly what it was and where it came from.  When I looked around I couldn't see anything. I thought it was possibly a vehicle from the military police so I got a little nervous.  It didn't really sound like a car however so I kept on searching. About 5 minutes later, two young men (maybe 20-25 years old) where standing about 10 meters away from me.  They where identical twins with short brown hair and also identical clothing (dark grey-black color).  Their clothing looked more like some type of uniform/ jogging suit.  They where about as tall as I was back then (6 feet). They both smiled at me and one asked me what I was doing.  I didn't want to tell them the truth so I told them that I was just looking for old musket bullets.  Then they smiled and walked away. Maybe I am just overreacting or paranoid, but I don't think that these 2 young men where normal humans.  I have never seen them afterwards again.

Log Roll Control had just call my target (wingman) it 45 degrees right, range 16 miles.  That was the approximately the maximum range the radar on the D could pick up another fighter, and as my search mode was trying to acquire my wingman I saw a very strong return at 8 miles between my target and me and locked my radar onto it.  My radar showed the ""target"" showed my true airspeed and no movement.   I asked Log Roll if they had this object on their radar and they said they did.  I asked them if it was not unusal to have an object sitting still at 30,000 ft and they said it had drifted up there from below 10,000 ft and they thought it was not normal.  The object although showing a very strong return was not visible in the clear air.  My wingman also picked the ""object "" on his radar.   I flew towards it until about 1 mile and then pulled left towards the West to avoid hiting this object, I could not see, into 90 port and 270 fight turn with my Wightman having joined up on me in loose formation I locked on to the object again and at about 8 miles and it immediately lite up in a light green color that I could see through.  It was approximately 100 ft high and 50 ft wide with its top and bottom both rounded off roughly in the shape of a football.  We both saw it and when we got about 2 miles from it my radar overtake went from my true airspeed to a 1300 kt undertake.   I selected when efull power and the object still lit up pulled away.  At about 8 miles out it stopped instantly and did an immediate turn straight down.  I followed it until about 15,000 and pulled out to avoid hitting the ground.  We were about out of fuel at this point so we recovered at nearby Erding AFB and after getting refueled and getting airborne again Log Roll Control sent us home to Phalsburg AFB, France and our 513 th FIS.  They told is they had several other fighters under their control and did not need us. Several controllers watched this on their radar including a General officer, (I believe it was BG Stuart.). I was contacted several years later by a British author, on my home phone, who asked me question about the incident and he told me that he had also investigated another incident like this over England 6 weeks earlier. I have never heard this incident judged, explained or discused. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",,,

It was the inaugural year of Nosker House, my dorm in the newly opened north complex of residence halls.  He lived on the first floor of Drackett Tower, to my north, and on the west side of his building.  Although we had phones in our dorm rooms, they were only able to access in-house phones.  To call outside the dorm we had to use the phones located in the stairwell, mine was on the west side of the building. So here is my report. As I was waiting for my buddy to answer his phone - located in his room and able to access in-house and out-of-house calls â I looked up and saw four jets flying in a diamond formation.  I was intrigued by these jets as they flew east to west and were at an attitude of about ten-thirty as seen out my stairwell window.  I donât know their altitude, but they were way up there!!!  No wings could be defined, but I had often seen jets (probably military since commercial aircraft donât fly in formation) flying at this altitude.  As soon the phone was answered, I immediately asked, âHey look out your window, can you see those four jets up there?""  I planned to give him more information as to their being a bit to the north, and quite high. In the time that it took me to utter those few words, the lead craft hit the accelerator and completely flew to the end of my visible horizon and out of my scope of visibility.  We are talking hundreds (?) thousands (?) of miles based on the altitude.  The three remaining jets continued at a snailâs pace, although I am sure they were travelling at a high rate of speed - for them.  There was no contrail, no noise heard - no deviation of direction, just an incredible display of speed like I had never seen before, or since - and that was 48 years ago.

March 1980, my husband and I were on the way to the Rocky Mountain Siberian Husky Club specialty in Denver, when we stopped for gas in Colorado Springs.  It was dark, early evening when we stopped, and I was on the right side (passenger) of the car pumping gas. My husband went in to use the restroom and pay for the gas. I saw a silver, round, disk craft come into view.  The only lights it had were the row of windows that went around the middle of the craft.  It sort of floated into view as I stood there staring at it, and I remember that I was surprised that no one else seemed to see it.  It made no noise and came from the north.  It was traveling so slowly that I got a good long look at it. As it got closer to being directly in front of me, I saw a âbeingâ standing in one of the windows. It was almost as tall as the window and seemed to be looking right at me.  I looked around again to see if anyone else was looking and they were not.  When it got directly in front of me, it gently turned and floated off to the east and disappeared off into the distance. End of story. Winter 1986, my husband was running our sled dogs up on U S Hill, southeast of Rancho de Taos.  It had been a mild winter and we had to go high to find enough snow to run on.  We were on our way back in, I was on, âGus the Beast,â snowmobile, and I was stopped on the north side of the mountain, just down from about 10,000 ft.  I was in the shade, sitting on the snowmobile, enjoying the peace and quiet, waiting for the team to catch up to me (I would go out in front to pack trail and be there just in case of an emergency of some kind.)  I was looking out towards Wheeler Peak when I felt a shadow go over me.  I looked up, thinking that I would see a raven â they would follow the team and often came in ahead of them â but instead, I saw a military aircraft, painted in camouflage, drifting down the valley towards Wheeler Peak.  There was NO NOISE!  It, just like the UFO in Colorado Springs, just floated away until it was out of sight. Looking at photos of aircraft, I think I must have seen the Rapture. That is as close as I can come to naming it. End of story  May 1968 I was going to The University of Albuquerque and my boy friend and I were going back to campus from a ball game near the Rio Grande Zoo.  We were on Central Avenue when I looked over towards the Country Club area, and saw a silver cigar shaped something in the sky.  I looked away and when I turned back, the trees blocked the sky.  It was a ways away, and not very big.  I doubted if I had really seen something. End of Story ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Suddenly the clouds got very bright white in a large area and a round white shining object came out and flew into the ruhr river valley in an angle of about 45 degrees (very fast).  For a second I thought it was some kind of shooting star that happens to hit the ground a few miles in the river valley. But just before it hit the ground, it suddenly changed direction and was coming directly towards us.  It didn't take more than 1 second for it to fly the approx. 1.5 miles from the spot it changed direction. Not far away from us (shortly before it hit us), it suddenly dissolved into nothing.  Everything happened very quickly and I was so shocked that I wasn't even able to tell my friend.  I didn't even tell him afterwards about it because I was afraid he would think that I was insane.

Awesome! I was standing on an open porch of a house (339 fifth Ave West, North Bay, Ontario) facing the street (northeast) at dusk (partly dark) with my friend  having a cigarette.  My brother at this time was in the house in a room directly behind where John and I were standing separated by a large window..  I was chatting with john (both of us facing east) when a brightly lit object flew/shoot directly overhead of us passed through several clouds and cleared the northeast horizon within about 2 seconds, leaving a light tracer similar to a shooting star. John and I had both seen this at the exact same time and turned to each other (still facing east). John said with a bewildered look on his face âI guess we just seen a shooting star ??â  About 5 seconds later what appeared to be the same object (with the same speed, light tracer and seemingly within the same flight path in reverse) came back from over the northeast horizon traveling now southwest bound. Almost Â½ way across the sky it instantly stopped on a dime and hovered there and drifted slowly for about 10 seconds. It then instantly accelerated and started making erratic random 90 and 30 degree turns in every direction without slowing. I recall about 5-7 turns in total within about 10 seconds all within a small local vicinity of where it had initially stopped and hovered. On the last turn it stopped and hovered for about Â½ a second then instantly shoot itself over the northeast horizon within a second, again with the same speed, light tracer and within the same flight path in which we had initially seen the object. All of this occurred without a sound. We lost sight of the object over the northeast horizon. My friend, my brother and I were absolutely ecstatic and bewildered after the sighting (it being our first confirmed). Not only were we first hand witnesses to a genuine, unmistakable UFO sighting (one of technological nature) but we were witnesses of a very rare, clear sighting one in which the object clearly violated known laws of physics. All without making a sound. We were very lucky, what were the odds of us being at the right place at the right time. You never forget something like that. I have searched UFO sighting videos ever since this sighting and have only found a few that even compare. I can honestly say I have witnessed something most will likely never get see first hand. Unfortunately at the time none of us had a camera or phone and weren't able to capture it. I also regret that I and or we had not reported it or documented it, exact time and date etc.. At the time I was concerned about the nature of the sighting; occurring in military airspace not to mention d! irectly under the nose of NORAD. I regret letting fear and circumstances at the time deter me from stepping forward. Notes:  -Within the 10 seconds in which the object was hovering I frantically banged on the window to the room in which my brother was in and screamed at him to come out on the porch to see the object. He then quickly came onto the porch and witnessed everything that proceeded. There was an older woman in the room where my brother was that had seen the tail end of the sighting through the window. I cannot confirm exactly how much she seen. We talked about reporting it to NORAD after the sighting but we quickly decided not to out of  fear. I had stayed the night at this address. The next day around 1:00 pm two officers in dress attire came to the house asking about an apparent robbery in the area. Initially seeing them at the door made me very suspicious considering.. My brother and I sky watch whenever we get a chance. Its now almost an automatic habit. I will submit illustrations and maps asap.

The ""V"" was a perfect formation of other interlocking ""V's.  I saw what I believe was the outline of this object.  As mentioned, it hesitated as if seeing me there in the shadows of the garage surprised it. It was slightly tipped upward, as a jet would be when taking off.  It seems to elevate quickly w/little forward movement and started to move forward.  My next thought was Oh Oh it's going to hit the maple tree (A huge tree!)....I heard a soft ""whoosh"" of air, felt no air movement.  Disbelief when it went right ! through the maple tree,  I ran and saw it briefly reappear, on the other side of the tree, it was still tilted upward and moved faster then I could follow it.  It then dissapeared from my view. Noticed no lights.  Basically, the outline was interlocking ""V"" formations, repeative chevrons/boomerange forms.  It was not that large, perhaps 30ft wide at its widest, and equal in length from it's tip to mid-span end.  The ""V's"" were or seemed to be a matte black, not shiney.

We both saw a bright orb/ufo flying low from the west.  When it reached the ocean, it went upward at increased speed.  It kept going up until we could no longer see it. 3.  On two different occasions, when there was a full moon, we saw an array of lights at ocean level.  They must have been only a mile or so out.  They were different colors and some were moving back and forth and around.  It was like no kind of ship that I know of. It lasted for 20 to 30 minutes and only in one spot. 4.  Two UFOs, lights, were moving overhead toward each other.  We would assume they were at the altitude of a satellite.  They stopped.  One got very bright and then became a thin line with a ball of light at the end.  Then it was gone.  It could be compared to a 'warp jump' from space shows.

Please read. This occurred many years ago and had I known I would have shared my story here. Believe me if you would like to or not, but I am blessed to have witnessed such cosmic wonder and mystery. My friend and myself went to pick up another friend at his house. We exited the vehicle and I, being an amateur astronomer, took notice of the sky (It was a clear night as I observed Orion) as we waited for him to open his side door.  Minutes later he emerges and we walk back to the car, approximately 60 feet around a corner to a dead end where we had parked.  A cigarette is smoked along the way and we wait outside the vehicle until it has been finished. It was at this moment when a sudden, intense flash of light was produced with no noise.  Akin to a lightning bolt when you are near the center of a severe storm, except much stronger.  The whole area was illuminated as if it was day for a brief second.  We looked at each other since we were spooked. I looked skywards and saw what was a small cloud growing larger slightly above our heads at the level of a very low cloud. It changed color from gray to blue to a dark green/purple to yellow and back to gray.  As it grew in size, there were small orbs or spheres of light moving inside of this cloud; they would never hit each other and would disappear inside the cloud. As the cloud grew in size, more of these orbs appeared.  Within the cloud there were small lightning bolts that would appear, never hitting the orbs. It grew to a considerable size above us in a matter of a few seconds before out of sheer terror and my grasp of physics/reality turned upside down that I collapsed to me feet trying to hide on the side of the car.  I stared up again and it was gone. My friend who also frequently stayed out at night hours for considerable amounts of time also reported seeing a flash of light and colors in the sky in that direction.

I have waited several years to report what I saw mostly because I didnât want people to think I am crazy.  But after finally telling a friend, then my brother and they believed me.  I have decided to go ahead and let you know what I have seen. We had just moved into a rental home Feb 2013 the backyard backs up to the woods.  I was sitting on the back porch area and it was approximately 6 pm.  At first I noticed shimmering up in the tree line approx 6 feet above the ground and I thought how odd it was like something was in front of the tree blurring it but shimmering. As I continued to stare at it all of sudden I saw the outline of an alien being.  I believe I was not suppose to be able to see it that the device that was suppose to make him invisible was not working properly or it just happened to be in the light just the right way.  It was an alien soldier.  He was not completely visible but I could clearly make out his form and face.  He was climbing something that I think was either a rope or stairs (this was completely invisible) but I could see by his movements that he was holding onto something and was using whatever it was to climb.  He kept looking around like a soldier would to make sure that he was not going to be shot at or hunted.  He was well formed muscular about 6â3 or 6â4, Iâd say easy 200 lbs.  His jaw was very pronounced and squared his eyes were very round and protuded.  His face was almost skeletal looking but again I was only seeing an outline, as I believe he was supposed to be invisible. I think he knew it wasnât working by the way he was looking around making sure he was not going to be attacked.  I was afraid to move for fear he would see me and realize I could see him.  I kept pretending to look down whenever he looked over towards my direction.  He was not moving fast as he was still climbing so I was able to watch him a good 10 minutes.  As it became a little darker I was no longer able to see him but could see the shimmering of what I believe was still him in the tree line approximately 30 feet up and now to the far left.  Then he disappeared altogether.  I did not hear or see a spaceship and he never made a noise.  I hear a lot about these little gray aliens but I can assure you this was no little gray alien this was a very dangerous looking alien.  Not something I would want to ever have to deal with in a war.  I did not see any weapons but again he was not fully visible and to be honest I was pretty scared and stunned at what I was seeing.  I wish I we! re an artist and could draw you a picture.  I did not attempt a photo I did not want it to know I could see it.   Do you know if anyone else has ever seen one similar to this, in a way it would be comforting to know that Iâm not the only one.",2015-10-29T00:00:00,28.25503467261905,-81.42949196428572

My friend had picked me up at LAX and we were driving eastbound along the 10 freeway.  It was about 2 - 2:30 in the afternoon on a Friday and traffic was rather heavy and slow moving.  We were maybe going 30 mph.  I was in the passenger seat and suddenly noticed two black triangular craft perhaps 1,000 feet up  and a bit to the south (to my right seen through the passenger window which was rolled down). Initially I thought that they were stealth aircraft, but what struck me later is that I didn't hear the sound of jet engines.  My friend and I may have had the radio on, but it wasn't loud because I distinctly recall interrupting him in the middle of a conversation to point out the objects.  They were also flying very close to one another.  From my vantage point, they seemed to be almost touching.  I don't recall any specific physical details apart from the basic triangular shape. The craft were heading east and moved forward into a position where my friend could also see them through the windshield.  Suddenly they seemed to accelerate and within a few seconds (less than 5) they were gone.

At approximately 4 am pacific time my brother was driving home from work on I-205 south near the I-84 east exit.  He ran into some traffic and came to a complete stop.  While he was stopped, he decided to pull out his cell phone and take a snapchat video of the horrible traffic to send to his friends.  He took the video, and when he went to review it, noticed that he had caught a strange light in his caption.  I should mention that he is taking this video from inside his car.  His view is looking over the interstate, and an overpass is approximately 1/4 of a mile ahead.  In the video, just a few seconds after the it starts, a bright almost neon blue light streaks down from the upper left of the video screen.  As the light falls from the sky it disappears for a second, then reappears only to come to a complete stop.  It appears that the light is just beyond the overpass 1/4 of a mile ahead.  At the same time this blue streak stops, it lights up and flashing lights rotate in a circular! direction around the ""craft"".  The craft then drops very 'mechanically' or abruptly and continues to flash sporadically until the video ends. I should mention that i have a copy of this video on my computer.  I will send it to you if you want.  Since its a cell phone video, the quality isn't the best, but you can plainly see what I'm describing when you watch it.

A few moments later, looking at the same portion of the sky, I saw what looked like a short meteor trail at a very shallow angle.  Then that light streak went out and a second later I saw another bright flash in the area where the meteor streak had ended.  I mentioned this to my friend and she looked in the same section of the sky and said she saw a bright flash followed by another bright flash and detected a very faint streak going towards the area of the flash. I saw these flashes too, but did not detect the faint streak.  I then called my husband out and he watched for a few minutes.  He observed a light flashing on and off, very slowly, heading ESE towards the west.  During this time there was no aircraft noise. The lights my friend and I saw did not travel in a straight line, rather they appeared then disappeared in a small area of the sky. There seemed to be several objects--perhaps 3 or 4. The lights were unusual. I checked several on-line satellite tracking sites and could not find any known craft over my area at this time. What we observed was not the navigation lights of a plane; I don't believe it was flares or sky lanterns.

Brandt Lane returning home from shopping at the Fred Meyer, and as they were approaching the pedestrian walkway that cuts into the Foxtail Estates Development, suddenly they visually sighted a UFO appear approximately 50 meters in front of them at approximately 50 meters above ground level from due East crossing over the top of S. Bergman Way.  The UFO stopped in midair approximately 50 meters above and in the vicinity of the house located at 3266 S. Fox Leash Avenue.  The UFO was silent and did not make any noise as it approached and then stopped in midair and remained in a stationary position for approximately 45-60 secondsâ¦silent.  The UFO appeared dark in color; approximately 12-15 meters wide by 3-4 meters in height.  The UFO had a green position light on the left side and a green position light on the right side.  There appeared to be a smaller red light approximately in the middle of the UFO. The UFO appeared to have âseenâ my wife and mother-in-law, stopped its forward movement, and for approximately 30-45 seconds they had the experience that the UFO was âlookingâ at or âobserving"" them. The two green position lights on the UFO suddenly shined down directly at them as if it was trying to light them up. The red light in the middle of the UFO remained on and visible while the two green position lights beamed down on them.  My wife described the feeling ""like two deer caught in the headlights,"" frozen in place in fear and thinking that âthey were going to get shot by the UFO!!â  They did not know what to do, did not know what the UFO was, but it was definitely NOT a helicopter, airplane, or any other machine that either of them had ever seen or heard about before.  Then suddenly, the UFO flipped over (it did not turn around or maneuver, it âflipped over...with the bottom on top.â), and simultaneously emitted a strange noise as it departed which sounded like a combination of ""a computer-g! enerated Star Wars R2-D2 sound, a rubbing metal-on-metal sound, and screeching cats sound"" â¦ flying away suddenly and quickly (in the same direction that it had appeared) in an easterly direction.

It was a perfectly clear night and I was outside getting ready to light up a cigarette when I noticed an odd dimly lit light in the sky to the northeast just over the neighbors tree line, then it became clear that there were more lights in formation next to it on both sides.  It was very hard to see at first, but as they approached in the sky I could tell they were all part of one object.  Some of the stars were brighter than this object, but as it got closer, I could tell that each one of these lights were bigger than airplane or helicopter lights.  The lights almost gave off a yellowish orangish glow, unlike traditional lights and each light with my best guess were somewhere between 3-5 feet in diameter.  There were no blinking lights.  It was moving at a slow speed and I'm not a good judge of altitude but I would say it was 7,000 to 10,000 feet above the ground traveling from North east to South west.  As it passed almost directly overhead I could finally make out the body of the craft. It was black and was shaped like a V but at 90 degree angles. Nothing in the middle of the craft like the extra diamonds on the stealth bomber.  It was literally a V. As it passed overhead I knocked on the window to call my wife to come out, and stumbled to the back yard to watch it for about 3-4 more seconds before it was gone over the rooftops. It never picked up speed, and it looked like it almost glided over the air.  The object I saw that night never made a sound.  I have 20/20 vision and If I wasn't looking directly at it, I would've never noticed it.  It's almost like it didn't want to be seen.",2015-10-29T00:00:00,39.869197777777785,-105.04200666666667

The large round light craft began moving horizontally across moving towards Corona and the Geomerer Ranch where the windmills sit upon the mesa.  As I watched in my rear view mirror and side mirrors, the red lights on the windmills went out as the craft passed.  The craft was on the floor of the valley as the windmills are on the top of the mesa. I had a lost amount of time while watching this craft.

It mostly consisted of a well defined orange coloured corona with what looked like a moving electrical discharging orange light in the center. There were no flashing lights and no sound at all.  The corona had a very defined edge and was not a glow or flaring.  The corona it self was giving off light and gave the appearance that the craft was flying/floating in an orange coloured self illuminating bubble.

I fumbled with my cell phone, but by the time I got it to record, both craft were to far away to make out details.  My video only shows a black screen with two points of light. The coronas where quite large in comparison to the center object and there seemed to be a darkened area or ring between the center and the corona. These craft were not moving very fast.  Possibly 200-400 MPH. An incident occurred about 1-2 weeks prior.  There were fighter jets flying over our neighborhood at low altitude and were going towards the direction that these two craft came from.  They were extremely loud.

October 18, 2015	 	I was outside and took note of the number of aircraft I could see in my field of view was unusual.  Normally I only see 5-10 flashing beacons from aircraft at any given time, but this night I could count 20-30 and it was a very clear night.   As I watched the sky, I took note of a satellite moving overhead from south east to north west.  I was following the movement of the satellite and after watching it for 20 seconds or so, I noticed a blurry object to the left and at a lower altitude appear.  At first I thought it was a meteor entering the atmosphere and at any moment I would see a tail streak across the sky.  There was no tail, no streak, and seemed as though it was behind a cloud.  For a moment I thought that it could have been a reflection from another object on a layer of cloud cover.  However, this was not the case as I had noted that it was a very clear night and the amount of other celestial objects I could see was enormous.  The object was blurry to gray against the sky a! nd had a dim source of light surrounding it.  Almost as if it had its own cloud source or as if the sound barrier was broken for the constant duration. However there was no sonic boom associated with what I was seeing. There was no flashing beacon on it. It occurred to me that it may have been some sort of search light or landing light from another aircraft, but nothing else was near it and again it was very clear with not one cloud in the sky. It was moving in the exact opposite track of the satellite from north west to south east.  It was moving at a very high rate of speed as I could only follow it for about 8 to 10 seconds. I would estimate that the object's altitude was some where in the range of 15,000 to 20,000 ft. The space in which it was contained did not lead me to believe that it was assending or desending, it seemed to maintain its path.  I look up and watch the night sky as often as I can, I am very familiar with aircraft as I served in the USAF for 4 years and spent a considerable amount of time watching the aircraft on the flight line every night I was on duty.  This was not an aircraft that I was used to seeing.  I repeated to myself over and over as I watched the object ""what is that??!!"" and then "" what the !*$% is that???.""  I was floored because I had never seen anything like it before and it made my hair stand as chills rippled through.  It followed a very straight and direct path and was moving faster than anything I have ever witnessed.",2015-10-29T00:00:00,41.13432265193371,-81.85594309392266

As I am sitting next to the large picture window, I looked out between the blinds to see 2 small reddish-orange lights moving off to the west, followed by a helicopter with a red & green solid, non-blinking lights. As they were approaching from the city center area of Tucson, I was able to see a dark shape around the red & green lights, showing the shape of the helicopter, with the city glow directly behind it, but I saw no dark shape around either of the small red-orange lights that would determine the approximate size or shape of the craft it was attached to.  Also, the distance between the 2 red-orange lights was slightly larger than the distance between the 2nd red-orange light and the helicopter lights and the 2 red-orange lights were offset, with the first one slightly more north than the 2nd one, but the helicopter lights were in a straight line directly behind the 2nd red-orange light. I distinctly heard one helicopter noise, not several.  As the noise was louder than I can ever remember hearing at this location, as well as the fact that the green & red helicopter lights were large, I believe the helicopter was flying low in the sky as it went directly over my house. I do live near a small airfield called Ryan Airfield, which is 2 to 3 miles southwest of my location, so I am used to seeing small prop planes and small helicopters flying over this area, but never that low or loud.   These lights were not going towards Ryan Airfield to the SW, but almost directly west, maybe slightly north of directly west.   I, on occasion, have also seen military planes and helicopters flying over this area, as we do have both an Air Force base and Air National Guard base located in Tucson, but they never fly this low, and usually are in groups of 3 or more.   With these helicopter groups, it almost sounds like an echo from multiple rotors, but I didn't hear that echo on this occasion. I wrote down the description of this occurrence immediately after it happened, so the details were fresh in my mind. On a separate note, in the 9 years I have lived in this house, maybe 8-10 times I have heard a loud sonic boom type noise that rattled my house to the extent that on a few of these occasions, I ran outside to see if a car had run into my house.  I used to write these sonic boom noises to military aircraft, but as I have heard reports of these noises on Coast to Coast AM, I am not so sure of that hypothesis, especially since I have never witnessed an aircraft to accompany these loud banging noises.  Most of these booms happened during daylight, as several woke me up since I work graveyard shift and sleep usually from sunrise to early afternoon.",2015-10-29T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

To note it was not as high as the usual planes in their flight paths.  It was probably about 5000' (+-)(not good on judging but knew it was isn't flight path of other planes)   When I came back with binoculars my daughter said it didn't leave area but seemed to slow down and turn towards the ocean(Atlantic)..  We could see it with binoculars but could not make out a shape...when it got from direct sight we could see that it had 2 lights like a car and in the middle was the blinking light that we had saw being 'dragged', so we determined that the light ! in front was like a 'head light'.  It was dark object with a barely visible square shape.  I mentioned to my daughter that it resembled a car or a bus...as the 2 lights in the rear made me think of it that way. It may have been as big as a School bus.... The object slowly went out of sight over the tree line and we could not see it anymore....in the same time we watched it ...regular planes kept flying by on their Northern path.

Which, I cannot see the sky clearly to the east, south, or north, here, due to heavy forestation here.  However, to the west we are on the shore of a large hundreds of acre's lake.  There the sky is of course, wide open, and one can see the southwest sky, western sky, and northwestern sky. This day, 10-21-15, the craft's sound, jumping around, and seemingly circling, circling to the east, then after jumping, circling again to the southeast, it seems (like it is looking for something), it passes flying one direction away across the southern side of the lake.  This day, 10-21-15, I went out again hearing this thing, and could see nothing until, hearing it proceeding west over the southern side of the lake, I went to the lakeshore, still seeing nothing, I began snapping pics of the sky at random, with my Cannon Powershot Camera, and later discovered the craft pictured, in one photo.  I cannot post directly online from my camera and this pic is a retake of the LED Screen of my camera using the ipad camera, and that pic, is filed with this report.  The thus, enlarged, ""v"" shape craft is then seen large (I estimate actual size at least that of a stealth fighter if not larger) though this craft was traveling west at an altitude of 5,000-10,000 feet I would guesstimate...  I have had this pic reviewed by an aeronautics electronics engineer familiar with most craft in the skies today, the opinion was this was not a known, man made aircraft.  I've not filed a report in some time (and do not, do so, with MUFON or any other UFO investigative or UFO reporting website) because there are some that have questioned why, I see so many unidentified craft in the sky both here, and more so, in Missouri previous to my move to my present location this summer.  Even Peter Davenport (Editor here at NUFORC), being a good investigator, has asked me on the telephone several times, this question, and I cannot answer it other than to say: I am open to the experience, accept this reality, and being deeply spiritual person, ""invite"" mentally/telepathically, in prayer like way, the experience's into my life, and of course, I do a lot of skywatching, all of which combined, most people, don't do.  This combination, has brought me hundreds of sightings 2010-2015, only a few of which, from in Holts Summit MO., I have reported here.  This craft however, being a daytime pic, and a decent shot of, even though somewhat blurry, was distinct enough, I felt it should be reported and thus, though it is likely to spark a fourth investigative call from Mr Davenport if posted, felt it should be reported to a wider audience.  I do not assert, that this is alien as I think some craft I have witnessed, are, but, this one, it certainly, is one thing: an Unidentified Flying Object ie; UFO.

It approached very fast again making me think it was a motorcycle.  The light was extremely bright as it approached and only took seconds to travel from way back behind me to a point just behind my car where I noticed that it looked to be about as large around as a basketball or perhaps slightly bigger and intensely bright white.  I was looking back and forth at the road in front of me and in my rear-view mirrors at the light expecting it to pass me when it just went dark.

My only explanation was that maybe a very thin cloud that I could barely see had frozen water inside the cloud and the moon that I could not locate was glaring moon light off of it.  There wasn't any wind almost and maybe the wind was moving about 12 MPH.  The reason why I think it wasn't frozen water in a thin cloud was why would it form a perfect circle.

The first occurance I was by myself and it was a very clear dark night.  I observed a light in the southeastern sky that appeared to be moving what I would call a curly q formation.  I tried to debunk what I was witnessing to be a satellite or just a star that maybe my mind was playing some optical illusions on me. I watched this object stay in the same exact part of the sky until about 430 am which was about when I dosed back off. I know it wasn't a satellite because as the nights sky continued to slip off to the west these object continued its dancing and swirling in the night sky that appeared to every once in awhile give off a red shot of light imi! nate from the bottom.  I couldn't make out any definitive shape or size.  Whatever it was it was very bright, very fast, and very high in the sky.  On Oct 22, I observed the exact same thing visually.  Only thing different this time is I had my son who is 7 awake at the exact same time I did do to vivid dreams.  My girlfriend was with me as well I'd had told her about my incident the week prior which she laughed off.  Not this time I awoke her and made her observe and confirm what I was seeing.  She was creeped out to say the least.  I observed the object for another hour maybe hour and a half before I slipped back off to sleep.  I tried taking pictures. All I got was some poor low quality dots on screen.  Tried using my hd camcorder but the object was just to far off to get a good focus.  Someone somewhere had to witness this as well.

As they get closer, you can hear their engines, see the strobes, and finally see the red and green navigation lights when they are directly overhead. Fifteen minutes ago, I was out in my yard when I saw what I thought was a light aircraft with its landing lights on approaching from the northwest.  The sky was partially overcast with wispy clouds.  The light seemed to be going at about the same speed as a light aircraft and was at about 8000 or 9000 feet altitude. I watched it, waiting to see the strobe as it got closer and listening for engine sounds, but it remained silent, and there were no visible strobes or navigation lights.  Then it began a slow, wide turn to the south.  It's hard to describe, but it almost seemed to slide.  The color of the light was almost the same color as a landing light. After the 90 degree turn, landing lights would not have been visible on an airplane, but this light remained constant.  Then it began to speed up, and it either gained altitude, or the light faded out.  I don't know which, but it just disappeared. I know some people will say it was an airplane, but it wasn't.  When it was overhead, I should have seen a strobe and the red and green navigation lights, and it should not have had white lights facing backwards.

At approximate 10:30 p.m. on Thursday, October 22, 2015 my roommate and I were talking out on our balcony which faces about south east.  I was sitting in a low chair and my roommate was standing with his back against the railing, facing me and the door to the apartment--he could not see the sky.  As we talked I observed a bright light moving across the sky that resembled the profile of a meteor, that is to say the light grew brighter as it moved laterally across the sky from the right of the balcony to the left.  That would put it coming from roughly the south to the north. If the light had streaked then disappeared I would have thought it to be just that, a meteor.  However, about 2 seconds after the light appeared the path of the light curved sharply upward and disappeared. The light did not fade out, it was there and then it wasnât there. This was so strange that I stood up and told my roommate what I had seen.  There wasnât much to say other than I had seen a light moving strangely in the sky. We joked that I was the only one to have seen it and that I now had a âUFOâ story that was unsubstantiated. It wasnât two minutes later that he pointed up into the sky and yelled âlook at that!â I thought he was kidding around at first but as I looked three uniformly shaped lights in a delta formation moved rather swiftly and silently through the sky toward the place where I saw the first light curve upward.  From our point of view they came over the apartment building which would put them moving roughly east.  In the interim between the first light and the sighting of three lights we observed five or six passenger jets flying overhead which is common for this area.  These planes took about 30-40 seconds to cross the majority of the sky.  The lights we saw crossed about half of the visible sky in less than 4 seconds. As the lights receded from us, the back right light broke formation in a non-ballistic motion, curving through the sky much like a motorcycle zipping around traffic, and passed between the other two as all three accelerated and then disappeared.  Just like the first like the first light that I saw, they did not fade out.  They were simply there and then not there.  I had my cell phone in my hand while we watched, however I was so completely mystified by what we were seeing that by the time it occurred to me to try and film the lights had gone. It likely wouldnât have shown up though, because once I had begun to take video most everything was black except for the brightly lit parking lot.  I donât recall the shape of the first light very clearly. It didnât really gain my full attention until it curved upward. The three lights however were very round, nearly perfect discs of soft white light. They appeared to be very high above us. I could not discern any detail other than the relative size and shape. There was no tell-tale warbling of jet engines nor any other sound to indicate a fast moving aircraft.  Shortly after our experience another roommate came home and after we told him what we saw, he indicated that he had seen a similar light in the sky akin to the first light that I saw. He was outside and less than 5 miles away to the north west of our apartment. He said that he noticed a bright light in his periphery and turned to look at it. As he did the light was obscured by the little cloud cover that was out. It was strange enough to him that he got the attention of another person next to him but as he directed their attention to the expected position in the sky, the light did not reappear. He did not witness the other three lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2015-10-29T00:00:00,38.43080419847328,-78.8831610687023

Place observed:  From my car as I was driving from Rockland County NY, on I-287 East in South Nyack, NY approaching the Tappan Zee Bridge.  The object was just south of the bridge, heading northeast, slowly.  It was rather low, at approximately a 40-degree angle from my location and large enough to be seen from the approach to the bridge on the Rockland county side of the Hudson River.  The object was neither over the bridge nor the Hudson River but was overland on the Westchester county side of the river,  just south of the bridge.  The bridge is just over 3 miles long so the object was at least that far away from me at the time my girlfriend and I first noticed it out of the windshield of the car. As the road curves a bit the craft was on the left side of the car (south of the bridge) for most of the observation. Description:  Rectangular and black.  Though not a perfect rectangle.  More cigar shaped but it was not round like a cigar.  Slow moving, angling down like it was preparing to land.  It was large, not huge, about the size of a large commercial or military jet, but much darker than the gray used by the USAF.  Most striking was its slow speed and shape.  Flight characteristics were more like a blimp then an airplane.  If it was a blimp it is one Iâve not seen before. The object was visible to us as we drove almost the entire length of the bridge.  We were driving in well moving traffic, moving at highway speeds for almost the entire length of the bridge.  We lost sight of the craft as we approached the Toll plaza and just after we cleared the suspension portion (superstructure) of the bridge.  At that point, it was too low from our angle to see anymore and was now to north of the bridge. My girlfriend attempted to record the object on an iPhone but she did not begin recording until we were already passing thru the suspension portion of the bridge and since the craft was now at a low angle (approx. 10 to 15-degrees), she was recording it as we were passing thru the beams / cross section of the superstructure of the bridge.  Therefore, the recording is basically a series of beams passing by at highway speed but the craft was visible to the eye in-between the breaks in the beams.  Unfortunately we waited too long to begin recording.  The reason for this is at first we assumed it was a slow moving large airplane moving away from us.  However, the more we observed it and had time to discuss it, we realized what we were observing was unusual and worth trying to record.  If there had been no traffic on the bridge, I would have stopped and gotten out of the car to witness it longer â it was that unusual. Duration of observation â approximately 5 minutes. Conditions:  Bright, clear and sunny.  A beautiful day.  Perfect conditions for observing the sky.  And this dark, slow moving object was perfectly visible and stood out quite vividly. Feeling â an odd aircraft that neither of us could identify.  It did not look extra-worldly or intimidating in anyway just out of the ordinary.",2015-10-29T00:00:00,41.0837,-73.8397

I happened to look up at the moon, which was just above the roof of my house to the south.  It was about Â¾ full, with a few wisps of clouds around it.  It was developing a ring around its perimeter. Just to the left of the moon, I noticed two lights - one green and one red - hovering high in the sky, about 10 degrees east of due south.  They were very bright and steady.  They almost looked like Christmas lights, but were too high in the sky to be that.  I initially thought they were from the jets landing at the Portland International Airport, because they were in that general direction, a little east from the airport.  But the lights werenât moving.  They just hovered there for maybe a minute or so. They slowly started moving west, then suddenly, the lights zig-zagged right, then left very rapidly 2 or 3 times.  The object then turned and started coming toward me at a slower pace than it was when it was zig-zagging.  It seemed as if the object blinked and rotated at the same time, and the lights turned from red and green to white.  I couldnât be sure, but I had the impression it was disc-shaped.  Suddenly, the light went straight down toward the ground, leaving a long, solid streak of yellowish-white light behind.  I lost sight of it as it disappeared behind the house.  I went out back, but could see nothing.  I did not hear any sounds during this incident. I watched for awhile, and saw several planes coming in and out of the airport.  They moved in a steady line toward and away from the airport, not in the crazy zig-zag way of the object.  I walked down the block where there was a less obstructed view of the southern sky, but could see nothing.  After coming in and looking up UFO sightings online, I found several stories from âThe Columbianâ newspaper in Vancouver.  It described sightings nights on Feb. 20 and 21 2011 when several residents in the Clear Meadows neighborhood of East Vancouver saw something very similar to what I saw.  There was some speculation that what they saw was a Chinese kite decked out with LED lights that was flown by a man named Mike.",2015-10-29T00:00:00,45.65808015267176,-122.58490839694656

I'm a realist and these orbs I've seen defy physics.  I was up and me and my girlfriend noticed two orbs by the mesa that are distinctly larger than any star by far.  These objects are in our atmosphere and I have a video that shows when the sun was coming up with the objects in view.  The the two orbs were diagonal from eachother. The larger orb was higher and on the right.  The larger orb appeared to look like a cluster of atoms jumbling around eachother.  My gf is the one who joticed it. I was playing a game and she felt the need to look out the window.  Keep in mind she was skeptical and said that something told her to look outside which is a similar feeling I've had in my previous encounters with ufos.  The weird part is that before we even looked outside we were sitting cross legged on my bed at about 2:30 am mountain time and as I was mid sente! nce I started leaning left.  My vision went black slowly and all noise faded away even the sound of my own voice.  This lasted only about 5 seconds and I snapped back and was very confused about where I was and what I was talking about.  My girlfriend asked if I was ok and had to comfort me a little bit. About 10 minutes later the exact same thing happened to her!  As time went by we looked at the clock and we were in disbelief that it was already 5 in the morning.  We both began to feel scared because we lost track of time and couldnt remember what we did that took so many hours. Thats when she felt the need to look outside. ok While we were observing the larger ufo we noticed noticed a pure white orb flying low to the ground faster than any man made aircraft and it was flying horizontally to the left then made very fast 50 degree ascension upward and quickly disappeared.   Once it was almost all light out the objects ascended and the main ship appeared to be searching in the ! sky. Very enlightening! In the video watch the last 50 seconds! and you will see that nothing man made spins and rotates like this.  Please keep an open mind I belive this is important for mankind.  I have a 4 minute video that shows the cluster orbs and i zoomed out and in to give perspective and detail.  Thank you.  I would be humbled to share this and share the awareness.,2015-10-29T00:00:00,39.07603153409091,-108.54615767045453

Immediately, a very, very bright light in the sky caught my eye; it looked like several powerful LED lights.  I stared at it for 30 seconds or so and just assumed it was a helicopter or plane and made another cast.  I looked back once again after approximately a minute or so and it had gotten closer and even brighter, but with absolutely no sound.  It was essentially just a silent ball of light moving slowly.  Out of nowhere, it literally disappeared instantly while I was staring at it for the second time.

This new sound, which is auditory and not internal, is a constant sound, which does last for a duration of fifteen minutes or more. During the reverberating sound, I begin hearing an unnatural pitch, which is not a part of the reverberating sound.  The pitch goes high and low like a tuning fork sound.  This occurs as the reverberating sound continues and the tuning fork sound is one to two seconds long. The emotional response, which it evokes is ominous.  Psychologically, I do try to rationalize and recognize the sound.  I begin thinking as to what the sounds may be and what I usually am able to hear.  I then try to decipher if the reverberating sound is one I have heard before.  I do try to come to terms with sound, as something that may have been natural, but I was unable to do so.  The reverberating sound and the tuning fork like sound, do not in any way sound like a natural occurrence, which is auditory.

Again I got very uneasy and felt like they, whatever they were  watching  me.  Again I ran inside.

Besides our family of five, my sister had 4 friends over & our parents had invited a young family of three & the mother-in-law, who had just arrived here a few weeks prior from Germany, not speaking a stitch of English. We had finished dinner and were just singing Happy Birthday with the cake, when our phone rang.  A neighbor across the street & up the block to the east of us called & said, âStep out on your porch NOW you wonât believe what you see!â  The entire group ran out to the front yard and what we saw was totally unexpected.  We stood stunned and in awe all at once. Hovering over the callers home (actually 3 homes by size) was a disc shaped craft which had a glow about it.  It was a brilliant metallic unseen before by any of us, adults and children alike.  It was near silent, just a hum almost like electrical lines make.  It was seamless and at the bottom was a circle of lights which to my recollection these 46 yrs. later were blue and red.   It just hovered in place for at least 5 minutes.  Dad yelled out, âIâm going to follow this thing if it moves, who wants to come!â  Dad, the male family friend, my younger sister, three of the girls at the party and me jumped in to the old Dodge Dart.

We followed from our home on 2nd Ave, went right (south) toward the hospital and followed that road through the parking lot then going right again & facing west and taking a left turn at the end of that block.  This took us up a slight hill which came to the next street which we took a right on.  We parked on the road there.   Directly south of where we parked in a then vacant lot we actually saw the craft land or appear to land, it may have just been hovering very low.  Dad turned off the car and we all ran out toward the craft.  Right before our very eyes, it disappeared.  It did not fly off with great speed as so many reports speak of.  It was just plain goneâ¦â¦. Within this same week we learned that another family in town saw the same craft.  I donât know if it was the same night but they claim it did land in an alfalfa field just outside their family home which I believe was west of Odessa near the cemetery.  The woman was an artist who painted what they saw.  They also claimed that there were burn marks in a circular shape left in the alfalfa field.  She is still living in Odessa.

But before I could get closer to the craft, it started moving West and then South over the highway.  I decided to follow it as there was enough light that I could see it wasn't a helicopter but was a black triangular craft. As I took the overpass, I saw the craft nestled down in a pasture behind a clump of trees.  I drove pass the area and the road curved back toward the East.  I went about 100 yards past where I saw the craft go down, pulled over, turned off my lights and waited but letting my car engine idle, looking into my rearview mirror. To my surprise, the craft arose from behind the trees about thirty feet in the air and came toward me.  It stopped slightly to my right, facing my vehicle, and remained motionless, with no sound.  It was just past what looked like a telephone line and on the South side of the fence. As I was looking up at it through my windshield, I could see a cockpit with 3 round heads looking down at me.  There was a green hue in the cockpit and the heads appeared like shadows with no discernible features.  The craft itself was triangular about 30 ft. in length and approx. 20 wide.  It was jet black in color. I had been there approximately 5 min., when a green light came down on my vehicle from the craft.  My engine stopped running and none of my lights and radio would work.  I couldn't get my car to start after trying several times which caused me to get  nervous.  So, I locked my doors and just waited. It was a cool and clear night, and I couldn't do anything but just sit there.  Every few minutes, I tried to get the engine to start but nothing.  It was just me and the three heads looking down at me. What seemed like an eternity, I finally got the engine to start on my VW Fastback after about 15 min. of trying.  I then pulled ahead with my lights off about 70 yards where I turned my lights on and did a U-turn.  As I drove back by the craft, it did not attempt to follow me.  When I got back on the highway, I looked to my right and could see the craft was still there. Having had two years of AFROTC and two years active duty in the US Army, I knew this was no known military or civilian aircraft.  Since it could hover with no sound and remain motionless, I can only conclude that what I observed was an alien spacecraft. About two years later as my family and I were headed to East Waco to have dinner my wife's family, I saw the same light again.  This time, it was South of the LaVega football field.  It was sitting still behind and above the stadium lights.  I wanted to go investigate; but my wife didn't want us to get any closer, claiming her parents were waiting for us for dinner.  Well, I think that was just an excuse as I had already confided in her my previous UFO encounter. I do have two pieces of advice for anyone reading this report:  1.  Keep looking up, and 2. Have a camera or picture phone available with you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2015-11-06T00:00:00,31.57359750778816,-97.13584859813085

Directly outside of my window (within a foot of my eyesight), I saw a yellow round circle roughly the size of a baseball.  It was spinning/bouncing  around in circles, made no noise, and did not seem to be bothered by me watching it.  I had no fear, and remained calm.

Black and silver cylindrical object at very close range.,Kit Carson,CO,1976-07-26T13:00:00,cylinder,5 minutes,"Occurred : 7/26/1976 13:00  (Entered as : 07/26/1976 13:00) Reported: 11/3/2015 7:47:26 AM 07:47 Posted: 11/6/2015 Location: Kit Carson, CO Shape: Cylinder Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/123/S123338.html,"Black and silver cylindrical object at very close range I was a recent college graduate, on my way to a teaching interview.  On about Monday, July 26, 1976, I was traveling southbound on US 287 between Kit Carson and Hugo in Colorado.  I don't know if I was in Elbert or Lincoln County, at that point on the highway. The road is very lightly traveled, so no other traffic was observed.  The time of day was approximately 12-1 PM. The weather was calm, clear and sunny.  The area was ranch land. I donât think there were any buildings in sight.  As I drove along, at about a speed of 60 miles per hour, I saw a black cylindrical object in the distance, in the air, on my left, no more than 30 yards off the highway, with its length parallel to it.  It seemed to float at about the height of a telephone pole above the ground.  The landscape on that side (East) of the road is fairly flat prairie, with dry prairie grass. As I slowed down and approached, the object appeared to be stationary above the ground with no visible support.  When I reached a point perhaps 30 yards before reaching the point perpendicular to the leading end of the object, I pulled over to the right shoulder, got out and leaned against the front fender of my car and ate a sandwich.  Now I could detect that the object was indeed moving, almost imperceptibly, from my right to my left, staying parallel to the highway.  It did not seem at all effected by gravity, which I thought very odd, given that I knew of no âantigravityâ technology which could prevent an object moving so very slowly from falling to the ground. Its altitude appeared constant as it moved.  The motion and course appeared to be steady. If anyone was inside of it, I could not tell if they noticed me by any change in the movement of the object. The object, which I could see very clearly, I estimated to myself to be approximately 8-12 feet in diameter, about the length of a residential housing lot width, ~60 feet long and uniformly cylindrical.  The color was flat black, with about 8 feet of non-reflective silver covering each end.  The surface of the object was not perfectly smooth, but I could not recognize anything that resembled construction, such as riveting that one might see on a man-made craft; having no doors or windows on the side exposed to my view.  There was absolutely no humanly detectable sound coming from it.  It seemed spooky, but I felt no unusual fear, other than of the unknown.  Its progress seemed like a train slowly passing on a track. I watched it for about 5 minutes, until it was quartering off the rear fender of my car.  I had moved approximately twice its length in five minutes.  I suspect I could have watched it indefinitely, but I couldnât risk being late for my interview.  Of course, I had no camera with me. :(  After taking the job, in extreme SE Colorado, I told my neighbor, a rancher, about my observations. He said heâd heard that area was a secret testing area for the US military.  I asked if he just heard that as a rumor among other area ranchers or if his AF service had given him reason to think that.  He hedged. I donât know.  This was before cruise missiles and stealth aircraft became public knowledge.  But the craft style and behavior is very odd outside of other UFO sightings, even today (2015).  I suspect that the object was a prototype testing craft for highly classified technologies, but if so, then why so close to a highway and possible public observation?  The similarity to other sightings people have reported intrigues me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2015-11-06T00:00:00,38.8263,-102.86

LOCATION:  13 miles north of EPHRATA (pronounced E - frA - ta), WASHINGTON, on Sagebrush Flats Road.  (Sagebrush Flats Road goes at a North by Northwest track from the town of Ephrata to the south.)   TIME:  about 7 pm PST (Dark outside), November 1999   SETTING ONE:  About 13 miles northwest of Ephrata, Sagebrush Flats Road comes out of a small canyon (gentle rolling hills on either side of the road) onto a 2 mile wide (north to south) and 5 mile long flat area with wheat farms and high power transmission lines.  The lines are suspended upon the very tall erector-set towers such lines are usually found on.  The high power lines cut across the flats coming from the Northeast (Grand Coulee Dam) and going to the Southwest. As I was traveling north and approaching the high power lines, I noticed a very bright light traveling very slowly (maybe 10 miles an hour) an estimated 20-50 feet above the lines.  It was to the northeast and coming towards me â as the road intersects under the lines at a 90 degree angle. The single light was very bright; such that I couldnât see the craft behind it. Not wanting to be directly under the craft when it got to my location, I went maybe 1/8th mile north on the road â all the while watching the light. I stopped the car and got out to watch.  There was absolutely NO sound from the craft holding the light.  I watched as the light came to the road and made a 90 degree turn to its left and slowly followed Sagebrush road south.  As it slowly, and at a very low altitude, approached the small canyon, the canyon and adjacent rolling hills were illuminated as if it was a bright summer day.  Since the craft/light was now going away from me, I could not see the light, just the effects of the lights illumination.  I still could not see nor hear the craft holding the light. I watched for maybe 10-15 minutes. SETTING TWO:  My home is about three miles northwest (as a crow flies) of where I saw the light. When I got home to my wife, I said to her, âYou will not believe what I just saw.â  My wife excitedly interrupted with, âYou will not believe what I just saw.â  She went on to tell me that 15-20 minutes before I got home (the same time frame of my sighting) she had stepped outside and looked up to the east.  Hovering, maybe 50 feet above her was a very large (an estimated 150 feet to each side) black triangular shaped craft.  It made no sound.  At each corner were several small bright orange/red lights.  These corner lights gave enough definition of the craft for her to tell it was triangular.  She watched for maybe two minutes and then, out of fear, stepped back into the building. There isnât any way these two craft (my light carrier and my wifeâs black triangular craft) could be the same craft.  It seems too much of a coincidence that these two craft were in the same general area at the same time.  Iâve always wondered if the light bearing craft was looking for the triangular craft.  That possibly, the triangular craft was hugging the ground for stealth reasons.",2015-11-06T00:00:00,47.2724,-119.59000000000002
