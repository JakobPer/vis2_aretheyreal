My brother and I were star gazing and saw what appeared to be a LARGE vehicle that had the appearance of a conventional aircraft but it had 6 sets of wings and was dotted with lights around the perimiter of the craft. It was also silent and very close. The sighting took place around 1980, but is still etched in my mind and will be forever. My brother and I would be outside every night to look for unusual things in the sky. One night just before dark on a warm summer evening with no clouds,we were looking at the apex of the sky when all of a sudden a huge craft floated silently ovrhead. We were both stunned at what we were seeing, our jaws dropped in awe. The craft appeared to a normal convetional aircraft at first but then we realised it was no air plane. The object had 6 sets of wing like appendages and the whole exterior of the craft was dotted with white lights and what appearerd to be a runway of sorts in the center. The object moved slowly over head and was completely silent. the oject also gave the appearance of being somewhat translucent,Im not sure how to explain it. It was just light enough to see the object so it could have been a reflection of some kind. I was about 18 years old at the time and my brother would have been around 20. We never reported this untill now for fear of riddcule. We did however tell our parents and some friends but they only laughed. I feel it important to note that there were no drugs or alcohol involved in the sighting. Please let me know if anyone else has seen an object like the one described in this report. this has been on my mind for a long time. Please let me know if you need additional information.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,43.0418,-77.6071

Object was motionless at an altitude of approximatiely One Thousand feet (1,000 ft.) and over the ordinance impact area north of the ground-wave listening antenna. A dark square, longer than it was wide, was centered in the diamond, and resembling a tinted-picture window. I was sitting by my second-story dormitory window with the window open.  The dormitory was near cherry hill on Elmendorf AFB.  The sky was clear.  It wasn't uncommon for me to observe sky conditions; because, I was a weather observer for the U.S.A.F.  I remember I was sitting very close to the window, and as I turned to my left I noticed a red speck in the sky.  My attention was drawn completely to the speck, and in order to satisfy my curiosity I grabbed my celestron (C-90) telescope and placed a 35X Barlow in the tube. Needless to say, there was a perfectly motionless red diamond floating in the sky, over the ordinance-impact area, north of the ground-wave-listening antenna, perfectly motionless, and at an altitude of about One Thousand feet (1,000 ft.). My initial reaction was to telephone the tower.  Instead though, I went next door to a rather merry gathering of my fellow workers and brought their attention to bear on the object.  Then we observed the object at a higher power - high enough to see it was a red diamond shaped object with a dark square longer than it was wide, and centered in the middle. Nothing accompanied the event such as sound or lights etc. emitted by the object. All of us looked at each other in amazement.  Our decision was that it might be a kite.  Since there was a party going on we decided not to notify anyone.  Also I think we were having trouble admitting to ourselves the reality of the situation. The sighting went unreported until now.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,,

The living room in my parents apartment, where I was at the time, faced east, or slightly northeast. I was lying on the floor watching television, when above the hills to the northeast I noticed a far off light, or lights. This was not at all unusual, as we lived near an airport, and planes flew near us all the time. While I was watching television, I noticed that the lights appeared to be getting ever so brighter a little at a time. They were obviously moving toward me as I watched them, yet at the same time it was taking an inordinate amount of time to do so. As the lights got gradually brighter, it was obvious theat they were moving toward us at an extremely slow rate. I wondered about this, and remember thinking to myself that if this was an airplane, it was going unbelievably slow. The time was about 8:00 pm. I finally got up and went to the window for a closer look, and although you could tell it was moving toward you, movement at all was almost impossible to detect. When the object finally made it's way close enough to be overhead, I went out to take a look at it. As it passed overhead, we noticed a distinct ""V"" shape to the formation. Again, it moved at an incredibly slow pace. The best way I can describe it is to say that if you look at the minute hand of a clock, it is difficult to actually see it move. You can if you stare closely, but if you look at the clock, then look away and look back, you will notice that the hand has moved. It was alnost the same with these lights. Movement was almost undetectable while staring at it, but after a few minutes, you noticed it had moved. Anyway, I remember commenting at the time that I heard no sound at all, not even a hovering noise. Some people say it was light aircraft in formation, but I really doubt it. There was absolutely no ""play"" in between the lights. In other words, When airplanes fly in formation, there is some variation in movement between them as they go along. There was no evidence of that at all. One truly had the feeling that this was one structure. Also, there was no sound, and while going overhead, it practically hovered. We watched the lights as they moved southwest, and then lost sight of them. Thinking it was over, we went about out business. At about 9:20 pm, I left the house to meet a friend of mine. I walked out of the apartment and up the driveway, when I was visually struck by what you see in figure 3 in my illustration. As I turned up the driveway, the lights were right in front of me (and above). I don't know if I can relate the size of it, or how wide it spanned, in writing. It was no longer a ""V"" shape, which could be attributed to the angle at which I was viewing it. I actually had to turn my head from side to side to see it all. It was huge. I immediately ran back to the house to alert my parents. As near as I can figure, based on the distance away our apartment was, to run back inside, tell my parents, and return with my father, would have taken about 45 seconds to a minute. In this time, when I looked up again, I saw NO discernible movement in the lights. Thay seemed to be right where they were when I first ran back inside. This again made me realize they were not airplanes. My dad and I watched them for about 15-20 minutes more, as they traveled in a northerly direction. As they moved, we were in a position to view what would have been the ""back"" of it. I then noticed that as it made it's way north, the light (or ""a"" light) from the back shot forward in a bee line to the front of the formation. Then the lights slowly proceeded north until out of sight.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,41.02648342105263,-73.7644002631579

I know this story is a little old, now, and sorry we cant remember the exact date. My mother came in late one evening about 11:30 and told me she saw a UFO. She went out to put the horse in the barn, and she saw a bright flash from behind the trees to the east, which made her think of shooting stars. So she looked up to see if she could see any more. She noticed something moving in the big dipper, and initially thought it was a meteor, or satellite, until she realized there were 4 groups of either 2 or 4 starlike lights, in a rhombus formation, with 1 group in front, 2 on each side, and one trailing.               :          :        :           :  Each one 'waggled' or yawed a bit in mid-flight, and then carried on until she lost sight of them behind the trees to the east, roughly where she saw the flash (the flash was like a flare that descended and dimmed, but she could not see the source for the trees). There was no noise. It was travelling at a pretty good clip, faster than a typical airplne, slower than a meteor. If it was a plane/jet, there would have been sound and colored/ blinking lights. Left no trail. Very clear sky. The whole thing she estimated to be the size of a dime at arm's lenght, or smaller. Each group of lights was as bright as a moderately dim star, no brighter than one of the big dipper stars. Whole time from flash until the craft disappeared behind trees was probably 15 to 20 secs max. The fir trees to the east are tall, and obscure the sky up to about 45 deg.

My cousin and I were going home from my girlfriend house at 10:00PM driving down highway ""H"" going East.  I was driving and my cousin was commenting on the sky in which he noticed an object coming Northeast toward us.  At first glance we thought it was a plane because there was a small airport for personal prop planes to the southwest of us.  I then told my cousin that it was nothing to worry about.  The plane looked as if it was coming in at a slow rate of speed.  It then began to speed up keeping the same distance from the ground.  So I told my cousin that it looked to me like it was getting ready to crash.  We were about a 1/4th of a mile from the object and as we watched it in fear thinking it was going to crash into a field on the southwest side of us.  I decided to speed up to an  approximately 70-80 miles per hour to get a closer look at it.  As it came over the highway it slowed down to a complete stop, where it sat motionless.  By this time we were about 20 yards and came to a screaching hault about 10 yards from it, in which the car engined stauled.  The object was about 30 feet in the air and the white lights were so bright that we could not make out a complete description of it. We could hear no jet engines or propellors.  So we automaticly assumed that it was nothing that we had ever seen before.  After three to five minutes of absolutley no noise and no movement, the object slowly began to move southwest across the highway. It then turned on its side and hovered closer to the ground.  It began to move away from us, carefully manuvering between trees and eccelorating to an approximate speed of 40-50 miles per hour.  We then left the area and headed for home.  When at the junction of ""H"" and ""72"" Highway we watched as a state patrol and at least 4 police cars headed down ""32"" Highway (which is ajacent to ""H"" highway) going southwest toward the area the object was moving.

As I watched it fly over it was about 2500 ft up and the sky ceiling was about 15,000 with partly overcast but bright skies. I noticed  what I thought to be the big dipper out early  ( I have these red tinted sunglasses that reduce the glare alot). I watched the glowing objects which were about 8 of them just stay in a formation that looked like the big dipper. But then they moved into a diamond formation and then a circle formation, and then a pointed arch similar to a arrowhead. I was quite in disbelief because I was watching a formation of objects in the clouds that looked like stars, and were in a perfect lineup of the other in otherwords they didnt move out of formation. I watched them float thru the clouds and and other objects seemed to turn on at the bottom of the formation. And then in the corner of my eye I caught a object heading over the tops of the downtown buildings at a great speed. I watched it soar just over the buildings and I saw it perfectly. It was chrome,kinda eggshaped, and the size of a small airplane similar to a ""Pipercub"". It had no wings,no jet intake or outlet,no sound,no lights, and no windows. I watched it fly over and disappear over the buildings. The original formation seemed to be in a circle formation when it passed over, kinda like they were watching it. Noone else seemed to see I was in shock! And then the original formation seemed to disappear in the clouds. No jets from McChord AFB were flying after the objects, and I still see it so clean in my mind. Just so everyone knows. Iam studying for my private pilots license, and I know what aircraft look like. This wasnt an aircraft. And no Government, or person for now on can tell me UFO's dont exist! I saw something.

I was in the center of three seats, so I could not actually see well out the window when I snapped the shot.  I just held my camera out to the window and took the picture.  At the time I noticed nothing unusual.  It was a clear, sunny day, and we were flying above the clouds.  Upon developing my film, I noticed a small brownish triangular spot in the distance.  The wing is also present.  I have maintained that this is probably debris on the aircraft window, but persons I have shown it to have been inclined to think that it is something else, often describing it as similar to a stealth bomber.  Since I did not observe whatever it was, whether something stuck to the window or else, I cannot offer any further details.

It happend on 19th april, 10:20 pm when me and a friend of mine were hanging out on his terrace. we were just gazing at the stars when suddenly we noticed two objects (disc shaped) with amazing tails fly from south-westernly direction to north-eastern direction. The tails were really really beautiful, unlike any I saw, on comets and stuff. the tail was glowing, light bluish in colour and atlest 8-9 times the size of the object (quite big..in comparision to the objects). they moved pretty fast and in a very parallel route when the second object broke into 3 more (so there were 5 objects now. the original two plus 3 tailing the second object). We were completly mesmerized to do anything...my camera was in my bike below but I just couldn't take my eyes of those objects. after some time the four objects joined back and now there were only two moving along parallely. they moved in the north-eastern direction for about couple of minutes when they...just vanished. The local daily contacted the local observatory who gave a bull-shit report that it could have been weather balloon. No way man, weather ballons don't have tails. Neither can they move at such speed. and too parallel. It couldn't have been comets cos comets dont break up and join back. it would have been in the news if comets were approaching anyway.

I was going to bed at 10:50pm Monday night when I looked out the window at the sky.  I saw a very bright shimmering light that was heading directly toward me.  We live in a landing pattern path for Sea-Tac so I assumed it was a plane coming in for the final approach.  I left the room for a couple of minutes and when I came back  the light was still in the same place and there were colored lights flashing all around its perimeter.  I have never seen a plane do that, or look like that so I got the binoculars for a closer look.  There was a dark object that had a shape similar to an airplane but was rounder in the center, with a big "" wing "" span.  The colored lights were very bright and seemed to be flashing in a random manner.  It was still in the same place.  At this point I awoke my husband and told him to look.  He did and was as amazed as I was.  It was no plane.  It was no star.  It was a craft of some sort and it was right in front of us!  He watched it for several minutes and had to return to bed for a early rising hour.  I continued to watch with and without the binoculars.  The craft had indeed moved but so slowly you couldn't detect it.  I had placed its position at the top of a tree that stands below our house when I first saw it.  When my husband went back to bed a little after 11, it had moved slightly upward in a north easterly direction.  By this time I had decided that I was watching a ufo and that I would watch it for as long as it took for it to do something. I drew a rough diagram of the dark shape that I saw, wrote down the colors of the lights and continued the watching until 1:00am. The craft had moved upward at about a 40-45 degree angle in a north easterly direction until the last hour when it seemed to shift its heading to a more southerly direction.  At that time the eave of the roof got in the way so I went to bed. The craft had 9 lights.  One in the center, larger than the other 8.  That light flashed from bright blue to a silvery white.  The lights that would have been on the "" wing "" tips if it were a plane also flashed the blue and silvery color.  The remainder of the lights flashed a rusty orange, silvery white.  The flashing was random to the eye.  There was a distinct strobing effect every 1/2 second or so that was a pale electric blue.  The strobe was only visible through the binoculars, but was visible from the closest point to the furtherest point. I am snail-mailing my drawing of the shape within the lights for your perusal.  Thanks for your time. ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  The report seems to us to be both sincere and well prepared.  We do not understand how an ""object"" can be either in, or near, an airport Terminal Control Area, which Sea-Tac has, and the airport apparently continues to function normally.  We would have guessed that the report had been caused by a ""twinkling"" star, but it apparently moved in the wrong direction in the course of the night.

I just finished reading a book and went to the kitchen to get some food and for some reason I went outside and looked up at the stars and thought I hope I see a UFO and when i looked up again I saw two flashing lights above a mountian across the vally from my house one red and one green naturally at first I thought it was a plane but I couldnt hear it and it wasnt moving so then I thought it could be a planet but I noticed it was swaying and moving unsteadly not smoothly like a plane and I have never seen a plane stay in one place for a long ammount of time before I kept watching for about five more minutes and came to the conclusion that its nothing and it was a plane and I must be soupid to think it was a UFO. So I ran inside and got my brother who was watching tv at the time when he saw it he told me it was a planet until it moved again back and forward very slowley the thought of it being a plane didnt really enter his head because we know what a plane flying through the night sky looks like we watched for about ten more minutes and I was still trying to get my head around what I was seeing. My brother told me to go and get the telescope so I ran to my bedroom and grabbed it I hadent used it in ages so it wasnt assembled as I proceded to assemble the tripod my brother caught it on the telescope and told me it defanitly wasnt a plane or planet he said it looked like a triangle of red,blue,green and white light. It hovered there for about five more minutes and thenvanished just as I got the tripod assembled jez I was pissed. We deciced to stay outside for a second chance of seeing it again and about three minutes later we saw it on the other side of the vally we were so happy to see it again but it was further away this time and moving slowley across the vally we decided to go and wake my mother up. She came out to have a look and said it was a plane and about ten minutes later a plane flew past we all laughed and we could hear it was a plane we then went inside and set the telescope up inside we all stood there watching it for a while and then my mum went to bed my brother and I caught it in the telescope. It was so cool through the telescope it looked like a dome but it had no apparent shape at one stage it looked like a red fireball and then a five cent coin. The colours were clearer through the telescope and were very beautiful it was mostly blue with green,red and white flashes with a hint of orange the colours kept changing as well. It didnt look like it was very steady moving around viontly my brother went to bed at about 1:35am but I stayed up watching it fly so far away that I could hardly see it I fell asleep before it dissapeared.

Once I got my eyes clear I saw several flashes of blue light. I rubbed my eyes again because I was blinking during the event.  I looked again towards the moon and saw two last flashes.  At this point my eyes were ""wide open"" and clear.  The flashes were circles that when flashed turned small and disappeared.  The total time was maybe 1/3 to 1/4 sec.  They appeared to look like an arc when using a electric welder.  If you can imagin seeing a welder strike the first arc to begin his weld.  This was also the colour.

I didn't have my Celestron software loaded, but took the time to do so.  I noticed that there were two stars near the moon.  Both having a mag of less than 1.  Jupiter was also just above the moon.

I remembered reading about these red UFOs recently on this website a couple of days ago. I wondered if this was one of them so I ran thru the house and took a spotting scope into the backyard to observe it. I couldn't make out any further details with the scope other than a pulsing red light. Next I ran in and grabbed a Hi-8 videocamera and a tripod. I went outside to set up the gear. I taped the object on the tripod, then proceeded to place numerous calls around the Phoenix valley to other skywatchers. On the third call Jeff Willes answered and immediately gathered his videocamera with my 5X telephoto lenses I loaned him. He also videotaped the blood red object as I did with a tripod. We'll probably post stills or video on our website www.ufovideo.com in a day or so. Until then we'll be keeping the Phoenix valley under watch during the 7-9 pm time period for a while.

At first I thought it was a black coloured ""party"" balloon that some kid might have let go of, but I didn't see any string underneath and it seemed more like a circle or a dot in shape and not an oval like a child's balloon. Also it was moving fast in a perfect straight line like a plane and just as fast. It wasn't bouncing or bobbing at all in the breeze like small helium balloons do. It was definetely moving as fast as a jet plane because there were some planes in other parts of the sky and I could compare the speed. I couldn't tell how big it was or how high it was but it didn't seem like it was far away. Maybe a quarter of a mile away, I don't know. There was no light or reflection coming from it at all. It was solid dull black. I couldn't see any characteristics at all. Its hard to explain but I think it would have just looked like a dull black circle or ball if it was just feet away from me. It moved in a straight, fast, perfect trajectory like it was under intelligent control. I lost sight of it behind our row of houses so I went to the front of the house so I could see it again. It went out of sight pretty quick and became so small I couldn't make it out anymore. Just then an identical black dot came from the same direction as the other one had and moved in the exact same fashion and trajectory. I watched this one until it too flew out of sight in the eastern sky. My wife and I kept saying, ""What the hell is that?"" Anyway I watch planes every night from my patio and I've seen many hot air balloons as well as helium party balloons and I can tell you it wasn't any of those.",2000-08-19T00:00:00,40.096999999999994,-76.3511

It was a clear night and you could see all the stars, so I stepped off my poarch and into my front yard to look at the stars, when I turned and faced the house, (looking East N.E.), I noticed 4 stars together.

The color was very similar to that of the planet Mars as observed from the ground at night.  I simply thought that what I was seeing was simply a planet or twinkling star, that is when I glanced back at the other 3 stars in the group and noticed that this ""object"" was now 2-3 times larger than the stars that it was next to and had completely change color from a white ""star"" color/appearance to an orange/yellow color.  The ""object"" began to suddenly move to my left in a straight line paralell to the horizon.  It moved at a rate of speed like that of an airplane for about 10 seconds and then stopped in the center of the star group.  It stayed stationary and both its size and color returned to that similar to the stars around it.  It remained stationary in the star group for about 30 seconds and then it changed both size and color again and began to move to my lower left (at a 45 degree angle to the horizon).  At this point it change shape from a circlular appearance to an elongated appearance, but its speed actually slowed until it pasted the star group that I was using as a reference point.  Once past the stars it increased speed and made a sudden change in direction to my upper left, (at a 45 degree angle to the horizon in an upward direction). At this point the suddenly disappeared.  There were no visible clouds in the sky.  I first suspected a planet, as I said, but ruled it out with movement.  I then suspected a satelite until the object stopped moving the first time.  After the shift to the lower left and both color and shape change I suspected a shooting star, but was completely surprised when it changed direction and moved in an uppward direction and disapeared.  I suspected that maybe it might be a test of some type from Redstone Arsenal here in town, but after realizing that it was in the opposite direction, I gave up on ideas. Can you help?

We discussed the flying machines and decided the white lights which were strobing were much too bright for helicopters.  Just then, two blocks past the intersection, we were right under it.  I turned on the side street and we got out of the car.  The diamond or square shaped as we decided object was just hovering in the sky with no noise.

We estimated it was no more than 100 feet above the ground and the lights were at the corners. We could also see individual squares marked off on the underneath side with carvings or writings of some kind we could not identify.  Some time later I saw a celtic cross and thought the artwork was the same or very similar.  We just stood under it discussing it, mesmerized.  Mainly we talked about its size.  A few minutes into it we saw and heard a jet coming down the same main street toward us.  At almost the same time we spotted the jet, the big craft took off in a northwesterly direction being chased by the jet.

I and two of my friends would always take our dogs out for early morning walks to let them chase rabbits. They never caught any but had a helluva time at it.

The way I've described it to the few I've told this too is that it was kind of like a dog whistle in audible range. For reasons that I do not know I stopped in my tracks and looked up. I saw this ""object"" out of the corner of eye to my right, out over the hills of the southern peninsula in the bay area. I was now looking west-southwest. This thing zipped, and I mean ZIPPED overhead in a somewhat northeasterly direction, disappearing over the foothills to the east in a matter of seconds. With it went the strange pulsing hum. Suddenly, I heard Rick say, ""What are you guys looking at?"". I then proceeded to look forward to where Rick was now standing about ten or so feet further down the trail. Then I looked to my left and my eyes met those of my other friend Craig, who had also stopped in his tracks adjacent to me.. I could tell by the look on his face that he had seen it too! We then proceeded to tell Rick what we had seen. He did not see it but said he remembered the weird sound. The object was circular, kinda dark but was moving so friggen fast little detail could be seen. It left no trail of any kind. The sky was crystal clear and this sighting (and hearing) was very real. It wasn't swamp gas or a meteor, and it sure as hell was not a plane nor jet aircraft. It WAS an Unidentified Flying Object, period.

Worth, Texas twenty three years ago. The date of this even as listed above was never recorded, and even the year 1977 is uncertain.  The witness to this event was driving a station wagon containing his wife and three young children - all of whom were asleep at the time, which was around 1:00 AM.  The vehicle was headed east along IH-20 about mid way between Ft. Worth and Dallas.  After passing some low hills located not far north of the highway the vehicle came to an area which was relatively flat and which perhaps sloped slightly downward from IH-20.  Immediately upon passing the hilly area the driver's attention was called to a location about one mile distant where  a series of lighted orange globes were rising up from the earth - one behind the other - in an arc which brought the string of orange globes to a flight level with the earth at perhaps 1000 feet altitude.  The orange globes were 20 to 30 feet in diameter, around 300 to 400 feet apart, and seemed to be moving at about 30 MPH.  When first seen, there were two globes rising along the arc following five already in single file behind one another.  A new globe arose about every 6 to 7 seconds from the same spot. The area from which the globes were rising seemed to be part of a large wooded residential area, but the witness could not tell what kind of buildings were present because of the trees and the distance.  However, there were no structures evident which were higher than a two storey building. The globes were about the same color as the orange color on a package of Hewlett Packard black ink for printers.  They seemed to be solid and rigid (unlike a balloon), and they were completely round with no appendages, attachments, windows, portholes, or other features.  The orange color was uniform over all the object, and the objects seemed to be lighted as if the surface of each globe had a dim glow.  They DID NOT appear like a balloon with a light source inside.  They appeared to be lighted from within their surface, and NOT as if lighted from outside the globe.  The globes travelled in straight, constant-speed flight - not moving up or down at all. No attempt was made to stop to observe the globes because it seemed dangerous to stop along that segment of IH-20 where there were no houses or businesses, because it was around 1:00 AM, and because the witness was tired from having driven for the previous four hours.  Because there were some major aircraft industries in the Ft. Worth area the witness at first assumed that he was witnessing the testing of some kind of air craft which carried a large light of some type.  But it now seems the orange ball itself was the craft being tested.  But why so many?",2000-06-21T00:00:00,32.757366003227546,-97.34710441097364

I suddenly became very frightened and got a strange ""feeling"" that it was looking for something. Here is where it gets even stranger - I bolted out of bed in total panic and ran into the hall to turn on the light. My screaming had awakened my parents, and when I flipped on the light switch, the ENTIRE HOUSE interior lit up in a brilliant white flash (like an enormous camera bulb flashing) and then the electricity went out for several minutes. Although no one else saw the sphere, my mother witnessed the bright flash and became frightened herself. She had been awakened by a strange ""crackling low hum"" (as she describes it) about a half hour before my incident, and had actually gotten up to look out the window to try and see where the noise was coming from. She saw nothing and said the noise lasted for about 5 minutes. After reading so many UFO sighting reports that mention a correlation between a UFO sighting and an electrical disturbance, my interest in trying to resolve what I saw in my bedroom in 1986 has provoked me to research this event further. Whether it was just ball lightening or of extraterrestial origin, I need to know.",2000-06-21T00:00:00,33.808705515846256,-84.38988231962239

A friend and i were driving along a country road one night when we noticed a bright light in the sky to our SW. We pulled the car over to the side of the road to observe the object. The object was a considerable distance away from us at that time. There was a pasture to our left in between us and the object and all of a sudden the object was at the edge of the pasture over the trees out the drivers side window. It looked maybe the size of a large house. It turned like it was angling down toward us and it was lights,very bright, in the shape of a cross. I personally, at the time felt we were being scanned or analyzed by the object. I don't know if we experienced lost time or what . The next thing i remember was looking at the digital clock in my friends car and it said 11:11 pm. Ever since then, if i'm around a clock at 11:11, i'll automatically look at the clock for some reason. It's really weird. Something just makes me look at the clock at that time. The object backed off a little, slowly and then shot off to the W/NW at great speed. It happened on a country road between Henderson, Oxford, and Youngsville off hwy. 56. There was no other traffic on that rd. at the time. Theres alot of weird stuff going on in this area. Other people have seen things too. I know two guys who live in the Watkins community of Vance Co. which is a very rural area w/ alot of woods, saw one land in the woods behind their house. They walked down in there about 200 yds. and came in contact w/ the object. It made a humming sound and had lights flashing in sequence around it. The closer they got , the faster the lights would flash in sequeqnce. They got scared and ran back to their house. The object was said to be small, about the size of a full sized van. If anybody in the world wants to see some weird, unexplainable stuff in the sky, just come to Henderson for about a week and go out into some of these areas i've described. I'll guarantee you will see something that will blow your mind!!! Theirs something weird going on here, ! theres n o doubt about that. The cross in the sky is not the only thing i've witnessed,by far. It is the closest i've been to one ( I think ). I wish someone would at least come and investigate the weird things that are happening around here. I would gladly assist any way I could. Some, or most people are skeptical to my accounts but i would pass a lie detector test w/ no problem.     Thanks.",2000-06-21T00:00:00,36.352979999999995,-78.387895

It clearly was under controlled flight.  It slowly flipped end over end as it moved.  It was not travelling quickly; it was going at a slow, steady pace.  Even as it moved to the north and I began to lose sight of it I could still trace its path by the fact that the sun glinted off its trailing edge as it continued to flip end over end.

Please contact me On the night of June 6, 1987. I was about three miles outside of the Jackson Lake Lodge resort area, where I had worked. There were four of us hanging out at a foot bridge having a few beers and counting stars, when we saw what we thought was someone walking down a trail with a very bright flashlight. It was swaying back and forth and kind of bobbing up and down. Sort of like a flashlight would if someone was walking with one. I then noticed that the shadow of the tree-line was below the light. I told everyone to watch it and to confirm that I was correct about the light being above the trees. It was very quiet that night. Around there you can hear a car from over five miles away. There was no sound coming from whatever it was we were watching. The more we watched the more we realized that this object looked like a star. I flashed my flash-light at the light hoping (out loud) that I would get a response. I did not get one, I wish I had. I was becoming excited, because it was thrilling to see. The two college age women who were with us became scared, and wanted to go back to the workers dorms. When we returned to the dorms, the light was still in the sky. I pointed it out to two Park rangers and a security officer. I asked them what the saw, and they said a star. I told them to watch it for a while. The security officer and Rangers pretty much ""freaked"" than almost simultaneously announced that it was moving. It was about that time that the two young women came back with a couple of the wranglers to show them the light. Other employees from the Lodge  statred to come over to us to see what it was we were looking at. some lodgers came up to the Rangers to ask what the light was. A small crowd had gathered and we all watched the light together until a little after midnight. It was about that time that the light steadied and started moving in a north-eastern direction and began to dim. We watched until the light began to move only slightly ( or so it seemed) faster and finally blende in with the numerous ! others s tars in that wonderful night sky.",1999-11-17T00:00:00,,

As I was looking tomy right, I did a ""double take"" because I remember thinking quickly that the arrangement of the hills looked different than usual. I saw an extremely large, silver disk hovering (no sound) in between two hills and the port holes, many of them, were clearly visible. It was suspended and I could see the remainder of the darkening sky around the edges of it. I said to my husband ""What in the world is that?"" As I kept my eyes on it I looked then at my daughters and I think they were looking at the shoreline thinking that I was talking about a pretty home or something. I looked at my husband and I don't think he heard me because he didn't respond to my question. I think the engine of the boat was too loud. He still looked straight ahead.

I'm a college English Instructor now.  At the time of this incident, I was working as a receptionist for a law firm, and I was thirty years old.  I grew up in North Carolina, and I am very familiar with our weather and our roads.  I've always considered myself to be open-minded, but at the time that this occured, I was very skeptical of ufo sightings.   It was about 8:30 p.m. on a Sunday.  My former wife and I were leaving town after visiting my grandparents.  It was raining especially hard as we reached the stop sign where we would turn onto highway #1, so I was watching the road intently (I was driving) while my wife was looking at me and telling me some family business.  There was ""nothing coming"" so I turned left onto the highway, into the closer, left lane, and began to accelerate.  I was responding to my wife's comments when I noticed what looked like something dark moving at the edge of the right lane about a hundred feet ahead.  I thought it might be a dog, so I took my foot off the accelerator (we had only gotten up to about thirty miles per hour, and we immediately lost a good deal of that). When the dark spot moved into the middle of the road and was thoroughly illuminated, I was shocked to see that it was not a thing but the absence of something.   Moving into my lane, was a circle about four feet wide of dark pavement, upon which the rain was not falling. I imagined an updraft or other weather anomaly was responsible, but a gust of wind rocked the car, and at the same time, the circle went slightly oval in shape--then back to circular as the wind eased off.  I thought it would fall apart at any second, but it didn't, and as it grew closer, I leaned forward and peered at the edges of the circle.  They were perfectly defined by the rain pummeling itself into mist outside the circle, giving the rest of the road a gray/white look. There appeared to be no transitional area-- absolutely no water was entering the circle. I remember my mouth falling open in shock as I saw this (about fifteen feet away).   Before I could react, our paths were intersecting. I experienced time dilation at that point--the normal kind, caused by adrenalin, which seems to make every- thing go in slow motion. I watched the rain stop pounding on the hood, saw the circular edge move onto the windshield, and then heard the gap in the sound of rain hitting the roof--it was if we had gone under a bridge. Instinctively, I hit the brakes and stared into the rearview mirror.  I saw only the area of road behind us lit up in the red glow of the tailights and that another car was cresting a hill about a mile back. Just as instinctively, when I saw the area lit up with my brakes, I took my foot off the brake pedal out of fear of alerting IT, and sped very quickly away from there.   As I did this, I turned to my confused wife, and in a shaky, excited voice, said, ""Did you SEE that?"" And she responded, ""See what?"" I tried to convince myself it was some sort of weather anomaly and made a mental note to check into it.  About a year later, I read some ufo literature and was shocked to find out how often craft of four feet or under are reported--up until that time, my chief point of scepticism was the small size of the unseen object. (i.e. Who would come across interstellar space in such a tiny craft?)  This could have occured in October or November--I'm just not certain, but I could probably pin it down if I compared my calendar from that year with meteorological data for the area.   Three notes: The area the circle seemed to be coming from is a kudzu- covered swampy forest.  There is a pond nearby and a line of high voltage towers.If the circle was caused by an object overhead, it appeared that this object was moving under its own power when I first saw it, but after entering the illuminated area, it appeared to be at the mercy of the wind.  I think this shows intent--I think we surprised it, and it cut out power movement until we had passed under.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,36.1146,-78.4688

A pre-arranged group of people gathered around a celebration fire after dark on the spring solstice.  Some of the group had traveled up to Nederland to join in the event.  We said prayers to the earth and the directions and the spirits. We blew flutes and drummed. The group was in different stages of the ceremony when two males standing apart from the group looked west to the comet and saw between 15 to 18 space craft flying in formation over the mountain tops towards the group. It took a few moments for the craft to move overhead and past us.  At that time two of the craft broke formation returning to do a low altitude flyby. At this point, those who hadn't seen the first fly over saw the second. The two flew in wing to wing -a few yards apart- and did a zig-zag dance. Which meant at the same moment each craft flew away from each other a few yards and then flew back together.  this was done before thye reached the group.  So that by the time they had flown over they had created a vapor trail and within 15 yards after passing the group they abruptly turned their noses up and flew straight up and away at tremendous speed.  The vapor trail following was easily seen and as the craft flew up nose to tail the vapor swirled like smoke following them.  .....now,as to my witnessing the event. I also was standing apart from the group with a woman friend and my back was to the group while she faced it.  The lunar eclispe was full and the country surrounding us was dark.  It's a very small town and there aren't many city lights.  Now as we talked we heard the group give up a great cry and whoop.  She said, 'look somebody's flying a kite.'  I turned to my right and saw a craft that was about 12ft wide with wings and a center sphere for the flyer.  The two wings were bent in three places like elbows and wrists. From the sphere the wing dipped down a few degrees then one-third out bent again up, at a sharp angle to almost the length and about a foot short bent again with a down wing. The wings where shaped like a long skinny triangle with the end points showing lighted opake(sp)tips. The sphere was also partly lit. The sight of the craft did not throw me because as a clairvoyant I have seen space craft before.  But none of the others in the group had had my experience.  My thought at first when my friend told me about the kite was that it was a mistake. We dismissed the idea and said go night to each other and she left.  When I walked back over to the group some 20 yards away in the darkness I was approached by several in the group who were all smiles and laughing excitedly.  After they began telling me what just happened, I began asking questions to each one separatly.  They all said the same thing basically but the two males standing apart proved to be the most interesting in their witness.  Each one told me a different number of craft but it didn't matter to me. What was the most compelling to me was the description that I saw matched their's. Especially the lighted tips of the wings.  Well many of the group that kept in contact over the next week were blown away. At first it was really cool and something they had waited years to see.  But as the week went on the event began to shock them and really bother them in many respects. It's different to think you see a ship, most of these folks are new-agers and try to be open, but when the encounter is like this one, up-close with plenty of witnesses, it throws the thinking around. This was also around the time of the Arizona sightings.  Nederland is 18 miles west up the mountain from Boulder.  I did enter this information on a site but had no idea who to talk to. I had just heard of the Art Bell show and hadn't even tuned in to the program.  Well anyway I thought I would pass this along.  Small craft with a sphere for a center and oragami wings that bent for flight control.  The reason my friend thought she saw a kite was the lighted tipped wings and the swirling vapor trail that looked like the tail of a kite.  My witnessing came from my psychic sensing of a foriegn object in the area.  The picture I received was a left-over image of the craft.  This is hard to explain but the craft had departed before I had even turned to see what my friend was talking about.  My view was the craft eight feet off the ground at level flight. ((NUFORC Note:  We are not certain of the date, but the solstice occurs on 21MR.  The comet was most dramatic on Sunday, 23MR97, so we have arbitrarily assigned a date.  It may be incorrect.))",2000-02-16T00:00:00,39.9822,-105.5501

I looked up.  It was a V or boomerang shaped craft.  It was not a triangle.  Take a V and spread it apart. I stood gazing up as it flew at low altitude, directly over me and down the path that I was walking.  It seemed to be a bit smaller than a 747, yet it sounded more like a small plane.  It was going slow enough, so that I was able to study it and remember what it looked like. It was dull silver metal, like an ordinary plane.  There were no markings whatsoever.  It was perfectly smooth with no projections such as a tail, or point or anything at all.  There were no propellers.  There was a single white flashing light at the end of each wing span.  There were two small yellow objects more toward the center.  Maybe they were additional lights, but they were not on. In the past week, I have scoured the Internet and books, and have not been able to locate this craft.  It is not a Stealth.  It almost looked like a Northrop YB-49, but no propellers and very smooth.

I was on the PC, and a little slow to come out until my wife said ""Oh my God, come out and look at this. I don't believe it."" I went outside and walked into the front yard. There, West SW from my house, about 40 degrees above the horizon, was what looked like a fat pulsating star. It was changing brilliant colors. Magenta, Aqua, Turquoise, Green, Gold, unlike primary colors. It changed color rapidly, but pulsed at a slower frequency. It was quite obvious even with the naked eye that it was pulsating and changing colors. You could see the diameter of it. It reminded me of what Jupiter might look like at times. At arms length, about 1/8 inch diameter. Round and pulsating. It appeared to be much too fat for a star, but otherwise you could not tell size, distance was uncertain. It did not appear to be in space, it was in the sky. It was very weird to be able to watch it for so long. It appeared to remain in the same part of the sky, until we lost it in the glare of the highway lights while chasing towards it in a car. A friend who was visiting happened to have a nice SONY Handycam with Night Shot infrared and 72x digital zoom. We got some great footage of it, first without the infrared. It is not like anything I am aware of that is normal in the sky. We got a good 10 or 20 minutes of it. Then we chased it in the car, but it was obviously a few miles away at least. But the best part was when we switched it to Night Shot Infrared. The object was too far away too be painted by the camera. What we shot was the infrared signature of the object, mixed with monochrome, and it really is spectacular. It looks like a pulsing fog, with a bright triangular nucleus that is spinning rapidly. Like a cell made of light with a spinning triangle for a nucleus. I will get the video uploaded to the internet and post it.

Has no sound.  Very large.  Tiny dim lights around edges. On the eigth of May, I witnessed a black triangular craft fly over our house three times in the course of about a half an hour.  My father saw it first, and called me outside.  After waiting for a couple of minutes, it showed up again, cruising slowly and silently, directly over the house.  The object was about five hundred feet up, and I could see the structure that the lights were attached to.  There were lights along the two leading edges, and the back was slightly inverted.  I would estimate that the object was about one hundred yards across.  After we lost sight of it, we waited, and it returned within five minutes, this time headed in the opposite direction, as if it had made a turn, and come directly over us once again.  We waited for it show up again, and about ten minutes later we saw it make a turn towards Foothill (Mountains).  We were out there four nights in a row, and it is almost guaranteed to show up.  It usually flys over from about 9:45 to about 10:30 P.M.  We both get the impression that the craft (or whoever may be piloting it) knows when we spot it.  Due to the way it flys directly over the house, it seems to want to make contact of some sort.  Last year around this time of year, the same thing was happening.  It gives me and my father a very eery feeling everytime it flies over.  My father works for the county of Santa Barbara, and I'm a junior at Carpinteria High School, 16 years old.

These preliminary impressions on the part of the witness apparently did not bear out under investigation.  John Kirby and Skip Schultz, State Director, can be reached over the internet, or through NUFORC.)) [This is being written by MUFON investigator, John Kirby, section director, Multnomah County, Oregon] Witness was stopped at a traffic light at the corner of 72nd and Woodstock in Portland.  While waiting for the light to change, there was a brilliant flash ""for just a few milliseconds"" in front of her vehicle and up about 10 feet in the air (very approximate height).  When the flash occurred, power went out in the area -- the traffic light went off, street lights went off, and lights in a tavern at the intersection went off. Her car continued to operate and so did a car across the intersection (that car turned left just after the incident).  The witness was ""temporarily blinded"" by the brightness of the flash and said that things looked dark all around (presumably / possibly) by her eyes' reaction to the light. The power came back on in just 1-2 seconds both at the traffic light and at the nearby structures.  Street lamps did not come back on. None of the other drivers (there were at least two other cars nearby) seemed to react unusually (they continued to drive on when the light changed).  Nobody got out of their car to look, etc. Investigator's opinion: This is consistent with an electrical arc (short circuit, fault) on a power line near / above the intersection.  When this occurred, presumably a circuit breaker opened (cut off the power) to the area.  Usually circuit breakers used in power systems are configured to reset after a few seconds, and if the short circuit is cleared, the power will come back on and stay on.  I have been told by members of the power company that small animals or birds sometime straddle power lines causing a temporary short circuit. The animals are unfortunately killed or seriously injured in the process, and are knocked free of the wires by the explosion.  Therefore the short circuit is ""cleared"" immediately and the power is restored in a few seconds.  This could also be caused by debris falling on wires and temporarily shorting the line. I did not go out to look at the wires to see if there is an obvious place where short circuits might occur, but I may do that in the coming few days. Note that the reason why the street lights did not come back on immediately is likely due to the fact that lights commonly used by cities, such as mercury vapor lamps, if the power is cut off for even just a moment, will take a few minutes to restart. When this explanation was proposed to the witness, she said that it made sense to her.",2000-06-06T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

It was then that I (and my fiancé) realized what we had seen.  We looked at each other and acknowledged the facts; we had seen a UFO.

I was in the restroom and I heard a large rumbling sound, like thunder. Then it started to get louder, and car alarms started going off. I pulled up my pants and started to leave the restroom and as I did I noticed that the sound was growing faint. I ran out front, and looked up. I didn't see anything and the rumbling was growing softer. Now I might have contributed this to a storm of some sort, but there was barely a cloud in the sky and the few that were there, were thin and light. Then as the rumbling was almost gone and the car alarms shut off, I saw in the distance a ""U.F.O."" (And when I say U.F.O. I mean Unidentified Flying Object, not a flying saucer nescisarily) of some sorts. It was to far away for me to make out and it seamed to be moving to fast to be a typical plane. As it moved behind some trees (or at least from my perspective), I started scanning the sky for it incase it might have changed course while not in my line of sight. Then from a different angle, what appeared to be a silver shooting star streaked across the sky from my perspective due to my proximity, it was about a foot. But it was a weird shooting star, at least to me. I've never known a shooting star to look silvery, and to appear shoot across then disappear in a small flash.

The object gradually lessened in intensity and almost seemed to disappear but then I noticed it had not disappeared but had slowed and was hovering east of my home and was now about the same brightness as the surrounding stars. In fact, I thought I had lost it at first because it looked so much like a star. Then, the object began to grow brighter and brighter until it reached approximately the same color as it was when I initially saw it and zoomed off to the east. Shortly after the first ""object"" took off to the east, a second object which appeared to be much lower than the first crossed the sky in about the same path except lower at a high rate of speed.

I considered all the possible explainations for what I had just seen but could find no explaination for what they were. There were no port or starboard recognition lights or beacons on these craft, they made no noise and they travelled at a very high rate of speed.

Everytime we pass Newark airport, we watch the planes land and take off , sometimes we get a really good view. We were watching the planes land and come in as I passed the airport. As we traveled we saw a few more planes coming in, like always from off in the distance- no big deal. As we got near exit 11 going south I saw the sun glint off another plane in the distance and looked away. It was traveling north toward us to the left of the north bound lanes. It glinted again so I looked at it. Another plane I thought. As we got closer I thought oh, its a helicopter. As I looked I could see it was round in front but it didnt look right. As we got closer I started asking myself in my mind, 'What the !@$%#@! is that? ' It was just a big round silver ball. After thinking this about twice I said outloud ,""Bob, what the !$#@! is that??? "" I was surprised to hear my own voice in a igh pitch to. He was staring at it to. It was round like a ball and silver and about -he said three miles to our left- I think it was closer about two miles away. It just kept traveling toward us and passed us on the left moving faster than any plane we have ever seen going to Newark airport.  I was driving, and as it passed us on the left I got a real good view. It was silver and round about the size of a helicopter- there were no windows- lights- nothing on it at all and heres the part that got us , it moved in a perfect straight line as it traveled -no wobble- no up or down no side to side or spinning motions. It just went straight. There was no noise no smoke nothing. To us it looked to be made of a solid metal,it glisted real bright from the sun off in the distance which first got our attention- Bob said thats when it turned- I didn't see it turn. Right after we say it the radio had static on it - we were listening to CBS 101.1 FM. I didn't pay much attentio to this because of what we saw. Bob said he saw it glint and watched it and it turned to go north following the NJTP. I saw it glint and took my eyes off of it and only saw it go in a straight line after watcing it after the second glint. We agreed that it was up about 2000 feet and the only clouds were way off in the distance far away. The sun was out and the sky was very clear. So it moved about five to seven miles toward us in a straight line followig the NJTP going north. The whole event lasted about 30 seconds or so. When I first saw it we must have been doing about 60 mph -I know I slowed down during the event but probably didnt go under 50 mph.  We both had the same thoughts - its a plane - no its a helicopter- what is it???? I looked at the time and it read 10:24 (AM) right after this happened. Allot of people had to see this thing. The NJTP was packed as usual and the sky was perfect. This thing was going much faster than the planes that go to Newark airport . Maybe you can contact someone and see if it was picked up on radar. A few minutes after the event I thught it might have been some type of ballon. But - could a balloon travel that fast?? And the part that reall gets me! Can a ballon  travel at 'helicopter level' in a perfectly straight line? I mst have watched it travel for several miles and thought it was an aircraft until it got within a mile or so. I know other people saw this. If its a government device - I say this because it followed the northbound lane the way cruise missles followed highways during the Gulf war - why did they test it under clear skys during the day i such a very busy area?

I had seen a similar light the year before only the light was due East.  My son actually observed this with me and we watched it approximately 20 minutes.  Interestingly, the on both occassions the light was missing at the same time the following day.  I assumed that it was a ""blinking"" star at first but it did not move nor did it seem to travel at all during the time that I was watching it. There was no 2nd guessing the second event because it was directly in the middle of two of my tall trees.  I would not have had difficulty finding it again but it just wasn't there the next night. ((NUFORC Note:  The description of the first sighting seems consistent with a ""twinkling"" star.  However, we have no explanation for why the object did not appear the next night.  We receive many reports like this, and our only guess is that the celestial object is in a slightly different part of the sky at the time the witness attempts to look at, or for, the object a second time.  Most non-scientifically oriented observers are not very experienced at looking at the night sky, we observe.  Just a guess, however.  PD))",2000-08-05T00:00:00,,

I located and observed the object for about 5 to 7 seconds before I lost sight. It was an oblong oval shaped object, greater in height then width, black or dark gray in color, and at first I thought it might be a hot air balloon, but then I realized the shape was wrong because it was  symetrical about the horizontal axis and it was moving very fast, at least with the velocity of an aircraft.

Witnesses were using a Mead ETX 125 and binoculars to ID messier objects for pleasure viewing.   A bright (brighter than any star)  Blue light was observed coming from close to North, first noticed at about 75 degress above horizon (moving south).   We initially assumed it to be a satelitte.  The light quickly varied from bright to VERY bright,  and sumultaneously turned sharply to move in a Easternly direction.  Light diminished dramatically after turn, and light did not move in a straight line but swerved sharply as it traveled in a generally Easternly direction.   We were able to observe with both the binoculars and the Mead, as speed was very slow (very similar to a normal satalitte speed), but the object remained a blue point source under magnification.  One member of the party (the guy with the binoculars), indicated that the object had a less bright companion about 10 degress south (higher in the sky) that shadowed its movments, but the others in the party did not see this object.  Object crossed perhaps 40 degress of sky before disappearing (slowly disappeared).   Most disconcerting was anomolous movement.   Turns were far to tights for any aircraft we were familiar with. 2nd observation occured about 15 minutes later.   Again an object appeared from north, at about the same location.  However, brightness did not seem to vary during sighting.  The object (moderately bright blue light),  was noticed at about 60 degress above horizon moving south (via binoculars.   Object moved to about 75 dgress above northern horizon, met two other objects that were stationery at that spot (we had assumed were stars), then all thre objects moved ""as one triangular structure"" to the east.  We carefully observed background stars between objects as the triangle moved east (with binoculars and the Mead scope).   The triangular formation was intially isoceles, but the lead object moved slightly north during the easternly flight so that the formation apeared as a right triangle by the time the objetcs faded in the east (there was a little haze in the eastern sky in the direction of Lake Tahoe).  Again speed was very similar to satellite motion.  All three objects were exactly the same brightness (blue points of light).

As the formation was flying, the 90-degree angle was in the lower-left position. These objects were certainly in space and possibly satellites, only if there are satellites flying in such formation. Since I am unaware of any satellites flying in a perfect triangular position, I am contemplating the possibility of UFO's. From Earth, the objects looked similar to orbitting satellites.

Early in the evening on July 20th, I was traveling with a friend Eastbound on Ocean Parkway, Long Island. Coincidentally, we were on our way to Robert Moses State Park for a sky observation session. The Southern side of Ocean Parkway faces the Atlantic Ocean, consisting of a relatively small amount of undeveloped land. We had just passed a sign stating ""Turtle Nesting Area next 6 miles."" The beaches in the area are known for bird and animal nesting. Following, however, were a mass amount of ""Do Not Enter"" and ""No Stopping"" signs. Not unusual, but in a mass quantity for such a small area. As we continued, we noticed unmarked, darkly colored helicopters in the area, hovering over the Southern side near the ocean. It was about 20:00, and we assumed the helicopters were watching traffic conditions. Although, it was rather late for rush hour, and they displayed no markings. After leaving the observation session, we traveled Westbound on Ocean Parkway. As we approached the Jones Beach area, we noticed a small red object on the Southern side of the parkway. It appeared as a glowing red Chevron. The ends were a darker red, but the center was lit up as though there were a bright white bulb inside. I had no perspective relating to the height of the object. It appeared as though it could be very small, about 15 feet above the ground. However, it could have been further out, possibly above the ocean, causing it to look small from our standpoint. We pulled the car over to the side of the road. As we watched, the object moved almost like a kite. It moved back and forth rapidly over a small area, with no apparent travel direction. The object then dropped a white glowing bulb-like object, and continued to glow red, but duller. Shortly after, the object decsended, or fell, out of the air. The event lasted for a minute and a half, which is when we continued travel down the road. We decided to turn around and look for any other activity. We took the next U-turn to find a car pulled over on the Southern side of the parkway, facing East. There was a man inside, and he watched us as we passed him by. He didn't seem to be doing anything that would warrant pulling over. There was no interior light on, no ciggarette, no tire changing, no other passenger. He was gone the next time we drove by. After a couple of times passing the event area, we decided to head home. On our way, we saw many airplanes overhead. We looked carefully to make sure they weren't anything else. One such craft caught our attention. It had no obvious shape, as it was rather dark. We were travelling west on Ocean Parkway, and it appeared to be hovering, and moving in a general Southern direction. We would have assumed it to be a plane, but it would move, then hover, then change directions in a way that a regular plane would not be able to maneuver. Some information about the observers: I have never seen, or claimed to have seen a 'ufo' before this account. That's not to say that I don't believe. I do, but if I see something unusual, I tend to force myself to believe something for the sake of being able to say I've seen something. When I saw the helicopters, I didn't think much of it. When I saw the red object, I assumed it to be some kind of toy. Maybe a lit-up toy plane, or some kind of light-up kite. When the object fell out of it, I thought maybe that a light bulb fell out of the toy, so the user brought the toy down to fix it. When I saw the strange man, I figured he was pulled over for a reason. When I finally saw the last strange flying object, I decided there was something wrong. Taken separately, the occurences can be somewhat normal. Howver, when I put them together, the results fit together in a strange way, and suggest some abnormal events.",2000-07-29T00:00:00,,

Possibly a second sighting. I have pasted the sighting information I am referring to at the end of my account regarding same.  I respond to this as a possible additional witness to this event, my account is as follows:   I was working as a long haul truck driver and viewed this ""thing"" from the north bound New Jersey Turnpike, off and on, between Newark International Airport and exit 3 where I was to exit the turnpike, and proceed west to my destination.  My reference to seeing the object ""off and on"", has to do with observing it, and continuing to drive the vehicle, not that the object would disappear and reappear.  I too am unsure of the exact date, however, after coming across this, I will be digging out my old log books to pinpoint it precisely.  I was able to view it consistently for about 3 or 4 minutes when I had to sit stopped in traffic at exit 3.  It was at this time I was also able to further verify, in my mind, that I was seeing something, I did not know what it was.  I even tried to see if the event was being reported on the FM radio in the truck by hitting the scan button, as well as a radio scanner I had in the vehicle, finally, of course the C.B.   My search of the airwaves on the radios yielded nothing out of the ordinary.  I also wondered if any one in New York City was looking up that day since I was not hearing outside news of this event. This ""thing"" was egg or blimp shaped and dull silver in color.  It was, from my vantage point at exit 3, hovering then moving slowly forward and back, in front of the World Trade Center Towers.   As I observed it during my travel from where I first saw it, (Newark International Airport), until I got stopped in traffic at exit 3, I figured it was a small blimp, or balloon used for advertising.  When I got stopped in traffic at exit 3 and able to study the object closer, IE: with out distraction, I assured myself it was NOT a blimp or a balloon.  It had no fins, no control gondola, no appendages of any kind that you would expect to see on a balloon or blimp, nor did it have any advertising on it.   As I continued to watch this ""thing"" a white Bell Jet Ranger helicopter approached it, and appeared to be in close proximity to it.  The object would have been about 2.5-3.5 times the size of the helicopter that was approaching it.   I was unable to see what happened next, as the helicopter continued to approach, since traffic started to move.  When I was able to again direct my attention back to the object, a minute or so later, it, and the helicopter, were gone.  The weather was clear and sunny that day.  This is not the first time I have seen an object like this, the last time was in 93 just west of Deming NM, and south of I-10.  At least I have one nagging question answered regarding this, if we did indeed see the same thing, at least I was not the only one looking up that day!

There was about 5 of us heading home to Memphis from St. Louis on Sunday morning around 1:30 a.m. and i was looking out the front window from the back seat when i saw what i thought was a star shining abnormally bright.  i told my friend, who was driving, to look and she agreed with me that it was way too big and bright to be a star.  everyone else in the car was asleep, and i didn't want to disturb them if it was nothing.  i made her pull over off the highway at a closed down gas station so we could get out and have a better look.  there were no other lights around and we were in the middle of nowhere arkansas, so it made our inspection easier. it seemed to grow bigger almost like it was headed in our direction, and eventually we could see that it was moving towards us at a consistent speed.  once it was almost above us it just stopped and stayed in the same place for a good while.  during this time is when we noticed that it looked as if it was rotating while morphing into other shapes.  it would go from a sphere, to a diamond, and then to a cigar shape.  it kept moving from shape to shape the whole time, but there was no sound. after about 7 minutes or so of this we saw what looked to be tiny particles of energy or something to that effect pulsating off the object, only to disappear when it got out far enough from it.  the energy was yellowish-orange, and the object itself was just about the same in color.  we stood there and watched it for a little bit before it occured to me that i should try and wake everybody else up, and also that i just happened to have my camera.  i raced to the car and tried to get everyone up by yelling excitedly and literally shaking them, but for some odd reason no one even stirred.  i was afraid that whatever it was would disappear before i could snap a photo so i gave up on them quickly and grabbed my camera instead.  i wasn't sure if the pictures would even come out right so i thought just in case i would take some with the flash on and some with the flash off.  i took! two wit hout it first, then i proceeded to take two with the flash on.  i wanted to show it's size in comparison to the moon so when the pictures were developed you could get some sort of an idea.  right after i took the first picture with the flash on the object flashed back at us with a bright white light.  then i took the other one and the same thing happened!  it was so crazy.  after gawking at this thing for a total of about 30 minutes we decided that we had to get back on the road.  we were headed in the general direction of the object, so we could keep our eye on it while we were driving.  i looked out one of the side windows and i saw another one that had appeared out of nowhere beside us.  it was a litle bit smaller than the first one, but it changed shapes and eminated energy like the other did.  after driving for about 15 minutes or so i saw the 2nd one flash a big flash, and then all of a sudden it was gone.  i told my friend what had just happened so we assumed the other one would do something soon as well.  it did the exact same thing about a minute later, and it too was gone just like that.  i made my friend pull over on the side of the highway so i could take another picture of the place where the object was in conjunction with the moon again.  for proof i guess.  the next day i took my film to be developed not thinking anything would happen. i had marked special instructions on the envelope stating that i wanted every picture back, even the ones that were messed up. several days later when i went to retrieve my photos, i saw pictures that turned out good, and pictures that turned out bad and blurry, but no pictures that i had taken of what i believed to be a ufo a few days before.  somebody had removed those pictures!!  i immediately checked for the negatives, and all were there except the 4 that i had taken of the object. you could even tell that the negatives had been cut. only the negative of the very last picture that i had taken that night with the moon when the ufo disappeared remained of ! that nig ht.  so now all i have is our story.",2000-06-21T00:00:00,,

It was July 4th 1998, and I was at a roofdeck party on Beacon Hill in Boston with many friends.  We had just heard the Boston Pops play from the Esplanade (a large park area that borders the Charles River on the Boston side) and had seen the fireworks display.  The show ended approximately 23:00.  I was standing with three other friends looking out over the river and noticed that there were two spotlights on the Cambridge side of the river waving across the sky.  One of them stopped moving so I was wondering who was operating them.  Students perhaps?  An old MIT prank?  Anyway, that was what made me look in that direction.  While I was observing this I also noticed all the smoke from the fireworks slowly drifting over the river toward Boston Harbor.  While I was observing the spotlights and smoke, I noticed a spherical shape floating discreetly among the clouds of smoke.  The sphere had no lights, no sound, and when one of the beams of the spotlights hit the object I noticed it was silverish metallic with a raised ridge going around its equator.  I called my friends' attention to what I was seeing and we all began to discuss.  We had time because it was moving rather slowly.  We first thought, ""It must be a balloon"".  But, judging by the distance between our location on Beacon Hill and the Sphere's position in the smoke over the river, the balloon would have been the size of two automobiles.  Also, it's movement was extremely steady and straight.  It didn't move up or down or sideways, just straight toward the ocean.  We watched it as it passed over the Museum of Science and then it just disappeared.  I've never seen anything like it, and I would find it hard to believe that no one else noticed it, aside from the fact that not too many people watch the smoke after a fireworks display is over....everyone is looking to make their way home instead.  I would love to find out if anyone else saw this.  My friends and I are still puzzled to this day.",2000-06-21T00:00:00,42.3416629506008,-71.06563371161549

It was nearly straight up, moving VERY slow to the north.  It looked like a star.  It kept its course going north, I figured it must be at 30,000-40,000 feet.  About as large as one wing of a commercial jet flying at 35,000.  I watched it for about 10 minutes in which it had traveled to about 45 degrees above north horizon.  Then it got close to a cloud and changed course to the WNW.  I was able to follow it for about 3 more minutes before it was to far away to see.  Broken clouds where at I would guess 10,000 feet and moving to east.  There was some cotton seeds blowing in wind at I would guess 100 feet, they where moving north also.  Then about 10 minutes later I saw another one!  This one appeared slightly to the northeast of direct above.  It was moving slightly faster and to the west.  There where more clouds and when it went behind one it actually was in front of it.  The strange thing is it went from a star light like object to dark, it showed up against the white cloud!  When it came out from in front of cloud it was still white/star like.  It changed course after about 1 minute and started moving NNW.  I watched it pass in front of some more clouds and lost sight of it as it got to far away.  I do not think it could be a balloon because it was at a lesser altitude than the clouds yet they where moving in different directions.  I'll never know what it was, but it was not a airplane or helicopter.  It was like a ""light"" than just a white object.  Must not have been to large since it was at a lower altitude than I first thought it was. You won't believe it but I saw it again on Tuesday.  I noticed it almost straight up slightly to the east.  Did not move for a couple of minutes.  Then started to drift SLOWLY to south.  Then started to move slowly north.  Meandered to east.  At this time it ""faded"" but was still visible.  It brightened back to original intensity.  Then picked up some speed, although still very slow, began moving NNW.  Then WNW.  Followed it to around 30 degrees above horizon.  I had to ask myself if I was imagining it.  This time I tried to keep my head still to see what kind of movement I could detect.  It seemed, although I can't be for sure, that it would meander back forth to and fro.  It is bright enough that if you pointed it out to someone they would be able to see it easily.  I have no explanation.  There where no clouds.  Still saw cotton seeds at lower altitudes.  Does anyone know if they gather into huge balls?  I have seen small clumps like 10 joined together but they are not in a perfect sphere.  This is Wednesday and I did not see it today.  I am going to bring binoculars tomorrow just in case.  I followed it this time for 20+ minutes.  Do not remember which direction wind was blowing.",2000-07-29T00:00:00,39.86983888888889,-104.78707037037039

It approached and i was scared, it looked like it was doing about 35mph over the treeline, it stoppedon top the trees about 300 yds away it made no noise.  I take 8 pictures over the whole time.  My uncle shines his light at the orange orb which is about 20ft wide, it flashed and took off at super sonic spead.  From then we saw it oune an hour.  The second time we saw it ,its color changed white and it was flying under a jet plane, then it paused in the air then shot off into the sky.   An hour later it reappears and it was flaoting right over the water coming staight for us, my uncle patled the boat near the bank and we hid under some shrubery.  We saw it again about an hour after that this time it paused over the trees, my uncle shined his light at it and it shot off into the sky and that was the last time we saw it.

All of a sudden the ""flames"" collapsed in on themselves, seemingly sucked into the center. What was left was a flashing light that jumped around the sky, seemingly at random. Then the object began moving south-southeast, almost directly at us. It flew in basically a straight path but it would jump around from time to time. It was disconcerting to watch. It didn't seem to obey the laws of flight we are familiar with. It passed within a few miles of us. I kept my binoculars trained on it the entire time. It was saucer-shaped, with multi-colored lights moving around its edges, a large white light at the bottom and a smaller red light on top. My girlfriend got scared and ran inside the lookout. I stayed on the catwalk to watch it. It went through the sky at sort of a 45-degree angle; not flat like a frisbee. It flew, still jumping around some, over the San Joaquin Valley. AS far as I could tell, it stopped at about five thousand feet above Woodlake or Lindsay, somewhere in that area. There it remained, nearly motionless, for several minutes. Then, from the west (the direction of Lemoore Naval Air Station) there came several flashing white lights, five or six of them. These lights behaved like helicopters. Above these lights was a another, larger light which behaved like a large airplane. As these lights approached the object, the object suddenly shot nearly straight up, going from five thousand to about 30,000 feet in a blink of an eye. There it remained while the white lights flew around the airspace it had occupied (searching?). I kept my binos trained on it for many minutes until my eyes became watery. I wiped them off and when ! I looked up it was gone. The white lights eventually peeled off and returned to the west.",1999-11-17T00:00:00,,

Size could not be determined, but smaller than an automobile. I first thought the light my be a reflection in my windshield; I looked back to see if there were such a light and there was not.  I then thought it might be a small meteorite, but because of it's translucence and because I have witnessed several of these in my lifetime, I knew that it was not.  Further, it's trajectory was not consistent with all the other meteorites I had seen previously. Lastly, I can also state that the weather was such that I knew it was not ball lightning. The object travelled very slowly and as it started to descend over and into the city of Newport, the light simply blinked out--it was definitely the strangest thing I've ever seen.  It was definitely NOT a ""alien aircraft"", but rather I believe some sort of atmospheric event that has yet to be explained.  I would compare it to the same sort of events that appear to precipitate seismic activity on the West Coast.

It then sped up and away. My brother and I were changing a shifter in his car when our dog started going nuts.  The dog ran up and down the driveway barking wildly, as he did only when someone was coming up the driveway.  I ran out (we had the car parked over the old cellar steps) to see who was coming up the driveway, and saw that the dog was looking up.  I looked up to see what he (the dog) was barking at and saw this grey triangular outline with orange lights against the clouds.  The triangle was moving slowly going west to east.  It had glowing orange lights in each angle of the triangle.  I measured the size by holding my arm out and judging the lights to be about the size of a large pea at an arms length (that would be one of the three lights).  The object was perfectly silent.  On the farm at 5:00 in the middle of summer it is pretty quiet.  There was no wind at all.  It was very still and perfectly quiet.  Absolutely no sound came from the object.  It moved at what seemed to be a very slow steady speed as it went directly overhead, with the dog going nuts the whole time.  I called to my brother to get out there to see it but he was putting something together on the shifter and didn't come right away.  As the object passed over our farm and went over the feild. it began to speed up and raise in altitude.  This change was very obvious, even to me.  It really sped up and it cruised up right off into the clouds.  At about this time, my brother came out and asked what I wanted.  I said ""man you missed it"".  The dog ran out into the feild and went probably about 1/2 mile before he gave up and came back.  Just directly West of our driveway was our neighbors runway.  He was a crop duster and when he landed, he flew at pretty low altitude right over our house. Our dog was very used to that and could care less when it happened.  This was very different.

I saw the object at the above time and location, from my back garden whilst having a cigarette. It appeared from the NE above the roof of my home, and headed towards the SW. It was travelling at great speed. I estimated it to be about 9 times faster than a comercial jet. My home was under a flight path from Heathrow, so I constantly saw jets high in the sky travelling over from the west to the east. The object was a dim, slightly glowing orange disk. The center was brighter than the outside edge. It was high, but still below the cloud deck, which was at its usual hight that evening. There were clouds dotted around the sky, and no other objects/jets etc visible at the time. As an amateur astronmer I instantly knew that this was not any kind of natural phenomena. Nor was it was like any kind of aircraft I had ever seen before. This was all the more obvious because of its great speed and silence. When the object had traversed about two thirds of the way across the sky it suddenly changed direction by about 10 degrees. The change of direction was 'instant', showing no curvature or arc during the maneuver. The object was silent for the entire time I saw it which, due to its speed was only about 4 or 5 seconds. The object left no vapour trail of any kind. It disapeared into the SW over houses and out of my sight. The direction was roughly towards the town's main park...Cassiobury. As it was Christmas eve I had family and friends staying with me. I went into the house and told them all. They advised me to contact the local newspaper, but I didn't. The reason for me remembering the time and date so well were of course due to the fact that it was December the 24th.

I had notice to the north of me some lights . coming toward our direction . didn't think much of it at first . but i noticed it was kind of low for a plane or jet . For that matter. So i watched it for sometime as it was approaching us . It had theese bright lights you might see omn a jet landing at an airport . But knowing that there wasn't , no airport close enough for it to land on . I kept watching it . By now it wasn't more than maybe fifty feet from , us. i noticed as it approached it had about six big lights on the front . But after it got wthin a certain distance , of us . it seem to have shut off some of them . As if to disguise , its approach . So by now my son andf i are watching this . now it was about 35 ft. and closing . it was about 25 ft above the ground . we could not here no sound coming from it . but from what  i saw . It must have been between 75-100 ft wide . it didn't shine no color lights at this time . By it , was crusing maybe at about 15mph toward us . At this point my son and i have got scared , So we hid behind our car . And i would peek up for a minute to see if it was still there . It was within at least 15 ft from us , by now . Now this is what happened next . i had ducked behind the car again . hopping it would pass. So i looked and it wasn't there , but it was to the west of us, no more than 10-15ft . to our west . itwasjust hoovering about 20ft or lower above the ground . it was within walking distance from where we was . Which was about 10ft . so i took noticed to look at my watch , it was a little past 10:30pm . As we walked over to it . As we approached i could see it had a dome on top . but it wasn't low enough to see into to it . I could just make out the top of it . As we stood underneath it . I took my flashlight , asnd shined up toward it . Sincwe i figure it would reflect my light . but it didn't . there was no reflection at all. It was black at least it looked black under it . becuse you couldn't see it from the bottom . but i was able to see the outline of it . it wasn't completly round .it had small wings on itsside it looked like . anyway , as i stood underit with my son . i ask him wouldn't it be great if wee got to take a ride in it . so we looked toward this our house , and started to walk away . When this light surrounded us . And the next tthing i knew it was 11;30 . I could here myself talking to my son .

At first, we assumed that these reports resulted from the missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at approximately 1816 hrs. (PST) on this date.  However, many witnesses in Oregon express strong opposition to this theory, stating that what they saw did not look like a missile launch, and the object observed illuminated the ground with a beam, or cone (?), of light.  This sighting occurred 82 minutes after the missile launch.  Moreover, our theory is predicated on the assumption that a missile launched from near Los Angeles could be seen from northern Oregon.

It was the fastest thing I had ever seen (I was an Air Force brat and have been around planes since I was a kid).  We followed the lights to the east when they made a very sudden ZIG ZAG and disappeared.  I timed this afterwards by counting the time it took for me to move my head to see this - it was seven (7) seconds, and then it was gone. We rose early in the morning of Sunday January 30, 2000 about 5.15 am PST to see the last quarter of the moon and how close Venus was to it. Our property is in the north part of the city of Palm Springs - higher than the town itself, so there isn't light reflection from the city.  My partner went outside on to the patio and turned all the lights off.  After looking at the moon we then tilted our heads to look at the stars in the clear desert sky -it was exceptionally clear.  As I looked back to the east I saw two lights, very very high, moving very very fast and said to my partner - look at those lights, what's that?  The lights moved eastward and then after a few (maybe 5 seconds)seconds, zig zagged sharply to the left and then disappeared.  I was very careful to note the time and then timed the incident again by moving my head (I'd previously timed it by saying one and two and - to get the seconds count.  I subsequently (during the day I timed a jet) and found that the jet was 5 times slower than what we had seen.  The lights moved together; they were tiny, almost pinpoint but the lights themselves were really bright even though small.  There was just one object even although we couldn't see any form.

There are a few reasons that make me believe the report is a prank. First of all, the neighborhoud in wich the factory was located in a dense urban area. If a UFO or any other flying craft would have landed in this area, someone else should have noticed too. Secondly, there was a full-scale investigation to determine what the cause of the accident and the results concluded that the containers containing the pyrotechnics, weren't safe and the person who lit the fire has confessed to the fact that he had lit the fire. I am a resident of the town of Krommenie, wich is locared about an hour driving from Enschede. I read the full accident report, and I visited the site.   I think its a shame that an organisation such as NUFORC is fooled by a prank report and this could have been prevented if your screeners just did a little more background checking of the accident.

Since the light covered no distance in the sky a possible explanation would be that something under some degree of control (?) passed through the sun's light as the object either exited or enter the earth's atmosphere. This idea parallels video tapes on television which seem to spotlight mysterious objects in the earth's high atmosphere. This UFO report is similar to other website reports of objects at satellite/star level.",2000-07-23T00:00:00,47.03031595092024,-122.89693098159509

A married couple in their 50's who are neighbors of mine were sitting on their front porch on Friday 7/14 and reported a strange phenomenon at a distance of about two city blocks, looking west toward the Tooele Army Depot.  Please keep in mind that these people are not very articulate and described what they saw in very simple terms (their description in quotes).  A ""beam of light"", possibly six to eight ft. in width, suddenly descended to the ground from an unknown source.  They indicated no source but described the light as similar to that of a ""police helicopter shining its spotlight"".  There was no sound.  The light stayed trained on the same spot for perhaps less than a minute and then seemed to ""disintegrate"" in an upward direction during which there were ""sparkles"" (similar to something from ""Star Trek""), followed by ""smoke"".  The phenonenon then disappeared.  The couple shared their experience with several people and two other parties: a teenage girl, her parents and brother approximately a half mile from this location and another married couple doing some late night fishing near Utah Lake, about an hour and a half south of Tooele, reported startlingly similar phenomenon.  The neighbors also reported hearing a similar experience from a woman in Modesto CA on talk radio a few days later. This was the day/night of the government's unsuccessful test of the space-based defense system, which I believe took place in California.  There may or most likely may not be a correlation. The area in question borders a new housing subdivision, is dark except for a few street lights newly installed in the subdivision, and is bordered to the west by the Tooele Army Depot where chemical/biological munitions are stored in dozens of concrete bunkers.

I casually categorized it as an airplane until I noticed another one. Then I studied the sky and realized that there were at least 5 ""aircraft"" in the sky. 4 of them were strobes that either were very small or very high altitude (was hard to determine in a moving vehicle.) The other one was fairly close and moving slowly to the east it seemed. I turned left (south) onto highway 114 and was still watching the objects. The strobes were playing tag with each other, they flittered about the sky in very very fast, short movements. The lower one seemed to turn back to the west some (heading in my general direction.) As I was going to pull over I got a good look at the craft as it rotated (not turned, rotated in place) towards me. It had three white lights , each at a corner of the object. It was chevron shaped and tubular. The best way I can describe it was that it looked like two toilet paper rolls merged together at a 45' angle but the ""front"" was rounded as well. It appeared to be in the vicinity of 1000' feet off the ground at a maximum. Seeing how low it was due to it's relationship to trees in my field of view, I suddenly got a vary bad feeling about stopping.I found this odd in retrospect as I have been a long time believer and have had sightings previously. Normally I would think of myself as being the being the first person to jump out and way to it. At this point I sped up and only occasionally looked back at it. When I arrived to my in-laws house in Essex Mo, I immediatley got out and looked up in the sky where the object had been, expecting to not see anything , but the object (or one like it) was slowly gliding to the northeast. I ran inside to get my wife and she returned outside with me to watch the object fly off out of sight. At that point all that could be determined was that it was a slow, rather low flying object that did not make any noise and did not display lighting consistent with FAA regulations (i.e. no red or blue lights, only white.)   My wife and I noticed some more of the ""strobes"" playing around in the sky very briefly as well. I am not a crakpot and I am not an illiterate ""backwoods"" person.

Approximately a minute later I observerd a second light traveling along the same flight path, demonstrating the same flight characteristics.  The lights were fairly dim, about as bright as an average star, and about the same size.  Neither light blinked, flashed or twinkled in any way.  Both objects were at about 70 degrees above the horizon, and and managed to travel from mid-sky to the northern horizon in about 15 seconds.  Both objects appeared to wobble or weave slightly as they traveled, and made no discernable sound. It is highly unlikely that this was a firework of any kind.  The display we were watching was a non professional one, and at this point there had been a lull of about five minutes since the last firework had been launched.  They could not have been sparks because they lasted too long, and their flight path started down wind of the launch site. In all probability I would not have noticed these objects had I not been focused on the sky since they were not particularly bright, and would probably not have been visible at all near city lights.  The only thing that made them eye catching was the speed at which they moved and the wobbling motion. I believe that I was the only one that noticed the first object, but the second object was seen by three other people in our group.",2000-07-11T00:00:00,44.6288,-85.8383

I'm just now making this report but I have witnessed U.F.O. sighting for three years now.  My family thinks I'm nuts over this.  Well I now have proof thanks to my camcorder.  I've seen, with my wife, three round like or football shaped like objects directly above our heads, taking their sweet time heading in formation straight across us ass the sun was going down.  It happened at my roof.  I walk my dogs to my roof and I am addicted to looking up a lot. I've also seen silver objects with a little bit of black underneith them with no lights at broad daylight.  My cousin has aslo experienced those with me.  My uncle had wittnessed a brown one with me.  I admit when I see the silver or white ones I feel at peece but the brown ones give off many negative vibes towards me.  I get scared of them.  When they're directly above me they seem to change their shapes kind of like a blanket or liquid metal then they go back to their original shapes (round).  Finally on the 23rd of July of 2000 at 6pm. I was looking out my window, eight stories high and I spotted a black or brown spot in the sky.  I then knew exactly what it was so I grabbed my camcorder and ran fast to the roof.  The building security guard was up there so he had a chance to wittness it with me.  It seemed like a large ball holding a smaller one in one spot keeping it's balance as though it was being held by a string.  It was very windy so it couldn't have been a baloon and it was definitly not a plane.  There were two very close maybe attached to eachother by a long but short object.  It seemed to be observing everything around it, turning all around but still in the same spot.  The security guard ran downstairs but I kept on filming.  After about twenty minutes it started it's way towards one direction.  The shape then looked round or like a lightbulb.  When it was gone another popped up within a minute at the same spot that I spotted it at first.  I thought maybe it was the same one or another, I was too startled at this point to even think. It ! seemed t o be making it's way towards me giving off a tapping sound as though someone was tapping on metal as it got closer to me it seemed like a light bulb black or charcoal gray.  I got too scared and started making my way towards the exit.  It then started moving away quickly and left  towards the same direction the last one left.  Then about five minutes later a third one just appeared behind me, going around me heading towards the same direction the others left.  It seemed to have been closer to the buildings behind me than an airplane that had passed right above it.  It's on the film when I said, ""watch it disapear and another will pop up again,"" and so I was right the fourth had showed up at the same spot the first two did and left very quickly towards the same direction again.  This is no supprise to me.  They say you only see this stuff at farms but I do spend a lot of times on roofs.  People in the city do not look up at the skies very often. They wouldn't even think we would get something like these sightings but I do got it on film now with four wittnesses. So, who ever said aliens wouldn't visit the city >>  huh?

Possibly the same object previously reported from Plano TX. I observed what could be the same object from the 04/27/00 Plano TX report already in the database. The object  was seen at approximately 8:40 pm CDT April 27 from the 4500 block of Fairway Ave. in Dallas, Texas, as I stood facing south towards the Crestpark Condominiums. This location is about 20 miles south of the original report from Plano. I saw a single white light at great distance moving extremely fast away from me towards the southwest (i.e., generally north to south).   I could only see one light and could not make out any detail of the shape, etc. It moved in a straight-forward (horizontal) line, as an aircraft in flight. The object moved much faster than a space shuttle moves upon re-entry (17,000 mph). I've seen 2 space shuttle flights returning at night from this same location within the past year. It was traveling at a steady pace (its speed did not change during the few seconds it was observed) and it quickly disappeared from view. I kept the object in clear view for perhaps 10 seconds. It did not appear to be a meteor because it traveled slower than a meteor. Also, it did not look like any space junk returning to earth (it was not burning, breaking up, like a satellite I saw reentering earth atmosphere in the 1970's). It moved much faster than any known airplane. It left no vapor trail behind as a rocket would leave at night (I saw one in the 1960's) and left no contrail like the space shuttle returning (again, I've seen these twice recently).  ============================================================   Report cited above from the National UFO Reporting Center database: Occurred : 4/27/00 23:38 (Entered as : 04/27/00 23:38)  Reported : 4/30/00 19:52  Posted : 5/3/00  Location : Plano, TX  Shape : Triangle    It was about 8:38pm CST, on Thursday April 27 when I witnessed the object. I met a girlfriend of mine in the parking lot of my  apartment complex, and while she was talking with my best friends fiance(they also live in my complex) I witnessed a triangular  object moving at incredible speed from the north to south. The object was lit on its underside in the shape of a rod, but I could make  out a black triangular shape outside of the lit area. I could see the object moving for about 3 seconds, then it seemed to just  disappear. There was no clouds in the area to hide in, so where it went is beyond me. The speed was incredible, in the couple of  seconds I witnessed it it covered a good portion of the sky. To compare in speed, I witnessed the space shuttle coming back in  orbit a couple of months ago, it took about 30-35 seconds to cross the horizon. If this object would have stayed visible it would have  cleared the horizon in less than 10 seconds. I was fully expecting to hear a sonic boom. My best guess of the size of the object is  about 3 times of the size of a 727(in comparison to a 727 flying at 30,000 feet, like this object appeared to be flying at). It definitely  dodn't appear to be a meteor, becuase of the color, size, direction of movement(it moved in a staight line). It was definitely a  strange site (sic).",2000-06-21T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

The weather that day was mostly sunny with clouds at about 3000 to 4000ft. I first noticed them flying about two miles south of Tacoma Narrows Airport runway 17.  Both of the saucer-shaped craft were flying together but looked as though they were engaged in a 'dog-fight' because they seemed to be chasing each other and doing aerobatics while ascending and descending rather quickly.  I would estimate their speed at between 400 and 450 mph.  At that time there were no aircraft in their immediate vicinity. Throughout the duration of the sighting both objects seemed to stay in a very small area, perhaps no larger then a square mile.  As I watched the two objects, I knew from my experience in aviation that they were not any type of aircraft  I've ever seen.  I can identify almost any military, commercial, or private aircraft that could be found flying in this country and what I saw was like nothing I've ever seen.  I should mention that at the time I was working at the airport fueling planes and for the last fifteen years years I've been interested in aviation and I know what kind of flight characteristics a small plane or even a military or commercial jet can do.  And the way the way these objects were flying tells me that they weren't any conventional aircraft.  I should also mention that the objects made no sound.  And finally, I lost sight of the objects when they both flew into a large cloud which tells me they weren't any type of bird or remote-controlled airplane because of the height of the clouds and my viewing distance.

I SAW WHATI SAW MY HUSBAND AND I LIVE IN A LOG HOME ON TWO ACRES OF WOODED LAND THAT BORDERS ONE SIDE OF ATWO ACRE LAKE. ON SUNDAY NIGHT APRIL 30,2000, WE ARRIVED HOME FROM CHURCH AND A CHOIR SOCIAL ABOUT 9:30 PM. WE PREPARED FOR BED AND WATCHED SOME NEWS BEFORE RETIRING FOR THE EVENING. OUR USUAL TIME FOR BED IS ABOUT 11:00PM. SLEEP CAME QUCKLY BECAUSE OF THE EXHAUSTIVE DAY AT CHURCH. AT 2:59 AM, MONDAY, MAY 1,1 LOOKED AT THE. CLOCK AS I RETURNED FROM A TRIP TO THE BATHROOM. IMMEDIATELY, I WAS ASLEEP AGAIN. I AM NOT SURE OF THE TIME THAT I AWOKE THE SECOND TIME. BUT, WHAT I SAW OCCURRED WHEN IT WAS STILL DARK. DAYLIGHT BEGINS TO ARRIVE AROUND 6:00AM EDT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR. I ESTIMATE THE TIME HAD TO BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 3 AND 5AM. ABOVE OUR BED IS A SKYLIGHT THAT WE ENJOY ON A CLEAR NIGHT AS WE OBSERVE THE STARS AND MOON OF GOD'S BEAUTIFUL HANDIWORK. ON THIS NIGHT, IT WAS NOT THE STARS AND THE MOON THAT CLAIMED MY ATTENTION. WHEN I AWOKE THIS SECOND TIME, I NOTICED A LARGE OBJECT IN THE SKY ABOVE THE SKYLIGHT. IT WAS MORE OVAL IN APPEARANCE THAN ROUND. IT WAS TURNED UP ON ITS SIDE IN A VERTICAL POSITION WHERE I COULD SEE THE TOP PORTION OF THE. OBJECT FROM A SIDE VIEW. THERE WERE THREE (3) WINDOWS VISIBLE ON THE SIDE OF THE TOP PORTION AS IT WAS TURNED IN THS VERTICAL POSITION. THE WINDOWS WERE TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE AND FILLED WITH LIGHT. WHEN I OBSERVED THE OBJECT, IT WAS MOVING TOWARD THE EARTH. AS I WATCHED TFIROUGH THE SKYLIGHT, THE OBJECT MOVED DIRECTLY TOWARD THE SKYLIGHT. IT MOVED AT A STEADY RATE OF SPEED MAKING A SOFT SWISHING SOUND. THE SWISHING SOUND SEEMED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOCKWISE MOTION OF THE EXTERNAL PART OF THE OBJECT. WHEN THE OBJECT WAS NEAR THE SKYLIGHT, THE CLOCKWISE MOTION STOPPED AND THE OBJCT STOOD STILL, BUT CONTINUED TO MAKE THE SOFT SWISHING SOUND. AS IT MOVED AWAY FROM THE SKYLIGHT, THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MOTION OF ANY PART OF THE OBJECT, THE SOFT SOUND CONTINUED. AS THE OBJECT MOVED ACROSS THE SPACE OF THE SKYLIGHT, I OBSERVED THE BOTTOM OF THE OBJECT. THERE WERE A SERIES OF LIGHTS EMBEDDED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE OBJECT. THESE LIGHTS WERE WHITE AND RED. THE FINISH ON THIS SIDE OF THE OBJECT WAS A GREY METALLIC FINISH. THE OBJECT WAS SO CLOSE AND THE LIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT THAT I COULD SEE THE DETAIL OF THE SURFACE. THE NIGHT WAS AS BRIGHT AS DAY AS THE OBJECT STOOD STILL OVER THE HOUSE. THE OBJECT STOPPED MOTION BRIEFLY AND THEN PROCEEDED MOVING PAST THE SKYLIGHT. AS IT MOVED, IT CONTINIJED TO MAKE THE SWISHING SOUND AND THE DARKNESS REAPPEARED. USUALLY MY FIRST RESPONSE WOULD BE TO AWAKE MY HUSBAND.

I was able to make a good determination of its size by watching it fly through clouds. The result- 5 feet tall, 2 feet wide. I only observed it for a minute, but it seemed to be flying parallel to the plane. Whenever the plane would turn, it would stay in the same place. It sped up sometimes, and I lost sight of it about 30 seconds before we landed. I was able to determine that it was a real object (because of the clouds), but it could be a strange remotely piloted terrestrial craft. However, I could not determine the object's propulsion system, and I don't think something that size can fly that fast. I made sound observations, and there's no question in my mind that I saw a solid object that wasn't an airplane. But here's the problem- I was reading Above Top Secret by Timothy Good on the flight.

Objects also had a blinking light as if signalling each other, blinked only when another crafty had blinked. Lights were very low in the sky. The time was about 05.00 am, on my way to work I have to travel from a small village 3 miles into a nearby town. I live near our local T.V. mast and it one day became suddenly common for fighter planes to be out at around this time. Now these fighters ( Our nearest RAF base is RAF St Mawgan, not far away) had sound travelling behind them, yet were not moving fast which I thought strange ( I know little about planes, but I always assumed travelling faster than sound means high speed and lots of noise!), but I enjoyed watching them so I began to specifically try to spot them every morning to kill the boredom of the walk. On several occasions I spotted lights that would suddenly appear out of nowhere and then speed across the sky and disappear in an instant. I guessed that maybe RAF St Mawgan had sent some planes out to patrol the area as maybe they were aware of such objects on their radars. But on two occassions I spotted these lights just hovering, totally silently, not far away and low in the sky. The first incident occured on Caradon Hill by the TV mast - a light moving and hovering not far from the tip of the aerial at about 05.00. I thought it a star at first but when I realised it was to low I watched it and the light moved about! I could not stay to watch too long because i would have been late to work. The second incident was under the same circumstances - on my way to work at 05.00 - it happened at 05.30, except this time they were near the main road that leads into the town of Liskeard. There were three silent lights this time, low in the sky, hardly moving and just signalling to each other. I would have watched further but somebody pulled over to give me a ride - I did not wish to mention the matter to them - so I left it. I have never seen any craft - just lights that either move or hover a little erratically low in the sky. The sky was clear - no cloud, stars clearly visible. I no longer live out that way, but I may one day  camp out on the hill one evening just in case I get to see any more - it was quite incredible as I am unaware of any craft we have that is able to silently hover and move so erratically.",,,

I saw the glowing sphere and screamed for someone to come in my room and look out the window.  My brother's friend and my brother both did, and we all three looked out the window at the orange glowing ball circling our ""tin shed"" as we called it--it was made out of tin and held such items like gardening tools and the like. From the distance of my room to the shed, the glowing ball looked to be about 2-3 times the size of basketball--but I was too little to really judge at that time.  It went around the shed at various speeds, sometimes quickly and sometimes not, but after a few revolutions, it just disappeared.  I went out there the next day, and saw nothing unusual, not that I knew what to look for anyway.

I remember how clear and blue the sky was and noticed this little ball about the size of the point of a Bic Pen slowly drifting westard.  I thought it must be a weather balloon because I could still see that it was rounded.  Of course I didn't think much of it until it suddenly stopped and simply hung in midair for a little too long. I thought that that was very odd - especially when it began to jiggle and ping-pong up and down and side to side with such speed, grace and agility that nothing earth-made could compare.  It then quickly dropped downward while increasing in size to about a pencil's eraser, still reflecting the sun and began jiggling and ping ponging some more.  It then drifted slowly eastward and rose and dropped again where it jiggled some more until it hung in midair again.  Then it finally shot eastward from a dead stop across the horizon and out of sight like a bullet. I all, I'd say this took about two minutes.  This sighting was reported to local police and reported in the local paper.  About 18 months ago is when the Richmond Times Dispatch recreated the sighting and called it ""The Great Central Virginia Sighting"" and noted that more than 25,000+ reports of this are on file from the Cental Virginia area.

Glowing orange sphere changes size during hover. A Chatsworth business owner and resident on Fort Mountain reported the following event to the State Director of Georgia MUFON. Witness was in his home on Fort Mountain on 16Oct99 at about 10:30PM.  The weather was fair, calm, about 65 degrees, CAVU.  His home overlooks the valley between Fort Mountain and Grassy Mountain to the north at about 2600 feet elevation.  The witness observed a glowing orange sphere hovering over the valley to the northwest about 1 mile distant.  The sphere seemed to be floating slowly to the east (left to right) and was estimated to be about the size of a basketball held at arm's length.  The sphere then contracted to about the size of a baseball AAL, then returned to basketball size AAL.  It then vansihed after about 5 seconds.  The witness indicated that it appeared to be solid, and the glow was about moon bright. The witness was found to hold an Art degree from a major college in New York, is in good health and with good vision for distance. Further that the witness is a well respected member of the Fort Mountain community, whose neighbors vouch for his reliability. A check for other witnesses proved negative and conversations with local law enforcement and other authorities proved likewise. This occurrence is consistent with other events observed and reported on Fort Mountain in the last two years.  MUFONGA and ISUR personnel have also observed unusual events in this area in 1998, and several past investigations have been conducted.  This other information will be added to the NUFORC data base at a future date. Note on terrain:  This area is part of the Georgia Blue Ridge Mountain chain (western end), and is very rugged country for Georgia, elevations ranging from about 2000 to 3000+.  The remote Cohutta Wilderness area is immediatetly adjacent Fort Mountain to the north and northeast. Fort Mountain has an unusual 'rock wall' formation running around it's military crest.  This unusual structure is 3 to 4 feet high in places, constructed of more or less smooth stones (piled) with highly unusual pit like rock nests within the wall at intervals. Personnel from the university system in Georgia have studied this formation and several bizarre 'legends' have been associated with the wall. Past events reported to MUFONGA and ISUR in this mountain area include a V shaped craft flying at treetop level, a domed disc emitting strange ray like beams from a portal on the fuselage, and orbs and spheres similar to the 16Oct99 report.

Peter, I will give you a brief background about my parents whom I sent you an email about there story earlier today. My father is retired, 68 years of age and was a heavy construction mechanic for 35 years. Dad designed and built numerous pieces of equipment used in the highway construction industry. Also, Dad is an atheist, no religious background of any kind! My mother, 62 years of age, was a part time cook and a full time mother, Catholic, and a strong belief in God. My parents live approximately 15 miles south of Tracy, California and have resided there for 22 years. They have a walnut orchard and it is located very close to interstate I-5 and Highway 132. On or around October 30, 1999, at about 8:00 p.m. both my parents where in the backyard sitting in their hot-tub. My mother looks to the south behind their orchard and observes two enormously large, what appeared to be circular objects with blinking red lights hovering approximately 500 feet in the air. The craft were spaced about 200 feet apart. They hovered in this position for between 60 and 90 seconds and there was no sounds at all heard coming from these craft. One craft then sped North over there home and the other went due East. When the craft left the area, they left at an unbeliveable speed, no sound what so ever heard, and the red lights that where observed changed to white when they departed. Both my parents are at a loss to explain what they witnessed and are even fearful to come forward to tell their story. They have never seen anything like this before and do not want to be percieved as crazy! But, this event forever changed their belief as to what may exist in our planet. They do not know if what they observed was alien, or, was some type of top secret military aircraft.",1999-11-17T00:00:00,37.705,-121.45771535947712

Later that evening while getting ready for bed, I looked out my window to look at the sky again and saw a floating, red, glowing ball move slowly from the woods to right outside my window and then float away down the street.  I called my sister into my room and she witnessed it just as it was moving away.  When I saw the movie ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" they showed almost the exact same type of orbs moving with the UFOs.  Anyway, we all asked our friends the next day if they saw the lights and no one we knew saw them.  It was incredible and I wish I could remember more about that night but I know what I saw and I've never seen anything like it before or since. They were saucer or disc shaped with multi-colored lights.  There must have been at least 50, maybe more.  The night was clear and calm.  I can't remember what time of night or even the time of year it was.  That data I gave is all approximation.  My sister first observed them while walking home.  They were moving around quite a bit apparantly.  She came in the house and got my brother and both went outside and looked through binoculars.  They kept yelling for me to come outside and look but I was on the phone.  Finally, I hung up and looked and it was the most incredible thing I've ever seen.  I couldn't look through the binoculars because I was wearing glasses and it was difficult to focus.  We watched for quite a while it seemed.  They descended slowing towards the ground in no particular formation spread throughout a portion of the sky just northwest of our neighborhood.  There could have been a hundred of them, I really can't remember and couldn't tell at the time.  There were many.  We determined that they weren't airplanes because airplanes can't hover and they weren't helicopters because they can't move that fast.

I am guessing on the year because it was so long ago. It was in the summer around 1979, give or take a year.  We were at my cousins house in Lake Tamarask, CA, just North of Desert Center, CA.  We were in the front yard looking North against the mountains.  The mountains were at least 15 or more miles North of Lake Tamarask.  At the base of the mountain was a single white light.  It had to be a fairly large light because at that distance a vehicle light would have been hard to see.  From where we were at the light looked about the size of a dime.  The light was moving in the formation of a square, and again from where we were standing it was a small square, about a foot long by 3/4 of a foot high.  But in reality the distance had to be quite a large distance since the light was so far away from where we were. I am guessing it had to have been at least a mile or more it was moving.  The kicker is that it was moving very fast and at that distance there is no way that a vehicle or normal aircraft could move that far that fast and turn such sharp corners.  My older sister, and my cousing who is about 12 years older than me was also watching this, and I am sure there were more people watching but I cannot remember who.

I have seen plenty of those high, distant lights that move acros the night sky, many repeatedly stopping, then starting again in a different direction.  Satellites or what?  I have also seen how people can mistake a common airplane for a UFO with certain angles and lighting and I believe I would be able take a photograph of said object and presto! a UFO.  I've even considered writing a book about how to fake UFO photographs with everyday objects. So then, there I was standing in my front yard, facing north.  It was dark and somewhat cloudy.

Judging by the size and speed I've seen of landing jetliners, they appeared to be of the same height and size and traveling at the same speed.  Are there places a jetliner could land so near Sherwood Or.?  Mainly what I could see of them were their lights.  The lights were in the same formation and color (white) as the string of lights on a jetliner, I believe on the bottom, back edge of the wings.  But there was one difference, these objects had NO blinking lights.  As I watched them they slowly flew north and the one to the west, which was slightly behind the other, moved slightly ahead, about as much ahead as the other was before.  I still heard no sound and saw no blinking lights.  They disappeared into the cloud cover.

She told me that she stood and observed the craft for about ten minutes and the craft just sat there hovering, then to my amazement she told me that she turned and walked to the V.F.W. and unlocked the door and entered the building to prepare for her evenings work. I ask her if she didn't think it was strange to just turn and walk away from the strangest event that she will probably ever encounter in her life, her response was that she had work to do before the customers arrive. She told me that a few minutes later that she looked out a window of the building and the craft was gone. She told me that while standing and observing the object she was in awe but had no fear and she felt strangely calm. She also told me that didn't appear to have any time period that she couldn't account for. The mysterious part of the whole esperience is that Hollsopple is a small town and only one person that she knows observed the object and he was driving on a highway that was about two miles from the site where she was. As I said Hollsopple is a small town and I believe there had to be more eye witnesses, but my sister said that no one else had said anything except for a few phone calls to a t.v. station in Johnstown reporting a strange object that they had seen in the night sky. I am writing to you after conviced my sister that she should pursue this incident further. I've suggested going to a Hypnotist in the hope that he can bring out further detail about her experience. I guess the reason that i'm writing to you is to get some advice from an organization such as yours who are experienced in these matters.",2000-01-07T00:00:00,40.1992,-78.9499

While waiting for one of the lights to change a ship, possibbly just a strange amatuer plane flew over head, only 60 or so feet above the ground. Object pass over the road, almost following it before dissappearing out of view. The craft itself seemed like something out of Star Trek. We both expected to hear about it on the local news but there was no report of it. I'm suprised no one else has ever reported it before, seeing there must have been over 50 people on the street who saw it, and I KNOW others did look up at it. It seriously looked like a Klingon Bird of Prey(Thats why I thought at first it was someone who had built a really cool airplane, but then I asked myself ""Wheres the Engines?"") Maybe it was just my mind and my mothers mind playing tricks on us, but I thought I should report it so that maybe someone else might have seen it too. Email if you have seen anything like it before, a drawing would be much Help.

Last year I saw in Canada an account on ""Unsolved Mysteries"" which I taped to show my wife and our friend who was visiting us when the TWO INCIDENTS which the three of us saw on MARCH 12 and 13.  I just reviewed your database and see that one entry is for the 12th. OBSERVATION: Usually every night I take a ""walked around the block"", a couple or three laps around the our mobile home south of Florence, Az. Mar. 12:  probably around 8:00 p.m, perhaps 8:30pm (between TV shows) I did my laps and noticed the a band of lights to the west where we can see the glow of Phoenix lights.  Unlike what was seen the next evening, there were gaps in the display.  From our perspective the lights were in one line dipping to the north, higher at the south end.  The lights were white BUT there were gaps between them;  as best as I can recall there may have been 5 or 6 displaying a pattern but with gaps in the pattern, such as #1 was on, #2 wasn't, but #'s 3 and 4 were and #5 may have beeen of while #6 was light.  Anyway I called out my wife and our friend to see them, and I speculated that perhaps these were flares from night jumping;  (the Coolidge airport where paratroopers have done night jumping is in line with the Phoenix air port, in fact, we are on the flight path for aircraft approaching Sky Harbor from the east or south east. I just can't remember if I took my binoculars out but I believe I did.  What surprised was that there seemed to be not perceptible downward movement yet this the fact that I jumped to the conclusion that the north end was lowest fit in with my idea that the first flare would be lower than the last flare dropped. March 13:  Again I saw the lights about the same time and again no perceptible downward movement BUT as been widely reported, this time there where no gaps in the lights--which to me meant that none of the flares were duds. I am really surprised that perhaps only one observation was make for the evening before since while there were fewer lights each one had the same intensity.",2000-01-07T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

No sound. Slow movement forming various formations. Changed color all at once & disappeared all at once. Four of us were leaving a restaurant after dinner when we noticed four bright, yellowish-colored lights, much brighter than the surrounding stars, appeared just east of Glassford Hill. We watched them for a couple of minutes before the restaurant help noticed us pointing at the sky and came out to see what was going on. There were between 9 to 10 of us viewing these lights. We were at the south end of Glassford Hill and the objects appeared to be about a mile from us between 1000-3000' high - it was hard to judge. An airplane on the way to Prescott Airport flew just west of and below the objects and they appeared to be much higher than the plane. There was no sound and no apparent movement at first. They appeared as if they were hugh, yellow stars. Then they started moving somewhat like a helicopter would move. Their formation at first consisted of three objects forming a triangle and a 4th off to the side (see Diagram 1). Then the 4th object moved to the bottom and off to one side (see Diagram 2). The remaining three objects then formed a vertical, perfectly straight line (see Diagram 3), moving very slowly. The 4th object remained in its position the whole time. All at once they changed color from yellowish to a dull orange all at the same time. One of the three objects then moved up towards the middle object and almost touched it & remained there for a few seconds before resuming its original position (see Diagram 4). The three objects then formed a straight line again and once more one of the three come up to meet another, almost touching again. We have never seen anthing come that close together without a collision. Finally, all four of them made a horizontal, perfectly straight line and then disappeared all at once (see Diagram 5). We could not detect any shape to the objects or lights on them. They appeared, as stated before, to just be hugh, bright, yellow stars, except that they moved & made various formations.

At this point I knew now that this object was not a piece of aluminum paper, but a vehicle of some type.  The object continued to go up higher and higher into the sky, until it was two or three miles away.  It then stopped and stayed stationary, all the while continuing to flash ""ON"" and ""OFF"".  A minute or two later I then saw a jetliner coming from the right towards object and when the jetliner came to within the distance of my fist, held at arms length, the object stopped flashing and the light went out.  When the jetliner pass the object, the distance of my fist held at arms length, the object began ! flashing again ""ON"" and ""OFF"", again 4 times a second.  A minute or so later another jetliner came from the left towards the object and when the jet later came to within the distance of my fist, held at arms length, the object stopped flashing and the light went out.  When the jetliner passed the object, the distance of my fist held at arms length, the object began flashing again ""ON"" and ""OFF"", again 4 times a second.  The object then continued up and away from me till I no longer could see it.  Total viewing time was about 22 minutes.  The skis were clear and no visible winds.

Otherwise, I have already submitted my original report along with drawings and maps. END ADDENDUM Original observation of bright lights of craft 20-25 miles away; lost sight of craft for awhile as I meandered through hills on way home; sighted craft again as I descended into Fairfield; huge (!) craft hovered motionless 800 to 1000 feet above major highway as if WANTING to be seen.  I stopped at side of highway to observe and although hundreds of other cars passed by this thing also, I seemed to have been the only one willing to stop.Odd! Fascinating! Scarey! Astounded to hear on Art Bell program of 1/21/00 that some police had seen similar object.  This thing is huge...several football fields in size. On or about October 1, 1999 I was just finishing up at a job site in San Rafael, California. At approximately 10:00 pm I was heading home to Fairfield which is about a 45 minute drive eastbound across Highway 37 through Vallejo and then northbound on Highway 80.  Travis Air Force Base is about 5 miles east of Fairfield.  The whole trip is about 30 miles. I am a professional Account Manager/ Project Manager with a bachelors degree in Design; I have also spent about 10 years as a flight attendant.  I know what various aircraft look like and what the typical lights on aircraft look like even from a distance.  My vision is extremely good and I am a well balanced individual.  Still, the events I am about to share always puts one on the defensive...trying to put all this into some perspective is difficult because I have no point of perspective from which to start!! I originally observed what I thought was a ""single"" very bright light far off in the distance at a position of about 10:00 o'clock and 30 degrees above the horizon (at 22:00 hours)during my drive home from an ongoing project. I had made this same trip at night multiple times before during the previous week and had never seen such a thing in the sky.  The weather was clear as a bell with no clouds at all.  The brightness of the light and the seeming motionlessness of it really caught my eye.  It definitely registered as ""odd"" to me.  The area where I was driving (east on Hwy 37)is not lit.  It is a long, flat stretch of highway single lane which crosses a marsh land.  There were not many cars on this particular part of my drive.  I had nothing better to do than watch this thing and the road.  I began to wonder:  #1 about how far away this thing was and #2 why I could percieve no movement.  I speculated that it must be moving directly toward me OR hovering in one place.  I deduced, however, that it probably was not a helicopter because it sitting was TOO still in the sky. As I drove on, I was still many miles from home.  The single bright light slowly shifted on its axis toward me and became two bright lights.  Combined, these lights were definitely a ""show stopper""!  The brightness, the distance and the motionless of this held my curiosity.  Suddenly, as soon as this ""thing"" had rotated towards my position so that I could see its two lights, it also started a ""strobing"" effect with one of it two lights (the right one).  I then knew that this was something I had never seen before and that it was definitely not a usual thing. Traffic and terrain took my attention away from this object at this time.  There were some small hills to pay attention to and quickly I lost track of this object.  I had actually forgotten about it as I traveled through Vallejo and up into the hills onto Highway 80 east.  There are some massive foothills I travel through at this juntion of highways 37 and 80. Dropping down into the Fairfield area is quite a site once you punch through the blackness of these hills. As I came into site of Fairfield, I could not believe my eyes.  Furthermore, if I had not seen this thing from such a distance away, I am not certain that my eye could have picked it out from all the other city lights and recognized it for where it was and that it was what I had seen before. I have been a resident of Fairfield for 20 years; I know the developed and undeveloped areas; I have driven this stretch of highway thousands of times and this was definitely out of the norm. At this point in time because of the elevation of the hill I was now driving down, I was higher up (!) than this craft which hovered motionless down in the valley.  I was looking down on it (spellbound) and approaching it fast. As this craft sat motionless over a vast dark barren area just to the side of the highway, there was no mistaking it's presence.  It was RIGHT BESIDE the highway as if it were taking a scenic tour and WANTING to be seen.  Furthermore, it was so low that as I passed it, I layed my head on my steering wheel to get a look at the underside.  I have no brains for math, but I am certain that one could compute the actual feet above the ground with some simple geometric calcs. As I came down the hill, a CHP (California Highway Patrol) car came by me at a high rate of speed.  I thought at that time that at least HE had also seen this thing and was also going to be a witness.  I do not, however, know where he went.  I leveled out onto the flat part of the road, I kept trying to maintain my speed, watch the craft, wonder if anyone else was seeing this event, and find a spot to pull off on the shoulder to get a better look. As I passed under and beside this craft, this is what I saw: a craft the size of at least three football fields long, triangular shaped with lights all around, two bright lights in front, and shapes underneath (2 circles and 2 straight lines beside each other)the craft which were backlit with light seemingly ""seeping"" from inside the craft. As I struggled to comprehend what I was seeing and trying to find a safe place to get over and stop, I still couldn't fathom why, with all the cars around me, there weren't 30 accidents or 30 people pulling over to get a better look.  Either they didn't realize what was just above their heads because of other lights and traffic around them OR they were as terrified as I was. But I stopped.  I pulled over off Highway 80 right beside the Inn America motel.  As I got out of my car and stood in front of it, the craft had already started to move slowly across the highway towards my location and headed in the direction of Travis AFB. I called Travis AFB about a week later to ask if they had had any reports of any strange events.  They said they were unaware of any of these events.  Additionally, I did call the local newspaper and they had no reports of anything. Last but not least, I was driving home a different route (Hwy 680 west which also hooks into 80 north) and I noticed some very bright lights up in the hills to my left on two successive nights soon after this major sighting (dates unknown).  I did not put these events together at the time, but I do remember thinking ""gosh what in the heck was built up in those hills so quickly.  That's alot of light for the middle of nowhere"".  I have never seen those lights again. I do alot of driving late at night along both these routes commuting from San Francisco to Fairfield and this was one STRANGE but exciting event!!  Thanks for having a site where one can report such things.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,37.99526143250689,-122.52110826446282

I was doing first aid at a high school football game ( one of the school nursing duties in this county).  At approximatly 8:30 one of the students on the sidelines pointed out 2 white lights 4 inches apart at arms length over the school building.  The crowd watching the game had their backs to the object.  There was no sound.  I thought at first it was a security light on top of the roof of the building. The appearance fo the lights was similar to metal halide lights. We observed the lights for several minutes. I at first suspected it was a helicopter and was looking for the navigation lights, but did not see any other than the white lights.  The focus of the lights was on the game.  After several minutes the lights began moving slowly towards us.  Altitude was low probably around 200 ft if that. Distance was about 400 yards.  No sound was noted the wind direction was from the east which should have carried the sound towards us.  The craft moved forward for about 30 seconds ( very slowly) then turned completly on its side and changed direction from NW to SE. The craft flew on its side with wingtip down wingtip up and nose to SE. As it turned I was able to make out the shape of the triangle. The craft was very large.  A couple of cessnas flew at the same altitude that night in the same area, and 5 of them would have fit into the wingspan of this craft. Also we had no problem hearing the other aircraft in the area. The craft flew on its side the legnth of the school building then turned on its back and flew away I have been waiting to see if any further reports would turn up.  A number of people who saw the object said it had to be an aircraft ( reason being is that they didn't believe in UFO's)  However, because of the size and the manuevering capability demonstrated I feel that it was definetly something unusual.  The actual object was only visible when it turned on its side.   There was no sound from the aircraft during the entire sighting. The craft was in back of the main crowd, there were only about 11 people in a position to see it.  we were unable to get any photos of it.  It would have been difficult because of the stadium lights. The craft did not appear threatening at any point in time. We didn't feel afraid but were excited and elated to see it. No unusual smells were noted and no missing time was experienced. ( When I first noted the object I kept an eye on hte stadium clock just in case) There were aircraft in the area, however none were there at the same time as the object. Mostly single engine type craft were out that night. This sighting was reported to Major Filer and MUFON since I'm one of their investigators.  However, If your investigator is interested in this I would be happy to talk with him/her.  I appologize for being so late in getting this report out.  Circumstances in my life have made it difficult to keep up on my UFO stuff. You may release my name but its important to keep my address and telephone confidential.

This proved to be true. When I was young I lived, with my family, next to my grandparents house in Plumstead, London England. We lived facing Plumstead Common and, as my grandparents had a t.v., we used to go next door to watch Wells Fargo on B.B.C. every Friday night. My grandfather used to go over to the Windmill Public House on the far side of the common, in the evening, for a drink. On this evening he arrived home early and told us all that there was a flying saucer over the common. My grandmother thought that he was drunk but my mother, father, sister and I went to the front door of my grandparents house and saw a large, red flying saucer hovering right in front of us - at a height of about thirty feetand at about thirty to fourty yards away. The disk was about fifty feet in diameter at its widest part with a protruded central cabin area which was about twenty five feet in diameter. It had circular windows through which people could be seen and behind them was a central core - about ten feet in diameter. It hovered in front of us for some time and we could clearly see the people - not aliens - moving about inside. It started to move over the house so my sister and I ran through the house to watch it as it flew away but, when we looked - it had gone. The incident was reported in both national and local papers but were either 'rubbished' or grossly distorted.

No-one had mentioned that UFO's did not exist and that what we had seen was a figment of our collective imaginations. I saw what I saw - and so did my family.",,,

On a Sunday in Mid July 1967 I spent the day at the Beach with 10 other people between 8 years and 19 years of age, the sky's were cloudy and we pretty much had the beach to ourselves. I was 19 years old and the oldest. We drove to the Beach in 2 cars, when dusk was approaching, 4 of the group decided to go into Galveston to go dancing, they left in one car. Crystal Beach is located on the Bolivar Peninsula off of the road that connects the mainland to the Galveston Ferry, which takes cars to Galveston. We (7 of us) started driving on the sand watching the waves as the sun was dropping, 2 of the girls were sitting on top of the hood catching the breeze as we drove. We were in a brand new chevy, listening to the radio. While watching the sea as the sun went uner the horizon my attention was caught by what appeared to be a speed boat heading straight towards land, it moved the way a speed boat moves on water, the color at first was silverish, then it turned to amber, I told the others to look at it, at some point as we watched, the driver and I realized that the object was moving far too fast, and headed straight at us, at this point he had stopped the car, I told  the 2 girls to get in the car and we proceeded to drive out between the beach houses on one of the dirt roads that connects the main road to the beach, it is a very short distance, it was going on nine oclock p.m. I was sitting front seat passenger and watching behind us from the open window, I was startled to watch the object closing on us far too quickly and it was changing colors. As we made the turn onto the main road the object had caught up with us, I can't discribe how fast this took place, the radio stopped playing. It then proceeded to tail us, I won't go into what was happening between the occupants of the car, however it was not any type of craft that any of us had seen before, and it was obviously a flying saucer, which was supposed to not really exist, we were scared (real understatement here) Since I was the oldest everyone was l! ooking t o me for answers, I was praying. Suddenly the driver pulls over to the side of the road slowing down and coming to a stop, I was dumbfounded with that action and asked for an explanation, he silently showed me that the key was locked in the ignition, as I watched him trying to turn the key I noticed the car lights had also gone off. We carefully told the others that the saucer had taken the cars power, to stay calm, we rolled the windows up and locked the doors. The craft was hovering directly to the rear, very low, and clearly visible. I was watching it through the rear window. The craft had 2 decks and a dome on top, all 3 levels had port holes. At the center between the 2 large decks was a wide rim which held panels of colored lights, these lights rotated around the craft constantly. The craft was translucent, glowed with light, the paneled lights were green, blueish white, and orange, the panels were rectangular in shape, the colors were pale, but seemed to pulsate as they moved around showing more vivid color back to pale color. I could not see inside the port holes, the glass was thick and dull looking and crusted around the edges, the craft had rivets at the deck joints. I was watching closly for activity and trying to keep the kids quiet and calm. I started to realize that I was becoming hypnotized by the lights going around and I forced myself to stop watching them, and told the others to not watch the colored lights. The car then started, the driver took off immediately, the craft again tailed us as we drove down the road, it tailed us right up to the turn off that would take us back to civilization and I-10 East, and then it veered out to the right (top of craft tilted) and was gone, it left a streak even though it was night time, here is a strange part of this encounter, the car radio came back on, and the DJ announced its 12 midnight. The loss of 3 hours startled all 7 of us, we just could not believe it, it had seemed to have lasted less then 30 minutes. We started to report it, then decide! d we wou ld be branded as crazy. I am reporting it after all these years because this is the first time I have found a place to report it. I would like to talk to an investigator, if I can be emailed a number I will call.

The sky was crystal clear with bright distinct stars (though I don't remember the phase of the moon) on a summer's night about 30 years ago when I witnessed the following:  A couple of miles to the south and perhaps at an altitude of a mile or so I saw what looked like an airplane (a modern passenger jet for that time) traveling from the south to the south-east.  It struck me as very odd, because it looked just like someone had taken a translucent, plastic model of a plane and put a bright light inside it.  The whole craft was a distinct bright white color.  That was the part that seemed odd, since normally one only sees lights at the extremities of a plane.  I watched it travel from due south towards the southeast at a normal pace for a plane of that distance and altitude (it could have been higher than a mile). The shape was very distinct with wings and tail fins in normal proportions. As I was watching it and noticing how strange it was, all of a sudden it split in two from nose to tail fin and one half went towards the northwest and the other went towards the southwest.  The whole event probably took between a minute and two minutes.  After the object split, the two sections took off in their respective directions at an accelerated speed and were soon lost to sight.  I might not have reported this incident, since it happened so long ago, if I hadn't come across a similar event reported in this database from Lewiston, NY on 10/2/99 at 12:00.

Could move in all directions in darting motions. When I was approximately 10 years old, my mother and I witnessed two objects traveling above us as we were driving on 45th ave. in Everett east toward I-5.  They were above us darting just under the clouds and traveling slightly faster than us.  I remember thinking that their shape was like the paper airplanes I used to make with pointed fronts, like elongated triangles, but they were translucent and the light reflected off them, though they looked like they were projecting cloud-like images on their surface. As we turned north onto I-5, they flew over the freeway, still just under the clouds and east, then turned north also and flew at about our same speed for about 5 minutes.  Then when we were between Everett and Marysville, they shot east toward the mountains at a highly accelerated rate.  It was so fast that it took only maybe 2 seconds for them to disappear from sight.  We never reported it because we had no proof, but after listening to a radio show about the UFO center I was encouraged to give my account.  We really aren't even sure of the year let alone the time and date.  I just remember that it was not very cold, a partially cloudy, partially sunny day.  Until I called the UFO center, I had never heard of anyone else seeing a UFO during the day.  These two could travel forward, backward, and side to side with the ease of a hummingbird.  My mother and I have talked about it through the years and told others, but never recorded it in writing until now.  The objects didn't really changed color so much as the patterns they projected seemed to vary as they passed under the clouds so as to blend in.",2000-01-22T00:00:00,47.92466490727532,-122.21939985734664

This information came from my ex-husband one night when we were sharing quirky things from our teenage years.  He said that one night about a week after Hurricane Frederick hit Mobile, Alabama, he saw a bizarre-looking object hanging motionless in the southern sky just before the sun went down.  He had gone outside to feed his dog and the object caught his eye because it was so bright, it seemed to be lit from within.  It had a row of lights horizontally across the center of every color which were alternately blinking (""chasing"" was the word he used).  He said he stood stock still for 4 to 5 minutes watching it and it neither got larger nor smaller nor moved at all.  He said it suddenly turned, made a kind of funny loop in the air, and shot off straight up faster than any man-made object could possibly have moved and was gone in less than a second toward the zenith.  He said that just as he lost sight of it, he heard jet air crafts and saw two (what he thought must have been Air Force) jets flying toward the spot where the rectangular object had been hovering. Further observations:  my ex said the rectangular object really looked like a flying mobile home made of silver with a string of Christmas lights wrapped around it.  He said he was looking due South at it which he said would have situated it in the Gulf of Mexico. He estimated that it was about 10 miles away and he said he felt all weird and creepy when he realized how big it must have been for him to see it so clearly from so far away.  He said it was about the size of his entire thumb from tip to hand at arm's length (he has a big thumb--he's 6'9""!). My ex is a man of little imagination and less verbal ability and so his story struck me with it's clarity and I was stunned by his recitation of the facts.  His discomfiture was obvious and we had been married for 5 years without him ever mentioning it.  In September, 1979, when this occurred, he was seventeen years old.  He's a licensed electrician now.

Driving to a movie yesterday evening..it was mostly cloudy. When we approached the Mercury Blvd. overpass on I-64N. I noticed a craft off to the left. I thought it was a pair of fighter craft in close formation as we were near the flight path of Langley Airforce base and sometimes two jets on approach blend into a strange shape. It became apparent that the object was not jets and not as far away as I first thought and it was a singular object, rather oblong and cylindrical or boxy with a smaller boxy protrusion about midway down the length off to our right. It was hard to determine how fast it was going as we were in a moving car, but it appeared to be floating as a balloon would. I would estimate the object was approximately 30-40 feet long and between 6-10 tall. It appeared to be dark gray and there were no lights on it at all that we could see. We were probably about 500 yards away at closest approach and it appeared to be about 100-150 feet up in the air.  There was a local police car stopped by the overpass and we later wondered if he has seen this as well and was taking a look at it.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a good look at the object and am primarily interested in if anyone else saw this and knew what it was...I've seen many a strange thing in the sky over the years but most if not all I could explain away after a short time.

Last night my Father (a retired Lockheed employee and WW2 Army/Airforce Vet)was setting in a lawn chair in my backyard when he said to me,""Do you have Fireflys around here?"" I told him ""no"" And saw he was looking into the southern part of the sky. I then walked over to him and looked into the sky and asked him what he saw. He said he saw a streak of light in the sky that looked like a Firefly. I then looked in the direction he was looking and suddenly I saw a quick, Bright streak of light that was very thin moving from West to East. I said that looks like a meteor. about 30 seconds later, another streak of light was in the exact area but this time it went from east to west. I was then kind of freaked out to see the same thing, in the exact area but going the opposite direction. At that time my Mother, my Brother and his Girlfriend walked over to see what we were looking at when the same streak of light appeared again, This time going from North to south in the same exact area. We were all wondering what we were seeing. I attempted to explain it as a meteor shower but we all agreed it would not be in the exact same area in the sky. About 1 minute passed when we then saw a bright strobe type flash in the sky Just south and lower in the horizon from where we saw the steaks of light. about 5 seconds later, another flash of light appeared futher south and even lower in the horizon. We continued to look into the sky for several more minutes when we once again saw the bright flash of light, This time is was towards the east of the other light flashes. It was now we all realized that this was no meteor shower so I ran in to get the Video Camera. Unfotunately we never saw the objects again. I can only describe the steaks of light as ""Pencil thin"",White Streaks with no contrails. They only went a distance of your hand streached out in the sky. All 4 steaks of light (3 which I saw)were within an area of the sky where as if you were to hold out both hands and make a circle with your thumbs and pinky fingers. The l! ight str eaks appeared to be ""way up"" in the atmosphere and traveled at least 5 times faster than any meteor or falling star that I have ever seen. The 3 bright flashes we saw resembled an Aircraft Stobe light but about 3 times brighter. At about 2030hrs I telephoned the nearest Air Force Base (Edwards AFB)which is about 70 miles away. I spoke to a person at their command post who said he had no idea what I saw and that no information about any flight testing or Military operations could be given out. He then gave me the phone number to the UFO reporting center. I then called the reporting center and spoke with Mr. Davenport and told him about the incident. He said that what I saw was very unusual and was not from ""This earth"". What my family and I saw last night was definately the most unusual thing we have ever saw. We believe the ""Sightings"" were of alien nature but we are not really sure. My wife was in the house during the time of the incident and now she thinks im crazy. All I can say is that ""I saw what I saw"" and I'm not ""Crazy"". I am a Deputy Sheriff in the Southern California area and have seen strange things before, but not like this! ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC Director talked with the witness at some length, and found him to be a seemingly very good observer and reporter of fact.  His description of the event was very precise, and he had made a note of the exact time of the event.   If we led the individual to believe that we concluded the phenomenon was UFO-related, we misspoke, and apologize.  We have no idea what caused this phenomenon.

Could not see a fuselage or wings. Sound of some type of propulsion could be heard, but it was very muffled sounding. Did not sound like jets that go over our house often, and was not nearly as loud as the ones that would be 2000-3000 ft altitude.  If it was a regular jet passenger plane, judging by what we saw, it would have been flying at about 1000 feet or lower by the relative distance between the the three points where the white/red lights were. Craft not moving very fast. My wife saw it first. Said ""look at that, John"". She noticed it through our trees coming toward us, NW to SE direction. I looked up, and could see it through the trees, coming toward us, and I then moved in the direction where I could get a better view.  The speed of the craft was very slow, that if it was a jet aircraft, it would not be doing any faster than 50 mph, relative to the altitude it appeared to be at. (We also see the police helicopter go over our house often, and I've seen it go over or by us much quicker than this total sighting took.) We were just on our way to go for a drive with our two great nieces. They had already gotten into the car in the garage when my wife first noticed this sighting. I called to them to come see it after I first saw it.  They didn't move fast (the kids), and I wanted them to see it, too.  But, they still climbed out of the back seat of the car, and the car is a two door - that when they got to the driveway at least 30 or more seconds after the craft was first noticed, they could still see it before it went over the trees to our SE. I would not report this, except I can not explain this sighting as a normal aircraft because: (1) the sound was too quiet for most jets that have passed over our house, (2) the wingspan, or distance between the corners of the triangle, would have made the craft size very large even for a 747, (3) the craft took a long time to move across our viewing space, (4) the lights on the corners didn't blink, (5) I've never seen jets going in on a landing pattern for the Eastern Iowa Airport in the direction of NW to SE, though I did see a small jet go over a little N-NE to S-SW just the same day, about 6:30 PM., and (6) I have never seen a passenger jet come in to our airport at that time of night.  Most of the normal traffic seems to die out after 8:00 PM. Because I can give an close time, plus or minus 5 minutes, and because I also believe that local radar would show a blip for what we saw, I think that this sighting would be easily verifiable if was a normal craft or not.",2000-07-23T00:00:00,41.977694906621394,-91.6758648556876

The total observation time was approx. 3 & 1/2 minutes. When the object reached what appeared to be the closest point overhead, it looked like it was about two inches in length, as judged by comparing it to my outstretched hand. Clearly, the object was reflecting the sunlight, as if from a white painted surface.  It did not appear to emit any additional light of its own, however; what looked like a very thin, spherically shaped and almost completely transparent cloud, halo or mist, seemed to cling to the object. This ""mist"" seemed to be fanned by the atmosphere as the object passed overhead. The object was low enough in altitude, (perhaps 3000 to 5000 feet) so that it DEFINITELY was not a likely to have been any type of conventional aircraft.  It looked like a missle, but it's speed was far too slow for that, and the object made no sound whatsoever.  A missle in flight, or a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft this low would have made noise! The object was close enough and the sky was clear enough to recognize  it for exactly what it was - unidentified. - I clearly observed the wings of a similar sized fixed-wing aircraft (commercial jet airliner) which flew overhead about two minutes after the sighting of the UFO began. 	It was plainly evident that the UFO, by comparison, HAD NO WINGS, ROTORS, MISSLE EXHAUST, ETC., of any kind. There was no aerodynamic tapering of the front of the object, such as would be expected to be found on a missle. Both the bow and stern of the object were flat, like a cigar that is cut straight on both ends. 	A man and his little boy approached, about a minute into the sighting.  I pointed the object out to them, and the man immediately exclaimed, ""Hey, that's a UFO!""  A man walking across the street overheard our conversation and looked up also, saying, ""Wow! - what the hell is THAT thing?"" 	The four of us stopped and watched the object for about 2 & 1/2 more minutes, when it seemed to noticeably speed up during the last 30 seconds or so of its remaining, observable flight path, until it had traveled too far into the NE horizon to remain visible to the unaided eye. Up until that point, the object traveled at a slow, steady speed, in a perfectly straight line. 	Afterwards, I called KNXT news radio to inquire if anyone else had reported a sighting of the object. The reporter told me no, but that earlier in the day (at 13:09 HRS, PDT), there had been a missle test launched from Vanderberg AFB. Obviously, this missle test is NOT what WE saw - we observed the UFO around 1900 HRS, PTD; about 6 hours AFTER the Vandenberg launch!",2000-07-23T00:00:00,33.994295145631064,-118.46369223300971

I was out having a cigarette break at work. Noticing the colors at the beginning of the sunset, I noticed a bright yellow, almost white object coming out of the western sky. Knowing that this was probably the reflection of the sun on an east bound jet, I didn't give it much thought, as there were several passenger jets heading both east and west bound that I could see also. It was partially cloudy, but no heavy cloud cover, and it was mostly clear out. What began to seem strange to me,was that NONE of the passenger jets that I could see were ""reflecting"" the sunset, in the same manner. While I watched a little closer, unlike the jets that I could also see, this object did not have any wings visible. All through this time, no wings were seen at all, and the object continued heading east, in a straight line, and a steady, continuous speed. (About the speed of the jets I was seeing on either side, and going in east and westerly directions.) It did seem to be going slightly slower, as some eastbound jets going to DIA, had passed it on either side. At no time was their any variance in the color also. It maintained a bright yellow, almost white ""glow"". As it passed over head, I STILL did not see ant wings, no noises above the traffic on I-25, to my west, and it was then that I saw that the middle of the cylinder was narrower than the ends, as if it was 2 cylinders, that had a ""docking area"" that met in the middle. Again, it never deviated its speed or direction. As it passed over me, going on to the east, I saw that there was a small cloud, that appeared to be in a direct line, with where the object was heading. At no time were there any blinking running lights, as there were on the passing aircraft. When the object went into the cloud, I kept watching to where I thought that it would come out. Any other aircraft that I have watched, would be through that small of a type of a cloud, in 3-5 seconds, max. I saw nothing at all, for over 30 seconds, and when I saw the light again, it appeared to be about half the size, still a bright yellow, and then after about 10-15 more seconds, it disappeared. I never saw any wings. It never deviated in the direction or speed, and after it ""halfed itself"", it just disappeared. No ""blink out"", no quick rise or fall, it was just not there anymore. I know I saw at least 6 aircraft going in other directions, that might have seen this object also. I lit another cigarette, and ran through what I had seen, and no ""logical"" explanation came to me. Wen it passed overhead, it seemed to be probably twice the length of a jetliner and probably 1 1/2 -2 times the girth, of an ""average airliner. With the clarity and length of my sighting, I felt I should report this in the hopes that others had seen it, and have reported it also.",2000-07-11T00:00:00,,

Missile was launched to the west.  PD)) Silent craft within 3 miles comes to with in 1/2 mile, very close to ground; observed for 23 minutes. 07/07/2000 My wife & I were just up at Red Rock Nevada and saw a UFO. We were at the area where we have gone for years (and never seen anything but stars) and we saw a Satellite. I said, if we check the time, we can see it again tomorrow night. So I turned on the car key to see the clock. It read 9:21, when I turned off the key, I looked out the front window of the car. I said, ""What the hell is that?"" and my wife said, ""what?"" I continued looking at it and said, ""That!"" she looked up and saw what I was looking at and grasp my hand. We just stared in disbelief. There was a bright slice of light. It was in a perfect triangle. The source of the light or light bulb like thig was about 10 feet around. No light traveled up or to the sides. Just straight down and it had a sharp crisptness to it. It was sweeping the ground traveling from south west to north east. The light was about 1/4 mile in the sky, just over the tips of the mountain closest to us. It was about three miles in front of us, coming toward us. The light swept the ground in about 1/2 mile swath. The light was sharp. That is, It didn't travel past the sharp edge of the triangle shape pointing toward the ground. There was a greenish blue glow to the east of it about 60 feet from what appeared to be a craft.  The glow appeared like phosphorus in the sky. All we could see of the craft was a blackness. Kind of saucer shape and kind of oval. It appeared to be thick It looked as though from the bottom of the craft to the bottom edge of the light that it would be about 6 feet. The light was like it was out over the front edge of the craft, pointing down. The blackness behind and under the light looked to be about 50 feet around and kind of like a saucer but a deep saucer dropping below the craft like a belly. The light, like I said, was a perfect triangle as it swept the ground. No light was behind the light and no light in front of the light. In othere words, it was not like a spot light that has an oval shape on the ground. The light was extremely bright and! we coul d see the ground where it was pointing as if noon day sun. But absolutely white. No yellowish tint. The devise / saucer seemed to be creating some kind of fog. but it just kind of radiated from the craft. It didn't blast away from the craft and the light left no trail in the fog it was creating. The valley behind it was glowing a bright white and we could clearly make out the shape of the mountain. The light behind the mountain appeared to be from another source and shown like sun rays out of the valley. Whate sun rays. The light continued toward us very slowly with absolutely no sound. It got to within a half of a mile of us and then in the blink of the eye, the craft and light were gone. But the fog stayed. The fog didn't sweep up with the leaving of the craft. It just hung there. The glow in the mountains continued for 10 minutes after the source was gone. The phosphorus greenish blue stayed for 23 minutes. After the craft left, the ground where it had been appeared to show brighter. I mean it was like the sun came out for a while. We could see the field in front of us and the side of the mountain that was behind it. This light faded as the greenish blue glow faded until it was gone. About 10 minutes after the craft left, a helicopter flew over. The racket that made, made us realize how quiet the saucer was. No noise at all. About 5 minutes after the craft left, all of red rock cayon filld with fog. The temprature out there was in the 96. We sat there for another 1/2 hour, after all signs of it had left and the fog remained. We pulled out of out spot and drove over to the fog and it was completely gone. It took us less than 5 minutes to get to where the fog had been.",2000-07-11T00:00:00,,

From birds to fireballs. But birds don't glow and don't cruise at that speed. Plus, I know a bird when I see one. These were definite triangular shaped, no wings. Fireball or low flying meteors?

I was doing almost 80 mph the whole way and the object appeared to move in tandem with my car speed, maintaining approximately the same angle until I got to Albuquerque.

At sunset around 8:15 pm. Two sightings seen from backyard patio. First sighting was witnessed just by me, I first saw a weird colored light in the sky, as if a child would draw a solid line across the sky, from where I stood it was about three inches long. It stood out from the rest of the sky, there were no clouds near it. I have never seen such a thing and this is why I took notice, I have seen other balls of light but not like this one. I also have had UFO sightings, again, not  like this one. The streak if that is what you want to call it was solid, and a flourescent pink/orange all by itself in the sky, nothing else in the sky looked as bright as this nor had its coloring. It was moving from right to left, what clouds could be seen in the distance were moving in the opposite direction. I first saw the streak appear out of no where, I also noticed a very bright ball extending from this streak on the beginning of the right side of the streak. Needless to say I was hypnotized by this event. Just as it was going to disappear, I called out to my friend who was in the house to come and see. She saw it too and I thought that this was the end of it. Then all of a sudden another streak appeared looking exaxtly like the first one. I said to my friend to get the camera and she did. We took the pictures right before this second sighting disappeared too. I was hopeing that we caught it on film. Got back the pictures the other day, and low and behold there it was. But its funny because you cannot see the streak, only the bright round ball. I have two sets of these pictures and would like to get them to you, I do not have a scanner, and so I think that I would have to send them to you through snail mail.

When 4 or 5 fighter planes came from the south and flew straight at it, it accelerated almost vertically in what would approximate the speed of a shooting star. I have ruminated over this for years and feel that I might add something not known.  I had a communications receiver tuned to the frequency that the chase planes were using to communicate with the Blackbird which was being tested at the time over the Owens Valley.  I went in the house in time to hear a pilot say ""have sustained some damage-request to land at Tonopah""  Reply was ""permission denied,return to ship-do not fly over valley-stay over mountains-give film to so and so immediatly"" or something very close to those words. After that transmission, I never heard that frequency used again.  The local radio station KIBS was talking about the UFO while it was overhead but when I called them after it was gone, they denied ever saying anything about it.",,37.496172413793104,-118.31717241379312

It was at this time that I realized that that thing that I had seen was not anything the average citizen was familiar with. As I watched this object it slowly and silently started to ""drift"" in a slightly NW direction towards the Ridge Road viaduct just East of Wicker Park, until it was out of sight from my window.

On a different story... a current airforce MP friend of mine was stationed at the air force in / near las vegas a couple of years ago (for two years) who told me/confirmed what an older ex-air force crew chief friend/ex-partner of mine told me. That there are a bunch of hollow mountains in Nevada near las vegas. The ex-crew chief told me that years ago he and the pilot/co-pilot were told/ordered to take off with some cargo but didnt know where they were going and would find out once they were enroute. He told me that they flew for hours and then received directions to fly to a certain coordinence (spelling) and they couldnt believe their eyes, they were instructed to fly into the side of a mountain, but when they got closer the side of the mountain opened up and they flew into the mountain and were told to not get out of the plane. the cargo was unloaded and they were told to leave. Ofcourse he told me to not tell anyone but i figured after all this time a bunch of people probably know about these ""hidden"" airstrips/bases in the mountains. Back to my friend the MP...he said he had clearance to go into the restricted areas of that secret base as he was a security/police and he has heard many people say that yes those hills/mountains are all hollow. One day a friend of his was taking a break in his humvee near a top secret building and a guy came out the door of this secret building and later the guy taking the break was taken to headqtrs and asked what he saw when the other man came out the door. he said nothing as it was to quick and he wasnt even paying attention but within 24 hours the airforce transfered him out of state and made him sign the 50 year ""i saw nothing paper"" this kinda stuff is exciting but i wonder what the heck our government is doing in those secret bases..i wouldnt be surprised probably.... so, has anyone/group ever tried to sneak-in to this area and take pictures etc.? dont we have a right to know whats going on? ofcourse we do!!! i will try to squeeze more neat stuff out of my buddy the MP.

",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12465.html,"While waiting for grandpa to return from gas station, I observed a circular craft with an elongated oval ring, emmitting small lights to the ground.  As one stream of twinkling lights fell to the ground, another stream of lights rose from the ground to the craft Because the incident happened so long ago, and I was at such a young, I don't remember exactly where the event took place or on what date.  However, as I remember it, I was traveling on a 2-lane highway with my grandpa and older cousin.  While driving towards Elizabethtown KY my grandpa pulled off into a roadside gas station to pick up some snacks.  As he exited the van, I was sitting in the back seat reading a book.  Seconds after he entered the store my cousin who was sitting in the front seat (he was around 13 at the time?) began to yell and point frantically.  I climbed to the front seat to see what he was doing.  He was screaming ""Look, Look!""  As I looked to the horizon across a corn field I saw a rather large object in the sky.  (As soon as I can draw a decent diagram, I will send it in.)  As I looked to the (East?) I saw a round, circular object in the sky that looked white in contrast with the sky.  Around the center of the object was an oblong oval shaped disc.  It looked like a big belt all the way around it.  Within the belt there were approximately four circles of light.  These circles were glowing red, green, and purple, and seemed to be alternating color schemes.  I would estimate that the object was around 200-250 yards away, and was located in the horizon where the corn field, and woods seemed to meet in the distance.  While watching the object, I remember being almost hypnotized by it; I had never seen anyting like it.  In fact at that time, I a positive that I did not know what an alien or a UFO was.  The craft just hovered the where the woods and corn met.  As it hovered it was emitting small twinkling lights down to the ground.  As one line of lights went to the ground, there was a second line of lights that traveled upwards into the craft. The whole time this was happening, my cousin was screaming and yelling.  After about a minute of observation, I snapped out of my fixation and asked him what it was.  He replied ""That's a UFO!  It has some aliens onboard who are probably going to kill off everyone and destroy the earth!""  ""They are going to blow everyhting up!""  Being 7-8 years old, I was pretty impressionable so naturally I believed him. As my grandfather came back to the van with food and drinks, I went to the back seat and cried, all the way to Elizabethtown where we were to visit my great-grandma.  My grandpa asked what was wrong with me but I didn't answer him.  Actually, I did not stop crying until the next morning when I realized that we were not all dead.  As I recall, my cousin and I did not talk to anyone until the next day.  I only bring this up because it really illustrates how absolutely terrified I was with the experience.  I thought for a while that my cousin was just trying to scare me, but he was genuiley terrified also. I am now 22 years old, and about to graduate from college with a degree in Law Enforcement.  To this day I have never seen any object even remotely close to this.  I haven't seen or talked to my cousin, who was present since I was around 10-11.  We had never talked about at all outside of the gas station parking lot.  Actually, I believe he is in prison now.  My grandpa does not remember my strange behaviors that day; but there are a lot of things that my grandpa does not remember. I am hoping that someone out there can validate this story, or have seen something similar.  I am very eager to talk to anyone about this, including investigators, or even go under hypnosis to possibly recount the incident in more detail.",2000-04-01T00:00:00,37.7149671875,-85.856540625

It moved very slowly across the sky, making a quiet puffing noise. This is the description of what thousands of people on the Gazelle Peninsula of East New Britain saw in the sky over the weekend. The people of the remote Bainingo ranges, cut off from television and anything else that is modern, possibly had the best description. They say a craft, which had huge lumps on the sides with light flickering around it. Some Bainingos said the object was lit up all around like a red-hot stone in an oven pit. But what they saw was exactly what others on the Gazelle Peninsula witnessed on the same night, Thursday, November 4. The people who saw the flying craft concluded that they were witnessing a spacecraft from another planet. On other parts of the province, similar sightings were made, although their descriptions were slightly different. Over on Duke of York Islands those living on the island closest to New Ireland Province reported seeing a huge craft hovering just meters above the seas off St George Channel, and traveling at a very slow speed. They claimed they saw other smaller crafts with bright lights circulating the bigger craft in a playful manner. They claimed they watched the craft until it disappeared over the high mountains in New Ireland. At Rangulit village, in the Baining area, on the same night, naturalized citizen John Berenti of Namatanai in New Ireland, and his family were sitting on the verandahs of their home when, all of a sudden, a huge craft appeared just above the top of the mango trees. ""It was so big, about 200 meters (660 feet) to 300 meters (990 feet) long, and 50 meters (165 feet) wide. ""It was moving very, very slowly across the sky and was lit up like a shooting star and it had two very bright lights at the tail. ""We honestly did not know what it was, but it certainly wasn’t an aircraft,"" Mr. Berenti said. ""It was traveling too slow, far too slow. ""It did not make any loud sound, just a quite puffing sound as it glided gracefully over the tree tops,"" he said. Mr. Berenti said his entire family saw the craft. He said the people who lived there, who saw the craft, lit handheld fires and chased after the craft, wanting to see where it would go. Mr. Berenti said he had never seen anything like it and he was troubled by it. ""It cannot be associated with anything on this planet."" He considered that the bright glow around the craft was its magnetic field, keeping the force of gravity away."" About 50 kilometers (30 miles) across the sea from Lassul Baining, Police Officer Raymond Theodore was sitting under his house along Vuvu Beach, North Coast of Rabaul, around 8:30 p.m. when he noticed what looked to be a huge craft traveling just meters above the seas. ""First I thought it was a ship but then we saw it travel over Waton Island."" ""It had very bright lights at the back as it moved along, but it made no sound,"" he said. Others who saw the craft gave similar accounts.

I am a 27 year old Austin, Tx resident.  I was travelling on northbound Interstate 35, joining 35 from 183.  I was heading north towards the Braker Lane exit.  The time was approximately 8:45 p.m. on Monday, November 8th,  and I had just left my office to join some friends watching the Dallas game that had just started at 8:00.    As I was travelling north on I35,  I became aware of an extremely bright, pulsating object in the sky.   The object appeared to be descending rather slowly,  and was extremely bright - several times brighter than any visible stars in the sky.  As I exited on Braker Lane,  heading along the frontage road,  I still managed to track the object.  The object descended appromately 1000,  then changed direction,  heading almost due south.  By that time,  I was travelling east on Braker lane,  and became aware of more details about this peculiar object.  The object appeared to be accelerating - my estimate would be approx. 400-450 miles an hour at this point.  Something else caught my eye - 2 tiny lights that were trailing this object.  By this time,  Both objects had passed me,  and I was looking behind them as they continued south.  The original bright object that I first sighted now appeared to sport several red blinking lights on the anterior of the object - these lights blinked in sequence, similar to standard navigational lights (however,  there were at least 5-6 of these lights on the anterior of the craft).  In addition,  there appeared to be some kind of strobe or circular light on the belly of the craft - this appears to be what accounted for the extremely bright, pulsating light that I had witnessed earlier.  However,  as the object was starting to become perpindicular/head away from me at this point,  this characteristic had become less apparent.  The two white lights that were trailing the craft (from about a mile) appeared to be the exhaust of a seperate,  conventional jet aircraft.  As I arrived at my friends house I immediately stopped my engine and climbed out,  stil! l tracki ng the two objects.  The first thing I noticed was that the first craft was extremely silent - no audible propulsion sounds were discernable.  In addition,  dogs in yards directly under the craft's path were barking loudly,  and this could be heard distinctly as the craft passed over the subdivision.  What appeared to be a jet aircraft followed this path shortly after the unidentified craft,  and this audible noise did not disturb the animals.  I lost sight of both objects as they passed over the horizon,  but that is not the end of my sighting. At approximately 9:10 pm the same night,  I had stepped outside into the backyard of my friend's duplex to smoke a cigarette.  I must make the disclaimer at this point that I was in no way under the influence of any psychoactive/hallucinogenic substances,  or even alcohol. Stunned by the earlier sighting,  I watched the skies as I smoked the cigarette.  To my suprise,  looking east over the roof of the duplex,  I spotted a bright light of similar intensity slowly arcing up in a straight path.  Iridium satellite, or some other orbiting satellite,  is what I first thought.  The altitude/speed seemed consistent with an orbital satellite - however, as this object passed right over my head,  I was again able to glimpse the flashing red lights on the anterior,  and then knew it was the same object as I had seed earlier.  However,  this time the object's altitude was (estimated)  at least 50-60000 feet,  and it's speed had to be several times supersonic,  at least mach 8-9,  to account for the terrific speed in which it traversed the sky from horizon to horizon.  It's long,  arcing flight from horizon to horizon occured within about 4-5 seconds,  and that was a good indication of it's altitude and speed,  as I watched it ascend from the east, pass straight over me,  and continue to the west,  until it passed from my view.   I did not see any conventional aircraft in pursuit this time (no conventional aircraft to my knowledge could demonstrate  this type of acceleration/speed). My final thoughts:  The red blinking lights indicate possible navigation lights,  lending an earthly explanation to this - could this be an Aurora sighting?  One thing's for certain, though,  this is new and completely unconventional propulsion system.  I believe that the bright, pulsating glow of the circle? underneath the craft has something to do with the propulsion - just by shear virtue of its intense luminosity.",1999-11-17T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

It was very similar to the traditional shape of a UFO but it was as if the contours were shimmering along with the craft and the edges were shifting almost.  There was no one sitting behind me either, the hostesses were at the back and I looked to see if any one else was looking. They were not so I closed the window shutter to test my own eyes.  When I re-opened the shutter it was still there. Ithought it must be a UFO and I remembered that I had heard that they should spin.  Even at that moment I could discern a very subtle spinning.  At one point it reached out an angular arm and folded it gracefully back in.  Eventually we flew past. I was amazed and somehow uplifted.  It was beautiful and almost spiritual somehow.  My mother does not believe me and attributes it to me being on anti-depressants and although I understand her concern, I cannot believe that I imagined it just because I am depressed. Sorry, I have given most of the information above. Apart from the moving arm it did nothing but hover. Colour chance happened extremely subtly and moved from brown to silver to a purplish hue.

We went to get it, and noticed an unusually bright light.  We looked up and saw a strange, round yet triangle looking craft.  It moved low and fast, seeming to follow our street.  We decided to follow it though it was late.  We jogged half way down my street after it, then suddenly it stopped, hovered, and then blazed straight upwards into the sky and faded into the stars.  When we returned home and sneaked back into my window, I saw a few faint stars that seemed to move then disappear. I was having a sleep over with two of my friends to discuss the facts about a new club we wanted to make concerning that of, ironically enough for that night, UFO's.  We had all had our own experience in seeing such strange things and we highly believed in it.  The only thing is, all of us have one belief.  If they land, it will most likely be not to make peace and exchange happy little gifts to us, but to take earth.  But who's to say what?  We have many beliefs, one that might make this bringing together make a little more sense is that we believe that if we evolved to look like this, what's to say that aliens don't look like us and walk among us.  And if they were to try to take Earth, we all agreed, it would be through the back door.  Well, we were talking about other matters as I sat up on my windowsill.  my room faces the street so I can see the clear acre of land across the street.  My two friends were talking when I noticed a small light shine off of something across the street.  I had lost my necklace near there earlier that night when we had gone out on a walk.  I jumped out of my window (we live in a one story house) and walked across the street.  It was near midnight, I remember that much, and no one, almost no one, is awake at that time.  I picked up the small necklace and one of my friends brought up the obvious, how could it have glinted if we don't have streetlights?  None of the patio lights are bright enough to cast that much light to make this small object shine.  Call it hunch.  The moon was bright, but there was an iridescent light that seemed to shine besides that.  We didn't notice that till a little later, but at the same time, we all felt the hairs on the back of our neck stand on end.  We all looked up at the same time and saw it.  it was a triangular object, too big to be an airplane and not shaped like it at all.  It was a triangular shape, with no wings.  It was round though, no sharp edges.  It didn't have blinking lights, it just glowed.  the light was yellowish.  I mysel! f notice d what could have been a small, red light in the center but I didn't tell my friends. ""That's not a plane."" 1 of my friends and I both said at the same time. ""Let's follow it."" The other said.  We all agreed and began to jog after it.  we all realized it moved too slow to be an airplane.  We ended up walking, rather slowly mind you, just to follow it.  It seemed to follow the same path as our street, which confused all of us.  I think I was the only one who could really tear my gaze from the object to look over at my other friend with long hair.  Her hair stood up almost on end.  I looked back up at the object.  It was moving a little faster.  We jogged after it, then it stopped.  So did we.  It hovered there for a few seconds, then flew upwards fast and faded into the stars.  we realized we were halfway to the end of our street standing in the middle of desert.  we jogged back to my place and I prayed my Dad hadn't woken up at the sudden silence.  Luckily, I didn't hear my name being called.  As my first friend began to climb back into the window, I felt a weird feeling wash through me again.  I looked up.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but still... I stared up into the sky and saw a faint star off in the distance.  It had more stars around it like it was a galaxy, but the stars around the first seemed to move rather quickly.  I tugged on my friend&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Toto,&#8221; I said, &#8220;We ain&#8217;t in Kansas anymore.&#8221;  She looked at me weird and then I pointed up to the stars.  She strained her eyes then saw them.  My other friend did the same. &#8220;Now all we need is the Leprechauns,&#8221; One of them said.  I smiled and watched till they disappeared then we climbed back into my window. &#8220;Well, this turned out to be a pretty awesome meeting.  Now all we need is some &#8216;Take me with you&#8217; signs, and we&#8217;re all set up.&#8221; I said. (On the bottom, I have checked that I would like to be contacted.  I'm not to sure though.

I was in the army at that time, and assigned to an air defense center in Key West, Florida. I spent many of my nights in a radar control center watching the various screens.  My second cousin was also in the scope dope business. He was in the Air Force at the time and worked in a radar station in Homestead, Florida, just outside Miami.  We spent many an evening conversing on the air defense net, although our conversations rarely had anything to do with air defense.  My cousin called me one night on the net and advised me that something unbelievable was happening in South Florida. He opened the net so I could monitor the traffic regarding the incident taking place. I pulled my headset to my ears as I listed to various NORAD stations tracking a UFO just of the coast of Miami. At the time, Homestead was a SAC base, and any such traffic was a great concern to the Air Force. Although I was about 100 miles from the target under discussion, I had the capability to observed activity in the area with my own radar. I had only to switch it off standby. As I was bringing up my antenna, the chatter continued, and referred to three more objects in the sky near Miami. It was also noted that civilian observers had now sighted the objects and the sighting was being reported on local commercial radio. As my scope came up the first thing I noticed was three Marine fighters departing Boca Chica Naval Air Station, heading North. The UFOs were clearly visible just Southeast of Miami.  They appeared to be moving just East of North, skirting the Florida Coast. It only took the Phantoms a few minutes to reach the area of the bogies. I have no idea if the pilots sighted the targets visually, or electronically.  The air channel was not part of the NORAD net.  As the phantoms approached the targets they disappeared off the scope. Now there is only one way to disappear when being observed by a PAR (pulse acquisition radar). You must go straight up, or straight down.   This cat and mouse game went on all night. Much to much to type in this report. Visual observations in Miami reportedly included the observation of one large object and three small. This I can not verify, although I imagine the Miami Herald would have some record of it.  To me, they appeared to be flying a search pattern. The way the Coast Guard would search in grids.  After about three hours one of the unknowns began moving South directly towards my location.  The target was really moving, probably twice the speed of anything I had ever tracked, around 1100 miles an hour.  This would provide me with an excellent opportunity to lock onto the target with a different type of radar. This other type of radar, which I probably should not identify, has the capability of bringing back actual sounds of the target .  Turbo prop, jet engines, or the thud of rotary aircraft could clearly be heard with this system. As the target approached I brought the unit into alignment with it and  brought the unit on line. For a short moment, a very short moment, I could hear a high pitched whine, similar to a jet engine, but smoother and much higher pitch.  At this point the target obviously detected my lock and hit my sight with some type of ECM.  It appeared to reverse the polarity of every piece of equipment on the sight. Needless to say this caused an instant shut down of the system and erased a great many taxpayer dollars.  Shortly after rendering my sight useless one of the guys threw open the door to the control center and stated that they had seen the object pass over. It was moving so fast that one of the guys swore it was a meteorite.",,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

I looked around the area and to my amazement observed a gray disk about the size of a hood on a car basket weaving between the high voltage power lines that were located by the road.  On seeing the object I became fightened and wasn't sure what to do.  I then put my head down on the mail box and closed my eyes.  I heard a sharp distinctive sound, differant from the first.  I raised my head and looked up to its original position and then scanned the area of the farm and saw it again.  It was directly over the apex of the farm house's roof.  On looking at it again, it appeared to be spinning on an axis of some type, wobbling slightly as it turned.  As I observed it, it took off in only what I could describe as an arc at a high rate of speed unlike anything I have ever saw.  Then after it was gone from my sight there was a loud snap as if a gigantic rubberband and been stretched until it broke.",,,

I was camping in Joshua Tree with my husband and several friends.  We had been there for several days when another group of people arrived and camped next to us.  We did not know them, but we all became aquainted pretty quickly.  We were all hippies (at least that's what people called us then).  One of the men from the other group was coming back from the outhouses and he was walking along a narrow dirt road that led back to our campsite.  He was only a few feet away from the central campsite when he suddenly stopped and looked up into the sky and said, ""What the hell is that?!""  We all gathered on the road next to him and watched an amazing display of flashing lights that covered an extremely large portion of the sky above us.  Each flash was independent of the others and there was never a flash in the same place twice.  (On your form I estimated that there were 400 flashes but I actually have no idea.)  We stood there for at least 45 minutes or so watching and trying to figure out what it was.  We knew it wasn't aircraft because it was totally silent.  (In the desert sound carries for very long distances).  We knew that we were near two airports.  One was Palm Springs Airport and the other is a military air base nearby. I don't know the name of it.  When the planes went over we could hear them very well long before we saw them.  These lights did not trail in any one direction like you would see on a plane with blinking lights on it.  It was as though we were seeing the lights from several objects that were zig-zagging all over the sky at incredible speeds.  I was not aware of anything being blacked out behind these objects.  They were flashing at such incredible speeds all over the sky that it seemed we were only seeing lights not objects with lights on them, but the flashes were such a bright white light that I wondered if this was some kind of natural lightning phenomena.  As far as I can remember there were no flashes that occured simultaneously.  Each flash was independent.  The weather was clear, cool and dry.  (It gets cold in the desert in December!)  There were no clouds and no moon that night.  The only other light that could be seen was the faint glow of Palm Springs on the horizon.  We eventually got bored with it and went back to what we were doing.  Every now and then someone would look up to the sky and say, ""It's still happening"".  It went on for approximately 2 or more hours. I would have reported this sooner, but I didn't know who to report it to until I heard an interview with Peter Davenport on WERE 1300 radio in Cleveland today.",,,

If I would not have been looking at the sky at the exact time I did I would not have seen them. Laying on my back looking at the clouds ( day dreaming) I seen 2 silver objects, side by side, coming out of this one cloud. At first I thought they were planes? But then I noticed they were round (no wings). So then I thought they were so high in the sky that they appeared round, still thinking they were planes. Then I thought if they were that high in the sky, would they not have vapor trails? Still watching them slowly cross the sky, I got my answer!  Out of the same cloud they had came out of were 2 fighter F4's (I think) chasing them!  At that time I thought WAIT A MINUTE THOSE ARE AIRPLANES, WHAT ARE THE OTHER 2 ?!!!  I continued to watch as the 2 silver round objects entered another cloud, with the 2 jets following behind them. They both disappeared into the same cloud. Not really understanding what I had seen I rolled over to ask my cousin if he had seen this? He was looking at another part of the sky, and did not see it. Rolling back over and tring to find the exact place they had entered the cloud I seen the same 2 jets flying back out of the cloud the same spot the entered it, heading in the exact opposite direction, as if they lost the 2 silver round crafts in the cloud and were now heading home. I took me 25 years to realize how important this sighting was, to me. I always remembered it but never really thought about the importance of it.

The following is my recollection of the objects relative position, distance, movement, speed, shape and size elevation: 45 degrees distance:  unknown movement:  approximately 45 degrees left and right of center. shape:     round light size:      alternated from a pinhead to a dime at arms length. As mentioned above I really thought this was only an aircraft as we have heavy air traffic in the Wash. D.C. area.  This point of light however would move from it's central position approximately 20 degrees north or south then return to the exact same spot.  I watched this and said nothing to my friends as I still thought this was an aircraft of some sort.  Suddenly this point of light moved at incredible speed and stopped instantly in a new position and just as quickly returned to it's exact original location.

This ""star"" would shoot accross he sky in all directions and return to the same point as stated earlier however now it would take up a new position and begin to pulsate and grow/shrink in size.  Then, in one of it's hyper speed moves it seemed to blow apart and leave glowing fragments in it's wake.  These fragments would then move in various directions then rejoin the main ""star"" Then it would completely disappear.  After about five seconds it reappeared in yes, exactly the same begining position!  It did this several times in all directions and as always, would reappear in it's starting position.  At one point it remained motionless while it pulsated and began to grow in size.  Within ten seconds it exploded with fragments going in all directions.  This time it and the fragments disappeared right after this explosion only to reappear in another part of the sky. This behavior went on for approximately forty five minutes before the ""star"" began to move off and finally could no longer be seen. To better envision what we saw and it's relation to the sky, try this, take a piece of letter size paper.  This represents that portion of the sky the object moved in.  Now draw a dot about the size of a pinhead in the center of the paper.  This represents the object. If you place your pencil on the dot and draw a straight line about four or five inches in any direction as fast as you can you can get an idea of it's relative speed. Even though many years have passed since this incident, it remains clear in my mind.  I believe this is due to the spectacular way in which this object moved and the fact that two other people saw it perform the same maneuvers, at the same time, as myself. I know this information may be dated.  The only reason I am reporting this is because of an episode of Sightings I watched this week in which they reported on what they referred to as ""Cluster UFO's"" and how rare  they are supposed to be. If I can be of any assistance feel free to contact me. Thanks,  ((name deleted))",1999-12-16T00:00:00,,

Then as we drove down Extraterrestrial Hwy.  I noticed a light in the sky.  It appeared to be below the moon, but was brighter and larger than any star in the sky.  I video taped the object for several minutes we then stopped the car to get a better video.  I was able to capture about 10 minutes of video before my battery died.  We thought the object was amazing, but figured once we were able to view the video we would realize it was just a star.  However, I don't believe what we saw was a star.  We did witness an airplane fly through the general area (I'm not sure if that is on the tape, however), but it was hard to tell where the plane was in relation to the light.  To the naked eye it appeared to be a bright light, but when I was able to zoom in on the light it appeared to pulsate.  At one point I was completely zoomed in at holding completely still and the object moved about. Recently I watched a show about sightings over Phoenix in 1997.  One man's video taken a few days before all of the other sightings was an exact match to the sighting my brother and I had.  The light was still in the sky an hour later when we reached our hotel.

On the night of the event, I went to bed just after 2AM. I seemed to be having a strange dream.  In the dream I was back in the house I grew up in.  I was in my bedroom.  What was odd about this so called dream, was that this bedroom didn't look at all like my bedroom.  The furniture was not like bedroom furniture, it was more hospital-like.  A person came in the room that appeared to look like my sister.  We had conversation, then she left the room.  Another person that looked like my mother came into the room.  We also had conversation. I was told that I was tired and I needed to take a nap.  I was told to go lay on my bed.  When I approached the bed, I noticed it looked like a hospital bed.  I remember thinking if this is supposed to be a dream, why am I seeing this.  I took a closer look at this bed and I noted a table to the right of the bed.  On top of the table was some sort of rectangular device that was beige in color.  There were wires coming out of the side of this box that connected to the bed.  At the back of the box there were wires that went into the wall.  I took my left hand and touched the bed.  I could feel some sort of low electric current.  I new something was very wrong here.  My first instinct was to run.  I turned around and ran out of this room.  To my left was a rampway.  I ran down this rampway and around to the front of this sort of building. When I had taken to run , I heard someone say ""Uh-Oh"".  I turned around to see if anyone was following me. I saw a man in a light blue spandex looking outfit. I went to run, to the right of me was, a person that looked like my deceased grandmother. She said ""take me instead"" at that point I realized I was not dreaming, I had become fully awake. I feel as if I went into shock, My heart was beating so fast and I was shaking, I looked down, I had on the pajamas I had worn to bed and I was in my bare-feet. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me. It would be very hard for me to descibe the place because it was so unreal. As I was t! rying to run from this man chasing me, I looked ahead and there was another, he was leading a woman that appeared to be drugged. I felt I had nowhere to run, so I turned and faced my pursuer, he had his arm reached out to grab me. To avoid any bad repurcussions I placed my hand in his hand. When I looked at the face of this man his eyes were covvered with some sort of visor but I could tell this man was not fully human, when I placed my hand in his hand he had a strange grin on his face, he then placed my hand on his groin area. The feeling I had was as if I was cattle, I was lead over to what looked like an orange van and I noticed the van had no wheels. The back passenger door slide open as I was being put into the van I remember praying out loud but could only repeat the same line over and over again ""Our Father who art in heaven"". Inside the van were what appeared to be three children around the age of twelve and they said to me ""We worship too."" I noticed the childrens' mouth weren't moving. I was sitting in the van opposite the children, the two beings in the blue got into the front compartment of the van, I could see into the front compartment because there was a glass partition above the seat I was sitting in. I noticed a control panel running along the front of the van interior, then I turned to look at the three children, they were just watching me. I said to the children "" aren't you afraid?"" and the said "" no, this has been happening all our lives."". I had then noticed the van had started acsending vertically. I looked at the children and I asked if we were from the same planet and they replied ""yes"". What struck me funny was that I was looking out the window and It was beautiful looking at the lights of what appeared to be a city. These children were just watching me. At some point I remember asking ""Why is this happening to me?"" and ""There is no God, otherwise he wouldn't let this happen to me.."". I became very angry and I turned and started banging on the glass partition. I felt something on the l! ower bac k section of my skull and lost conciousness. The next thing I remember is being lead to a room by my initial pursuer, we were standing outside the doorway of a room, when I looked in the room I saw appoximately fifteen people casually talking, they were all dressed in white. The being that was holding my hand started speaking to a man in the room to the right. The man in the room said to him ""I'm not a telepath, you'll have to talk"" at some point I heard GH3 and also the man's name which I will withhold at this time. The man to the right said "" I'll tell them your ready"" at this point I lose conciousness again. When I awake I am in this orange-red lite room. I will keep this less graphic as possible. It was a none human on top of me and I felt as if my upper arms were restrained, I reached up and touched the face it was definately not human skin, I looked to my right and could see where the red light was eminating from, there was a run of lights pulsating the orange-red color. This lighting made it rather dificult to make out things in the room clearly. The being on top of me was making a strange none human type of noise that sounded almost like a lion purring but faster. I looked to my left there were other exam tables and a person lying on it and the same was happening to this person as was happening to me. I tried to fight this but was totally helpless. I lost conciousness again. I came to in my bedroom with excruitiaing pain in my lower abdomin, I looked at my clock, it was 4:01am. I triede to get out of my bed, it was very hard I felt drugged, I started to cry and scream at the same time. I have three older children in my house that are very light sleepers. I sat on my floor crying and screaming for a good ten minutes. Not one of them heard a thing at 4:01 but one of them at around 2:20am heard a commotion in my bedroom but went to sleep. When I went to use the bathroom I had found physical evidence that something had happened to me. 1 1/2 later the mans name that I heard in the white room to the ri! ght I fo und on the Internet, I pulled up at picture of him and it was the same man. This man is known in the U.F.O. community.

It seems to have passed over the house just slightly earlier on each event, shortly after sundown just nearing the end of twilight. For your information we live in the flight path of commercial jets traveling to and from Chicago and Las Vegas, I believe, at an altitude of about 30,000 feet. Additionally, with some changes in flight approaches to Teterboro Airport in Teterboro, New Jersey we have an occasional inbound Gulf Stream or Citation at about 1500 feet one of which recently crashed in Pike County. I thought that you might find this as interesting as I did. At 8:00 P.M. on 12-22-99 I received a phone call from my son ((name deleted)) to tell me that at about 7:45 P.M. or U.T.C. 00:45 he sighted a Black Triangle shaped craft fly over our house in rural Northeastern Pennsylvania. Lackawaxen Pennsylvania (Pike County) is about 75 to 80 miles Northwest of New York City. Philip is always outside star gazing, bat watching in summer or just hoping to see a U.F.O. He was outside on the deck looking at the best full moon in 133 years. Because of the brightness of the moon he got a pretty good look at the craft. He says it had a wing span of about 80 to 100 feet wide. It was not smooth on the bottom but somewhat bumpy or rough I guess. He says that he only heard it about 3 seconds before he saw it. It came out of the Southwest and headed Northeast. ((name deleted)) estimated the altitude at around 400 feet. The sound it made was not a propeller or jet aviation engine, but rather what he described as a vibration such as you might experience in an earthquake. It seems to have not been going particularly fast.((name deleted)) describes it as having a whitish glow in front and several red navigation lights on top. He feels that it was not wide enough to have a pilot on board and could see no cockpit type configuration which lead him to conclude that it was some sort of drone craft which he had read about somewhere. One point which I was fascinated by is that he says the wide part of the triangle was the front and the narrow point of it was the tail section unlike a stealth fighter. As stated above, since the first sighting of this craft, my son has seen it on a number of other occasions. Each time it was traveling in the same general direction but at a somewhat higher altitude than the first time. It seems to have passed over the house just slightly earlier on each event, shortly after sundown just nearing the end of twilight.I might clarify something contained above. The whitish glow in front of the craft upon more extensive discussions with my son seems to have been exceptionally bright aircraft type aviation landing lights. The red light on the corners of the craft at one time appeared to be more of an orange color (different craft?) or multi stage lighting? I hope that you find this information useful! A few additional Comments in the words of my son: I have seen it a total of six times since the first sighting. In the first sighting it went about 150 to 200 M.P.H. and has increased to an estimated 500 M.P.H. as of the last sighting on Thursday 2-3-00. I am not certain that it is the same craft each time since the size and light colors have changed from sighting to sighting. Each time the craft is a black triangle. I think that this area is being used as a test area for military aircraft. The path it follows is almost always the same directly over the house or just a little North of the house but not very far away. It is something that you cannot hear as it comes up to you, it sort of sneaks up on you then when it goes over above you it makes a very loud noise like a diesel power generator on a train. Then after it passes over you it gets quiet again very fast.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,41.4967,-75.0181

When we got there I got out of the passenger side of his car and shut the door. He started driving off headed west as i looked east. There was this gigantic silent maroon/orange/red ball/sphere/fireball thing just fixed in the sky not moving. It was quite low. I was frozen for a second in thought. I actually thought it to be the moon and some sort of apocalyptic thing, although it was not where the moon was supposed to be. I turned around to alert my friend, but he was pulling away. At that point I felt a great fear and kind of panic. I looked at it for another moment and then went into the house and kind of ignored my family. I regret deeply not staying out to watch it or alerting my family. I was seriously freaked out, though! I sat in my room and did just about anything to divert my attention from what i had just seen. Then at about 1:30 AM, i went outside and the moon was just how and where it should've been, which was northwest in the sky to where this very strange object was.

I noticed a very bright light in the sky in front of me. It was approximately 30° above the horizon. (Although, looking in that direction there are hills, so it was probably more in the range of 35-40° above the true horizon). The light was moving fairly quickly from left to right across my field of vision. My first thougtht was it was an airplane with its landing lights on. It was an extremely brilliant light, very white or blue-white. Then it appeared to stop, and I thought perhaps it had been turning slightly towards me and now was facing me so the apparent motion was stopped, although there was only one light rather than the two one normally sees from an approaching plane. But it continued to stay motionless and the light did not appear to grow any closer or brighter. I then thought perhaps it was a helicopter with a bright light on it. But I continued to watch it for several minutes and it made no movement. I also heard no sound (There were no sounds out there in the countryside other than the occasional low “moo” from a nearby cattle pen). After watching for several minutes, I went into the house and called the others to come outside to look at the light. We all trooped out the back door and I pointed out the still stationary light. Witness 2 asked what is was. I said I didn’t know and explained its movements so far. Witness 3 asked if it could be a planet or a star. I said it was certainly much larger and brighter than any star or planet I’d ever seen, that it looks bright like nearby aircraft landing lights, and it also moved from left to right and then stopped. Then I noticed it seemed to move slightly to right, and said so. Witness 2’s boys (Witness 4 and Witness 5) agreed. We all kept watching it while speculating on what it might be. It appeared to move both left and right and up and down occasionally, but with no pattern I discerned. These were precise horizontal and vertical movements We all noticed the same movement. Witness 3 wondered if we were perhaps seeing the movement as some sort of optical illusion. But we were all seeing the same movements. After Witness 3’s speculation, when I noticed movement, I did not call it out, but waited to see if someone else would notice and call out the movement I saw. Both Witness 2 and both boys at least once each called out movements (that I saw but did not state until after they said something). So at all times we were seeing the same movement. I asked the boys what they saw (as they good eyes - no glasses, and we had no binoculars). Witness 4 said he saw a darker area around the light. Witness 5 said to him the dark area looked kind of like a doughnut. I thought perhaps there was a smaller light above the light and asked the boys if they could tell if there was more than one or what it looked like to them. Witness 5 said it looked like there was a light on top going up and down. Witness 4 agreed that it looked like that to him. I thought perhaps I could see that movement, but I couldn’t tell for sure. We continued to watch and talk about the light, until we needed to leave for our hunting trip, which was approximately 5:30 am. Total time viewing the object from first sighting, until we left was at least 20 minutes. The weather was clear and dry, temperature approx. high 30’s It wasn’t possible to tell how far away or how high the object was, although I would venture a guess of a mile or two distant. In size it appeared to be something about the size of a pea held a arms length. At one point while we were watching, I used lights from two houses or farms as reference points. The “light” appeared to be equidistant (left and right) from the ground lights , making it the top point in a triangle. When we went to leave I looked at this again and the light was farther to the right (south), but still at the same apparent height. Even disregarding the movements of the light, I’m certain we weren’t seeing a planet. I later looked up the planet positions for that location, date and time, and found that Venus was the only planet that could have been visible in that general direction. However Venus was only approximately 5 degrees above the horizon at 5 AM, so I don’t think we could see it at all, because it wouldn’t have risen above the hills yet. Venus would not reach the correct height until around 8 AM. There were (5) witnesses altogether: Three adult males in their forties, all business executives from Houston, and the two sons (ages 14 and 12) of one of the men.

If asked to provide a better description I guess you could almost describe the object as amoeba-like in its shape. I almost didnt see it because it was completely unlit, I could only see it do to the ground lighting from the power plant and other chemical plants in the area. (This area has a heavy concetration of chemical plants.)It was hard to determine the color but appeared to be slightly off-white or very dull gary in color. It was not moving particularly fast, maybe about the speed of a small propeller plane, and flew in a straight line, not erratic at all.It also made no sound that I could detect although there was a quite a bit of noise from the power plant that may have obscured the noise, if any, that may have come from the object.I had never before heard of any reported UFO's having the same strange shape that I saw. I told the shift supervisor about what I saw but he didnt seem to concerned.

Suddenly, a couple of guys came in and said that there were some strange lights to the west.

These lights seemed to be going in and out of each other in triangular patterns. We jumped into my car and sped northwest toward Springdale to get a closer look. After traveling about a 1/4 mile down the road we noticed that the lights were now moving slowly south toward Fayetteville. I pulled over to turn my car around and got stuck in the ditch.

My mother, brother and sister left my son and I at home.  It was late, before 7 pm.  It was warm and did not get dark until around 8:30.  We were watching TV and it went out. I tried to get it back on but could not. I tried to call neighbor that had worked on it, but phone was dead. I could hear the dogs barking at something and I picked up my son and went out to see. It was daylight.  When I went out, the dogs had quit barking and were standing perfectly still. I thought that was strange but before I could dwell on it, I turned to my left and saw an object, round, no markings, no openings, in the corner of the field under tree branches. It was a warm, not hot, yellow and orange, several feet above the ground and about 15 to 20 feet tall. I could see under it and tree limbs above it. This is mountain area and we were in a valley, the area behind the UFO was a mountain. I walked to the fence and I felt so happy to see it.  I ask it to come closer that I was not afraid and it did.  The next thing I knew, I could hear a car or truck coming up the road, my thought was that I hoped it could see what I was and when the lights hit me, I looked back and the object was gone.  Now, I know it was then dark, something I only remembered in the 80's.  It was Mother and I wondered why they had come back early, I ask her and she said they weren't back early.  I told them about it and they thought I was crazy.  We went back in the house and the TV was working and the phone was working.  It was then that a report came on TV and said a UFO had been seen over Jacksonville, Ark., about 70 miles away and it was described like the one I saw in the field. I pushed it back in my memory because I felt no one would believe me.  In the 80's, TV was full of investgations on UFO's, still I did not talk about it. My friend and I were going into town and she ask if I had watched TV and saw the UFO thing, and I told her I had not.  It was then she told me that one evening she had gone outside and saw a round object behind my house a few months earlier. She said she lost an hour. I said nothing of what I had seen, she did not know about it. It was then that a mental picture came to mind about that night in 65, of the clock at mothers, when I returned to the house it said 8:15, I had gone out at 6:30, apx. That time period is still blank for me. The time I saw it was at mothers and the time my friend saw it, it was 100 miles away. I moved back to Scotland last year. One day I walked to the spot and put my hand on the ground and said that I was back and I wanted to know why. A blinding headache hit me, I left the area quickly and have not done that again.  I never liked this area, where I now live, but last year, I changed my mind and insisted that we move away from the Benton area to Scotland. I was very surprised, but I had such a strong need to get back here. In the months after I saw the object in the field, I had such bad headaches, that I was put in the hospital, they found nothing wrong, and they went away in October of 65. My son that was with me that night says he remembers nothing, he was 3. But all his life he has fought to live here and he lives on the place. In order to work, one has to drive at the least, 50 miles for a job.  I drive to Little Rock to work, 70 miles one way. By the end of the day, I begin to get anxious about getting back, I am almost sick with the need! I am ok once I get here. In 1962, I was pg with my son.  Several times I would wake up in the mornings with the bottom of my feet black. I have a slight memory of talking to someone in the alley at our house. I had never sleep walked before and no memory of doing so, again. What concerns me now is the need to be here, as if I am waiting. I would like to know if anyone has seen the object I recreated. Last night I found a picture of the same thing on David Fowler, Unknown UFO, picture #2.",,35.524,-92.6972

Moving left to right, it crossed my field of view in less than ten and perhpaps about five seconds. I must have recently seen something about missiles because I remember thinking that's what I was seeing...but also that it seemed very strange none-the-less.  It seemed at first to be as high as a commercial airliner, but then it appeared to be much smaller and lower that a jet would fly.  It was silver and without any other appreciable detail that I can recall.  My clearest memory of the event would put the objects length at about 30 feet and with a diameter of about 7 feet...less than 25% of its length.  It's distance would then be about two or three city blocks.  I sometimes thought about this as a child.  When I was old enough to realize that missiles do not normally fly over peoples houses, I eventually assumed that I had seen a plane banking so that his wings were parallel to my line of sight.  But upon further reflection, I also remembered being quite sure that the object was a simple cylinder having no vertical structures.  I never even made the connection to cigar shaped UFOs until recently...it had just never clicked for some reason.  What strikes me now is the lasting impact that the event had on me.  I don't mean anything mystical here, simply that even at the age of four I seemed quite sure that this thing was very strange.  It was one of those rare events which imprinted clearly as one of my earliest sustained memories in life - like the first time I saw Santa Clause or when I got my first tricycle.

There it was, hovering over the large cottonwood tree that is still there today. It was shaped like a hockey puck and about 100 ft. in diameter. Its edges were covered with large rectangular lights flashing in a clockwise direction as viewed from the ground. They were taller than wide and as a light would flash then dim the next light would flash and then dim, etc.,yet by the time it would dim the lights would go full circle around the craft. It was almost as if the light was streaking around the machine, yet you could see the delineations between the lights. We were frozen with awe and fear when the craft dipped and one of its red lights went out and it shined some sort of beam at us. I just recall that I think our hair was standing on end. The next thing either of us can recall was that it was daylight and we werein the car driving towards Lewis and Clark Monument, our original destination. I make no claims of abduction or anything extraordinary, other than we were obviously missing time and my girlfriend who had never taken birth control in 4 years became pregnant the next time we were together and went on to have 4 children altogether.",2000-04-26T00:00:00,41.243651578947365,-95.79313315789473

The interview and investigation was conducted by this writer on 4Jan98 while serving a Chief Field Investigator for MUFON of Georgia and as an ISUR FI. The two witnesses in this case were found to be middle aged parents living in Troup County Georgia. The couple have several grown children, one of which is a Police Officer with a major west Georgia police department. The couple maintain a very nice rural home, which is a focal point for their grandchildren and many neighborhood children. The witnesses go to great lengths to provide informal recreation in the form of various ball games for these grandchildren and others in the neighborhood.  The husband had recently suffered a stroke which affected his speech somewhat, but seemingly not his thought processes.  The wife is still employed by a major corporation in Troup County. During the summer of 1969, this couple was living in Freedonia Alabama, near the Georgia line, the state line being delineated by the Chattahoochee River running north-south. They were employed in nearby Lagrange Georgia on the 3rd shift at a major corporation.  On the event night, they were enroute to work at about 10:15PM.  Driving east toward the state line on Glassbridge Road, they had to cross two bridges very close together, the Weehatkee Bridge and the Chattahoochee Bridge. The Mrs. indicated that as they approached one of the bridges (she does not recall which one) they noticed a circle of lights hovering just over the tree tops at the edge of the water on the left (north) side of the roadway.  Her husband stopped the car in the road in order to get a better view. She said that the light/object was about 25 to 30 yards away, at an estimated height of 40 or 50 feet.  She added that the circle of light(s) appeared white in color and about the intensity of Christmas lights, the whole configuration being about the size of a china saucer held at arm's length.  She recalled no dimming or blinking, but could not recall if there were individual lights or one solid unbroken light circle.  She added that she did get the impression there was something solid and substantial behind the glow, even though there was no sound.  After watching this hovering circle for a minute or so, a second identical circle/object appeared, possibly coming out from behind the first, and they hovered side by side.  The Mrs. then picked up a large flashlight in the vehicle and reached across her husband and shined it directly toward the nearby objects (!). She indicated that the beam projected out, but seemed to 'get lost', as when you shine a flashlight straight up into the air and the beam disappears after going so far. Her husband knocked her hand down, telling her to stop (!!). At the same time, she noticed that the objects seemed to seperate a little bit as if from having the light shined on them. One object suddenly accelerated away over the top of the car to the south at a high rate of speed, and was immediately followed by the second (both still silent).  She commented that they seemed to go from a hover to this high depature speed instantly, and she had never seen ANYTHING move that fast.  She saw them quickly recede to the south, seeming to go upwards a little as they flew out of sight in just seconds. No human or EM effects were noticed.  Witness did not recall the weather other than it was summer and not raining. An interview was also conducted with the husband, who had difficulty speaking due to his stroke.  His personal account was similar to that of his wife with just enough difference to indicate the truth was being related i.e just a slightly different personal perspective was being accounted.  He recalled a bluish tint to the glowing lights and felt that they followed more closely the direction of the roadway when leaving with the incredible burst of speed. Both witnesses were shocked by this event and had held it in for 29 years. Their home in Troup County is within a location known as the 'Troup-Heard UFO Corridor' due to the extreme number of UFO reports by reliable witnesses in recent years. The publicity generated by these reports convinced this couple that they would be taken seriously if a report was filed.  (Note:  The event site in this case is also in the same 'Troup-Heard Corridor', although the creation of West Point Lake in the 70's has done away with the bridges described above and obliterated many miles of river). Both witnesses seemed to be completely truthful with this FI and the various cognitive and kinesic interview techniques uncovered no inconsistancies or indications of deception. This couple is exactly what they appear to be; hard working and loving parents proud of their successful grown children and doting on their many grandchildren.

I lived on air bases all my life- please read the following information. I have sent this stuff the Art Bell... this WAS REAL. It was NOT FROM THIS WORLD !!! Dear Whitley, (I also sent this to Art.) I am in a most unique position. I have been observing the night sky since 1983 from a snowcat in the high Sierras. Where I am, from midnight to morning, there is no light pollution. I have seen some extraordinary night- sky natural phenomena that were quite spectacular- I would love to tell you about them. I once saw a Macy’s- sized chunk of ice light up the entireTahoe basin a cobalt blue as bright as day… it must have been as big as an iceberg… skipped across the upper atmosphere in a swath of cobalt- blue light spewing green and gold sparks. Rock and metal, I imagine… the ionizing H2O lit the night sky like a magnesium flare.  I was perched on a crag of rock at the top of Echo Summit kicking back in my Bombardier snowcat at the top of Sierra At Tahoe ski area taking a break and watching the comet two years ago… when this GIANT meteorite- if you could call it that, it had to be almost all ice-gouged it’s way sluggishly across the top of the atmosphere… Though spectacularly beautiful, such sights do not make the spine tingle and the skin crawl, the hair stand on end..…but I saw something that did one night, and that story follows… Please read this letter. I think you will find it interesting- I love Dreamland- I am fascinated by the people who call in who have seen UFO’s- because I had an amazing encounter with one, and so did my father, who was a United Airlines pilot for thirty years. I never DREAMED I would have such an experience. My God, when it happens to YOU it changes the way you look at the night sky FOREVER. As you will read, the craft I saw could not even be from our corner of this solar system, as it defied the local constants of physics completely. Here are my stories. Absolutely true. They read like installment- articles because they were posts I made to a together-list on the net. If you think it would be of interest to your listeners, I would enjoy talking to you on the air about my years in cats at night in the high Sierra. I am articulate and though this is not the same, perhaps, as being an abductee, still, my range of night sky observations make for interesting listening. Call me if you’d like to talk about it. I enjoy relating the stories. In January of 1992 I was sitting in my Bombardier snowcat on a run at Sierra at Tahoe, Echo Summit, Hwy. 50, South Lake Tahoe. It was around 3AM, I was making snow on Broadway. I was rested, had NOT been drinking or taking any kind of mind- altering substances !!! I am NOT a recreational drug user! I was facing to the east... the night sky was very dark and clear, with almost no light coming up from the Tahoe Basin, which was about ten miles to the east. I saw an oddly bright orange ball of fire coming up in the direction of the basin...it had unusual detail in the corona, kind of a flickering. I thought about it and decided I was looking at the exhaust of a large jet taking off out of Tahoe airport and flying directly away from me... thus the orange ball of fire. It did occur to me as odd, because large jets had ceased regular service to Tahoe several months earlier. It was raising up quite quickly...then it abruptly- and by abruptly, I mean instantaneously! took off north at a speed that made it a streak of bright orange fire. Then it stopped of a dime, hovered motionless for a second, then proceeded to do a number of these maneuvers over the next sixty seconds. I got the major willies. I was not scared, but I knew that nothing any human could build in THIS age could withstand those kind of forces- OR accelerate with the speed of the USS Enterprise going into Warpdrive. I jumped out of my cat almost instantly, looking all around to see if there were any other sources of light that could have caused a reflection on the inside of my windshield- but there weren't, and there it was, still making the same movements. I would guess from the detail and from the fact that it was to my side of a couple of peaks in the far off distance that it was three to five miles away... Then it shot straight down out of sight- and reappeared a few seconds later, shot up to about 5,000 feet above me- hovered for a minute, then instantly rose at a speed beyond anything previous, shooting straight up into the sky on a pillar o! f orange light that looked like a neon tube, and kept going, right on out of the atmosphere. I could see it for a long time, it was visible all the way out of the atmosphere. I had tried to call another cat operator to check it out but he was out of his cat at the time and busy with the snowgun he was running and did not look up. However, I was to learn this last year that I am not the only one in the Tahoe basin to see this type of craft. During my sighting of this orange fiery object, the manuevers it performed  gave me the willies- I was not fearful, the thing was a long way off- but it was covering a lot of miles on it's one-second trajectories. It moved across the night sky approximately 40 to 60 degrees...left to right, right to left, with huge altitude changes, and some of it's movements were shorter and more nearly vertical. I could not think of any possible reason for these weird manuevers. It was moving so fast that there was no real appreciable acceleration or deceleration... it was stationary, then there was a streak of orange light, then it was stationary somewhere else for a moment. I was very happy and excited to witness this. I always wondered if maybe I would see some strange phenomenon in the sky, being up in a cat on the top of the Sierra where visibility is so good, but never thought I would see anything so clearly impossible by present human technological standards... and never before or since have I seen anything so wild.. Four months after the UFO sighting in 1992, I went to a local pizza parlor where a friend was putting on the showing of a Christic Institute film called ""the secret war"", narrated by Elizabeth Montgomery (see it if you ever have the chance- it's about the Iran Contra affair) and at the show was a very odd, spooky looking guy who said nothing until everyone was on the verge of leaving, then asked if he could have a moment to speak to everyone. He admitted that he was not there for the movie, but rather, wanted to know if anyone present had seen any ufo's in the Tahoe Basin... I thought about that for a moment and went over and said, yes, I had. He then asked me if it had been coming from the direction of the lake. I said it seemed to be...HE THEN ASKED ME IF IT WAS AN ORANGE BALL OF LIGHT. I said, yes.... WAS IT MAKING JERKY MOVEMENTS. I got the willies all over again! I looked more closely at this guy... tall, thin, gaunt, wild- eyed, looked like he had been maybe had a real bad fright he never got over… Spooky... I asked him, how the HELL did you know WHAT I SAW? He said,that's what EVERYBODY'S BEEN SEEING. Turns out he had seen one like mine a couple of years earlier and had been so affected by it that he had been traveling around the Lake Tahoe Basin asking people about sightings, and he had come up with a bunch of people who had all observed similar craft- coming out of the lake or from near the lake, orange- white balls of fire, jerky, high- acceleration movement and eventual flight straight up. He asked me if I wanted to know why they made the jerky movements. He said he had talked to people from Nevada who “knew about these things”... said the air force & CIA had learned from the Roswell craft that the controls in these things were bioelectronic, that the beings set their hands into little recesses in the seats and interfaced their own nervous systems into the craft's guidance systems, which were part-biological, and that focussed microwave beams could disrupt and disable the craft- and that the ! operator s did these maneuvers in order to avoid being shot down! Well, I don't know if I believe that. for one thing, why couldn't they just go blazing straight out of the atmosphere at a zillion knots, that should be sufficient to avoid being shot down. But I do know this- I know what I saw that night, and it was not of this planet. No human- OR human machine- could take such forces without becoming pate’... and no structure running under the known physical constants of our little part of the universe could suffer such G forces without turning into little pieces of scrap metal. It seems to me that these things carry around with them the local constants of some other part of the universe. In fact, I have a friend who works for the air force at Edwards who wires obsolete fighters to be used as drones to be shot down by pilots in gunnery school who told me about the Aurora project... 9G's, but pilotless... flies on some kind of propane pulse engine... it's what they've been seeing and hearing in LA, the things that leave the smoke rings up high in the sky... and that is a primitive and slow craft compared to what I saw that night. This last winter, I started at Sierra and had been working for a few weeks...while in the cat barn, I heard a couple of snowmakers talking...one of them said, ""Keep your eyes out for those ""UFO'S"" Chuck, the security guard, has been seeing! Yeah, said he saw some BIG ORANGE BALLOF FIRE MAKING JERKY MOTIONS IN THE SKY...Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!!” I turned around and said, WHAT DID YOU SAY!!! WHO saw this! They told me and I tracked him down... a retired man who works at Sierra as a security guard... turned out he and his wife were on the deck of their house last summer off of North Upper Truckee Road, looking south toward Meiss Meadow... which puts their sighting about the same place MINE was, - TRIANGULATION tells us more accurately where the things seem to be coming from- and he described the EXACT SAME THING I SAW. IDENTICAL. He was worried about me telling people, he didn't want people at Sierra to know, he was afraid they'd think him crazy. What I have related here is all true. SOMEthing IS going on !!! I can't BELIEVE we humans fly around in machines that can do what I saw that night. I DON'T think that it's US. It's THEM. Whoever they are...I just hope- they're friendly. “My father was a pilot for United Airlines for 29 years... once he returned home with a wild story about seeing a UFO... and here it is. My father is a very humorless and pragmatic individual who never had much interest in gags or jokes... so I was interested to hear his tale of seeing a UFO once in 1970...I was fourteen... he came back from a flight and told me this story... ""We were enroute from Chicago to LaGuardia when ground control advised us to be on the lookout for a large object that was on their radar and had been observed by several airliners in the area...as we got closer to the object we picked it up on our screen... we had a United VicePresident aboard, a captain, co- pilot,(my dad) second officer(engineer) and four stewardesses...all of whom saw the object-There were two other airliners watching the thing when we got visual on It. It had been doing high- speed erratic manuevers but was stationary when we got it on radar... then it started pacing us, staying several miles ahead and to the right...then ground control asks us, is it still there? It just went off of our screen! Right out of the MIDDLE of the screen...We had it in visual contact, as did another aircraft, but it just blinked off of everyone's radar, one by one...we were most interested in it at that point...then it shot across our flight path to our port side, and it was so fast you almost couldn't see it, just a blur...then it paced us for a while on our port side...it was a large sphere,maybe a hundred feet across or bigger...it had a green light on top and a red light on the bottom, both lights alternately tracing a path around the perimeter of the body of the craft, the green doing a half-circle across the top, left to right, the red doing an arc across the bottom half, right to left...then it shot at us at perhaps 2000- 3000 miles per hour, passing under us to our left perhaps several hundred yards below us. The shock wave rattled the airplane violently, as if we had hit a huge air pocket..."" About a week after my father came home with this story, a letter marked 'confidential' came in the mail from the air force. My father was out of town on a flight. I was very curious to know if it had anything to do with his sighting. I opened it. (I knew he wouldn't care) It requested my father to attend a meeting in Manhattan in a week to discuss the sighting and it specified that he was not allowed to discuss the sighting with ANYONE, including family. This confirmed to me that he had seen what he said he did.Then, the capper: in 1993, I was watching a special, a Sixty-Minutes sort of thing on UFO's, and there was one segment that went as follows: in 1970, two airforce fighter pilots were scrambled over Norad in the Rockies to check out a large UFO which was in Norad airspace and not responding to identification requests. Both of these pilots, since retired, were able to get fairly close to the thing before it took off at a zillion miles an hour...they said, (and it was another of those getting- the- willies- moments) it was a large sphere with a green and red light, both moving in a semicircle around it, alternating left to right.

Turned off on a dirt side road to see if we could get closer to it. It was 11:00 pm and we were going home from a class reunion. We were between Bridgeport and Grand Coulee Wa and had come over a hill and in the distance saw a pulsating bright red light. It was hovering about a hundred feet off of the ground. I saw it first and asked my wife what is was. She said it was an airplane. I replied that it was no airplane. It was just a light about the same color as a red strobe on an airplane but it was not blinking like a strobe light. It was more like a slow pulsating light that would go from dim to bright in a slow pulse. We turned off on an improved dirt road that led towards the object so we could get a closer look at it. It was hovering over a large set of power lines that transmits power from Grand Coulee Dam. It let us get within 200 yards of it, maybe less, and it took off. It stayed at that distance in front of us matching my speed exactly. I sped up as fast as I felt was safe on a dirt road and it would speed up accordingly. We chased it for about three miles trying to get closer to it. It crossed the road and went out over a wheat field away from the road so I stopped at the point that it crossed the road. As soon as I stopped it stopped. I rolled down my window to see if I could hear it making any noises. The only noise that I heard was the sound of crickets. I sat there wondering what to do next as it was just hovering there. My 13 year old daughter was very frightened at this point as we were out in the middle of nowhere with no lights or houses and she had seen movies about alien abductions. I had been out in this area many times before so I new the way the road went. It wound around the back side of where the object was hovering. I thought that if I took off quickly and got around the other side of it that maybe we could see the shape of it as it passed overhead. I started up the car and took off quickly. The object took off at the same time and ended up passing over the road way ahead of me. It evidently was tired of the cat and mouse game at this point and traveled faster than it had before.

As one approached, I returned to truck for camera and saw  bright lights in the sky. At 5am, before daylight, my brother-in-law and myself separated to deer hunt on the edge of a very large corn and hay field bordered by a cat-tail marsh and enormous red maple and  white cedar swamp. I saw what I thought were headlights coming from some distance across the field and hurried to reach a hill. I intended to get there ahead of anyone else since it was a choice location to observe the surroundings for deer. Once I arrived at my spot on the 25' hill I sat down to await daylight, my compound bow nearby.Again I noticed the lights toward the east and moving along just over the ground at adistance of several hundred yards, left to right.The two of them were white and appeared to me to be attached to a silent truck or an ATV. As they moved they passed behind brush, became erratic,as though someone was running with handheld flashlights.The lights went out and I assumed whoever it was had reached their destination. Moments later a single light re-appeared, this time rising above the horizon and toward me, I moved to get down from the hill as it grew larger and higher in the sky. I then realized it was nothing I had been thinking it was. At perhaps 20 yards, with it over my shoulder, I tried to put some distance between us. I headed toward my truck and a camera with difficulty in the darkness, As I looked back it was descending, glowing over the marsh, and then there was a silent explosion of bright light as though a wick had burned through the sky and reached a large quantity of flammable material. The sky was clear and the air absolutely still, Once I reached the truck I could again see a low light moving across the field as before. I then saw a bright ""star"" well over the horizon in the direction I had come from, but, I thought at greater distance. It began descending slowly and I tried to photo it but it faded while I fumbled looking through camera. At about 5:45 am there were again low lights over the field, then two lights side by side in the sky growing in intensity, brighter like two suns, only small. I could now see my brother-in-law and went toward him. The lights went dim until gone- took 5 seconds to disappear in the sky. Daylight was gathering, we watched as more small lights like headlights moved along erratically out in the field, then out of sight.  As soon as it was light enough to make out the landscape, a fog formed, which was a remarkable transformation from the clear pre-dawn. In conclusion, I feel the lower lights were probably ""swamp gas"", ignited in the hay field and following a ""fuse"" back to it's source under the water in the marsh. As tidy as that is, I'm troubled by the sky lights. My brother was visiting from Vermont that night where he works for the state, he suggested I write an account of my experience that very night, which I have referenced here,in order that my story wouldn't get confused with other people's comments, etc.                Background: I have hunted, fished and hiked for 22+ years, I work oudoors before daylight often till after dark,I am a com.fisherman.

The family believes the  craft hovered over the river, observing them (and vice versa). Craft left at unbelievable speeds and the father, a flight engineer for Boeing  Aircraft and former flight instructor on the B-29s of WWII, insisted the family remain silent about the sighting so his career would not be in jeopardy. I was thirteen years old, and it was a Sunday morning in July, 1955, in Washington State.  I thought it was aspecial day from the start.  The morning mellowed from a nighttime nip into a lovely, crisp summer day, more like late spring than summer, and the skies were a cloudless blue.  Days like that are rare in Washington State, and my parents were not about to waste such an opportunity, so, over breakfast, they suggested a picnic. Later, I sat glued to the car's window, during our short drive into the foothills of the Cascade Mountains.  My parents located a rather remote picnic site along the Tolt River, near the little town of Carnation, which I considered a perfect setting for our outing.  Our car was not far away, but the spot was totally natural and untouched in appearance.  The river was a bit too swift to wade in; its cold glacial waters spilled over heaps of stones and boulders.  The river banks were even larger heaps of stones, most of them sanded smooth by years of flooding waters.  Large stands of virgin Douglas Fir flanked the banks. We picnicked first, then I started a family game of skipping stones across the water.  I remember laughin at the near impossibility of skipping stones on such wild waters, yet my Dad could often manage two skips.  I don't remember how long we played like that, but at some point, my Dad picked up a slightly heavier stone and drew back his arm as though to loft the stone skyward, over the river.  Instead, he stood frozen, arm drawn back, for several seconds.  He was staring up, and off to the west slightly, across the river.  With great alarm, I followed his gaze.  There, above us, hovering motionlessly, was a UFO. It would be more accurate if I called it a flying saucer, for it was just that.  It was as though someone had joined two round stainless steel saucers, edges together, only these saucers had no bumps, no varying angles, and no visible portholes or openings.  I could see that the saucer's mass was easily defined along the edges, and solid in appearance.  The sun was further to the south, and there was no glare on the saucer.  It seemed to hang, suspended, like a monstrous steely plate, at a fairly low altitude, over the river.  It remained there, motionless, as seconds stretched into an eternity.  All was quiet except for the river in my ears. As I huddled near my mom and dad, I experienced a numb uneasiness, which was visibly shared by the rest of my family.  It was not the presence of something alien that bothered me as much as the knowledge that IT was watching US.  And how long had it been up there, hovering, before we noticed it? I noticed that the saucer's height was difficult to estimate, simply because I had no reference points to use for comparison, except possibly the tree tops.  Was the saucer huge and at great height, or smaller and at a lower altitude?  (This is the only point where my family and I recall things differently:  I remember it as hovering low over the tree tops -- maybe one thousand feet or so --but the rest of my family remembers it as being higher.  We all say it was 8-9 inches across, as the eye sees the diameter.  I cede to their opinion, because I was the youngest of the group, and my imagination the most vivid.  Although altitude is a debatable point, what is most important is that we all saw the saucer and for a considerable period of time (five minutes plus). Finally, the saucer started to move towards the east, silently, very slowly at first, then gathering tremendous speed.  It left no vapor trail.  Never, in my wildest fantasies, had I ever imagined an object could move so fast.  And most incredible of all, it was silent speed.  (Yes, the river could have muffled quite a bit of noise, but we heard nothing.) After it was gone, my father suggested we all sit.  He was quiet and in control, and led our family discussion about what we saw.  He said the UFO did not fit any aircraft known to earth, unless it was some sort of secret, experimental project.  He absolutely discounted weather balloons, based on the fact that we could all see enough of the top portion of the saucer to accurately judge its total shape.  Besides, my father was not making presumptuous statements; he had been a flight instructor for the B-29 bomber during World War II at Mather Field, California, and after the war he was a flight engineer with Boeing Aircraft Company of Seattle/Renton, Washington.  Furthermore, he was an enthusiastic, leisure pilot, flying often in his spare time.  My father also said that the saucer would reach New York City in twenty minutes (or less?) traveling at its departure speed.  In 1955, nothing from our earth, to my knowledge, could travel that speed. My father made us promise that, (with only a few possible exceptions), we would keep this experience a family secret.  He feared social backlash and loss of his job at Boeing if we reported the sighting.  Usually -- not always -- I managed to keep his rule. After my father died in 1974, I started to speak about the sighting more often.  I still wonder if speaking won't jeopardize my career as well.  I hope not.",,47.648900000000005,-121.8991

It was during the summer and I had just stepped out onto our back porch which was on the second story of an apartment building.  While standing there, leaning up against the railing, something shiny caught my eye on my left.  I glanced to the left and observed a small, metallic looking, oblong object traveling east, about tree height, through the neighborhood backyards.  If the object had not caught the glint of the sun, I never would have seen it.  The color was kind of bronze and slightly shiny and blended well into the surrounding area.  I do not remember seeing anything that resembled windows.  There was absolutely no sound and no noticeable lights of any kind.  Guessing, I would say it was about 20-30 feet in the air.  At no time was it higher than any trees in the neighborhood.  It was approximately 10-15 feet long, using the trees and length of our back yard as a guide.  It was traveling very slow, maybe 1 to 2 miles an hour.  It never deviated from a straight line.  As soon as I caught sight of it, I followed it with my eyes, watching its progression as it slowly made its way through the neighborhood backyards and I lost sight of it due to distance.  I am a 54 year-old female, and looking back on this experience my impression today would be that there was nothing alive in it.  It reminds me now more of what a remote controlled probe might look like.  I had the feeling that everything in its path was being recorded.  The other unusual thing about this sighting is that I never discussed it with anyone.  I did not run into the house for more witnesses or mention it to my family.  Years later, my daughter and I were discussing strange and odd happenings and I mentioned this incident to her.  She was very surprised that I had never talked about it before and in hindsight does appear unusual that I had never discussed it before telling her. In all the years since then, I have never seen anyt! hing eve n remotely similar to this UFO.",,41.381240094339624,-76.82344056603773

The event happened 17 miles south of Ponca City, OK during the plowing season after wheat harvest in late July or early August in 1972. I was 19 years old and a first year college student at Northern Oklahoma College. I was plowing late at night because of the hot days.  I noticed a new radio or TV like tower at the west end of the field but I didn't notice it at the beginning of the evening.  The tower had three red lights and a white light at the top, none of them were blinking.  Then alittle later I saw the tower at the north end of the field, but I blew it off thinking I was confused and lost my since of direction in the plowed field because of the darkness. Then just a short time later I saw the tower floating and traveling horizontally across the sky with the white light in the lead.  The tower slowly circled the field I was in once and then it moved out of sight. I once turned the motor of the tractor off, a 930 Case with a four bottom plow, and listened but could not hear the lights or tower making any noise at all.   The tractor is a diesel and the throttle has to be turned down all the way to stop the motor, I did not however turn off the head lights. It had also moved out of my sight while I was busy with manuvering the tractor and I did not notice the direction it went. I remained in the field working until the tractor was low on diesel fuel then unhooked the plow and started home.  I exited the field to the north on a one lane sand road which cut through another field before it crossed an asphalt road running east and west. Then the same road turns to a north-south county road.  But the most interesting thing happen on the sand road just as I was leaving the field I was working in. A single large white light came over the trees north of me at the asphalt road and came at me like it wanted to stop me on the road. The light was the brightess light I think I have ever seen, it was almost like a thick liquid and I could not see anything else. I was going north and the large white light was going south. I was traveling about 20 miles an hour but, I do not know the speed of the white light. I kept waiting for the light to stop but it didn't and I waited too long. I thought we were going to wreck so I started to turn to the right and run through the shallow ditch and take what might come in the rough plowed field. That is all that I remember about that night.  I awoke the next morning in my bed and the tractor was parked next to the 500 gallon fuel tank in the driveway ready to be refueled for work like it always was. I do not know how I or the tractor got home that night. After breakfast that same morning when my Uncle and I went out to refuel the tractor, two F-4 Fighter Jets flew over our farm so low we could see the pilots looking back at us, they were going south toward the field I was in.",2000-04-15T00:00:00,36.71205652173913,-97.09243913043478

Intense overhead close noise shaking the earth This was my second experience with this type phenomena.  I was working in my office around midnight and heard what I thought was a huge storm approaching.  Thunder, lightning, wind - - yet when I looked out all was quiet and the stars and moon visible.  I am usually terrified of thunderstorms, yet when this came near I felt a sort of excitement.  I went into the yard and the sky was totally black above me (as it had been in an earlier experience at noon some months before.  I stood in the yard with this blackness above and lightning flashing to earth in a circle around me.  The wind was terrific winding my cafton about me like the streamers on a maypole.  The sound was deafening, a steady roar.  The thought in my mind was of a movie I had seen years before where a mother had drawn a circle upon the floor and sat, with her son, huddled within it while something like this was happening.  I thought about drawing a circle in the grass, but did not.  I felt amazement at my feeling of joy when by all rights I should be scared out of my wits.  I stood there and raised my arms.  The next morning I awoke on the daybed in my office.   At breakfast I casually said to my husband ""That was some storm we had last night, was it not""  He said that he had not heard anything. I was leaving for the week so did not ask anyone else about the storm. The following week when I returned home my husband wanted to talk about the storm, but I felt a strong need to deny that it happened.  He said that when he went over to town (2 miles away)that the people were asking him what had been going on at our home in the night.  That the whole town was shaking and people were rushing outside and from their location they could look across at our home where something huge was over our house.  (We are located on the second ridge with a deep valley between giving visibility.)   He also said that our neighbor up the hill from us had come wanting to know what had been happening.  She said that in the night their house had lifted from its foundation and shook like it was falling apart.  The children were all screaming over the roaring sound and the family fled outdoors convinced that the world was coming to an end.  It was an old rural area with but few houses.  For Sale signs went up quite promptly and the people moved away.  The bulldozers came in scraping off the signs of habitation and a new subdivision began.  I have often wished I could relocate some of these people to get a description of what they saw over our house from a distance.  In neither case did I see anything. In the earlier case at noon on a bright sunny day it suddenly became eerily dark with the wind and roaring.  That lasted about four seconds before everything clicked back to normal again.  The night experience was similar in that the moon and stars disappeared while the noise and wind continued.  I do not know how long that lasted.  My viewing of it was probably as long as a minute and a half.  That was the length of my memory or the happening.  Obviously to arouse a town of people plus my neighbors and get them out of their home in the middle of the night it must have lasted somewhat longer.",2000-04-15T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

From my 3rd story patio I had a terrific view of the Cahuenga Canyon - out across Hollywood and off toward the high rise buildings far off in Downtown Los Angeles. My 10 year old son was staying with me for the holiday and was asleep on the floor in a sleeping bag.  This night was one of those warm winter evenings, and the doors & windows were wide open. It was about 4:00 AM when I got up to use the bathroom; then decided to step outside onto the patio to view the city light.  I was looking East & South. I stood on the patio for a few moments and looked downward from my hilltop location - Then, I was amazed to see the lights in the Cahuenga Pass slowly began to vanish?  It appeared that these lights below me were being ""eclipsed"" by some large oval black shape which passed over them, as it moved Southward & West around the mountain. ""Helicopter,"" I thought... or maybe ""The Goodyear Blimp?""  But there wasn't any sound!  I listened for the 'copter's clatter, or the low-drone of the blimp...  but nothing. The shape kept moving around and below, across my path of vision.  It was probably 300 - 400 feet away.  I was very intrigued, as this made no sense, and no sound?  I could then see the general oval shape as the object passed and the canyon lights were again revealed behind it. Then, the object was directly before & below me (maybe 100 feet below my eyelevel), when I suddenly thought... ""Zeus!  It's a flying saucer!!!"" -  and then, THE SHIP'S LIGHTS POPPED ON!!! revealing a row of yellowish / pink WINDOWS?  which passed all around the thing! I tried to make some sense of it all ~ and I thought, ""It couldn't be the Good Year Blimp at 4:00 AM in the Morning!!!..."" ""It's a bloody Saucer!!!"" Then, 2 rows of Colored Lights (Red & Blue, I think) popped-on, and started to ""marquee"" - first in one direction, then the other.  All the while, the Saucer continued to pass before my line of sight... I could see (sort-of) inside the Ship - but by now, I was positive this was all a strange hallucination.  So, I ran back inside the apartment and wakened my 10 year old son...  (Trying not to frighten him from sleep) ""Jaes!  Wake-up!  Quick!"" ""What is it, Dad?"" ""Quick!"" - I took his hand and we hurried back outside on the patio... but by now the saucer / object had passed out of view, and around the side of the Hollywood Hills to across West Hollywood and ???

If they are advertising lights, we are not familiar with this type of formation.  Usually, advertising light in the U. S. are four lights, which rotate around a center point.  Other types we have encountered are either red or green lasers, projected as single, double, or quadruple beams.  Our experience suggests that UFO's are generally are not visible for the length of time indicated in this report.  PD))",2000-06-06T00:00:00,,

I said, ""I think it is a UFO"".  At this point, we both stared out the bus window transfixed.  I was determined not to take my eyes off it.  I should have yelled ""UFO"", because there were at least 5 video cameras and 20 cameras on the bus, but I couldn't take my eyes off it. I know the object was extremely large, because eventually the helicopters were directly under it, in the same formation, and the diameter of the disk was larger than from  the back of the trailing helicopter to the front of the leading one.  This was actual, not apparent.  and the copters were about 8500-9500 feet below.   I haven't done the math on this yet, but if the length of that type of copter can be found, a reasonable estimate of the actual size of the craft can be derived. It was magnificent and beautiful. About 30 seconds after the copters were directly under it, it disappeared.  I wasn't even blinking, let alone looking away, and it simpy disappeared. The copters were out-of-sight in a few seconds after. Note:  altitude estimate derived from knowledge of meteorology and the apparent shrinkage of the copters as they approached it, time of day, and relative sizes of airplanes coming in and out of Love Field.

I am a 45-year-old office worker. On May 26 at 9:28 p.m. I was in my back patio. As I was walking to go back inside, I looked up and saw a boomerang-shaped craft slowing gliding directly overhead. Its shape was that of a 90-degree angle, with very sharply defined, angular features, like 2 long rectangles joined to a point in the front. It had 3 large, white lights on each wing. It was the size of an index finger held arm's length, slightly smaller. My guess is that it was approximately the elevation small planes fly, traveling about 200-300 mph, and I would say it was somewhat larger than a commercial airliner, maybe twice as large. The lights were very soft looking, not bright or glaring at all. I could just make out the boomerage outline of it against the sky. If it didn't have lights, I'd never have noticed it. It traveled almost directly overhead going NNW. Then 4 minutes later, to my utter amazement, ANOTHER one flew directly overhead, this one going NW. The second one was identical in every respect except that as it approached, I noticed that it looked asymetrical, with 3 lights on one side and 4 on the other, the last light on the left wing being considerably brighter. As it passed overhead, I saw that that 4th light was actually a separate object flying a short distance off the wingtip at exactly the same speed. As it flew off in the distance, that extra object kept perfect pace and distance with the boomerang. These craft were completely silent. Then, at 9:55, I saw a very bright, silvery white streak of light go across the sky in that same NW direction. I've witnessed many meteor showers, and this wasn't one. The tail looked like light as opposed to a debris tail left by a meteor, and it dissapeared to a single point of light in the distance. On January 2 of this year, I reported another boomerang that flew overhead at this same location, which looked exactly the same except it was traveling much faster and the entire craft was much easier to see because it had a sort of florescent glow outli! ning it.",2000-06-06T00:00:00,34.112463636363636,-118.15585454545455

Friday (July 7, 2000), around 9:30 p.m., my brother , who lives in Covina, CA, was taking out trash.

He was frightened.  He called his wife but she did not hear him so he ran into the house to get her.  By the time they both came outside, the object appeared to be miles high.  All that was visible was a bright blue oval shape cloudy image.  It remained there for a long while then disappeared.  My brother reported this to me this morning.  His wife confirmed that she was a bright blue oval shape against the dark sky and that it remained there for a long while.  She said that my brother was shaking when he came in to get her.  My brother is convinced the object that hovered over his house was a UFO; as may be expected, he is frightened. This afternoon, I contacted my son-in-law, who told me that my daughter had seen a bright white object in the sky on the same evening (in Monrovia, CA, around the same time).  My daughter confirmed this and said the large, bright light did not move and that it emitted a beam.

PD)) A bright white beam and a large, bright blue beam and the white beam object disappeared behind an out of place 'cloud' . At around 9:30 pm this evening I got out of my car and in turning around caught sight of a bright!! light in the sky towards the western end of the (Coachella) valley.  At first it appeared to be an airplane unfortunately aimed.  A very large cloud hovered all around this light-appearing somewhat like a duststorm would; with a misty look to it.  This combination made the bright light resemble those movie shots from *inside* a theater, with the flickering light and smoke-effects.  (Although this light was steady and not flickering) My immediate second thought was that it was a police copter out looking for someone as they often do. I continued to watch the light as it moved slowly up and to the left (my left..around 10 pm on a clockface) It moved-not too far, distancewise, but over and up, where it went behind the cloud/smoke/dust/mist and reflected, from behind, in a very bright, round manner. Around this time I am noticing another/more light that at first I guessed might be this ""police copter"" using a blue searchlight, although the *cone* of this blue strip of light was pointed down, as though it was a searchlight from the *ground* pointing up at the light. This strip of light was fairly wider, it seemed, than the white strip that was coming from the object. There was, although it was dark, a fairly well-defined sense of where this cloud started and stopped in the sky, since it was well illuminated. I took note of the sky and climate: The night was clear with stars speckling the sky.  The moon was...? about a quarter?  Not too big, not obtrusive. The temperature *here* had to be around 89/90-as the thermometer in the car said it was 89 when I was about 5 minutes from home. 		So I watched as the white light (beam) moved behind the clouds just as the moon would, and waited for it to come out from the other side of the cloud.  It failed to do so.  I scoured the visible sky for what had become of the object...there was nothing moving (through the air) that was even remotely close enough to the area, to have originated from there.  I did not see anything moving in what would have seemed to be the proper trajectory. The light had dimmed to nothing.  There was *not* any cloud-cover tonight, I could see the stars all around. The blue strip/beam of light remained...still pointing down towards the right .  I stood there for several minutes as this effect slowly faded-at the outset this was a fairly bright shade of blue, almost a light turquoise/seagreen type of color. I tapped on the window for my daughter who sent a message via AOL to my mother who lives next door. So we all hung out for a few minutes and looked as the brightness started to fade and the eventual result was an oblongis/vague triangle 'cloud' in a pale, pale blue tint and then just fading into transparence and then gone.  In the meantime my housemate approached me on her way home from being out and said she had seen the same thing although from her viewpoint (about 3 miles and closing, coming in from the west I think) she had seen something of an 'x' or cross-shaped item.  She told me she would draw a picture of what she'd seen. From the moment of my first noticing it until the time we went into the house about 10/15 minutes had passed.",2000-07-11T00:00:00,33.4854,-116.1044

It was myself(((name deleted))), My brothers ((two names deleted)), and our friend ((name deleted)). We had just paid to get into the Ceres Drive-in in Cere's, CA. Anyways, we were at like the first bend turn to get to the screen we were about to watch our movie on, when David says, ""dood, there's something in the sky up there."" At that point everyone else in the car wanted to see what he was talking about so I ducked my head from the back seat so i could look out the front window and what I saw i truly can not justify. Picture if you can a summer day just coming to a head in the evening, the sun was just down, and the sky was a deep, but still lit, baby blue. Above and to the far right of our screen there was (now this was totally a visual experience) this blueish-neon streak in the sky, something I have never seen before and you could tell it was totally foreign to the sky...it was like something from a sci-fi movie, like special effects. it was about 3 inches in length in the sky, and it was such a clear night, it looked close. Now just after this streak there was a dusty trail of smoke starting from the small end of what would look like a stretched tear drop, but of smoke, and directly in the end of it was a bright white light, that seemed straining, searching almost through that fog/smoke, kinda like a smake crawls, not exactly in a straight line. Now I couldn't make out any shape of what the ""light-emitting thing"" might have even looked like, because it was surrounded almost entirely by that damn smoke. My brother ken said he saw lights around the light, but I couldn't say because I didn't concentrate on the light..i was too busy trying to make some logical excuse for the neon blue streak in our sky.About an hour later, into out movie, i was still checking out the window to watch that streak and see if it had dissapeared, b! ut it di dn't, it took a long time. Then i noticed off to the right sky there were about 7 planes, all in in close formation, with their little flashing lights, all coming what seemed towards us. I've never seen that many planes flying that close, such a small amount of sky, i don't know if they had anything to do with what we saw, but i have a feeling they did. All we could all say was, ""what the hell is that??"" It was shocking, because i've never seen anything like that before, and it kind of brought a sense of reality crashing in rather suddenly. Anyways, i'm not sure how long it may have been there before we originally noticed it, but I don't think verly long. And after I first spotted it after david pointed it out, if i had to give a time that it was in the sky, i'd say maybe a quick 6-8 seconds...maybe less. It was going in a more or less straight course, then like I said maybe 6 or 8 or seconds into it, this thing just vanished into thin air. The smoke was still there, and so was the blue streak. The smoke evaporated within a few minutes, but the strange blue streak in the sky, stayed for at least an hour. And we were not the only ones to see this thing, there were people everywhere; we were in a drive-in movie lot! people were standing outside their cars pointing in the sky, talking on their cell phones. it was a very strange thing, and I've never seen anything like that around here, or even heard of anything like that. That's why I know it wasn't right, something was definitely there, and many people were witness to it. I haven't heard any local news yet, or read any articles, but it did just happen yesterday, i checked online at the modesto bee, (a local paper) but there is nothing, and there is no Cere's paper online. so i don't know if anyone reported this yet, but I can garauntee someone will besides me. What I saw was in my mind alien; very unidentified and rather alarming. I haven't told anyone about it except my mom, this was my best idea to try to spread the news about what I saw, and to let othe! rs out t here know who might be skeptics, so was i, but this was as real as it gets. and i to tell you the truth I wish i hadn't seen it, i wish I could still believe that things like this are only fantasy, or made up stories, but I can't. I saw it and so did a lot of other people.",2000-07-11T00:00:00,37.5949,-120.95769999999999

I'm not good with distances, but I thought it was maybe three miles east of us (Stanwood, WA) and maybe a mile south.  It would have been very close to Interstate 5 between Stanwood and Arlington.  I don't know how high up it was, but it was a handspan above the rooftops we could see from our vantage point. We quit thinking the fireball was just a fireball because it moved rather slowly with a curve to its tail, and then it pulled straight up.  The sparks cut out, the thing nearly disappeared into a mote of light.  Then it reignited, the fireball this time looking like it was moving from east to west.  During various maneouvers a brilliant red oval of light appeared under the fireball, as a second fireball moved in from the south.  Both fireballs and the red light winked out, then one fireball reignited and looked as though it was moving away before it winked out. These things almost looked like intelligent fireworks, which has got my neighbor thinking the lights could have been part of the annual airshow in Arlington.  I'm not so sure since the fireballs sans tails would have been the size of my fingernail at arm's length even though they were a little distance away.  A single plane in the same location would have been much, much smaller.  Also, the crowd that would have been watching any nighttime airshow would have been several miles south of where this took place.

I was out early morning Sunday, delivering newspapers, June 11th, 2000, 0305 hrs. EST. I had an urge to stop, and looked out my side window. The sky was clear, starry, the moon had likely already set by this time, on the opposite horizon. I saw a spherical object at my 10 o'clock, about 30 degrees above the horizon, in the northwest. It was bright and luminous, but not bright enough to cause me to squint. The quality of the light reminded me of florescent, dull white with a slight bluish tinge. The light did not pulsate, or show any other variation. The most interesting thing was the size of the light. It had the apparent size of a penny at arms length, much to big to be aircraft or landing lights. The brightness was even across the diameter, and the edge was sharp, with no halo effect, against the background of the clear night sky. It gave the impression of a self luminous, spherical object, not a bright light projected from a small souce. The object hovered; completely stationary for a full five seconds, at least. There were enough clear stars to judge its relative movement, or lack there of. I live fairly close to a municipal airport, and am very familiar with aircraft lights and the effect of a head on landing light. This was not an ordinary aircraft, and the size of the light made i unusual nature very clear. The object suddenly blinked out, as if a light had been extinguished, and a split second later re-appeared north of its original position, slightly higher in the sky.  I would estimate its apparent  movement relative to the starfield was a fists distance at arms length. The interesting thing was that when it reappeared, in addition to the visual distance in movement, the object appeared to be only one-third to one-quarter the diameter it appeared originally. The light still had a wider visual diameter than an ordinary aircraft light, and maintained its almost florescent quality. Roughly a second after  it reappeared, it started moving in a northerly direction, covering  about four fists width in about three seconds. As it moved relative to the starfield northward, it also very quickly diminished in size and brightness, until it totally disappeared from view. Just before vanishing, the light was much smaller than the way a typical star appears in your vision, and the quality of the light was more a dim reddish orange. Just as unusual as the large diameter of the light was at the beginning of the sighting, the tiny pin prick of light before it disappeared  was much smaller than the lights from even high altitude airliners. As it diminished in size, it very quickly reached such a small size that it would not have been noticed at all by anyone not following the trajectory of the object. It gave the clear impression of an object shooting skyward at incredible speed, but not straight up. More like an 80 to 85 degree climb. There was no discernible form to the object, but its perfect circular appearance from my viewing angle seems to support a spherical rather than disk shape. There is no way to be certain of its actual size, but I had the very strong impression that its distance from me at the beginning of the sighting a quarter mile to half mile, or less, and its altitude somewhere between 800 and 1500 feet.  If so, based on the rate of decrease in the visual size of the light as it climbed, I would guess that it climbed a NUMBER of miles in altitude in seconds. It was the perceived speed and rate of climb that cemented the impression that this object was extremely extraordinary in nature.",2000-06-21T00:00:00,42.5945,-71.7245

It was in late September, 1992. The evening was warm and balmy, and large white clouds drifted by at low altitude. I was driving back home from the local convenience store around 9:30pm, and had just pulled onto my street when I saw a bright, white flash apparently emanating from a large cloud. It was roughly directly ahead of me, and at some unknown altitude. I thought at first that it was an airliner with brighter strobe lights (the FAA is always testing new anti-collision devices). I think I remarked out loud, ""He's too low!!"". He was not only low, I felt, but also off course! That was definitely not the approach to the Mpls/St.Paul airport. I pulled into the garage, stowed my groceries, and decided to wander out to the deck since it was so nice outside. I had been outside only a few seconds when I saw another flash. It looked like the same one I'd seen before, but now it was southeast of me instead of almost straight south. It appeared to come from inside the same cloud as before, although it might have been below it and in front of it, creating its own haze. Since I had sighted it from 2 different angles, I was able to mentally triangulate its location, and later used a city map left over from a Street Light Project to do the same with a ruler. This thing was located approximately over a neighbor's house or front yard across the street, not much higher than the tops of the trees - perhaps 1 1/2 to 2 times the height of the local elm trees. I watched it for quite a while and noticed that it flashed about every 30 seconds. Finally, I was able to see - very dimly - a searchlight beam originating from the south, going around in a circle. Whenever the searchlight beam aligned with the object, there would be a flash apparently in the cloud. The searchlight beam was far too high to hit the object and cause a reflection. The closest advertising searchlights (used by car dealers, etc.) would have been about a mile away since the area is entirely residential up to that point. At that distance, a searchlight beam would have been hundreds of feet high by the time it intersected my neighborhood. Why I didn't try to photograph it or turn my binoculars on it, I'll never know. I simply stood there and thought, ""Isn't that interesting...."" - knowing full well that it was very interesting, and unexplainable. Finally, I went into the house and watched the 10 o'clock news til about 10:30. When I came out again, the flashing was still continuing! I went in again, and when I came out at perhaps 11:00pm, the clouds had drifted away. But the flashing continued with each sweep of the searchlight!! The flash seemed to be enveloped in a haze when it occurred, but there was no visible haze in the air prior to the flash. There was also no ""object"" visible. This went on until midnight when the searchlight quit. So it was hovering (?) near my house for at least 2 1/2 hours - possibly longer. I mentioned it to a friend in our UFO group (an engineering type), and he had never heard of anything like it either. Since that episode, I've purchased a videocamera and a 500,000 candlepower, hand-held, portable searchlight of my own! Maybe next time (if there IS a next time), I'll tape it!",2000-04-01T00:00:00,,

However, it didnt lose any altitude and continued traveling westward until I couldnt see it. I never heard any crash sound and there were no reports of downed aircraft from the base. The details of the event are sketchy for me because I didn't write them down. I didn't really think much about it until I heard another report describing the flaming embers.

NTSB Identification: NYC97SA193. The docket is stored in the (offline) NTSB Imaging System. Scheduled 14 CFR 129 operation of SWISSAIR TRANSPORT CO. LTD (D.B.A. SWISSAIR) Incident occurred AUG-09-97 at NEW YORK, NY Aircraft: Boeing 747-300, registration: HBIGF Injuries: 3 Uninjured. On August 9, 1997, about 1707 eastern daylight time, the flight crew of a Boeing 747-300, Swiss registration HB-IGF, and operated by Swissair as flight 127, reported an unusual sighting while in cruise flight at 23,000 feet (FL230) over New York, New York. The airplane was not damaged, and there were no injuries to the occupants. Flight 127 which had departed from Philadelphia International Airport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was conducted under 14 CFR Part 129, and was operated in visual meteorological conditions on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. Flight 127 was en-route to Boston, Massachusetts when the sighting was made. According to a report from a Safety Board Air Traffic Control investigator: ""Swiss Air 127 was in contact with the Danbury Sector of the Boston ARTCC at Flight Level 230. Voice communications with Swiss Air 127 were of a routine nature until 2107 UTC, when the flight transmitted, '...sir, I don't know what it was, but it just over flew like a couple of hundred feet above us. I don't know if it was a rocket or whatever, but incredibly fast, opposite direction.' The controller asked, 'In the opposite direction?' Swiss Air 127 replied, 'yes sir, and the time was 2107, it was too fast to be an airplane.' The controller then asked another flight, Eastern 986 if they saw anything like a missile in the area, 'perhaps off your right.' They replied that they would take a good look, but 'didn't think that if it's going that fast they probably won't get a chance. They had just seen Swiss Air go by a little bit ago.' "" ""Swiss Air 127 then reported that they had no warning, & that the object was going way too fast. The controller then asked how far above Swiss Air 127 it was. Swiss Air 127 replied, 'it was right over us, right above, opposite direction, and, and I don't know, 2,3,4 hundred feet above. All that I can tell , 127, is that the three of us saw a light object, it was white, and very fast.' "" ""The flight was then cleared direct to Providence, and told to reduce speed to 300 knots before contacting the next sector."" Interviews were conducted with the captain and first officer on August 10, 1997. The flight engineer had not observed the object and was not interviewed. The captain reported: The flight was abeam of John F. Kennedy Airport, Jamaica, New York, at 2106, and proceeding direct to RAALF intersection when the event occurred. The captain was making a public address to the passengers in the cabin when he looked ahead and saw a white object. He saw it for less than a second, and the only movement he could discern was opposite his flight track. He did not observe any wings, and was not sure it was an aircraft. He thought it was cylindrical in shape. He had never been so close to other traffic before. He was not certain whether it was stationary or was moving opposite of the flight. It passed over the cockpit, slightly right of centerline. If it had been any lower, it would have hit the aircraft. As the object passed by, there was no noise, no wake turbulence, and no disruption or anomalies with any of the flight or engine instruments. At the time of the event, the airplane was flying on a heading of 060 degrees, at 340 KIAS, at FL230. It was clear with cumulus nimbus clouds to the west. The sun was behind them. There was no TCAS warning. In addition, there was no exhaust or smoke, no fire, and he could not accurately discern its size. The captain reported his total time as 15,000 + flight hours. He had never seen a missile in flight. The first officer reported: The flight was cruising at FL230. The captain was making a PA to the cabin. The first officer was putting on his headset, and bent over to adjust the volume. As he looked up he saw the object. It passed overhead very quickly. It was close enough that he ducked his head because he thought it would hit them He said it was white and had a round shape. There was no smoke or fire visible from the object. He thought it passed about 100 to 200 feet above the airplane and between the right side of the fuselage and the number 3 engine. There was no drift, and it appeared to be flying exactly opposite of the aircraft. No actual movement was discerned, and no markings were visible. The object appeared to be the size of a thumbnail held at an arms length. The engine indications were steady, and the visibility was unlimited. The sun was behind the airplane. The first officer reported that he had previously encountered a weather balloon over Italy, and the object did not look like the balloon. The first officer reported his total time as 7,500 hours, all civil. He has seen missile shoots from the ground. A check with a Safety Board meteorologist revealed the following: WEATHER BALLOONS * Weather balloons are launched twice a day. * The normal times are 1100 UTC, and 2300 UTC. plus or minus 15 minutes. * The time to reach 23,000 feet is normally about 25 to 28 minutes. Sounding balloons are light tan or brownish in color. * PIBAL (used for wind observations) and Ceiling Balloons are black and red in color. * The closest launch point to the JFK was Upton, New York, about 43 NM east of JFK on a bearing of 085 magnetic. A check of winds aloft data from Upton, New York, revealed the following: Date Time Altitude Velocity Direction Temperature 9 Aug 12Z 500 MB 35 kts 350 degrees -14 C 10 Aug 12Z 500 MB 15 kts 360 degrees -12 C 9 Aug 00Z 400 MB 20 kts 330 degrees -22 C 10 Aug 00Z 400 MB 20 kts 330 degrees -22 C Radar data was supplied by the Boston Air Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), in the NTAP format. The data contained both secondary targets (beacon), and primary targets (non-beacon). The data was plotted and Swissiar Flight 127 was identified. There was no evidence of an opposite direction target, either beacon or non-beacon.

Saw large object hovering right off the side of highway.  Nighttime spotting so shape hard to make out.  3 very bright white lights on front, tiny rapidly blinking red light on side facing us.  I am only guessing the shape to be triangle since night sky and bright lights made it difficult to discern I am hoping to find someone else who has seen what my fiance and myself witnessed at around 8:30 pm on Interstate 81 in PA near Wilkes Barre. We were driving home one evening after spending the day at the Italian festival in Scranton PA. We were on Interstate 81 South near the Scranton/Wilkes Barre International airport in Avoca when we first saw this object. We took notice of this thing because it was extremely high in the sky with 3 huge very bright white lights but with no of the typical blinking lights which are common to known aircraft. We paid little attention to it seeing that we were so close to the airport and chances were that it was some kind of commercial aircraft. We wound our way past the airport on 81 south and continued for another 20 miles or so before we came around a bend in the highway and out of a small patch of trees which are common on this highway when we saw it again. It now was no more than 150 feet off the ground with its 3 bright white lights now hitting us in the face, nearly blinding us. other cars on the road around us began swerving as we did due to the sudden loss of visibility. My fiance began saying things like ""What is that? Is that a plane?"" I at first thought we were about to witness a horrible plane crash but the thing never crashed. It did not even move all that much! As we got closer to it, I wondered why this thing didn't shoot over us to the north toward the airport if it were indeed a jet coming in for a landing at the airport. As a matter of fact, the craft was not moving horozontally at all. It was making a slow vertical descent over what I could only describe as a small industrial park. I had a good vantage point to judge how high (or low) the craft was in the sky since it was near a radio tower. This huge craft was definitely lower than the top of this nearby radio tower. I quickly opened the sunroof on the car and stuck my head outside the top of the car. the only thing I could hear was the traffic of the other cars and trucks on the highway and the wind! rushing around my head. This craft made no noticeable sound. Later that night I thought that perhaps what we saw was a large helecopter or a harrier jet of some kind. these are the two craft that to my knowledge can hover without horozontal movement. If this thing were a helecopter, it would have had to have been one of those big old Chinooks who's rotors make enough noise to shake the very ground if it were to be at the low altitude that this monster was at. This thing was RIGHT off the side of the highway so a chinook would have been easily heard from our vantage point. I invesitgated the possibility of a harrier jet. I learned that harrier jets were not only way too small to be this craft, but also make a terrible noise when using its engines to hover as this craft was doing. As we passed along the craft's right side, I tried my best to discern a shape of some sort. I could not see any wings at all on this thing to speak of, but I was able to barely make out a very small red light on its right hand side blinking in a very rapid fashion. This red light was very small an was toward the rear of the craft. The shape I could not define to an absolute seeing that it was against the night sky but my eyes saw that the craft was very angular and rectangular from the profile view I had of it. I kick myself every day for not making my fiance turn the car around to get a second look at it. Again, this crat was BIG. The size of a large commercial jet at least. Yet, what kind of commercial jet has the ability to hover? It di not pass us on the highway...we passed IT! It did not move save in a slow smooth downward motion. Again, this was Early September 1998 along interstate 81 near Wilkes Barre, PA at approximately 8:30 pm. i never have reported this to any authority due mostly to the fact I did not know who to contact in this kind of a case. I am not the only one who saw this thing on that particular night as the highway was full of cars and trucks. A friend of mine who used to drive from our college in Columbia county i! n North Central PA to his home in upstate NY told me in confidence even before I saw this craft that he had seen something that matched my description to a tee pace his car and a tractor trailer while he drove home one night on 81 northbound. The craft in his description flew over very quickly and then suddenly slowed and flew over his car and the truck for around 1 mile before veering suddenly and disappearing to the West. The trucker and my friend honked at each other after the craft flew over almost to ask each other if the other saw what they saw. He described the craft as ""very large with 3 bright white lights."" I hope someone someday will read this and respond either by follow-up post or direct email reply and tell me what the hell that thing was. A little info about myself. I am now a 23 year old white male. Computer Technician. While I held an interest in UFO's and the like, I never gave them much credit until this incident. I have visited other UFO sites in the hopes of finding someone else who has had an experience along I-81 in PA, with no luck.

Looking in the ESE sky at about 30-40 degrees I noticed what appeared to be a stationary group of 3 stars or planets, arranged in a triangular formation. They were white to yellowish in color and about the same size as Saturn or Jupiter, and spaced about 2 finger-widths apart (if held at arm's length). I didn't see any other structure around them.  The sky still was light (pale blue). I looked at them for approx. 5 seconds, and then saw that they began to move as a group to the north.  The kept the same distance from each other and maintained the same formation. Their speed was not incredibly fast, probably similar to an airplane.  They did not blink or change color or size.  They continued to move along the horizon to the north and then they gradually faded. What puzzled me was that these lights were standing still and looked like stars when I first saw them and then they began to move.  I don't think they were planes. I told my husband about them and he said they were probably satellites.  I've seen satellites fly over, usually at night and directly overhead.  These were different.",2000-04-01T00:00:00,42.28027533875339,-83.73625456187895

The object was larger than a star, circular or semi circular (it happened too quick) and at first I thought it was an aircraft, since it was sitting in the usual airline flight path for landings at Pittsburgh International airport (Planes land from east to west). Then I noticed that the object was not moving. As I tried to focus harder It suddenly and without sound quickly moved straight up into the sky and winked out. I only saw one object and the whole event took place in about a 5 - 10 second period. I was the only witness. I am a 37 year old, college educated(liberal Arts), web designer and part time bartender.

It flew in a straight line, slowed a bit then speeded up again, it traveled a great distance in seconds,near the horizon it veered right and disappeared out of sight.  I could see many aircraft in the sky, because we were north of Sky Harbor airport. The speed of this light was amazingly fast in comparison to the aircraft in the area.  I've seen hundreds of meteors in my life and am positive it was not a meteor, a plane, a bird, a bat, a reflection, a satelite, or a rocket.  I've never seen anything like this before and am writing this because I have no idea on what other recourse to take. I work an evening shift and at 7:30pm two co-workers and myself went outside because they smoke cigarettes. I don't smoke, but just went with them to talk.  We went up to the top floor of a four story parking lot for employees of the company.  The weather was great, were in Phoenix, there were plenty of stars, were near downtown, so the city lights drown the sky, yet it was easy to see the entire sky from this roof top.  Squaw peak mountain is several miles to the northeast of us and I could see a light mist near the peak.  Off on the east I could see some light clouds on the distant horizon.  Planes could easily be seen circling for a landing or take-off from Sky Harbor airport to the southeast. I saw a huge thick bright meteor to the east headed straight down, very bright with specks of bright green. It burned up and I was impressed with the thickness, brightness, and straight down direction that it had. It seemed very close, but I know these things can actually be very far away. All three of us saw the meteor.  We continued talking and about ten minutes later I commented again on how beautiful the meteor had been and the others were agreeing, just then, my friend said whats that, I turned around and saw the light zooming across the sky.  My first thought was a plane, it looked like it had a dim red speck on it. I've also seen birds fly by a night at close distances that appear to fast high flying vehicles, but I quickly dismissed this being a plane or a bird.  Phoenix is full of helicopters, I see them alot. This was definitely not a helicopter. Way too fast, went very far, fast.  I thought it might be some type of reflection. No clouds, it varied it speed, slightly, then veered right.  It wasn't a reflection.  It happened very quickly and the third person in the group never caught eye of it.  I've seen satelites before and I even saw the shuttle fly by one morning as it was about to land in California. This was faster than that. Did anyone else see anything?

I was still in bed, but awoke and idly watching a star around 15 degrees above the horizen to the west.  Keep in mind that I am located on a hill adjacent to downtown LA and there is a lot of ambient lighting in the area including all of downtown LA with its major lit-up skyscrapers only a mile from the site towards the south. Visibility was good, but by no means crystal clear, hence the object I was looking at was either a major star or planet nearly directly west.  I notice a smaller but clearly distinguishable object slowly circling the brighter object.  At first I thought it was an airplane or a helocopter, however at this time of night, I discounted the possibility of an airplane as it was an unusual at this hour (I know LAX traffic patterns well and they don't fly over the city at this hour).  At any rate I couldn't take my eyes off of it and wandering what it could be.  Too high to be a helecopter; no sound.  Within a few seconds the smaller object simply turned, acerlerated and litteraly shot away like a meteor- across the northern sky from west to east. No big deal, I smiled and made a wish.  After a while, I began thinking that it could not be a meteor, meteors don't turn at right angles. There was no breaking apart or trail characteristic of meteors either. There was no sound.  It was quite amazing.  What was it? All of this activity would have to have been seen over the entire LA Basin as it took place at a great distance from me.  I am mostly curious if other may have seen it...surely they did, but did they see it slowly turn and then shoot like a bat out of hell?  If it was actually approaching earth during the slow turn, then it must have been a major asteroid.

At 8:35pm on the night of October 5th 1999, a friend and myself had just put his kids to bed and had stepped outside for a cigarette.  It was an exceptionally clear evening and we were marveling at all of the stars out that night, when I asked him if he had ever seen one of those hundreds of satellites we have orbiting our planet.  He responded that he hadn't, and so I told him that I could probably spot one for him within 10 or 15 minutes, and began scanning the skies for one.  We were in a quiet neigborhood, but the neighbors porch-lights were making it difficult to see good, so I walked north between the two houses where the night-sky became more ""observable"".  I was looking straight above me, when out the corner of my eye I saw a really fast moving blur to which I began to blurt out to my frind, ""Look!, a shooting star""....But I only got out the words ""Look! a shoo......."" when My eyes were able to focus on the object.  This was NO shooting star, NO aircraft man has ever built, and NO weather related phenomena!  I could very CLEARLY see a long, thinly shaped triangle with only the edges lit up in a pale whitish outline.  I had only focused on it for maybe a second or two when I noticed a 2nd one behind it a ways and to the right of the first one.  They were flying precisely at the same speed and kept the distance between them so steady that they could have been flying as ONE! (unlike our known aircraft that fly in formation.....they always seem to deviate a little from one another as they fly overhead)  There were no blinking lights at all, only the complete outline of the triangles were dimly lit and the light seemed to gently fade from the outside edges inward, where the center of the craft appeared almost translucent......sky-black with just a hint of reflected ""ground-light"" of whitish-green.  It is very hard to determine the altitude of anything in the night sky, but to the best of my knowledge, they seemed to be flying rather low, maybe at an altitude of between 1,000 and 3,000 ft.  Agai! n, in a night sky, size is difficult to determine also, and once again, I believe they seemed to be rather small craft, somewhere between 8 to 15 ft. in length, and maybe 5 to 9 ft. at their widest point, which would have been at the aft end of the triangular shapes.  At this relatively low altitude, one would think that you would be able to hear some kind of sound, even if it was the sound of air rushing around them, as they flew at a very high rate of speed,.....but there was NO sound whatsoever!  I would have to guess they were traveling at a rate of maybe 500 to 800 mph, heading north in a straight line.  At this speed and altitude, and given their rather dimly-lit appearance, I only observed them for maybe 5 seconds and they were out of sight.  During this time of observaton, I was calling out to my friend and pointing towards them, asking if he was seeing what I was, and wondering why I wasn't hearing a response.  Turns out, unfortunately, that one of his kids had called out to him, and he had turned and gone inside the house and didn't even hear me talking to him, much less SEE anything! I am a 50 yr.old aircraft mechanic of 32 years, living in Minnesota for the pat 20 yrs.  I often fly comercially and recreationally, even though I do not posess a pilots license.  I have always been interested in astronomy and enjoy observing our night skies, and believe me......I will be observing our skies even more now, after witnessing this account, even though I don't really believe I will ever see anything so compelling as what I saw on that night in early October, 1999.",2000-01-07T00:00:00,44.7258,-93.0656

The lights certainly appeared to hover but it was obvious a few seconds later that the lights were from an aircraft which was moving westward with a slight movement to the north.  The object appeared to be a large jet liner on a final approach but that was impossible because the nearest airport here is to the southwest.  The aircraft was, in fact, moving roughly parallel to I-70.

Once the aircraft had passed, the jet engines were silent, but it was not the sound of a shutdown, but sort of a fast fadeout.  Its speed was about the same as propeller aircraft (200 mph).  Since I have seen and heard this aircraft before I have assumed that it is based at Whiteman Airforce Base. In light of two news items in local papers I have decided to report what I recently saw and heard, as accurately and concisely as I can.  The delta shape reported by some, including a friend who saw one of these close to Whiteman, near sundown, where he was working reminds me of the shape of the B-2 bomber, though the B-2 is delta shaped only on its leading edge,  however I speculate that for such an aircraft to fly at low speed, which Jane's reports that it can, there must be extra flaps which are necessary to improve on the aircraft's lift, flaps which have never been shown to the general public.",2000-01-07T00:00:00,,

In the fall of 1957, shortly before the Sputnik satellite went up, I was in front of our house in St. Paul when I heard the roar of F-89s. The F-89 was an all-weather, 2-seater, twin engine fighter interceptor based at the main airport. With its very loud J-35 jet engines, they never or rarely ever flew at low altitudes over the metro area. It wasn't unusual to hear them take off, but it sounded as if the noise was lasting longer than usual. It was about 7:00pm, and already dark (before the Daylight Savings Time era). (I couldn't positively identify the planes, but there was nothing else located there which made that much noise. The military areas of the airport also hosted F-80s, T-33s, C-47s, C-119s, Navy Phantoms, P2V Neptune sub hunters, helicopters, and miscellaneous others - none of which made such a horrendous racket. Commercial jets were not yet using the MSP airport except for 1 French twin engine jet which came and went, one day, as part of a sales mission.) After a while, I looked up and saw a row of red-hot exhaust pipes (or exhaust) and navigation lights all westbound, coming from the east at perhaps 5,000 feet. It looked like a string of firey brands. They were making one heck of a racket, and I took them for the F-89's. Then I noticed a bright light in the sky - brighter than Venus in the western sky, except this light was in the wrong place to be Venus: it was south-southwest from me at an angle of almost 45 degrees, and hanging nearly over the airport. At first I thought it must be some kind of expensive, well-done prank. Then I thought it might be a helicopter with intensely bright lights. Finally, I noticed that the planes appeared to be headed straight for the object. The object remained in place as if it had all day to make up its mind if it were going to move or not. Finally, it DID begin to move - slowly at first - towards the southwest. The jets adjusted course to the southwest. Then the object picked up more and more speed, and finally turned off its brilliant white light, and sped away. It was still barely visible for a few moments after it switched off its light, and had a dull, glowing orange appearance, and had some small white lights around the main body. The jets followed in that direction, and eventually disappeared. All the noise finally stopped. I ran into the house and checked all the TV channels expecting to see a report on the object chased by the F-89's, but there were no reports. Nothing. Just your typical Ozzie and Harriet, Gunsmoke, etc. Then I finally sat down to read the evening paper. On the front page was a small article which said: ""Mystery Object Sighted Over RAF Base. A mystery object was sighted today over one of Britain's RAF bases, but when pursued, it doused its light and sped away."" I cut out the article and posted it on the bulletin board in our high school science class, explaining that I might have seen the same object.",,44.95305527415144,-93.11475467362925

It was October of 1958, and I had been out collecting for my paper route. (In those days, paper boys collected the bill from customers monthly, in person. I usually quit collecting for the evening around 9:00pm.) Rather than going straight into the house when I got home, I decided to get on my bike and amble somewhere. I started traveling down the alley at a slow pace - going nowhere in particular - and I saw the glow from the lights of the college football field, and decided to head over there and check the score of the game. I gazed upward and noticed that the night was filled with stars; it was absolutely clear and pristine. What a knock-your-socks-off beautiful night! I looked forward again, down the pitch black alley, and I suddenly saw a strange, dull-orange craft streak across the sky, over the football field, heading southbound, parallel to Snelling Avenue. It appeared like 2 bat-wings cut out of an orange paper plate, with 3 sides in total (front, back of left wing, back of right wing), and all sides smooth and rounded, except the tips which had normal points. Its altitude was perhaps 300 feet. Viewing time was perhaps 2 seconds. I could easily tell: It wasn't from ""around here"". I slammed on the brakes of my bike, and just stood there in the dark stillness of the night, realizing that I had just seen my second UFO, and that I couldn't prove it to a single soul... There had been no other witnesses that I know of. The stars kept shining, and the crowd watching the game would occasionally cheer, and the traffic kept moving up and down Snelling as the people went about their business, scurrying to and fro... Years later, around 1978 or so, I was watching a documentary movie on TV called ""Flying Saucers Are Real"" or something like that, when I saw an account of a UFO encounter by an Army helicopter. This happened in Ohio, when a Lt. Col. Coyne and his crew were effortlessly pulled up several thousand feet by a large ship. An artist had made colored drawings, based on Coyne's testimony (he went public with it). It was an enormous, gray, metallic hulk of hi-tech engineering, and it had a dark red design on the nose which I recognized. The design was a kind of 4-pronged ""splat"", or jelly-fish, or thick cross-hairs, which if viewed from the side, appeared to be a kind of bat wing, or unusual flying wing (not like the Northrup flying wings). I suddenly realized that what I'd seen back in October of 1958 was POSSIBLY the nose art of a much larger craft. What appeared to me like a large, orange craft, had possibly just been the tip of the iceberg of a MUCH larger, huge, gray, silent piece of engineered metal... Either way, it was big, fast and silent.",,44.95305527415144,-93.11475467362925

It was February, 1960 when my friend LB and I had stopped at a local dairy store on Grand Avenue, bought our candy and chatted with the owner, and left when it closed at 10:00pm. We walked over to the vocational school next to our old grade school, and stood talking about aviation and rockets and anything interesting. There had been an F-84 parked in front of the vocational school for a few years. The school had removed the jet engine and taken it inside to be used in training jet engine mechanics. The plane remained out front as an advertisement for the school. Eventually, someone must have gotten nervous about the possibility that a kid might hurt himself on it, so it was towed away. So that's where LB and I liked to stand and talk: it was near the F-84 - or at least, where it now USED to be... It was now around 10:15pm. LB and I had been talking and trying to keep warm for about 15 minutes. The conversation felt like it was winding down, which was fine with me: it must have been around 20 degrees outside. Suddenly, while LB was saying something, I saw an unbelievable sight. It's fantastic - but I swear I saw it. A huge, cigar-shaped, wingless, engineless, noiseless lighted craft appeared from behind something - I think it was an apartment house - and quietly and swiftly glided down an imaginary slope as if it were on invisible railroad tracks. Each end was tapered and blunted - like the lit end of a fresh cigar. It was silvery in color, and had 8 to 10 round portholes with white light coming out of them. I did not see anyone or anything inside the ship. It was roughly in front of me and to my left - behind LB - and seemed very close: perhaps less than a block away. I was absolutely stunned. It was huge, it was bright, it was close, and it was moving closer. I thought it was going to land or crash. I was nearly speechless and momentarily afraid to move. My left arm shot out past LB's shoulder and I yelled, ""LOOK!!!"". LB has always been noted for his quick reactions, but for some unknown reason he reacted slowly on this occasion. He started to turn to his left (the wrong way), then changed his mind and turned slowly to his right (towards where I was pointing). By the time he was fully turned, the ship had disappeared behind ground clutter - houses, trees, bushes, etc. I yelled, ""It should reappear over there!"", pointing and running towards where I thought it might reappear. But it never emerged. It was apparently gone forever. While I was trembling and out of breath, LB was calm, collected, and slightly puzzled and bemused. Did LB - the world's greatest skeptic - believe me? Certainly not. He didn't think I was lying - he knew I wouldn't lie to him, but he thought that perhaps I'd seen an optical illusion caused by the newly installed mercury street light, a hundred or more feet away. But, as to practicality, I've seen billions and billions of mercury street lights, yard lights and playground lights, and not once have I thought I saw a silvery, cigar-shaped UFO come gliding out of the night in their vicinity - EXCEPT for that one time. Science, to be science, must be repeatable. LB's theory is not repeatable, nor can it be science. I saw what I saw - so far, once and only once in my lifetime.",,44.95305527415144,-93.11475467362925

We noticed a formation of (estimate) 4-6 clusters comprised of about 6 each saucer like craft in a semi V formation going from east to west roughly @ a 45 degree angle up in the sky. Would estimate distance out in the ocean around 2-5 miles and formation at about 2-3000 feet. Very visible, clear, breezy evening. Lots of stars but formation was very evident. Looking down the condo balcony, just about everyone in the building witnessed the event with people shouting to each other ""are you seeing this or that...?"" Formation flew ""seemed slowly"" with luminiscent, undulating or pulsating shimmer to each craft. Humming sound also was low & undulating. This was witnessed and then formation seemed to gain speed with sound undulation becomming more compressed and all craft increased angle of attack (like 75 degrees) into heavens and sped off at tremendous speed. Seemed to vanish in seconds into space. I'll never forget the experience! Numerous reports in the ""San Juan Star"" newspaper during this time period. No hoax!

It then hovered over a local residents front yard, and at this time was approximately 100 + feet from us. A cylinder of light came from the bottom of the craft as if taking samples from the yard.  This light defied the laws of physics, as you could see the bottom of the cylinder(of light) decend 1/2 way, 3/4 way down, etc. before reaching the earth. The light then ascended in the same manner, and then the craft vanished in thin air.  Again, making no noise whatsoever.  We then jumped back in the car and sped to our homes in a state of terror.

During a shamanic training on the Big Island, our group went to what is considered to be a ""sacred warm pond"" for what our group leader referred to as an spiritual initiation. During this ""initiation"", all of us were bathing in the warm pond, pretty deep in the Hawaiian woods.  I think it was near Hilo, but I'm not sure because we visited many different sites considered sacred to the Hawaiians.  Some of these sites are called Heiaus, or ancient Hawaiian temples. Others in our group probably could give a better description of the events, as I was personally immersed in a process known as rebirthing with the instructor/shaman for what I estimate to be approximately an hour based on what another in our group said, which was prior to this sighting which I witnessed personally for only about 15 minutes.  (Rebirthing is a breathing technique considered to be a ""Western version of Eastern Yogic Pranayam."") Anyway, this rebirthing was done with my eyes closed, and so it was not until I came out of this process that I saw what the others in my group said they were watching for at least an hour.  I looked up into the sky towards the horizon above a mountain and noticed the stars blinking on and off.  I asked what was happening in the sky, or if I was seeing things, and the others laughed at me, saying they had been watching these UFOs for the past hour while I was undergoing this rebirthing process. I saw, over a mountain, a formation of several, I'd saw anywhere between 1 and 7 at any one time, lights that looked like stars.  They sometimes blinked on, and sometimes off.  They sometimes changed colors (blue, red, white, green), and they moved into various formations including a triangle and a square, and sometimes just blended into the sky to appeared to be star constellations (with the exception that the ""stars"" would turn on and off and occasionally move to different positions). The instructor of the group, whom some consider to be a kahuna (Hawaiian term for ""Keeper of the Secret""), told us that the government was working with Grays in that area in that mountain, and that that was a known base.  They told me they knew where that base was (inside the mountain), but it was not wise to go and visit it.  I don't know if any of that is true, but I just want to give you some background.  Perhaps it seems nuts.  That's fine. But, I saw what I saw, just as I described.  It was the only encounter I ever had with anything like that, other than seeing a mysterious green light over the ocean at night in Hawaii that seemed to just move across the water and back.  From what I understand, many people have seen this and call it the ""green flash.""  Anyway, I was kind of in an high state of mind after this breathing process, and when I saw them everybody laughed at me.  One person laughed, ""Peter's baaaack!""  I pointed up at these ""stars"" and said, ""The stars are disappearing!""  The others just laughed and one of them said, ""No kidding.  We've been watching them for about an hour!""  I thought it was amusing how they (the UFOs) seemed to be putting on a show for us and I remember exclaiming, ""They're playing with us!""  Anyway, they disappeared from the sky, just blinked out a few minutes later, and that was it. I have to add that our group used no psychotropics as it might seem by such a sighting.  At no time did any of us.  We followed a strict vegetarian (organic) diet, mostly fresh fruit and nuts for the during of the training which lasted several weeks.  We were all of very clear mind and were not delusional by any means. What this was, I don't pretend to know.  But, I am sure they were not meteorites, nor swamp gas, nor aiplanes, nor helicopters nor anything man made, due to the precision with which they moved, and how swiftly they moved into such precise patterns.  At times, many of the real stars in the sky seemed to just disappear, like they just got blacked out, and then brought back, and there was no cloud cover whatsoever.  It was the clearest night you could imagine.  The whole experience was extremely strange to me, but our group just sort of ""went with the flow"" and I don't remember much talk about it afterwards. So, that's what I saw.  Probably old news being that it was in 1993, but I figured I'd share it just in case others on the island, or elsewhere witnessed anything similar.

Moving at a high rate of speed and then slowing to almost hover.  My friend and I watched this for about 40 min and decided to go away from the city lights to get a better view of them. Each smaller light eventually returned to the larger one and it seemed to ""catch"" it.  The larger obgect matched the speed and trajectory of the smaller object as it merged for just a moment and then returned to its previous position. And then it got weird, I had noticed that they left a slight trail on the retina like a flashbulb dot but just a trace so you could see the lines of their movement.  I began playing this game with them where I'd look into an empty portion of sky and one would fly right into the spot I was looking at, stop and then began zipping around again.

They were small plain white lights, nothing multicolored. I told the other guys to checkit out. For approximately an hour, we watched these things dance across the sky in awkward patterns. The seemed at times to defy the laws of physics. One very prominent feature was their ability to accelerate at a very fast rate. When they did so, the craft expelled sparks (or what seemed to be sparks from a great distance). These craft could turn on a dime and sometimes seemed to stop. It almost appeared as if they were playing tag. At one point there were at least 5 flying across the sky. I am not an astrophysicist, but I am an Air Force brat, and I have seen every make and model of military and civilian aircraft fly. These things were not performing routine maneuvers. In fact, I don't know of any aircraft that can do the things that the craft were doing. The craft were pretty far from us on the horizon, I am guessing a few miles. I could tell that they were flying at speeds exceeding any mach level we have achieved.

Well camoflaged, it appeared as if a piece of the sky had moved. At approx 10.50pm while observing the Lunar Eclipse, I spotted something in the sky below the level of the moon and a few degrees to the north. The object at first looked as if a section of the sky had peeled away from the background, and moved from north to south almost like a chesspiece on a board. I immediately shouted out to my companions and said "" look! what the hell is that?"" What I saw was a 'triangular (equilateral) shaped black object moving rapidly from north to south. One of the points of the triangle being the leading edge. The two outside edges (behind the leading point) had several dim lights down the two sides. These lights were a little ways in from the edge. The object moved in a straight line (without deviation) and without sound. It was visible for only a few seconds (four or five) and then we lost it in the glare of the lights from the hotel.. One of my friends missed it all together as he was looking in the direction of Orion trying to see shooting stars, but my other friend and myself observed it. Without prompting, I asked him to describe to me what he had just seen. He describe it 'exactly' the way I had seen it. We were located just south of Puntarenas Costa Rica. Date Jan 20/2000, Time 10.50pm local time. We did not talk about it much while we were on holiday, as it took a few days to sink in, but had a serious discussion when we got back. The other day at work I asked him to draw the object in question and I would do the same. The drawings were identical. I cannot explain what we saw that night, it was most unusual to say the least. I asked one of the local guys at the hotel in Costa Rica (Caribbean Village Fiesta Hotel) to check the local papers and the internet. He did not find anything. At the time of the sighting the weather was clear and visibility was good. My friends and I were on a pier, away from the lights of the hotel, so we had a pretty good view of the night sky. We observed the craft by looking east over the beach. It was only after the craft had move towards the south, that the lights of the hotel came into play.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,,

The investigation and interview was conducted on 17May97 by this writer, Tom Sheets, then Chief MUFON Field Investigator for Georgia and ISUR FI. A supplementary visit to the witness and area was made on 7July97. The witness was found to be a professional educator, female, 56 YOA, residing in Upson County Georgia.  Witness holds a degree in Education from Emory University in Atlanta, with various other educational certifications and advanced qualifications for teaching science subjects.  Witness was found to be highly intelligent, observant and seemed to react to stressful situations in a calm objective manner. Her home appeared to be well managed and immaculately decorated. Witness indicated her personal interests ran to historical reading and various sewing projects.  Evidence in the home indicated same. The witness stated that she observed the below described event during the summer of 1987, but had not discussed it outside of the family.  Her elderly mother, now deceased, was also a witness to this event. The witness stated that on an unknown night during the summer of 1987 she went out to look around the neighborhood for her cat which had not returned home as it usually did. About 12:30AM, she drove back into her driveway and parked at the end, adjacent to her house.  As she walked toward the rear of her vehicle, she noticed an ovoid circle of lights hovering over a utility/security light/transformer pole which is 75 feet SE of her driveway, in the side yard. The pole is 29 feet high.  She added that the ovoid circle had about 50-100 or possibly more orangish-red lights around the edge. Witness estimated that the size was about that of a child's portable wading pool, about 6+ or so feet in diameter.  She stood at the rear of her vehicle watching and noticed no sound and no other discernable effects.  Within a few minutes, the circle rose up a little higher and slowly moved a few yards away, over and then down behind some adjacent trees.  She could still see it thru the trees. Within a short time, the circle returned to it's position over the pole for about 20 minutes.  She stated that she had the impression that the lights surrounded some solid structure that she was unable to see.  Finally the circle of lights rose up into the sky quickly and flew off to the east at what the witness said was an incredibly fast burst of speed, vanishing in the distance.  When asked, the witness indicated that if she had blinked her eyes while it flew off, she may have missed the departure, it was traveling that fast. She further described the lights on the circle as appearing to be about the size of a quarter, and with a continuous glow.  No EM effects were noticed in the house or with the security light. At one point during this event, the witness ran inside the house briefly to alert her mother who became frightened and began locking windows and doors.  Her mother strongly protested when the witness went back outside. Local authorities could provide no information concerning similar cases from that time period.  The witness also polled her neighbors the next day, finding no other witnesses.  She added that the weather was clear and warm on that particular night, with no appreciable wind that she recalled. This writer found the terrain in the community to be mostly flat and rural, with Georgia pines predominating. An examination of the woods adjacent the utility pole on 7July97 during a follow-up visit found the normally expected number of stumps and dead pines in the same vicinity with healthy trees. The witness related that within a few years of this event she developed serious cancer, with major surgeries allowing her to survive. Her eyes also became weaker, and she was fitted with reading glasses.  She did not attribute any of that to the event described. During the whole of this investigation, the witness seemed completely truthful and forthright, and it was obvious that she was relating the truth.  In fact she was one of the most credible witnesses this FI has encountered.  All indications pointed to her being a highly respected and productive member of the Upson County community.

I have recently discovered your site and have enjoyed perusing it's contents. I read with some interest your report on the ""Phoenix Lights"" as I was a witness to their passage on the night in question. I am a pilot with one of the major carriers here in the valley and I live in the South Mountain area. On that night I was on my way to work and traveling north along interstate 10 at approximately 8:15 PM. The lights first appeared to me to be over the airport in a wide formation and traveling in a southerly direction, roughly over the interstate. There is no question that they were anomalous, they got my attention immediately, and I was concerned enough about distractedly weaving into other traffic while observing them, that I pulled off the interstate to watch them go overhead. Where my account seems to differ from the accounts of other witnesses is that I perceived the lights to be individual objects, five in all, traveling in a roughly triangular formation. As they passed overhead, I took note of a particularly bright star and noted that the star was never obscured by any solid object as the lights passed it. When the lights were directly overhead, they appeared to be comprised of two lights per object, the bright light in the direction of motion and a much fainter light immediately behind it. There was no variation in the color of the lights and no blinking or twinkling. It was very difficult to judge the altitude of the objects, as they were never more than pinpoints of light moving very slowly; if I had to guess, I would say they were at very high altitude. I know this is at odds with some of the more dramatic reports of a gigantic dark object, but I am certain that I am not mistaken. Being a pilot, I am a trained observer of lighted airborne objects and, while these lights were indeed strange, there is no doubt in my mind that they were individual objects and not the running lights on some single large object.",2000-04-26T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I was at a friends house and we were playing video games. We were in the middle of the game when the electricity went off briefly, flashed back on, and went out again and stayed off for the duration. Several seconds after losing power, a very bright bluish light came in his front windows. My first thought was that a power transformer had exploded outside and the light s were fling sparks. It continued for about 30 seconds to a minutes slowling flashing on and off. It was actually bright enough to cast beams on the floor as the moon would. At the same time that the light was going on, a low 'humming' sound was heard. It actually felt as though it was vibrating my body slightly. At the same time the 'sound' cycled in time with the lights. Fading and picking up. When the incident stopped, the power returned. The game we were playing was actually 'saved' and was not deleted when turned off. It  was not saved. The incident was quick enough that we observed it inside, but afterwards we went outside to seeif there was anything left. His neighbors were all outside as well, and nobody knew what happened. There was no exploded transformer, and nothing on the power poles that could have produced the light. All that I actually witnessed was power loss, light, and 'noise'. Several days later, I talked with my brother who lives in Festus MO. Without telling him what happened, he went on to tell me that the same night, he saw something strange while in Arnold MO. (about 15 miles south of the city limits, 20-22 from where I was) He said something to the effevt that he saw whar looked like 'colored lighning' in the sky to the north of where he was.

The friend I was with and I continue to refer to it as the'unexplained phenomenon' when we speak of it. I wonder if anyone else reported anything that night. Like i said, other people on the street were outside afterword, and we all wondered what had happened. I never heard anything in the news.

It moved very quickly across the sky. it moved back and forth and up and down several times every 3 seconds. It changed color a few times. It then went behind the far mountains and reappeared from behind them again a few seconds later before it suddenly shot away and out of sight. There was no way this could have been an airplane, no plane can move that quickly or in such a manner. I watched the sunrise for several minutes before I noticed a strange oval shaped object move across the clouds. At first I thought it was an airplane so I paid it no mind. then as I watched it suddenly began to move quite erratically, it shot up and then down and went all the way across the horizon and back to the other side in a matter of seconds. It continuously did this for an estimated time of 20 minutes. When it first started doing this I realized that this could not possibly be an airplane of any sort. There was no way any airplane could move that quickly unless it was travelling very near the sound barrier, it was moving so fast across the skyline. It was at that moment that I began to feel rather nervous and a bit afraid. The craft never came towards me, but just the sight of it frightened me, and very few things frighten me or even make me nervous. I am a very calm, rational person, however this craft had that effect on me for some reason. I continued to watch it and it appeared to change color several times. I do not believe that the color change was due to the reflected light from the sunrise however, because it changed to dark green and red and then to pure white and finally to black, all colors that did not appear anywhere in the sunrise. I am also a rather observant person and I took out my binoculars to try to see if there was any way that this could be a plane, just to put out of my mind the last few doubts I had or to prove that the doubts were for good reason. I looked at it and I saw only the perfectly smooth oval craft still, with some sunlight reflecting off of it's now dark green surface. when I took the binoculars away from my face I watched as the craft dissapeared behind the far mountains. This craft must have been quite large to be so far away and still be quite visible. My neighbor also witnessed this event, however my neighbor and I rarely speak to eachother due to a personal dissagreement. As far as I am aware my neighbor was the only other witness. Also the craft emitted a! strange sonic pulsing sound that I could hear as could my dog and several of my neighbors dogs as well as all the other animals around my area and as far as I could hear. I do not believe that my neighbor heard this sound. I have a strange ability to hear ultra high pitched sounds such as a dog whistle, that many people cannot hear. I do not believe that my neighbor heard the sound emitted by the craft, even though the animals could. Even the wild coyotes seemed to react to it. After about 20 minutes the craft shot away out of sight. It must have broken the sound barrier at this point.",2000-04-26T00:00:00,47.91181404255319,-122.03520680851064

Last summer,  I observed a similar phenomena in full daylight. I was cycling with a friend and we had stopped to  rest in a local park area. The sky was generally clear - with the exception of a small hazy patch of cloud that  had somehow developed in one quarter. From where we stood we had an excellent view of the horizon - or as good as it gets on the outskirts of a big city. Eventually, my friend spied an unusual craft moving very slowly across the sky. It was light coloured (silvery white - very difficult to read in the mid afternoon sunlight) and somewhat angular appearing. At first I thought it was perhaps an ultralight of some variety - except it made no sound and moved too slowly - ie. should not have been airborne at that rate of speed.  Both of us were moved to ""high alert"" as we observed it very carefully for some minutes as it approached the cloudy area - which seemed to thicken. I began to suspect at this point that this anomalous cloud might have something to do with what we were seeing and I didn't so much as blink an eye as I watched the craft slowly merge with its outer edges. As the craft was just about to disappear behind the haze,  a bolt of light, like a lens flare or flashbulb discharge, erupted from its exact location. From my point of view, the object disappeared instantaneously and in a matter of moments thereafter, the  ""cloud"" dissolved completely. Although I scanned the skies for this object and traced its logical trajectory, after the flare, it was nowhere to be found. I stood there quite devastated, wondering what it was I had seen - even as the skies to the north and south of us were strewn with a checkerboard of contrails. A look at one of the planes that laid a large trail almost directly over our heads reveled that it was not a commercial plane - but a very large military craft - a two engine job resembling  a high altitude bomber of some description.  The sudden appearance of planes laying out contrails seemed deliberate. Were they mapping a location? Interestingly, my friend did not view the situation exactly as I did. Whether for fear of being implicated in a sighting or not, he insisted that he had seen the craft emerge from the other side of the cloud  and made repeated attempts to point it out to me. I have excellent eyesight and although I stood trying to get a focus on whatever it was he was attempting to call my attention towards, I saw nothing. It was both a puzzling and highly emotional experience and we actually got into an argument over the whole deal. I stand by my story - he by his. What he does conceede is that the event was ""suspicious"". I would go much further than that. It does not take a genius to understand that this could be one of two things: a) ariel military test manouvres of  a new generation of air ship - the possible application of Bohm's non-locality and post quantum physics in faster than light transportation b) an incursion into North American airspace by some unknown entity One thing that",2000-04-26T00:00:00,45.51408695464828,-73.58579954756006

I was approaching a large hill which sits just off the Spur on the West side.  I noticed very bright lights moving in the trees along the top of the hill and moving in Easterly Direction.  My immediate thought was, ""Hey, there is someone driving through those trees up there. I've never seen anyone driving around up there.  Must be someone doing off road stuff.  Wow the lights are bright, could be more than one driving around up there.""  As the lights got to the East edge of the hill where I wondered if I would be up to the hill in time to see them drive down toward the highway, suddenly the lights just came out from behind the hill in the air!  I did not expect that!  A string of very bright lights emerged slowly and stopped directly over the highway up ahead. I would estimate the length of the object to be about as long as Texas Stadium!  I could not see the shape of it or the sillouette of it for the brightness of the lights.  I continued driving but was stupified at what I was looking at!  After it stopped, it reversed direction and proceeded to go back the direction it came from. (West) It disappeared behind the hill and very quickly I arrived at the spot where it had stopped over the highway.  I looked to my right expecting to get a good look at whatever it was and all I saw was the lights of Grand Prairie, Arlington, and Fort Worth spread out in all their spleandor!  There were no bright lights. There was no object.  If it had been there and had just turned its lights off, I would have seen a sillouette with all of the city lights .  It just vanished!  I have been driving home from night shift for 13 years and this is the one and only strange thing I have seen in the air!

It was about 1.30am and the road I was walking down wasn't very well lit up, as it was cold and a bit of mist was about due to the temperature. There was no-one else on the road and all was quiet. I heard a faint swishing noise and looked around to try and locate where it was coming from. As I looked about, I happened to look directly above me and saw a very dark object alarmingly low (25-30 metres) moving horizontally over me. It was really quiet and seemed to have a non-moving centre piece, and on each side of this were these semi-circular wing type objects which were turning end over end (a bit like a paddle steamer cylinder) It made very little noise, like something flapping in the wind. There were no lights that I could see, the only thing I can compare it to would be is a dark shadow. At first I just stopped walking and tryed to keep an eye on it, but the object was so dark I lost sight of it within 10 seconds or so. I stood there for about half a miniute and tryed to figure out what I had just observed I said to myself ""That's some freaky shit right there!!"" and carryed on walking. Trying to understand wether or not I had just seen what I thought I had seen, a second identical object passed again directly overhead, or maybe it was the same object that had done a full circle and came back for another look. The object was not very large, possibly 15-20 metres from wingtip to wingtip, and about10 metres wide in the middle.

We apologize to the parties who submitted the report if we are wrong, which is possible.  PD))   while night fishing we watched a silent craft slowly hover over a large pond over a 4-6 hour period making its way across the body of water. It looked very much like a star in the night sky but was very close cause we were able to see its reflection in the water proving it was in the imediate sky. we also witnessed it avoid detection from any planes flying higher above. so to us that also proved intelligence and with the reflection in the still water we were convinced something was several hundred feet in the sky, able to fly for hours silently, and directly over the pond. again it looked almost exactly like a star in the sky but was obviously not. the object we witnessed for several hours was silver and the size of a star at night in the sky so much smaller than a plane more like the size of a car. The reason i believe it was defintely a ufo is because of two undeniable concrete observations: 1. it reflected in the water very obviously and the stars did not because of their distance. It would be hard or close to impossible to detect with the naked eye because of its size and likness to the stars. but we watch it slowly move over a 4-8 hour period across the water from one side of the pond to the other. we continued fishing all night while we monitored its location. when the sun began rising we decided to leave and go home approximately 5 miles away. 2. we continued discussing what it could have been besides a ufo but we were having trouble with anything man made that could fly without sound and didn't need to refuel for that long. so at the house when we got there we decided to have a beer and go out on the back porch and finish our fish stories and the talk of what it might have been. by now the sun had rose and it was daylight i was the first out on the porch and i started to search the sky for the ufo cause i was still trying to be skeptical when i saw it in the sky above the lowest set of clouds above the house. so it was above the lowest clouds but not as high as airplanes. i called my friend out and we both witnessed the shiny star like object in the sky. now we were both convinced as there were no more stars visible due to the daylight and this object was clear as day and stationary as clouds occasionally passed in front of it. So it was now complete daylight and i saw it clear as anything a silver shiny object still looking like a star even in daylight hovering in the sky all alone. it wasn't shiny like eye wincing or flashy but rather like a star just shiny enought that we couldn't make out any detail. I wish i had a camera or proof cause i have no doubt that this object was sokme type of flying craft and displayed intelligence by the fact that it travelled with awareness to its surroundings. I formulated a weak but possible theory that it might have been studying the pond and eventually maybe us because we were fishing and did catch some. And that we noticed it and when we were leaving it i believe moved from across the pond to directly above us cause i asked my friend while we walked back to the car ""hey wasn't it across from us cause now its directly above us"" but with it being night i was still skeptical and with the way the moon seems to follow you in a car i thought it was just my perception. but after seeing it in the daylight and at my friend's house i have no doubt this object followed us for what reason i have no idea casue it did nothing unusual besides be in the sky. I saw something very clear from 12:30 pm at night until 8:00 am or so in the daylight and it was very clear to be a craft but shiny enough that i can't give any more detail. i tried very hard to see something distinguisable something to add to its desciption but it was a perfect replica of a star impossible to further describe which to me is the perfect camouflage and a mastery of craft. we watched it for maybe an hour in the daylight then my friend drove me home and we just came to the conclusion that between us we know we saw an ufo and all these crazy descriptions that people describe are not acurate to what we saw. i have to say that i know i saw a ufo for at least 10 hours and it never moved eratically or made any noices but the shininess did dull to almost it being invisible during the night when a plane passed over it then it slowly reglimmered to its star like shininess. again showing it having intelligence. I believe it either watch us catch the fish or knew we could see it  and from either one of those reasons followed us to my friends house which without it interacting with us tells me that this object was very confident in itself and in an observation mode where it feels no threat or fear of being exposed. i have never noticed anything like this since but without the water to use as a marker so to speak i! don't s ee how i could notice such a well hidden craft. this is what i believe people should look for decoy stars not what they see in the movies. please let me know if you have any other credible stories very similar to this cause this is the truest your likely to find cause this is what we honestly saw and i can't embellish it more cause this is all i saw but seeing it in the daylight has made me a concrete convinced believer!",2000-01-22T00:00:00,42.79500000000001,-71.2256

I am a pragmatist, based in our known realities of scientifically proven facts, but what I saw was most tangibly real...even my dog stopped and looked up at this item.  I decided to report this today after reading about the police in southern Illinois who gave descriptions very similar to my own. At age 47, on or about the 15th of October, 1998, (may have been 10/10-10/27), I took our Cairn Terrier outside for her last ""potty break"" between 10:31 and 10:37 pm.  My spouse had gone to bed just minutes earlier.  It was a very mild, clear, star-filled evening.  As I stood looking at the beauty of the stars, facing a slight northwesterly direction, an enormous flying craft appeared--almost as if it had been 'Star Wars-like uncloaked'. I was immediately struck by it's seeming closeness to the earth, it's relative silence, and it's almost COMICAL display of two huge single-row banks of lights on either side of it's triangularish front---it looked almost exactly like the row of lights on police cars in these colors: red, clear and blue.  My next thought was: ""well, if this is a secret USA project, they sure want to be seen!"".  It was close enough for me to wonder if those inside would wave at me. As this object approached, I choose to stay and watch what would probably be a once-in-a-lifetime experience instead of getting a witness.  As this seemingly slow and quiet craft approached our property, I tried to gauge it based upon a 40-50 ft. tall pine tree in the next yard.   My mind was trying to move fast to get a size estimate.  With it's unusual shape, it was difficult.  Nor do I possess the advanced physics/mathematical skills to measure items based upon horizon/angle, etc.  To me: this item was rather symmetrical, i.e., width from widest point-to-widest-point appeared to be 150-200 feet; front-to-rear, perhaps 200-250 ft, based upon it's distance from the pine tree's top and width of view it took up in my line of vision.  Our city block is approximately 250 feet long, and each lot facing our street is 150 feet deep.  I believe this object, if on the ground, would have just about filled the property space of one-half of our entire block--perhaps more.  I remember won! dering why anything so huge would risk flying this low so near to 4 electric company smoke stacks located on the waterfront of our city. Description: first impression: a triangle.  When I was directly underneath it, my next impression was: pentagon with a flair; my last impression: pentagon with enough of a flair to be considered an arrowhead.  Rear of craft as it was flying SE, away from me over Lake Michigan: flat rear/slight sides to main body, just like the back end of an arrowhead. Other descriptive items:  as it passed over me, I thought I detected some type of circles on the bottom of the craft; the bottom of the craft was the darkest part of my visual experience.  As the craft first came toward me, I was fascinated by the banks of lights--what appeared to be rather halogenic red/clear/blue....but then I noticed that there was a beacon light on the top of the portruding ""cabin"".  This craft DEFINITELY had a curved cabin with either windows or perhaps black reflective surfaces.  However, this cabin was NOT sharp-angled like the stealth bomber type.  This cabin seemed proportionate to the rest of the object, i.e., it was not a small bump in the middle of a disk.  This craft was not a ""thick"" craft...at least it did not appear so to me from the front/bottom/rear views I had of it as it almost silently cruised toward/over/away from me. Behavior of Craft:  seemingly ""slow cruising""; it did a flat bank from it's more southerly direction of travel to a southeasterly direction and it did this RIGHT over my head, i.e.,our street runs perpendicular to lake michigan on a slight NE/SW angle, so when I was watching this craft go directly away from me after it passed overhead, it had to be traveling in a slight southeasterly direction over Lake Michigan (I believe a straight-line shot across Lake Michigan would have placed it in Indiana/Ohio eventually?--it did the bank directly over my head; at no time did this object exude any type of exhaust/exhaust noise--only a low humming.  We experience many helicopters flying overhead here.  If one takes a typical Flight-For-Life type helicopter on a scale of 1 to 10 for noise, with the helicopter's noise being a ""10"", then this craft, many times the helicopter's size, was barely a ""1 to 2"" in noise level.  At one point, it felt as though I could almost reach out and touch, it! seemed so close to me. Other Characteristics:  Nothing struck me as it being ""out of this world wierd"" except it's enormous size and quiet functioning, and two bizarre banks of ""cop car gumball"" lights.  This object seemed to have a dull body surface in a darker color, i.e., it was not silver/white/red/blue/green/purple/orange, etc.  It was, perhaps gray/brown/black.",2000-01-22T00:00:00,43.4266,-87.8732

I know, my English language isn't very good, but I wanto to share this with all of you. The Beginning I was working on the isle Texel nearby the Dutch city Den Helder, a city with a marine-base. (The Dutch Navy) When we arrived on the isle there were strange things happening in Den Helder. A paper wrote about a Russian ice-breaker witch had a collision with a strange waterthing. The marineship was badly damaged, but the thing dissapeared from the rader. It wasn't a fish. The Dutch authorities wrote an official warning about a thing in the Dutch Waddenzee (Waddensea) Ball of fire We were looking on the dike of the isle of Texel in Holland. A girl had seen there a ball of fire above the water. The thing was hanging above the water and dissapeared very fast into heaven. We laughed, but she said it was true. Then whe went with eight persons tot the dike. Three marine-ships When we arrived there were suddenly tree Marine-ships lying in the water. A kilometer away from the dike. That was very strange because there hadn't a marine-ship for years. Strange light A ten minutes later one of my friends said: ""Look at that"" he pointed at the sky. There was a light little bit bigger en brighter as a star travelling at high speed from east to west through the sky. (two friends of mine with good eyes said the light excisted out of three little lights ) Two times the thing stood suddenly still and on his flight it shaked/danced through the sky, ""It just like the driver is drunk"" one of us said. The thing dissapeared with a little flash. After the light dissapeared the marine-ships also dissapeared. The day after our seeing the marine was flying with helicopters the whole day. A man from the island denied it was a military action because they have to announce that in the paper. Dutch papers Also in the Dutch papers there were people who had seen strang lights. A Dutch fisherman had seen also a strange light above the water. The Dutch-paper kwalified this light as a sea-ufo. Strange photographs Two friends of mine made some photographs the other day.

I would estimate the object to be about15 ft. tall and nearly the same wide but not quite.  It was completely silent, appeared to be smooth in texture with no appendages or apparent windows or doors.  It was not brightly lit but rather more glowed than anything else.

I have hesitated up until this day to report this event.  Although I understand it has been almost 1 year since the event, I now believe it's important to report the event even though I want to believe it was nothing more than a trick of my eyes.  As the months go by I am still drawn to what I saw and hope that reporting it will at the least get this off my mind. I was driving to my last home (apartment) on a warm summer night approximately in Mid June of 1999.  It was just after dark and perhaps a bit of ""dusk light"" left in the sky.  I can't exactly recall, but it was mostly dark at the least.  Beyond the treeline of where I live is the Piscataqua River, which is home to the US Navy Yard at Portsmouth, NH.  Among other things that are developed at the Navy Yard, the base supports the building of Nuclear Submarines.  Perhaps there is no connection, but I would think that if there was a motive for a UFO to be in the area, that would be it.  The treeline is approximately 500 ft away from the area that I spotted the craft.  Furthermore, if you extended your arm as far as you could away from your body and measured 2.5 inches with your index finger and thumb, that would be the vertical distance between the treetops and the craft.  Based on that, I believe the craft was no more than 80-100 ft in the air.  The trees are approx. 50-60ft in height.  It is not an exact science, but I'd said it's a fair estimation.  If the trees were 500ft away from where I was, then the craft was 550-600ft away (since from where I was it appeared that the craft would have been hovering directly over the river or just beyond the tree line where the trees meet the river). The craft itself would appear to be 40ft in length (width) and 20ft in height.  The blue beam was about 1/2 the width of the craft or 20ft wide and appeared from the bottom and center of the craft. The craft was moving slowly east or towards the mouth of the river, rather than further inland. As it moved a blue beam extended from the craft below the tree tops and out of my view.  I believe the craft hovered just along the bank of the river at times since the blue beam did appear to light up some of the trees.  The craft moved at an approximate speed of 10MPH.  I did not hear any sounds.  The craft was a glowing white light, but the light was isolated to the craft and didn't seem to extend beyond the craft.  It's as if the craft itself was the color of milky white light. As I continued on the road I lost the craft below the trees.  I do not know what happened after that.  I also, to this day, don't know why I didn't stop to get a better look.  Again, I just simply didn't want to believe what I saw. I only hope this serves to rustle up some other witnesses to this event.  Mr. Davenport et al, I hope you can make a call for NH Seacoast residents to recall their memories to last summer to see if anyone else saw this event.",2000-04-15T00:00:00,43.06793627118645,-70.7985986440678

As I rose I noticed an oblong sausage shaped dull orange light quickly pop up from behind a large bank building North of me in the downtown Fresno area.

It rose to about 30 degrees in the night sky and no longer appeared to have the dusky illumination that caught my eye. It now appeared to be light gray and very shadowy as it approached and came even with me as I viewed it due West. This is where the description gets really weird. I have had sightings of structured craft before but nothing, never even like this, nor have I heard of anything like this.

A friend and I were chasing a large free flying(uncontrolled)model airplane on a cross-country duration competition flight aboard our ATC cycles. The model had reached an altitude of approx. 1500 feet and was very small in the sky which was a very clear blue with bright sunshine and high temperatures (90's).  While traveling on a trail paralleling Hwy. 118 just north of Maricopa, I noticed a very peculiar looking object just above the model in the sky but obviously at a much higher altitude and greater distance. The shape was very clearly egg-like but more symmetrical and oblong, not unlike a ball squashed down in the center viewed from the side. The color was dull silver / grey metallic that did not reflect the sunlight appreciably and at times appeared almost translucent. We stopped the bikes momentarily and I asked my buddy, ""what the hell is that thing above the airplane?""  He said that he had no idea but that it was certainly peculiar.  We both agreed that it bore no similarity to any conventional aircraft (my buddy is a certified aircraft mechanic and pilot).  The object was moving very slowly from east to west towards Maricopa and when a jetliner appeared slightly above the object, we realized that the jet had a completely different appearance, was moving much faster and leaving a contrail. We resumed our pursuit of the model and after about a minute the object appeared to be blending into the slight haze and when I looked up again, it was gone.  The only possible explanation we both could think of was that we were seeing some kind of large high altitude research balloon (Skyhook?) because I read where these tend to condense and elongate as they reach the upper atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Two similar reports received from Albuquerque, NM, and southeastern AZ on 03JN00, which may be related to this report.

The event lasted for over 2 hours and continued even after we left the park when it closed at 10 pm.

There was no noise and only once, for 10 minutes, did I notice 2 circling aircraft (that seemed very small compared to the lights) in their vicinity. It could have been some desert military exercises with helicopters, but I never saw any strobes or nav. lights, and the movements/formations seeemed unusual behavior for helicopters unless they were practicing for some blue-angel air-show event. It just didn't seem to be the way helicopters would support ground troops at night. The movements were not quick, but deliberate, and seemed to be precisely mathmatically coriagraphed. The lights seemed to have two stages, shaped like an hourglass, self illumined, not attached to any structural object, very intense, unwavering, steady, piercing, never did they turn off and on, turn away from us, they were always on, face to us, and only disappeared when descending below the dunes. The diamond formation was especially visually pleasing, and overall the serenity of the twilight>night white sand afterglow, starlit, clear desert sky with the dancing lights made for a serene, spectacular, and awe inspired evening. There seemed to be no unusual concern, outside of the 2 briefly circling jets, from Holoman AFB five miles to the east of white sands, and after watching the strange lights for a couple of hours it just seemed as no big deal for us either, almost as commonplace as the sunset, and as beautiful.

I went outside and there it was -- approx. 20 - 30,000 feet up (about the highest a commercial jet is that you can see). The object was lit up with green, red, and white light. We couldn't make out the shape of it, being so high and far away, and object was about size of the north star on a clear night. We could tell it wasn't a jet or helicopter, as it didn't have lights that blinked like commercial aviation craft, instead the lights on it just seemed to be moving (too far away to tell if they were blinking in sequence, etc.). Through the binoculars, we could definitely see the red, green, and white lights on it, the red and green lights being brighter than the white. The craft was slowly moving north from south slowly, which we knew, because it was slowly getting dimmer as it went. We couldn't tell how many miles object was from us because of the height, but could tell it wasn't too far away -- either it wasn't that far, or it was probably very bright, which made it easier to see. We live right next to Montgomery County line, so actually, the object was over Montgomery County, approx. over The Woodlands area, when we first saw it.

Wide band around center w/ rows of lights flashing different colors, many small lights. Smoke color windows. Could see figures moving inside.  Approx. 15' up over Bank parking lot.

Many people working and banking at the bank and driving by.200 calls to report to police.  We were told it was a blimp. We went to the bank my dad sister brother and myself. I was young.  The date could be a year or more off due to this fact.  Size could also be affected due to my age.  As we waited at the drive thru tellers window there was a car in front of us in line, It just sort of came over us and just was there sitting there over us in the sky about 15'-20' above the lot.  It was a silver saucer shaped and I would guess (NOW) about 10' - 15' in diameter.  I remember the lights around the center band.  My brother remembers the way it was crafted of metal (he said kind of riveted together in sheets.  My sister I don't even remember her being with us.  My dad (He passed away in Aug. 1977 when I was 14 years old.) told my mom when we got home a few minutes later (all excited) what we had seen and reported it to the police,that he had seen shapes of figures moving around inside.  The people in the lot outside ,we all got out of our cars.  People inside of the bank came outside or were climbing further up into the tellers window to get a better view.  This thing was silent but seemed to have a kind of a feeling to it that you just were made aware that it was there. Is this a vibration?  I don't know what you would explain this as.  It stayed there over top of us then moved lightly to either side then just went away so fast that you just really didn't see it leave although you never took your eyes off of it except maybe to see how the other people around you were reacting to this event that was taking place.  I hope someone else has discussed this event so I can get an adults point of view on it.  After that day we (my family) never talked about it again.  This fact bothers me to this day (i'm 36 years old now) almost as much as the sighting itself.

A strange sensation was report by female then I felt it too.This started the abduction scenario. I remember very much of it and has thought of it almost everyday since then. It startedf with two of them, then at the ship another was there whose form I saw outlined by a goldish light and he communicated with me by beaming a very bright ultraviolet light. I do not know how we float aboard the ship but I remember come off it with my female friend and it was like walking on something solid that was also transparent. We all spoke of many things some which I remember and other things I cannot fully recollect. They took us some place and showed me some things. One thing they said that really has stayed in my mind. I asked where are you from? The reply was, ""How can I tell you where we are from if you do not know where you are at"". They mentioned something about coming from north over Canada and they said something about south. They told me that one of their crafts could take on the entire world, and at that time, I did not know it to be true, but they said that Russia had more milatary might then the U.S. I told them that I was going to tell my people about the incident, and after they made me & my female friend understand, believe, and know to be true, what the ones who I called my people would do to us, after we left them and went to the police station to get help for my car which would not start up, we only laughed when they asked us where we were. Then they asked us where are the two kids who took us into the woods, and we said that we did not know anything about taking two kids into the woods. Later, many years afterwards, I understood that the person who called the police witnessed the abduction. When we repilied to the question, ""where have you been?"" and we said, in the car. The patrolman replied,""Lt. , I search the car, they could not have been in the car.! We call ed someone from our college, a friend of mines who I transfered to that particular college with, and he came to pick us up. He arrived at the station somewhere near 3:30 a.m.; this person is currently a prosecutor in Newark, NJ,Essex Co. During 1979 or 1980 I underwent hypnosis and began remembering bits and parts of the abduction. On this day I remember so much of it and seem to be even getting more pieces to the puzzle. Here is something that I remember and looked forward to see. I asked would we all be dead by the year 2000; to that question the answer was, ""I cannot say"". I have written a lot above this section. Here is another part that I remember. The older individual ( about 2500 yrs. old our time) asked me to look into his eyes, and I called him a big eyed ((deleted)) in my mind. As soon as I thought that something hit me in the head very hard. I asked him how did you do that ((deleted)),  because it seems like he never got up from his seat. After that I was his friend. Now here comes another part, I told him that he was not real because I can see the spirit in a person and I saw nothing in him. At that point I saw or felt or sensed the being of a very good person who was very old like 2500 years old. Then I asked them or at least some point in the contact I asked what the universe is like. And a younger one said, it is like your sea. It seemed like he was saying or said that there is life in the universe like there is life in your sea. They told me that the universe has many kinds of spirits, and that there are very high spirits around. That next day or the night of the next day I have come to Jersey City to have my car repaired because it had a warranty (30) days and this was something like the 28th day of having been purchased. A VW and a regulator went or something like that. I also remember we were in this room and it seems like there were 2 or 3 guards watching me, and this other individual like the boss or something came in and said to them why are you anwering his questions, and the rest went something like: ""You are not going to remember any of this when you go back"" that's exactly. I replied, oh yes I will.(editorial: I know this seems hard to believe and I've confided in some people close to me like my family members, some cousins and close friends but this is what happened). I could tell more but it gets even more incredible so I'm leaving you with what I have given.",2000-05-03T00:00:00,42.8626,-73.0998

Now, 9 mile bridge is a very curvy road with no street lights and all houses set back at least 50 yards, not to mention that the street is lined with woods and trees all the way down. Anyhow, I saw the light in the mirror and at first thought it was a street light so I looked back and noticed there was not a street light or a house light anywhere on the road. I was going 45 down the road and I kept a watch on the light which didn't seem to move until I got to an ""S"" turn on the road. As I made the turn I looked in the mirror, the light was gone. Then all of a sudden, it came back in the same area, well I had one more turn so I watched and it did the same thing. Then I came to a major highway (Hwy.199) and proceeded to get on it to get home and when I got on 199 I looked in the mirror and it was gone. So I traveled about 4 miles to the road I lived on and as soon as I was on that road the object was back and it followed me all the way back to my house (about 3/4 mile).I turned in my driveway and pulled up to my garage (my house is set about 100 yards off the road with nothing but woods all around it)and I always back my Blazer up so I wouldn't have to turn around the next morning, and just as I got finished parking, there was a bright light that came over. It was so bright that it blinded me to the point that I couldn't see anything around me, but there was not a sound, and the light was gone as it lit up the area. Now trust me, I was working security at the time and always carried a Glock 10mm with 170 grain jacketed hollo! w points with me, so I was well protected. After the light, it was all I could do to get in the house. I was so scared and when I came in I was running from window to window looking out with my gun in hand. My roommate said he had never seen me so scared in all the years he knew me. I couldn't sleep at all that night and can remember every little detail to this day as of 3/29/2000.

The oddest thing about it was that it must have been rather low in orbit since it produced sound similar to that of a jet, but without any sonic booms.  Shortly after its sound passed, a jetliner passed overhead from the opposite direction, and its sound trail was positioned only slightly behind it, whereas with the supersonic object's sound trail didn't reach my position until the object had already stopped.

The next day, I called Kings Island to ask if they had any advertising objects in the sky the night before, making every attempt to find an explanation for what I'd seen.  The telephone operator was very quiet for a moment, and then replied, ""Oh, my God -- you saw it too?""  She then said the Kings Island had not participated in any type of advertising, and that she had witnessed the same object from a different location the night before.  I am a 54 yr old insurance agent, a partner in a large agency, and a very responsible and trustworthy individual.  The neighbor who also witnessed it is still my best friend.

This object hit the earth. After hearing Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast 5-9-00 I am not so sure it was meteorite. Myself, my brother and two other teens at the time were hanging out in my parents front yard. I was looking accross the flat land east of my parents home when low on the horizon i saw what at first glace was children shooting a Roman Candle. Within less than a second a realized the ball of fire was too large to be a Roman Candle firework. (plus i thought it was strange that the children at my neighbors would be shooting fireworks at this time of the year. The ball of fire was low on the horizon and moving from east to west. It was not moving at a large rate of speed. It looked sort of how a jumbo jet seems to float when it passes close over head. The object continued to move from east to west and flew almost directly overhead. It looked to be aproximately 300 feet over us. It was a ball of fire approximately 3 to 4 feet in diameter. It passed so close we could easily hear the sizzling of the fire. The object was yellowish orange in color. Just prior to passing overhead the object broke into two pieces. The larger continuing along the same trajectory, but the smaller one still traveling horizontally began a sharp decent. The smaller object appeared to have fallen appx. an eighth of a mile west of my parents house. My friends and i scouted the area on bicycles knowing the object would have to be smoking or burning. We found no sign of the object. We were certain it hit the Earth. The next day on the school bus to school we were telling the story, when we noticed a group of kids began to crowd around the back of the bus. I went to see what could be more interesting than my story. Two friends of mine were out in a boat ( the Mermentau River runs just behind my parents house) running fish or crab lines, when the ball of fire fell from the sky hitting so close to thier boat that it actually splashed water on them. The object is still on the bottom of the Mermentau River, All witnesses are still alive. And with the right metal detectors could most likely still be recovered.",2000-05-11T00:00:00,,

It was in late September, 1992.  The evening was warm and balmy, and large white clouds drifted by at low altitude.  I was driving back home from the local convenience store around 9:30pm, and had just pulled onto my street in Golden Valley, when I saw a flash in a cloud.  It was roughly directly ahead of me, and at some unknown altitude.  I thought at first that it was an airliner with brighter strobe lights (the FAA is always testing new anti-collision devices).  I remarked out loud to myself, ""He's too low!.""  He was not only low, I felt, but also off course!  That was definitely not the approach to the Mpls/St.Paul airport that I'd seen any planes take.   I pulled into the garage, stowed my groceries, and decided to wander out to the deck since it was so nice outside. I had been outside only a few seconds when I saw another flash.  It looked like the same one I'd seen before, but now it was southeast of me instead of almost straight south.  It came from the same cloud I'd seen earlier! (It was a very large, white cloud, and unmistakable). I watched it for quite a while and noticed that it flashed about every 30 seconds.  Finally, I was able to see - very dimly - a searchlight beam originating in the south, going around in a circle, and striking something with each pass.  When the beam made contact, something flashed in the cloud.  I had NEVER seen anything like this before!  Why I didn't try to photograph it or turn my binoculars on it, I'll never know. I simply stood there and thought, ""Isn't that interesting...."" - knowing full well that it was very interesting, and unexplainable. Finally, I went into the house and watched the 10 o'clock news til about 10:30.  When I came out again, the flashing was still continuing! I went in again, and came out at perhaps 11:00pm.  The clouds had now drifted away, but the flashing continued with each sweep of the searchlight!  Even though the clouds were gone, when it flashed, there seemed to be a variable haze around the flash.  This went on until midnight when the searchlight quit. So it was hovering (?) near my house for at least 2 1/2 hours - possibly longer.  It was late and 3 of my neighbors had young children at that time, so I didn't feel comfortable calling them at 10:00 or 11:00pm or later, to say, ""Come out and look at this strobe light which flashes every 30 seconds..."".  I mentioned it to a friend in our UFO group (an engineering type), and he had never heard of anything like it either.  I was able to triangulate its location using a city map left over from the Street Light Project in our neighborhood, since I had 2 sightings of the object from 2 different angles.  This thing was located approximately over the street or over a neighbor's house in front of my house!  Frankly, I was flabbergasted - even though the triangulation was simple, and could really have been done in my head if I'd been thinking.  Since that episode, I've purchased a videocamera and a 500,000 candlepower, hand-held, portable searchlight. Maybe next time (if there IS a next time), I won't be so timid and mush-brained!  Next time, I will videotape it, put a searchlight on it, use the binoculars, and call a neighbor for corroboration.",2000-05-11T00:00:00,,

I was living in Niles, Ohio, at that time (August 25, 1995) 12:42 a.m.  I was in bed and noticed in the distance bright lights coming towards my home.  As it got closer it was a large  blue/green colored spaceship with four large lights or windows.  The blue rays came down through the trees and lit up the back yard and bedroom as well as myself.   I got away from the window because I was't sure if it was coming down.  I would say it might have been approximately 25 ft. in diameter.  It is hard to judge size when in the air.   It came from north and curved around to the east very quietly.  It only appeared for about 15 seconds and then went out of sight due to other trees and roofs of homes..

We received many other dramatic reports about this incident, which was seen over Ontario, Canada, as well, where it generated several news reports.  One news camera crew caught the object on video, and it clearly was not a typical fireball or meteor.  In addition, the video, a copy of which NUFORC received from Amy Hebert, a UFO investigator from The Colony, TX, clearly shows a small, bright object rising from apparently ground level, passing behind clouds in the distance, and perhaps merging with the ""fireball"" as it passed overhead Canada.  The object was reported to have stopped and hovered over southern Pennsylvania.))",2000-05-11T00:00:00,41.1851,-80.7422

Two Weeks previous to my sighting I was listening to a local Talk show (The Allen Prell Show [WBAL AM 1090]) A Caller discribed a simular craft sighted around twilight, said to be standing still. The host listened, then quickly moved on with no comment (seeming to Poo Poo the caller). To go on with my discription the craft that I saw was huge. Very low, only one to two hundred feet (a normal plane going this slow would fall from the sky). The craft was SILENT, it made a U-turn in a jerky or phasing manner in little more then its own length. A normal craft would have to make a wide banking turn. The sighting did not last much longer due to the low hight it soon flew out sight. I looked around the parking lot to see if anyone had shared my sighting and found that I  was alone (very suprising due to the time of day and the normally busy area where this ocurred). I then entered a shop and told the clerk what happened, he quickly changed the subject (case closed).

Off in the northwest sky we watched in amazement as 4 lights ""danced"" around. It reminded me of four people holding four flashlights and making them swirl and dance upon the ceiling...each ball of light making a random swirling path across the dark sky...sometimes coming together for a ""spin"" then going off again to their own dances. We watched this incredible sight for about 10 minutes or so. After a short while, the 4 balls of light converged and glowed brighter. Suddenly a shaft a light dropped from the mass to the ground and stayed that way until the light of the converged 4 ""melted"" away. I couldn't tell if the shaft stayed in the sky or the image of the bright light stayed in my vision (light a flash from a camera sometime does).

There was a full moon out so the sky was fairly bright but still quite clear.  I was enjoying the sky seeing several meteors and a few satellites.  At aprox 02:50 am I notices some movement almost directly straight up from my position.  The object or objects were extremely high (I can only guess as high as most satellites).  The thing that was extremely odd was that this object or objects had three distinct equally bright points of light that all moved in formation at exactly the same speed and direction.  The direction of travel was toward the northeast.  The distance between each point of light was about the width of a thumbnail at arms length.  The object formed an equilateral triangle with a single point of light in the front of the object (northeast side).  The color of each point of light was bright white (similiar to a bright satelite).  The object or objects traveled in a straight line of direction at a constant speed.  If it had been only one point of light I would have believed this to be a satelite.  I have never seen a satelite with three points of light.  I am sure this was not a common flying object because it had to be at an extremely high altitude.  The object traveled at about the same speed as most satellites.

As a airliner aproached it moved to the east.The object was videotaped. Dear Mr. Davenport. Per our phone conversation this morning I am submitting this report of my encounter with a UFO. This report was submitted to the FAA on September 22, 1999. They have already forwarded the video tape of this encounter to you. The following is an account of what happened: I awake each morning at 5:30 am. After a shower I take my dogs for a one mile walk. The area in and around White Rock, South Carolina is rural. On our walk back twords the house my attention was drawn to a rather brilliant light just above the trees in the northern sky. At first I thought it was an aircraft landing light because aircraft on approach to Columbia Metropolitan Airport generally come from that direction. But as I approached the light it was perfectly still in the sky at approximately 2,000 feet altitude. The closer I got to the light it became obscured behind the tall trees, but is was so brilliant that streams of light came down through the trees. Then I heard the distant sound of jet engines and saw an aircraft approaching from that same direction at an altitude of about 7000 feet. As the plane approached this object moved around to the eastern sky and rose in altitude to approximately 4,000 feet. If the pilot in that approaching plane would have seen this object it would have appeared to the pilot to be below and to the east. If the pilot had observed this it might have looked like a bright street light. The object made no sound. I went into my house and got my video camera. (Hitachi model VM-3700A, with a 24 to 1 zoom) As I came out of my house and observed the object, it was in the eastern sky and again just above the trees. In the video the silhouette of the trees is visible twords the end of the video. The silhouette of the trees gives scale and distance to the object. Could you please evaluate this video and keep me informed as to your findings? Thank You. ((Personal and contact data deleted.))",2000-04-01T00:00:00,,

I could not hear any sound from them. They continued to move quickly across the sky and disappeared into the Eastern horizon, slightly North. I was waiting in the drive thru line at the Dairy Queen in Medina Ohio and the passenger with me said ""what do we have coming here""? I looked across the vehicle and out the passenger window and noticed what looked to me as fireworks. It was a cold November day and I remember thinking to myself that this was an odd time of the year to see fireworks. The colors were flickering blue and purple and began traveling toward us in a cluster. The two of us were astonished! We both got out of the vehicle and looked toward the colored fragments. As the fragments began to pass overhead they took on a greenish yellow color and appeared to be fireballs with tails traveling in a row. Smaller fire balls could be seen in the tails of the larger fireballs that were in front. They moved swiftly accross the sky and seemed to disappear into the Eastern horizon. Neither of us could believe what we had just seen. There were other customers in line behind us that sort of looked quickly to the sky almost as if they wondered what we were looking at but I don't believe they acctually saw the fireballs. I was on my lunch break and was angry that I had left my digital camera at work. The image is etched in my mind forever. I saw a brief article on the evening news that someone was calling it space junk and another an asteroid. I heard on the radio that people were calling in reports of a sighting and they were telling us that it was part of the Leonid meteor shower that was due to be seen the following night. This did not occur in the constilation of Leo. I have yet to get any kind of explanation of it. One of my fellow workers told me that his daughter had seen the same event and seemed very puzzled about what she had seen.

I on several occasions went by groups of trees that blocked my view but when I got pass them the object was still there.  I came to a corner and turned in the direction of the object to see it better and it was gone. I have to say that this did not look like some kind of alien spacecraft---like I would know (ha!)

Aloha from the Big Island of Hawaii, I would like to share a series of sightings what I believe to be UFOs or advanced life form spacecraft, firstly I am your average man with a open mind, of sound mind and body, and I have nothing to gain from my observations other than to share what I saw with all people who are enterested, I was staying with my very close friends, my Hawaiian family, at there house which is adjacent to Hawaii's Volcano National Park, 19.5 Deg. Latitude, on the Island of Hawaii, my friend had been telling me for some years that he had spotted a metallic sphere that hovered at a fairly high altitude over his house, I hoped that I too may be lucky enough to see this object, On Feb. 28 2000 we where looking up at the stars at about 9.45 p.m. that evening when I spotted what looked like a flash bulb going off, we continued to watch , after a few minutes there was another flash in the same basic location, this continued with several more flashes until we saw no more, the next day on Feb.29 at  1:35 p.m.  HST my friend had awaken from a nap and walked outside, he said a little voice in his head said ""look up"" and there it was, he yelled for me and I ran outside and it was straight up in the sky, the object was a round sphere shape which was very bright and reflective,emitting no sound, and hovering at a altitude of roughly 30 t0 35,000 feet, it's size was comparable to a jet liner, easy to spot with the naked eye, so we quickly grabbed two pairs of binoculars and laid flat on our backs and focused in on it, we watched the craft for close to 40 minutes, with the field glasses we could see the object very clearly as it moved ever so slightly from side to side, the suns reflection would move from left to right on its metallic surface as it hovered side to side, at this point we had my friends wife and mother in law watching with us, they to confirmed it was not a balloon, aircraft, or a satellite, this thing hovered, then while we were watching this thing with the field glasses it looked like! it expl oded for an instance, a fairly large vapor like cloud engulfed the craft, a perfectly round cloud, and you could see two smaller round spheres emerging from its center, two craft where now visible, they too where metallic and round and exactly one half the size of the original object, as the two craft split apart they to hovered and separated more, we continued to watch them for 5 to 10 minutes longer until they made there slow ascent into the sky, we watched them move indepentitally upward until they were out of sight, what a buzz!!!!!. The next day we rounded up a telescope and watched for the next few days, with no sightings in the day, but observed the Flashes in the night sky most every night and in different locations, some flashes where very bright, in random locations, we spotted satellites and these were totally different. Then on March 5 Th. at about 8:30 p.m. HST I was looking at the moon through the telescope and had my friends son was with me, he is 7 yrs Old, I had him standing on a tree stump so he could look into the telescope, I was holding him while he looked, as he was looking I looked up and saw a very bright light in the sky above the house, I thought what star is this, then it moved slightly, I quickly moved the boy from the telescope and asked him if he saw the light, he responded, "" YES UNCLE "" we quickly moved to a better position to view it, the light was like a headlight shinning down, then it started to move away, flying a squirrelly type flight path away, again not a sound coming from it. Then on Feb. 14 Th. At about 11:30 p.m. my Hawaiian mom came up and got me, I was packing my suitcase, we went outside only to view another bright object move across the sky, with more flashes, in the 5 weeks I was on the Island we viewed  flashes in the night sky, from random locations, there is no airports close to where we  where, or any flights at night at all, no air bases or anything of that nature, this brings me to one last sighting we had in July or Aug of 96 on the Big Island with my wife, my same friend and his wife and the same little boy, only 3 yrs old then, we were returning to H.V.N.P. from Kona after a day of fishing and it was dark about 8:00 p.m. HST, we were just before the turn off for Southpoint on the main HWY. When my friend says "" LOOK "" out the right side of the car coming in over the ocean we see a flat disk shape object with a small half round dome in the center top of it with rounded edges front and back of the disk part, it was coming in over the ocean at a very low rate of speed, what you would expect to see if it was a jet coming in on a landing lets say, and its angle of decent was nearly parallel to the land, it was trailing a beautiful day glow green color, a meteorite would be very fast and most likely a steep decent, this was not, as it passed by us it flew into the side of Mauna Loa,  just behind the town of Na'alehu, upon impact it  emitted a large bright flash of white light, and  no sound, we continued home and ! slept th e night. The next day we made some calls to the local police, they heard of nothing, the newspaper, nothing, we call the observatory at Mauna Kea, nothing, we drove back to the town of Na'alehu and asked the locals, they heard and saw nothing, there was a fire burning up in the hills that had started that night and a fairly large fresh burned grass fire next to the road, we looked around the area for awhile for wreckage but found none, had the men in black already been there!!!! .

Within 2 miles from home driving back from work on Florida Avenue, I noticed in my rearview mirror a bright white rectangular light about the intensity of a street lamp at a distance of 50 feet directly to the east.  It appeared to be rising over Ruby Hill Park directly behind me. I say rising because I was descending the hill and it appeared to ""peek"" up over the crest of the hill directly behind me in line with the street as I continued away from it.  It could not have been a car, however, as it continued to appear to rise above the level of the street even at the top of the hill, though that thought initially crossed my mind.  I had never noticed such a light at that location behind me, but thought perhaps I had just been inattentive previously not to notice. As I continued, two more appeared to rise above the hill flanking the first one so they appeared to be in a triangular formation behind the first one from my vantage point.  Since they had the brightness of a street lamp, I thought that was what they were.  However, the street lamps at distances much nearer faded from view due to their lack of strength and the edges that direct the light downward as I drove away from them.  I also thought they could be lights on top of tall buildings that were there and I had never noticed, or were being built, but the direction I was viewing has no such construction taking place, nor does it have any tall buildings. I pulled into a filling station to get gas, then thought I would try to look for them again later that evening, as I had plans to go out with some friends.  However, I was in the back seat and did not think to look for them the rest of that night.  The next night, though, I looked for them and they were not there!  Additionally, the part of the city I could normally see was occluded while those lights were there.  This would lead me to believe that the 3 lights were not just separate lights, but were actually part of one large craft.  But I really have no idea what they or it was.  I have just not seen it since. A few more facts:  the rising action stopped and the object(s) seemed to be stationary once I saw all three.  The rising action could have even been an illusion because the land begins to rise a mile or so west of Ruby Hill.  I might note, however, that I was only about a quarter of a mile beyond the hill when I started to notice the first one.  They were not following me, nor were they moving in any direction like a plane or jet.  The light quality seemed to be gas lights of some sort, but much brighter proportionately.  The object(s) were probably a distance of 4 to 10 miles, depending on how big they really were.  I don't know why I was so casual about the whole thing, but I just felt it was an interesting phenomenon.  I had had three previous sightings which were much more interesting.  One of them was chronicled here about a year ago.",1999-11-17T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

I am a truck driver and was returning from a run and was near Moorehead KY when I observed what appeared to be a bright star at first glance.  However, being fairly familiar with the stars I knew this wasnt one.  This object appeared in the ENE sky at about the 1:00 position on the horizon.  It started as very bright, and then dimmed until it had disappeared, and continued on this cycle for about 3 minutes.  At the dimmest, it was not visable, however at the brightest, it appeared to be a greenish color, almost neon bright.  Then the object moved across the horizon to the WNW horizon, leaving a tail such as a comet would, then stopping and proceeded to repeat the cycle of dim to bright.  After about 3 minutes at this position, it returned to its origional position, repeated the cycle, then disappeared.  I can not say for sure this was a ufo, or what it was, however I do beleive I know what it was not.

It was unusual in its apparent size and altitude.  It might have been a hot air balloon, except I saw no basket or burner.  It could not have been a plane; there were no lights and no wings.  It was no bird; the flight was too high and steady.  The altitude must have been several thousand feet.  I watched for a minute or so as it flew out of my sight.

No sound, no additional lights as angle changed. I never thought I would contact you twice in one week(I called about a 2nd-hand report of a blue light over Atlanta earlier in the week.) I am not what you would call a ""trained observer,"" but I am familiar with the basic characteristics of known conventional aircraft and flight, and I can tell when something is ""out-of-the-ordinary"". I am a very poor judge of height/distances/size, etc., but I am good with spatial relationships and observe things from that perspective. I have the benefit of a college education and have a critical and questioning mind. If this was indeed a sighting of a non-human or non-manmade craft, then it was VERY SUBTLE. It was about 5:45 A.M., and I had just returned home from work (I work at night), and was out walking my dog, who often stops and sits down in the driveway if she feels we have not spent enough time outside, so I was standing there with her and star gazing. I turned and faced North looking at a group of stars in the Northern sky (I do not know which constellation) when I noticed one of them (what I first thought was a star) was moving. This star-like light was EXTREMELY high up, to the extent that it looked about the same size and brightness as the stars behind it. It was moving in a straight path at a fairly slow speed, much like what you would expect to see from a regular airplane(in other words, no abrupt movements or turns, etc.) At first, I began thinking about what it could be, perhaps an airliner VERY high up, a satellite (seemed too fast for that), or some other type of spacecraft (I am uninformed about what is up there in orbit right now). As I stared at it, however, it slightly veered off its straight course and began moving more in line with my line of sight/where I was standing, and was getting brighter. After a minute or so, I could tell that it was getting brighter because it was descending. It was a very cold and perfectly clear night, so I had a ski-cap and coat hood over my head, so I began taking everything off to listen for a sound, and there was none. As the light began approaching the point of being overhead, and since it had veered off course slightly, I figured that as it passed, I would be able to see additional or blinking lights if it was a standard airplane, and at the very least I would hear a sound as it passed overhead, neither of which happened. The light, though brighter, maintained its basic appearance of a white, star-like light. As it got closer it seemed to level-off, but was still very high, and I got the feeling that it was coming down to look at or look for something (monitoring/patrolling?). At this point, I thought it might be a morning traffic or news chopper, but that was highly inconsistent with its original altitude when I first saw it. After about 30 seconds of flying at this height/speed, it seemed to increase its speed to what was approximately double its original speed, veered back left to its original path, and began to ascend rapidly. This is where I began to feel funny about this object, as its ascension seemed to cover an extreme vertical distance in a relatively short amount of time, which seemed like highly unlikely behavior from any type of conventional aircraft. Again, this with NO SOUND and NO ADDITIONAL LIGHTS-by this time it had already passed overhead, and there should have been some defining features if it had been a conventional airplane. As the light continued to traverse the sky, it was obviously climbing faster than it was moving horizontally, because it got so high that I could not see it anymore looking straight on. I offset my eyes slightly and continued tracking the light in my periphery, but after a about 60 seconds of this, it was completely out of view (UPWARDS, NOT ON THE HORIZON). In other words, it went so high up that it was no longer visible, and never fully traversed the entire skyscape from horizon-to-horizon. At this point, I had a very odd feeling about what I had just seen. Although it was not very dramatic, just the basic behavior of this ""object"" did not, in my mind, conform to any behavior, attitude, or flight plan that would be expected from any type of aircraft in near-space or in orbit. It seemed that the ascension (and as I later concluded, the first descension) was just too extreme for a conventional aircraft. Adding to that the missing sounds/additional lights that accompany traditional craft, it added up to be a very unusual sighting. Plus, I just felt strange after seeing it.",2000-01-07T00:00:00,33.96188745901639,-84.51021319672131

I was in 6th grade at the time, and i was also living in the residential unit at the school.  I was in bed, along with my room mates ((deleted)) .  I saw a brilliant flash of white light and i got up and opened the window to see what it was. Then the white light faded out and I saw the traffic light outside was changing colors erradically...it would go from yellow to green then to red, and so on.  Then i looked up and to the left of it, and saw there was another light in the sky, changing colors exactly the same way.  The traffic light was about 50 feet away, and from my vantage point it looked like the UFO was about twice it's distance, hovering at maybe 150 feet. After i observed this for about 45 seconds, an even brighter white light shined onto me, and i had for some reason an intense feeling of joy, followed by an intense feeling of dread or fear.  The next thing i knew, the person who was on duty that night came into the bathroom and said ""Are you okay, ((deleted))?  You've been in here for almost an hour.""

I stepped from house into driveway and noticed three bright lights approaching at just above treetop level from the south.  I first thought they might be helicopters with search lights.  But then I realised that the lights were beaming forward and not down.  Straight line formation...some distance between lights but I am unable to estimate how much distance.  I listened for engine sound, but heard nothing except crickets and distant creek sounds.  The formation moved slowly from south to north.  I was dumbfounded because this is a rural area and nearest airport is about 15 miles south of here.  Just as I was wondering why three aircraft would be flying so low, in formation, and with landing lights on, all three lights extinguished suddenly and simultaneously.  I then observed no strobe lights or wing/tail markers.  And of course, still no sound.  I strained my eyes trying to see anything in the darkness that followed the lights being extinguished, but could see nothing on this otherwise clear night.  End of incident.

E-mail address:  <mufonga@webtv.net>  NUFORC expresses its gratitude for the report.  PD)) Hovering dark mass surrounded by yellow glow The witness in this case is one of several in the Chatsworth/Fort Mountain community that have reported apparently anomalous events to MUFONGA/ISUR during the past two years. The witness lives in this mountain top community that overlooks the valley lying between Fort Mountain and Grassy Mountain, both peaks lying just east of Hwy 411 in NW Georgia. The site from which this observation was made is about 2800 ft. in elevation. The witness was found to be a successful businessman in good health and a subtantial well respected member of the Murray County/Chatsworth community. This investigation was a joint MUFONGA/ISUR venture and was conducted on 22Aug98. The witness stated that on 8Aug98 at about 9:30PM EDT, he was sitting on his patio deck which has views to the north, northwest and northeast. There was a cloud cover at about 8,000 feet, no precipitation, little or no wind, temperature about 73 degrees. He observed a yellow circle or orb drop down out of the cloud cover to the NE about 1/2 to 1 mile away. It then stopped and hovered at an estimated 3800 ft. altitude (observation made from about 2800 foot altitude).  The witness watched closely for about 10 seconds and described it as being a dark object or center mass, his diagram indicated a small doughnut shaped center, surrounded by concentric layers of yellow glow.  It appeared to be about the size of a basketball held at arm's length and the glow was about as bright as that of the full moon. The object/light then vanished as he watched. These investigator's gained permission to surveil the valley for the remainder of the night from the patio deck. At about 11:00PM, these FIs noticed a very bright starlike light (brighter than Jupiter and about twice it's size) appear appx. 1/4 off of the horizon over the ridges to the NE, it then dropped straight down, displaying a 'wiggling' motion as it descended and disappeared. Event duration no more than 1 or 2 seconds, range to light estimated at 1+ to several miles (night observation).  This writer seemed to notice a slight momentary halt in the travel downwards, but this was not noticed by the other FI. An inspection of that vicinity with binoculars revealed no aircraft that could be observed or heard. While not as close or spectacular as the event of 8Aug98, this distant observation did exhibit some of the same characteristics; dropping downward, then vanishing.  It did not appear to be a meteor or returning space junk, both of which have been observed by these FIs on previous occasions (meteor showers many times). There are additional cases under investigation in this area, including the nearby town of Elijay.  See elsewhere in this database for case of 16Oct99, 'Glowing Orange Orb Hovers'.  That particular case was reported by a seperate witness in the same general vicinity. Detailed reports of the aforementioned 8Aug98 event were submitted to MUFON HQ and the ISUR database.

At 2:30 am on the night of April 23rd, 1998, I was lying on the ground outside of my college dorm building staring at the night sky. My body was lying feet to the west, head to the east. The cloud cover for the sky was patchy but at about 40-50%. That night there must have also been a bright moon because I clearly remember a particularly intense luster to the clouds. I was talking with a friend when I noticed out of the corner of my right eye (to the north) movement that really only registered consciously but not so that it drew my attention. I did realize that the motion was extremely fast and for some very puzzling reason, I felt compelled to look to the south in the night sky as if I knew that it was moving so fast that to attempt to turn my head and look at it would mean missing it and instead I looked south to allow it to travel through my field of vision where I could track it with my eyes as it entered. What I saw, albeit brief, to this day is the most profound event I have ever witnessed. I was able to see the objects for no more than three seconds in the sky. They entered my vision heading south at what I would estimate at between 800-1000 mph based on the change in degree of my field of view and the time in which the change occurred. The objects were as follows: there were three light blue or grey light triangles with only the borders illuminated. That is to say that the objects looked like isoscelene triangles made of flourescent light bulbs. The objects appeared to be dodging in and out of the clouds from my vantage point. I can not, however, state with any certainty how far away they may have been or if they were above or below the clouds. It was especially difficult to tell because the illumination of the objects was not unlike that of the clouds in intensity. But, not only did the objects appear to be moving in and out of the clouds but they moved as though they were completing repeated figure-eights with each other at a very constant rate. I remember being scared deeply by the exact nature in which the objects moved with each other. I guess it scared me because I had never seen anything as geometric, fast, or precise in motion any where in the natural world around me. These certainly were not birds or aircraft. Any aircraft moving this fast would have created at least a sonic boom not to mention either a contrail or engine noise. Almost as soon as the event was recorded in my sight, it was over. I jumped to my feet and started swearing quite loudly and asking anyone of about six people within about two feet of me if ""they saw that"". I was struck dumb with disbelief having seen something that to this day has left me with no logical answers. Here is some important info about the area. Fargo is, apparently, no stranger to the sighting of aerial phenomena as I had found out after checking out some other reportings and found that North Dakota itself is a hotbed. The area of Fargo itself where I was when I saw this event occur is not more than one mile south of the 119th Strategic Bombing Wing and an Air National Guard base. Grand Forks, ND is just 80 miles north and is home to one of the largest air bases in the United States. Often in the area, one can see large aircraft landing, committing touch-and-go's, taking off and rolling flight patterns over the area. I am not, however, even going to begin to kid myself into believing that what I saw was military aircraft or any kind of commercial aircraft. The speed was simply astounding not to mention the risk of flying three aircraft in a weave-pattern in and out of each other at ANY speed. And finally, background on me. I graduated from that college (NDSU) in 1999 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Archaeology with a specialization in cartography and linguistics. My minor degree was Psychology. I am an accomplished Martial artist and guitar instructor and I have a very well paying job working as a systems analyst in Minneapolis. I am not any sort of cuckoo or permanent day-dreamer. I have nothing to gain by reporting this event. I apologize for waiting over a year and a half to report this event but the very mention of the phrase ""I saw something last night I can't explain..."" got me glances from the wierdest of my colleagues. I hope that this report helps your efforts. God Bless and take care... A Believer. PS Due to the nature of my report, I hope that you understand my reluctance to transmit my address and name. You can, however, contact me via the email address below and I will respond as I am possible. Thank you...",1999-12-16T00:00:00,46.85898940568475,-96.84602144702843

Three ""lights"" which looked like stars, were moving in a triangular shape across the sky. I've seen satellites before, and these were kind of similar.  no flashing, no sound, just a silent flight from behind us in the south, toward where we were facing to the northeast. Total flight time horizon to horizon was around three minutes.  There was several other aircraft in the sky, jets and helicopters.  It was by far the oddest thing I've seen in the night sky.  I don't know if it was alien, I just would like to know what it was.  At first i thought it was a large aircraft with white lights on the nose and the tips of the wings.  But when it flew past the stars, I could see them between the three lights.  I assume it was three objects flying in formation. ((NUFORC Note--The report may allude to a formation of three (presumed) satellites, which were being reported from many sources at about this time.  We presume that the objects are part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system for pinpointing the location of ships around the world, but that is an assumption.  In years past, NORAD and the Space Command have reported to NUFORC what these three objects are.  However, Terence Dickinson, of the Toronto (Ontario) Star, was able to identify a similar formation that was reported during the summer of 1996.  He found that the objects were almost certainly satellites put up by the U. S. Navy.  Our gratitude to Mr. Dickinson for his research.))",1999-12-16T00:00:00,,

From out of nowhere, an object appeared directly above and in front of us, and positioned itself in favor of the driver's side, but so that the passenger had full view as well. After a second or two of adjusting to the extraordinary event, I realized that the UFO was traveling the same distance/speed as we were, as if to keep up with us.  My impression now is that it wanted us to see it, as if it were there only for us to enjoy the light show.  The UFO was beautiful to me.  It wasn't exactly diamond-shaped, but more trapezoidal.  Geometrical and very angular.  It seemed to be hovering approximately 50 feet above us.  It was glowing a gorgeous, warm auburn, yellowish-brown color.  It was just beautiful and the feeling I get to this day is that it was ""showing off"" for only my friend and I, since the other 2 passengers had no idea that this was taking place.  After maybe 10 or 15 seconds of traveling a straight line with us, the UFO emitted 2 rays of light from either side of it, which shot out in different directions.  All 3 objects then disappeared.  I don't know how I managed to keep my eyes on the road for those 20 or so seconds because I can't imagine that I ever peeled my eyes off the spectacle.  The 2 passengers in the back had no idea anything took place.  I pulled over to the side of the road and my friend and I began sobbing in excitement.  I will mention here that I am certain this amazing event took place only because she was present.  She has extremely unstable energy and is an emotionally troubled person.  Her entire life has been plagued by poltergeists (which I'm sure are just psychokinetic irregularities she createsv) and out of the ordinary experiences.  This type of experience is not unusual for her, and I believe that I was given a gift of sorts to be able to see what I did.  I feel very strongly that whatever was prope! lling th at craft, was there because of my friend and to fulfill my life-long wish of seeing a UFO.",1999-12-16T00:00:00,35.75970943396227,-81.72392452830188

As soon as we ( my 14yr. son) arrived in Lexington KY. I wrote the date and location and time down we saw the triangle shape in the sky.(8:20pm)  My son,  who normally tells me it is just another plane.. actually rolled down his window and said. "" Mom, I think you are right.. that is no plane or helicoptor, I don't know what it is.""  There were at least two other air crafts in the sky and we were watching those as they were fairly low as I assumed there was a air port close by.  Since I was driving it was hard for me to watch the planes.  Then my  son noticed somthing unusual..  very bright white lights on each corner of the of a third air craft. We were not that close to actually verify it was trianglar in shape.  But, from me just looking out the window.  I would say yes... it had a triangle shape.  It was moving when we first saw it and then it just more or less just hung there.. no sound.  I can't say for sure if it was a UFO.  But, it gave us good converstation on the way to my parents house in Lexington. Sincerely, ((name deleted))",1999-12-16T00:00:00,39.0022582278481,-84.65651645569619

He suddenly felt a very distinct presence around him which appeared crystal/dust like. It was different than anything he had ever observed or felt. He stated that it only lasted a matter of seconds. He told no one about this event as he did not want to frighten any of us. He kept quiet until our 16 year old daughter, ((name deleted)) told us about a simular occurance that happened on her birthday, November 10 1999.

I was frightened and started to run up to the house when it happened again, it made me stop, I felt like it was all around me."" My husband then told us about the event he had experienced.

The light lasted approximately 20 to 30 minutes. They were very frightened. We do not have any lights on our property that would shine on the roof.

On thr night of 1/26/00, I was a passenger aboard a commercial Beechcraft plane flying from Denver Co. to Sante Fe NM. At approx 9:45pm, I felt the plane lose a little altitude in the cloud cover and assumed we were preparing to land in Sante Fe. I looked out the window (westerly) and saw yellow lights passing parallel to the wing tip. I believed them to be runway lights and felt they were a bit too close for comfort. Thinking we had passed all the lights, I looked back towards the rear of the wing and noted that the lights  were now traveling with us in a line parallel to the back of the wing. After one or two seconds the lights simply vanished. Shortly afterward, we broke through the clouds and were not, as I had imagined, near Sante Fe. It was another 25 or 30 minutes before we made it into Sante Fe. After landing, I asked our first officer if anything unusual had occured during our flight. The officer asked me to be more specific and I recounted what I had seen. I find the officers response to my questions as interesting as what I had seen during the flight. I was told that ""our aircraft"" or ""aircraft of this type"" do not use yellow lights of any sort, they use a red light on one wing, green on the other and white on the tail. I was then informed that there had been no radar contact with any other PLANE that close to us during our flight and stress was placed on the statement by saying that if any PLANE had been that close to us, it would certainly have been picked up by radar alerting the cabin crew to such a presence. Even more interesting, while showing an egar attentiveness and curosity to the details of my account, the officers remarks were professionally reserved. Additionally, this individual asked me a number of questions about what I had seen and yet never gave more than vague and obscure responses to my questions. Because of this officers manner, one could speculate about a few things: When saying ""our Aircraft"" or ""aircraft of this type"" don't use yellow lights, was this person hinting that perhaps a military or some other sort of craft might use yellow lights? If so, what sort of craft might that be? By stressing no radar contact with any PLANE that close during the flight, was the officer illuding to the possibility of radar detecting something else? Was I being subtly asked to read between the lines? During our conversation, the officer seemed to carefully avoid anything that might have led to answering questions about what the cabin crew actually saw with their own eyes. I have learned that airlines frequently assign less seasoned pilots to fly the small commuter planes, allowing them to rack up the flight hours required to pilot the larger, jet passenger planes. No doubt the admission of an unusual sighting during flight might well be considered a professional liability for a young pilot just starting out with a major airline, therefore, I am electing not to name the airline or make any further public comment about my interaction with the officer for the time being.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,,

I would have estimated the initial contact to be about 75 miles off the nose of our aircraft and at approximately the same altitude.  We were unable to pick up this object on our inflight radar...which had a range of over 500 miles.  The object stayed at off our nose for about 20 minutes before rising to what I would have guessed to be over 70000 feet in altitude.  It then came to a position almost directly over our aircraft.  It stayed in this position for about ten minutes before it took off in an easterly direction at what I would have estimated to be over 70000 feet in altitude.  I was the pilot on that particular flight.  At the time, I had over 3000 hours of flight-time, mostly in jet aircraft.  There were 17 other people on the aircraft who witnessed the same object.

The reports from professional pilots are particularly interesting, and useful. Thanks again for sharing the information with our Center!  Please pass our contact information along to other pilots, so that they will be able to preserve the information surrounding any sightings they may have had. NUFORC NOTE : Subsequent reponse from witness The type of aircraft I was flying was an E-3A AWACS aircraft.  This was a military aircraft with airborne radar and surveillance capabilities.  It has a crew of 17, all of whom witnessed the same object.  We should have been able to pick the object up on our in-flight radar which was fully functional at the time we saw the object. In reference to your second question, we tried to make a report when we landed in Iceland, but noone in our debriefing knew how or whom to report such an incident. I hope this info helps.

It was still visable for about twenty seconds then again shot off to the north and disappeared.  It was more than likely outside the atmosphere and looked no different than the North Star.  I witnessed this object zig-zag and manuevor.  Something was controlling this object.  No sattilite can manuevor at that rate of speed.  This object would move quicker than my own eyes.  I watch the skies periodically and never have I seen something in this nature.  I live by Dulles Airport so I know what should and shouldn't be flying around my house. It was about 10:00pm on Wycombe St. in Centreville Va.  My french friend and I were observing the traffic of airplanes above when something caught both our attention at the same time.  An object very far away moving at first very slowly.  This object had the appearance no different from what a star would look like.  At first I thought it was just a sattilite until the object moved very quickly to the left and to the right and then to the left again.  Then the object remained stationary for about two or three seconds.  My friend and I woke up the neighborhood with obsenities.  About that time the object zipped to a more northern area in the sky very very fast.  Right after that it shot off out of our site within the blink of an eye.  I will never forget that experience.,2000-02-23T00:00:00,38.8439,-77.46703165829146

I am located at roughly 35.717N Latitude/-86.5060W Logitude. The moon at this point was roughly 75-85 degrees from my field of view and I was facing SE. This object glided eerily and slowly. Each point of the triangle was covered in vapor or cloud-like material and the object was translucent. As the object crossed my view of the moon, it obscured the moon as if looking at heat waves down an asphalt highway during the summer months, but the moon was still visible. I also detected a faint oscillating or sound pressure alternating sensation in my ears. The wind was blowing gently that night as well. It was a partially cloudy early morning and particularly cool, approx. 45 degrees. I didn't report this incident earlier as I had dismissed it as an illusion of the elements (clouds, moisture, temperature) but after seeing Eric Martin's GIF animation, that's (more or less) exactly what I experienced, except not against a starfield specifically, but against the sky as it was that morning.

My friend and I were driving north on 2nd Ave S in Waite Park, MN when I noticed bright white light in the western sky to my friend.  I commented on it and asked my friend 'what in the hell that was'.  He thought it might have been an airplane, but I thought it was too bright.  I took my eye off the object when we neared an intersection.  I lost track of the light and dismissed it as mildly unusual.  As we cleared the intersection, still headed north bound we both noticed an identical light in the northern sky.  It was easy to follow, because we were driving in that direction.  We watched the light for approximately 5 seconds when it seemingly lost its illumination slowly.  It seemed to take a couple of seconds for the light to disappear.  When it did there was no visual evidence of anything else in the sky, no aircraft, no nothing.  By the way the light dissapated I thought it might be some sort of flare, but there was no ascent or descent of the light, rather it seemed to just disappear.  It seemed possible that it may have been an aircraft, but the light was too bright and didn't seem to move and with the cloud cover being so great or distance of vision would have noticed a movement in an aircraft.  The light never blinked, but seemed to be greatly illuminated.  There were no towers or tall buildings in that area. In both cases the object appeared to be around 30 degrees ascension. I would have dismissed one strange light, but two in totally different areas of the sky in such short a length of time didn't make any sense to me or my friend.

Our analysis indicates that the anomalous objects are normal contrails behind jet aircraft preparing to land to the north at Neward, NJ, airport.   The well known UFO investigator/skeptic, Phillip Klass, we have been told, reached the same conclusion from having inspected an identical tape sent to him.  Hence, this report of rapture appears to us to be premature.)) DAYTIME VIDEO RAPTURE! ANGELS AND UFOS! On 11-11-1999 I went outside to look at the sunset, as I did I saw luminous patches of sky. I went inside to get the 35 mm camera. I came outside and took some shots of the bright lights in the sunset. Now these lights were more like pieces of sky, like sheets. I quickly ran out of film so I went inside to get the videocamera. When I came bacl out there was a sphere type ufo over my neighbors house in the distance. I started to film. While I was filming it another ufo appeared in the frame from nowhere. It appears as a small dot and grows ito a cigar shaped ufo, clouded or encased in mist. The Cigar and the sphere are under fire. There are small  very fast moving spheres running from right to left perfectly horizontal. The two ships fire a weapon at these ultra high speed spheres. Now, these spheres were not visible to the naked eye, only visible when the tape is played back and only clear in a frame by frame view. The  cigar ship that is above and to the left of the atationary sphere spits out a long silver thread shimmering like snail trails. then the snail trail blows up to become another ship. The three form an isoceles triangle. The two cigar ships are changing color from green to red. Upon close examination of the avi file you can see the ship change color as it charges it's weapon the green flashes are charge up and the red is discharge. Remember I have the videotape proving every word I write. The craft fires a green plasma ball. The green balls of energy deflect the ultra high speed spheres the spheres come in two colors black and white. After a few moments of shooting like crazy the amount of ultra fast spheres decrease. Then Huge patches of a Luminous substance is manifested right out of thin air. These patches are like the ones I first took the photos of. Then several large patches of Luminous ""Stuff"" gets sucked into the bottom of the extraterrestrial craft from the bottom. Now you must think I am making this up. But I have the tape. It was made with my Son and my Daughter present. In the middle of the tape my wife comes home from work and finds us on the porch with the camera. This is not a joke! This is the most seious footage that has even been acquired. You can see stills here:((URL deleted)) Theere you will also find a copy of the letter sent to the President and Vice President as wellas to all 100 U.S. Senators. These craft have the ability to appear out of nowhere. They do it without warning. They are laying down suppressive fire during some type of extraction process. They are performing some unknown business in our atmosphere. This is an EXTREMELY BIG deal. BUT! If you don't come to my aid, by viewing and questioning and doing your part. The extraterrestrials that so want to meet us will be even further delayed. It's that simple! When will we be ready! If you are ready write me. We here in New Jersey need to fight for recognition of this reality. I have the undisputable daylight video! On 12-13-99  ((deleted)) news is coming over to film the area in preparation for a live broadcast on Thursday. The Senior Correspondent is ((name deleted)), and he will be doing the interview. Stand Tall Folks, now is the time. I have had this footage for some days now and it has modified my perspective as it has to ALL who have seen it! The video trancends language and speaks to the higher self of every individual. Now yes those who would believe nothing will not believe this either, but that will make it easier for you to push them away before the explode and get you all messy. Those who doubt will be swayed by this. But those who actively participate in diss- information, and in just being an eternal detractor will be destroyed by this tape. This tape ""IS"" the truth. The ""TRUTH"" is no longer out there, it's in you and this tape will bring it out! And allow you to have pride in your inner knowlege. Knowing without proof is faith but knowing with proof is cake! Throwing away things that are ""NOT"" cake....well in that there can be no loss when the rest is all cake! I hope you can understand that.

The colour of the craft were silver, and highly polished. The lights were orange, and yellow and there were about 13 of them on each craft.There was also ablue haze around one of the objects. There were at least two Silhouettes of beings with large heads in each craft. Their eyes were red and fiery and were like slits. The craffs did not land but came close to the ground. All of a sudden, a thunderlike sound w as heard, and the crafts disappeared. They were going at about 110 kms an hour. A tril was left when the crafts were going to the landing position close to the ground.

"watching storm,thought a boat let out a flare,a red hovering light but the flare zig zagged then flew on angle, then flew straight behi","Magnetic Island (QLD, Australia)",,1999-11-12T23:30:00,light,10 mins,"Occurred : 11/12/1999 23:30  (Entered as : 11/12/99 23:30) Reported: 4/5/2000 06:56 Posted: 4/15/2000 Location: Magnetic Island (QLD, Australia),  Shape: Light Duration:10 mins",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12532.html,"watching storm,thought a boat let out a flare,a red hovering light but the flare zig zagged then flew on angle, then flew straight behind  cliff nearby, 5 mins later we turned around it was flashing,hovering on mountain in front of us. We were watching an electrical storm from the beach, all the fishing trawlers were coming in to get away from it. A few minutes after the last of the boats seemed to be away from the storm, my friend said ""look a flare"" we thought a boat was in trouble, my friend who first spotted it said it came up from the water so we thought it was a flare. It was red, It stood still about 2 klms out to shore, it kind of sat there for about 30 seconds to 1 minute then did little zig zags then it went up on about 45 degree angle then flew a straight line until it went out of sight behind the nrth cliff of the beach yet it was still a fair distance away, the cliff just obstructed our view. We were excited as 2 of us believed in ufo's and the other 2 do/did not yet we could'nt explain anything that flew that way or at that speed. After about 5 mins of shaking excitment we decided to go back to our campsite as we got up and turned around, there it was only this time the red light was flashing on and off as it seemed to be resting on top of the mountain/hill approximately 600 metres in front of us, then we noticed it was not resting it was hovering and slowly ducking behind the mountain/hill as we screamed out in excitment to the 5th person in our party, funny enough it's haze could barely be seen once he joined us. He kind of riddiculed us but we were shaking uncontrollably so I guess he kind of believed our story. It even seemed as though it did'nt want him to see it cause the second he joined us you could barely make it out. We are no longer in contact with him anyway. The next morning my friend who did'nt believe in ufo's (which to me gives the story credability b'cause I know too much of these things to have u believe me, as my mother is an active speaker in this country on ufo phenomena and even regresses abductees) said ""I had a dream about those aliens last night"" I jokingly replied ""then you were abducted b'cause abductions usually flash back as though it were a dream"", what threw me is that she then said ""then you were abducted too b'cause you were on board the ship with us"" Well that gave me the chills and I asked her to tell me all about her dream.....which sounded to me like a classic abduction but I don't know if u r interested in that part of the story, but to me it's the most important cause she described things that I knew others had described in other abduction cases yet I was'nt the one that remembered it was the non believer who had no knowledge of abduction case histories. I was carefull not to feed her information as I have knowledge of people who are drama queens and make these things up. And I really wanted to hear if she spoke of things she had noway of knowing such as the appearance of the tall blonde female, who showed us writing that made no sense to us, on a board, yet we were shown this for some reason my friend said. She, my friend said the boys, (our boyfriends) were not with us it was just us 3 girls.",2000-04-15T00:00:00,,
