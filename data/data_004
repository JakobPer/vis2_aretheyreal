It traveled overhead until it stopped completely at a much higher altitude, and appeared to be just a bright star.  It stayed there for 5 mins, then headed back to the southeast at a very high altitude. I was able to look through binoculars at it and still couldn't determine any specific shape, but could see the fog like shroud around the light. It reminded me of a airplane with its approach lights on lighting clouds in front of it, but it was completely clear outside. My dad was a g Flight instructor and i grew up in small aircraft.   This wasnt anything conventional.  No sound, no nsvigstion lights, and ascended from 10k feet to what seemed like much higher than commercial aircraft fly (35k).

The two objects were white in color but not a metallic shiny white, more of a dull chalky white but were round in shape with no wings or any lights observed.  The two objects were approximately 80-90 feet apart from each other with the object on the right about 20 feet in the sky lower the than the object on the left and appeared to be farther away.  I do not know the approximate altitude of the objects because I have never seen them before so I do not know their relative size to be able to determine how high up they were.  If I had to guess their altitudes, I would say approximately 10 to 15 thousand feet.  They were not moving at all and I do not know how long they were there; it is like they were perfectly suspended in the air.  The sky at this time of day was still blue and stars were not yet visible so you could still observe other aircraft such as helicopters (olive drab H-60 Blackhawks) flying and landing in the nearby helo pad to the North of our front gate but they too did not require lights at this time.  There were also two takeout food delivery people who use their own vehicles to enter the base to deliver food to our Soldiers who also observed the objects and they two commented about how strange the objects were.  Then all of the sudden after maybe 20 minutes, both objects disappeared.  I do not know exactly how they disappeared or if they just moved out of the area because we could not stay looking at them the whole time because we had to focus on our job of checking ID cards for those persons entering the base. One of my coworkers who observed the objects that Friday night saw the same object above his backyard in Copperas Cove, TX, approximately 20 miles from the Gatesville, North Fort Hood sighting, on the afternoon of Sunday, 16 August 2020, and that is the one which is labeled as such. Myself and my coworkers have never seen anything like this before and we cannot tell you what we think it is because we just do not know.  That is why I am submitting this report.  I am really ashamed of the photos I am submitting but as I said, this is all we have.  There is also a short video of the objects from Friday 14 August but the quality is very poor because it is so pixelated.  Please when you open up the JPEG file of the photos zoom them in and you will see that white dot in all photos but understand that when you do that; the image will not be sharp.  As I worked the same location on Saturday and Sunday 15 and 16 August at the front gate of North Fort Hood, I did not see the objects.  I have never seen a UFO before so I cannot tell you that these objects are UFO’s but I do believe they exist.  Please provide some sort of feedback at your earliest convenience as to what you and your staff think these objects were.  Thank you.",2020-08-20T00:00:00,31.4397,-97.7853

There were no stars out, so he was a bit curious and asked me to go look at it. I could definitely see what he meant and it was large and brighter then anything else. From what I could see it looked was an orb that had an aura around it. I pulled out my phone to take some pictures and 1 video.  The object seemed to move a little, but mostly stood still in the sky.  It stayed there for about 6 minutes and then faded and was gone. I was unsure of what I just witnessed until my son and I reviewed the images. The images clearly depict how much brighter this thing was then anything else in the sky. It also shows the object illuminating light from it.  When reviewing the video you can see what seems to be a circle within a circle moving or pulsating.  It’s quite amazing!

Moved erratically and made an unusual wooing sound with oscillating pitch At approximately 23:57 hrs on 8/27/2020 I was outside at a residence on Granite St. Rockport, MA 01966.  I observed a flying craft approaching from the West over the ocean traveling in an Easterly direction. It appeared as a bright white light which at first I thought to be an airplane or perhaps helicopter.  I could see that it was traveling towards me as the light was becoming lager. It was not moving at a very fast rate of speed. Then it began moving in a way that was inconsistent with conventional aircraft that I know of.  It moved very quickly several hundred feet to my right and then a few seconds later several hundred feet to my left crossing its original position and then moved rapidly diagonally back across to the right in an upward direction and then again after a few seconds it moved rapidly back to its center position, all motion was in straight lines.  At this point it had moved close enough to me that I could see greenish blue lights in a star ! like pattern on either side of the craft, approximately 5 lights on each side.  I realized that this was not consistent with conventional aircraft lights.  I was now able to also hear the sound that it was making, it sounded like a wooing noise with an oscillating frequency pitch and it continued throughout the time of my observation.  At this point I ran in to the house to retrieve my cellphone to video record the event and I returned outside bringing with me a friend that was in the house to witness what was occurring.  Upon returning outside the craft had moved over land still heading in the same direction but, my view was now obstructed by the trees in the yard.  I was able to see the light now facing from the rear of the craft through the trees as it disappeared from my view.  Both myself and my friend could still hear the  sound it was making.

Last night of FL vacation observed a large red object sitting in or near T-storm over ocean near Cape Canaveral.,Satellite Beach,FL,2020-08-20T22:00:00,light,10 minutes,"Occurred : 8/20/2020 22:00  (Entered as : 08/20/2020 22:00) Reported: 8/23/2020 9:26:16 AM 09:26 Posted: 8/27/2020 Location: Satellite Beach, FL Shape: Light Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/158/S158820.html,"Last night of FL vacation observed a large red object sitting in or near T-storm over ocean near Cape Canaveral. My wife and I were spending the last evening of our Florida vacation watching the storms over the Atlantic Ocean, east of our condo in Satellite Beach Florida.  This was on 08/20/2020.  We were sitting on the beach, just out of reach of the surf, or so we thought, that plays a part in a moment. The storms were quite a ways out, at least 4 to 5 miles or more.  To our north is Cape Canaveral and Cape Canaveral Air Force Base. While sitting and talking we were also taking short video clips of the storms and the beautiful lightening displays within them.  While doing so we noticed quite a few aircraft moving about in the vicinity of the storms, some getting very close and we remarked about how one would think that the pilots would try to avoid flying into the storms.  Most of the aircraft were far enough away they were just blinking dots. At approx. 2200 hrs I noticed that one of the aircraft appeared to be much closer, or actually much larger, than the others we had been seeing as it was bright, comparable to Venus in the night sky.  It was a steady red color and not moving: It was in or at the north edge of the storm front.   I noted this to my wife and she said it was just another aircraft.  But it was NOT moving.  I noted there was an aircraft moving northeasterly to the north of the larger light, and one moving due east away from the large light.  These were clearly much further away or much smaller objects.  I watched the object sitting, not moving, for approx. one minute. I started my phone to record video of this (so I thought) and just as I did a large wave came in and struck us as we were not far enough away from the increasing waves lol.  This caused us to grab our stuff and quickly retreat further back on the shore.  I refocused my attention after this brief, just a few seconds of clamoring up a few feet, interruption of viewing the object and it had now moved.  It was now northwest of where it had been, still just as large and bright, but now it was roughly in between the two other mentioned air craft which were still moving the directions they had been.  By my estimation it was now sitting just east of Cape Canaveral.  I went to continue filming and realized my phone had not started filming, my error, and when I did get the video to start I aimed my phone back toward the object in question it was now gone. Some things of note:  There had been a launch of some kind from the cape on Tuesday 08/18/2020 I believe.   There was another launch scheduled for the next Monday I believe also.  We were near both a spacecraft launch area and an USAF base.  Other than the roar of the ocean there were no sounds detected.  I am a LEO (going on 20 years) and also a lifelong believer in our planet being visited by other entities from other worlds, but have never experienced anything first hand related to this belief.  I am a lifelong resident of Oklahoma and not a resident of Florida thus I don’t know what lights and craft are “normal” in the night skies, but I don’t think apparent instantaneous acceleration is normal and this object exhibited that twice. I decided that I was likely not seeing anything out of the ordinary and was going to let it go, as in not report to NUFORC, which I am aware of thanks to Coast to Coast AM.  That is until I was catching up on recorded shows on my DVR and began watching the latest episode of “Unidentified:  Inside America’s UFO Investigations” on the History channel.  This newest episode was talking about sightings of orange or red objects off the U.S. east coast, including Florida. Thus I am making this report. I have no idea what I saw but it displayed things that stood out:  Larger, apparently, than surrounding objects that were clearly aircraft.  One solid color, red, displayed.  No other flashing lights to indicate aircraft position etc.  It moved twice at a high rate of speed:  Once when I had to move my position, and again when I activated my phone camera.  It moved completely out of sight on the latter. Thank you for your work collecting these sightings!",2020-08-27T00:00:00,28.1737,-80.5997

They continued to fly in the same direction for five minutes making a large sweeping circle until coming back headed directly W passing almost directly back over top of us. About fifteen minutes after the military aircraft left our field of view the four of us observed two large orange circles appear in the sky to our ENE that stayed illuminated for roughly fifteen seconds.  The two circles were side by side with one slightly higher than the other and almost appeared to be angled down to the ocean. We waited and watched in the same direction to see if anything reappeared and we then noticed two military aircraft coming from our W again but this time traveling at the same altitude but at a much higher rate of speed. The two aircraft passed directly over top of us again and headed towards the ocean and started to veer ENE in the direction of where the two circles had appeared. While heading in that direction the two circles appeared again blocking out the light from the military aircraft. We then continued watching the sky towards the E to see if we saw anything else.  We continued watching for another half hour but never saw the circles again.  We did witness the military aircraft making passes back and forth up and down the beach line, but well out over the ocean, and on one pass multiple other aircraft joined into the existing two aircraft.  When we came off of the widows watch the military aircraft were still making passes up and down the beach line. This same event has happened every night we have been here but this is the first night I have gotten to witness the event.  It is never the same amount of lights and they appear in different spots in the sky for different durations.  Another member of our party posted a report from earlier this week of their sighting.

In the minute it took me to get my camera out, this huge moon had slowly and steadily floated down below the tree line where I could only see its outline glowing behind the trees. This is when it occurred to me that this was not a super moon. One the moon can't move that quickly and two at 3:22 AM the moon is not setting.

It was noiseless. I noticed that the lights, which were positioned in the shape of an equilateral triangle, blinked in an irregular fashion. All of the lights seemed to be white or yellow.

There were not enough stars visible to be able to tell whether the center of the object was a void or not, though I thought I could make out the edge! s of the triangle. Instead of passing over the parking lot where I was standing, the craft banked in a southeasterly direction toward Norristown, which is the beginning of the more densely populated area stretching toward Philadelphia.

I tried to locate it again with my naked eye but it was gone, or so I thought. I focused my camera in the area where I saw the flash and beyond, not knowing what I was capturing. I reviewed my video that night multiple times and at different speeds, backwards and forwards. It initially appears stationary, then started to fly upwards and then made a very distinctive turn headed right/south where it “hid” in the clouds. You can barely make out it’s moving through the clouds. Since I didn’t know in real time that I was filming this object, I panned over to the right too soon after it went into the clouds. I panned back to the same spot and I could no longer see it. The entire video is five minutes, the object appears at the 3:21 mark. I tried to upload my video to this site but it said exceeded max size.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,29.775480377035134,-95.78561259640104

Littleton, CO 80128  At approximately 10:02pm on Monday, July 21st, 2020, I was reminded by the local news to take a look outside as the Neowise comet may be visible. I didn’t see the comet, but knowing that the ISS was also supposed to be visible from my location around that time. I immediately spotted a slowly blinking light moving from west to east. Its direction suddenly changed to the south and slowly made it towards my community.  As it got closer, I noticed to trailing lights that were just a bit dimmer.  Looking closely, it was obvious this was a triangular arrangement of lights that were now hovering over my townhome complex and making no sound.  On a couple of separate occasions, the “trailing” lights got slightly brighter which allowed for more illumination of the overall craft; it was indeed triangular. It was then that I noticed other moving lights in the area. Some with a faint red glow and others that appeared to be smaller versions of this particular craft. At one point one of the smaller crafts flew under the larger, original triangle and completely illuminated the underside of this object. The shadowing that the smaller craft cast provided a brief glimpse of texture to the underside of the larger craft.  Think 4 very distinct “ribs;” like you’d see on a leather car seat.  The object would also occasionally shift as if to redirect its course while not actually going anywhere.  Originally, the brightest light was facing south, but after about 30 minutes of observation, it was apparent it was now facing west. At this point I asked my daughter to come outside and tell me what she thought she was looking at.  At first she said some planes, but I had to remind her that planes don’t hover; and they are not generally silent.  She then said, “Dad, what’s that,” and point in the direction of northeast sky. It appeared that there was a larger version of the original triangular-shaped object just a few miles to north of us.  This one had all of its lights illuminated so that any observer could make out its outline – triangular but twice as large and with what may have been a tail, like a stingray.  It then emitted a streak of white light to the northwest that left the atmosphere within a split second.  This was the first of three instances that I saw streaking white lights heading in that direction.  I could not verify any other sources however. Then the drones started flying.  This was clearly a man-made object that flew from the north just along the top of some trees, took position just south of the object and flew up to an elevation of about 300 feet.  It stayed right there for at least 3 hours.  By 1:30am on Tuesday, there were at least 5 drones surrounding the object(s). I Invited some friends over to have a look and also met my neighbor in the parking lot; they all confirmed exactly was I have described.  In fact, once they went home, they could actually track that at least two small triangles had migrated slowly to the west.  The drones moved accordingly. At this point I was too tired to stay up and just accepted that there are things out there that I may never understand.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,39.56792218259629,-105.0102302425107

On Saturday July 25, my wife and I and our little bichon went down to what we call the ""Zen garden"" -- which we just completed with slate rock and gravel --  to create a little patio, it's little spot about a 150 ft² nestled in trees, bushes and shrubbery ... as we sat down in 2 adirondack chairs next to eachother, to enjoy the evening around 9:30 I was admiring the floor slate slabs that we had installed, when my wife grabbed my right forearm and asked "" what is that ?"" ... I looked up and instantly knew it was the same vehicle I had reported on July 10, a huge circular object with a very bright white lighted center making up about 90% of its belly and the edges a red Orange glowing, shimmering ring ... but this time I was able to see more because it was a lot darker outside and we were out in the garden looking up -- as opposed to the July 10 incident where we were on the upper deck, looking almost sideways at it --' this vehicle was the same vehicle,  t traveled from the North East to the South West in the same flight path as the July 10 event ... it seemed to have a misty white ""shroud""  to its rear and above it, that was billowing behind -- it was made up of white misty light, it had the shape of a cape, or cloak,  and followed the vehicle like a condensation trail.... below the vehicle i noticed it had a conical shaped red light beam thst was being directed to look back-and-forth, downwards, towards the Earth ... the red beam didn't have a ""center"" (like a flashlight would in its beam), but just a ring, in the shape of a cone that expanded as it reached further out from the ship ... the ""outside"" of this cone shaped beam was solid,  bright red/burgundy color.  It looked like it was a search light, looking at or for something. When it first appeared. It was about half way over the Puget Sound, between Maury Is. and the Dash Point Pier.  When my wife first noticed it, it virtually appeared right over the Sound as if it ""turned its lights on."" It moved silently and smoothly in a straight line.  Maintained altitude, it made Slight changes in acceleration, a little appearance of slight bobbing, but maintained its straight line course NE to SW. The vehicle was round, and defined by the light it was shining.  It's possible the actual shape may differ because nothing is visible behind the light. The center was made up of and entire ""belly"" of white light, it was a surreal looking white color ( like LED light white, but without the bluish hue LED has).  The outer ring was a shimmering red/orange, seemed to be flickering at the edges, and bright.  The moon was in the sky to the SE of us, better part of half-moon to 3/4, brightly lit by the slow setting Sun in the NW we're accustomed to see in the summer.  The light intensity of the UFO's center white light was almost competing with the brightness if the moon.  As soon as we saw it, we stood up and looked in amazement as wellas a little fear that we're encountering this again.  I instantly said ""It's the same UFO we saw"" because i recognized it.  My wife was a bit fearful and was standing slightly behind me with her right hand on my left shoulder, as we visually followed its travel.  I asked her 3 times, ""Look at it, you tell me that's not a UFO""  And she kept saying ""it looks like a gigantic chinese lantern"" and then ""it looks like it has a flowing, misty looking shroud behind it""   It flew right past us in what seemed to be slowing down, and then sudden acceleration, and slowing down again, until it went right over the horizon behind our neighbors house ... the whole incident lasted about 45 seconds ... it is hard to tell how high and therefore how big this object is but based on my July 10 incident report -- I know that when a 737 flew underneath this object,  it was about 4 to 6 times larger than the 737 and it was higher than it --- so it gives an optical illusion of being lower, but it's actually a very large vehicle, very high ...  we were a little freaked out so we went back into the house... and then I reviewed the security video camera,  one of which points out the front door and in the direction of where the vehicle passed looking West ... and nothing showed on the camera because the angle was not high enough into the sky, its focused on the door and the driveway.  While reviewing the security camera it showed us entering the house at 9:36, and the incident happened between 5 to 7 minutes before that, so the whole thing lasted between 9:30 and 9:36 PM.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,,

It traveled across the sky at an incredible speed, perhaps 15 minutes from one horizon nearly 75% to the other.  It moved with no sound or trail.  It appeared to almost wobble as it moved across the sky.  As it reached about 75% across the sky (relative to our perspective) it slowly vanished.  The light just dimmed until it was gone.  About 5 minutes later we saw another light moving in the same direction.  Both lights were coming roughly from the North West moving towards to the South East. This location where this occurred is about 20 miles from Laguardia Airport, and so as the lights moved across the sky, there were aircraft present also in the sky. It was easy to contrast the speeds, apparent heights, and light from the aircrafts as significantly different from the 2 lights observed .  Leaving the park, I believe I also saw something bright streak across the sky much brighter than a shooting star.

I saw what I thought was a plane approaching from the northwest of the farm because it was a large white light moving slowly towards our direction.  Something about it seemed odd though, because no sound and no green or red lights were blinking around it.  It also seemed very large and a bit too low for a commercial plane.  I continued to watch and told my friend to come outside and watch with me, because something seemed odd about it.  He immediately was able to see it, as it stayed on a path towards southeast.   We both commented that it seemed to slow when above his house.  Again, I noticed no sound coming from it, nor navigational blinking lights one usually sees.  He mentioned something seemed a bit odd about it, so we continued to watch it move in a southeast direction across the skyview of the farm and past h! is house.  We continued to think it would eventually show itself in a way we could identify it as a plane, but then it just blinked out of existence while still quite bright, low and close to us. There were no clouds and it had not moved far enough away from us that it should have dissapeared from view. It continued to be quite large, silent, moving slowly. We considered satellite, but too low and then agreed there was something incredibly odd about its brightness, its slowed down movement as it got closer, and how it blinked out of existence, as if the light went off. However, the farm was bright enough from moonlight, and the sky bright enough as well, had there been a craft with a light gone out, you could have still seen the craft. And surely, we would have heard it like we do any other plane going over head at that close a range.

Was able to spot Mars in the sky, bright and reddish.  I stepped back inside the house and told my wife to come outside and check out the stars,  Mars was super-bright. She followed. As we stood outside, unfortunately with our back light on, we stared at the stars when suddenly a bright light, which looked like a low star, flew smoothly by, followed by another after some spacing, then another with approximately the same spacing, etc.   I pointed out the moving lights and my wife said they could be planes.  My wife was in the Army working on helicopters for 10 years, I was in Naval Special Warfare for 16 years and we see airplanes overheard often. These lights had no running lights, which I pointed out. As the lights continued to go by, in the same path (042 degrees)(so starting from SW to NE pathways remained consistent), no running lights (to stress that it was not an aircraft), no sound, spaced evenly at the moment and moving quicker than any aircraft I have seen. Then a spacing occurred. It became clear that a ‘light’ was missing in formation and my wife even joked about that fact, then another light followed the same path, followed by another, and so forth for the time being.  Then another gap between lights. Trying to watch the lights from inception until they disappear showed that we were limited by our abilities to see them until a certain point, both coming and departing.  As these lights are moving quickly and silently across the sky, evenly spaced, an airplane became visible on another and different flight path.  This had the strobe light and it was a lot further away than these lights.  It’s altitude is where I would expect flights to be. While we continue to watch the movements and eventual spacing occur, suddenly a space followed by a pair of lights appeared. The lights remained parallel to each other, traveled on the same path, same speed, and same spacing, made no noise and had no running lights. Behind this pair was another single light, which was followed by another light. Pointing out how cool this event was, my wife mentioned that it could be satellites, to which I informed her that I don’t find it possible that satellites would appear lower than an aircraft (plane) flying by in the night sky, then we spotted another light that was apparently staged midway on the path, but began to travel East to West. Watching this specific light, it appeared to be on an intersecting path with the flow of traveling lights headed on the 042 degree path, but it slowed enough to allow the light to go by and then sped up. There was another rogue light that appeared to monitor the path of the moving lights, but we lost that because of how bright our porch light got, which ruined our night vision abilities. In total, there were approximately 30 lights that traveled on that path and they looked to be traveling smoothly, silently in a straight line, however, towards the end the movement looked a little funny to me so I focused on one light as it passed by a star and it appeared to ‘wobble’ or ‘sway’ around the star. Its path did not go straight to where the light of the star and its light were ‘one’ for a moment. It ‘wobbled’ around the star. This caused me to watch the lights that came behind it in relation to that same star and they all seemed to travel in a slight ‘s’ pattern, back and forth, which allowed the light to look as if it moved to ‘avoid’ crossing the light of the star. It was an awesome experience and I wish I had my phone on me to record it but unfortunately it was still inside our house.",2020-04-09T00:00:00,44.80706449912127,-91.55365096660809

I planned to go to bed myself, and in order to get to my bedroom I have to go all the way to the other end of my house.  That includes going through the kitchen and the living room.  I was headed to my bedroom when I stopped in the kitchen.  I was really thirsty, and wanted a drink.  That's when I saw it. I got my drink and was almost ready to go to my bedroom when something told me to look out my kitchen window.  So I turned my head to the left and there it was out my window.  It was tree top level, maybe a little higher in the sky.  I watched it for about 5 minutes, because I didn't want to mistake what I was seeing for a ""drone"".  Or a sattlelight. As I was watching this ""star"" it changed colors many times.  It went from blue to yellow then red.  And the colored light was flashing.  They were flashing ""off, on. Off, on"".  Just like someone was flicking a light switch.  Then the light flashed one more time.  This time when it came back on, there was more lights.  Now the lights all started changing colors at the same time, and flashing at the same time.  This was when I could see that there was a shape to the lights.  I could tell that the object in the sky was a oval.  I didn't know what I was looking at. I was so scared, I didn't know what I was looking at, so I went into my bedroom to wake up my husband.  I woke him up.  He thought something was wrong with the kids.  I told him what I was seeing.  He thought I was nuts.  He said ""that's a star.  Why did you wake me up for that?""  I tried to tell him that it is not a star.  He got so mad at me that he turned around and went back to bed. When he went to bed I stayed in the kitchen to watch what was in the sky.  Then the object did something I didn't expect.  The object's lights totaly went out and a big white light on top of the object appeared.  The light on top of the object was a circle.  It glowed a very bright white.  Almost so bright that I couldn't look at it for long.  It reminded me of lighting. Or an electric wire catching on fire.

I heard a sound of something hovering or making a low vibratory sound moving through the campsite. At first I thought it was a drone but it would have had to been a pretty large drone to make that sound and furthermore the lights that were beaming through our tent were almost blinding. I tapped my friend to alert him to what I was hearing and seeing but he only caught the tail end of the sound and the lights diminished as the object moved further into the Forest. We both agreed that it was quite bazaar and we asked questions the next day to see if anyone else had any information we could make since of.  One person thought it could have been the security boats passing through but wouldn’t explain the movement through the camp site.  That night we went to sleep around 11pm and I woke to dogs barking pretty aggressively in the distance.  The owners were able to calm them down so I again fell fast asleep and was awakened by the same sound as lights but this time I saw who I thought was my 19 year old son sitting quietly in a meditative pose for close to 10-15 min. It was strange to see him sitting in the dark that way but I decided not to disturb him just in case he was praying or meditating and I drifted back off to sleep.  That morning during breakfast I asked him was he ok and why he was wearing a black hoodie in the tent being that it was so hot. He looked at me weird and said that he didn’t bring a hoodie. I then asked him if he was meditating. He said he fell to sleep shortly after we the rest of us fell asleep because he was kind of creeped out by some moving shadows around him at the campfire. I asked over and over if he was sure that he didn’t wake up and sit straight up for at least 10 min. He insisted that he never got up once and that he was dead sleep until this morning. So, who was the hooded person dressed in black in my tent? And how did they get in without us hearing the zipper being unzipped? I have so many questions!!!

Odd ‘Drone’ Sighting, Greenfield, New Hampshire  Location:  Slope of Crotched Mountain, Greenfield, NH Date: July 18, 2020 Conditions:  Partially cloudy with haze / warm and humid, approximately 75 F Duration of sighting: 5-7 minutes  My wife and I hiked up to a viewing platform on the slope of Crotched Mountain in Greenfield, NH, hoping to get a glimpse of Comet Neowise in the northwest sky after twilight.  Local sunset was at 8:20 pm.  We stayed on the viewing platform until 10:00 pm, and though we didn’t see the comet due to thick haze near the northwest horizon, we did see something strange.  At about 9:40 pm, after looking at stars around the Summer Triangle, I turned to look south facing the direction of North Pack Monadnock which is about 10 miles away as the crow flies.  I immediately noticed a very bright stationary light that appeared to flicker.  It was orange-red in overall color, and in binoculars was very bright, so bright it ruined my night vision.  It was at least several times brighter than Venus at its brightest, and my first thought was it must be a Drone, though it was much brighter than any other night flying drone I’ve ever seen.  It was also completely quiet, and I could hear no whir of propeller blades. It was hard to tell how high in the sky it was, but our elevation was close to 1,000 feet, and I’d guess this object was at least that high at it was straight out from our viewing position.  Through 10 X 40 binoculars I could discern no clear shape, with the object flashing bright red and yellow-orange lights, though in no regular pattern.  At one point it appeared that either the object or lights were rotating, though it was hard to tell if they were stationary and flashing or moving.  At one point I thought I saw a silvery background color under the other lights, but they were changing so fast it was hard to tell.  It stayed motionless for at least two minutes.  After this time the object suddenly dimmed by at least 50%, and then proceeded to move slowly but steadily off towards the east, from time to time being obscured by trees in front of us.  Once it entered a clearing between trees I could tell that there was a brighter red leading light and a fainter, almost pink trailing light.  I would assume they were fixed to the body of the object but that too was difficult to discern.  It then moved beyond our viewing range as it continued heading to the east / northeast. It made no sudden directional or velocity changes, but moved steadily.  We estimated that it must have traveled several miles during the time we had a good look at it.  Drones in New Hampshire are supposed to be operated in line of sight, and there was no way this object was in the line of site of one individual operator for the duration of the event. I’d like to know if other such odd ‘drones’ have been sighted in New England recently.",2020-07-23T00:00:00,42.9333,-71.8813

Thanks for taking my call Tuesday, 8/18/20 and per our conversation here’s my account of the UFO sighting I noted that occurred on 8/15/20 at 12:45 A.M.. I, and a friend named Rob, was doing some deep sky imaging astronomy at a friend’s anch in Burnet Texas, when around 12:45A.M.  Rob spotted what looked like a “blinking star”.  Initially, I figured it was either a satellite, airplane, pulsar, or something else, but initially looking at the object naked-eyed it  didn’t appear to move against the background stars, or moved imperceptibly slow that I could not detect movement, so I took a break from imaging and went over to use my other telescope to look at the object visually. When I saw the object through my telescope I could hardly believe what I was seeing. The object wasn’t any of the things I thought it might be, and I don’t know what was, nor have I seen anything like it before.  The front of the craft was semi-circular, and the rear of the craft was less distinct but appeared to pan out in a wedge shape. The craft had 4 distinct very bright lights on the bottom, two towards the front, and two at the rear, which flashed in succession (two in the rear flashed, then the two in the front) along with small pin-like lights around the perimeter edge of the semi-circular portion of the craft that flashed third (front of craft). I shouted to Rob “Oh My God, you’ve got to see this!”. When Rob saw the object he too was amazed, and he confirmed what I was seeing, describing the craft exactly as I saw it. Initially we looked at the object for about 20 minutes, then I decided to train my imaging scope on the object and take some images. I took a few images starting at 1:02AM CST. My imaging scope is a wide-field setup so the resolution isn’t what I would have liked it so be, but nevertheless, I took some images which I will send to your email address. You will have to zoom in to see the object. I am sending a couple of JPEGs, but per or conversation I do have  the “FITS” images which is an astronomy file standard that contains various pieces of data including the date, time, equipment used, resolution, etc.. If this is needed, I’m happy to send these too; one image is over 16 meg so I am not sending these files at this time, but the JPEGs are a direct copy. The pictures I’m sending were taken with a 106mm objective at 530mm Focal length and at roughly ¼ second exposure. Also, the craft lights flashed repeatedly as noted above, and continuously throughout the time we observed it with no change in intensity nor frequency. I did revisit the object twice after the initial sighting and there was no change in the flashing behavior. We initially spotted the object in the constellation of Lacerta, and the object seemed to move very slowly and not is a straight line like a satellite or aircraft would.  The object started out (from our initial spotting point) in the north-east about 68 degrees up from the horizon, traveled west by southwest crossing the zenith, traveled north, the then moved almost due south.  This occurred over a period of about 3-4 hours. Let me know if you would like to discuss this sighting or need anything else.",2020-08-20T00:00:00,30.796999999999997,-98.2445

So during a trip this weekend doing some Astrophotography out at a dark location.  I was imaging M31 Andromeda Galaxy and while trying to find M31 with my naked eye I noticed a blinking light up in the sky. Thinking it was an airplane it would move.  It never moved.  Thought must be a satellite still never moved. Looked through binoculars and saw the blinking lights.  Then we went to the AP 130 and could see 2 x 2 lights blinking in succession followed by an arc of very small lights flashing after the 2x2 lights flashed.  This was all flashing in a split second.  My buddy slewed his Takahashi 106 over to it and took a photo of it.  I took a photo of the computer screen of one of the pictures captured which I will include.  The red is just for night viewing. After a few hours, we could tell it was moving slowly across the sky in what seemed to be a random way.  Started in the N NE in Lacerta region of the sky high above Andromeda (which was my target I was shooting).  After a while it moved across meridian and then proceeded to move South over my head and finally behind me.

On 08/15/2020 at approximately 11:55 AM CST, I was playing football with my Son in our backyard located in Schertz, Texa,s just North of San Antonio.  We first noticed one “white or pearl” colored object sitting perfectly still almost directly above us in the clear blue sky.   Then after looking closely, we actually noticed a total of three similar objects all completely stationary. My first thought was that “this must be some sort of weather balloon or google balloon” etc, but they remained completely stationary on a what is a typically windy day here in Schertz, for over 30 minutes as we observed them.  I even had time to go inside and retrieve some high powered binoculars.  I then came back out and viewed them continually for over thirty minutes.  They never moved an inch. When viewed through the binoculars I could see that the material these objects were made of was very similar in appearance to abalone shell or mother of pearl.  They were not wafting around in the wind like you would think a cloth balloon would be, but appeared to hold there shape in a rigid manor.  One of the objects, (the circular shaped one) had a straight line of “lights or reflectors” starting at the center of the object going towards the outside edge as well as more “lights or reflectors” on one quarter of the edge of the object following the perimeter (as I have illustrated in the quick sketch I made while I was observing these objects). The second of the three objects appeared to be a more rectangular shape, but with slightly rounded corners and a line in the center (again as I have illustrated in my sketch).  The third object was closer to circular, but because of it’s close proximity to the Sun it was very hard to view . I also took pictures of the first two objects with my phone and will include them with my report. The picture of the third object did not come out unfortunately. Per the recommendation of Mr. Peter Davenport from the UFO reporting center I immediately placed a call to the security desk of nearby Randolph AFB and spoke to the desk SGT (name omitted) . I gave him my name and information and then I advised him of what I was seeing and he said he intended to deploy “observers” to my area to attempt to see them as well.  He did also say to me that he was not aware of any balloon activity, but that “he would not normally be privy to such information.”  Again, per the recommendation of Mr. Peter Davenport from the UFO reporting center I next immediately placed a call to KENS 5 NEWS a local TV station in San Antonio and gave all this information to their tip line asking them if they were aware of any balloon activity, but they have not yet followed up with me further.  After making these three calls we returned outside and all three objects were gone. I have never seen anything like a UFO before or anything unexplained frankly, but this was in fact unusual enough to me that I had to call and also to file a report and share my sketch and pictures.  After seeing the newly released “Tic-Tac” UFO footage released by the US Navy I felt compelled to share this report.  What I observed was eerily similar to what was described by the Navy pilot in the Tic-Tac UFO incident.  An elongated rectangular shape with smooth edges not unlike a tic-tac or a capsul. Lastly, I just want to reiterate that we observed these objects perfectly still and silent for over 30 minutes.  My neck was literally hurting from peering straight up for so long.  Also on a more personal note there was a strange feeling of danger or “fight or flight” that came over me as I observed these objects, they “felt” unnatural. That is my report for what it’s worth. I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration.  Very best regards.",2020-08-20T00:00:00,29.5892,-98.29389999999998

After shooting a few photos I saw a flash in the night sky to the south. It was about 80 degrees altitude.   I usually pay attention to anything unusual in the sky.

I alerted a friend to pay attention.  We continued to watch this supposed object to flash on  a very irregular intermittent pattern.  Interval being anywhere between 5 seconds to maybe 1 or 2 seconds.  I could tell this object had to be in space or very high in the atmosphere.

My computer is situated below a large north-facing window that gives me a clear view of a large portion of the sky, from about 50 degrees up to a little below the horizon, and about 50 degrees toward the west and somewhat less than 10 degrees toward the east.  I wear reading glasses to use my computer.  The flash of light was high enough that I saw it above the frame of my glasses, i.e., it definitely was not something on my computer screen.  The flash seemed to originate from a point outside of my field of view, very high up in the sky.  It appeared to be about as bright as a flash of lightning would appear in the semi-darkness of a thunderstorm. However, the weather outside at the time of the flash was sunny and clear with a cloudless sky . It was a very bright flash, indeed.  The duration was very short, perhaps the way one would perceive a camera flash or a blink.  For a moment, I considered that I had imagined it or that it could be a sign of an eyesight problem such as a detached retina. However, when I mentioned to my wife during lunch that I had seen a flash, she remarked that she had seen it, too. When it occurred, she was sitting in our living room, at the opposite end of the house, where the windows face south. She was seated away from the window, facing the interior of the house, i.e., north, so she was not in a position to see where it originated. Unfortunately, it did not occur to me to record the time of event. I only remember that it was shortly before noon.  I checked our local power utilities to see if there have been any electrical outages. They post updates very quickly on their websites and on twitter. But they reported no outages or other problems today. I have seen transformers explode, and they make a very bright flash.  I'm inclined to think that this could have been a meteor or bolide.

Went to go on a drive and my friend first looked at the sky (we like looking at the stars on clear nights) and noticed a line of lights following eachother from northwest to southeast. This is a rural area north of Idaho Falls and south of Lewisville. It took around 2-4 minutes (guesstimate) for one to get from one side of the sky to the other. Me, my friend, and my boyfriend watched the first four pass the sky slowly from far enough away to only see a light. The first one we saw actually changed directions towards the end of its trip and headed northeast. This was about a 90* angle, but it didn't make a 90* turn, it was a little more gradual. None of the others did this; they continued and still went straight where the first one turned. Once we noticed a fifth, I pulled my dad and grandma outside, and they both saw them as well. My dad said that they were satelites, but around 16 more came around in the same manner. I looked to see where they were coming fr! om and they were appearing in the exact same spot in the sky, pretty far above the horizon, and disappeared in the clouds on the other side of the sky. But we aren't sure how many passed before we noticed and we left before they finished, so we watched them for around ten minutes and they likely continued after we left. We had our phones but the crafts were about the brightness of stars, so they weren't able to be captured.

The only close airport is in town to the southwest, a direction the lights didn't come from or go to. What satelites move in a straight line following eachother?

The storm was past us heading NE (more Easterly),there was a rainbow about an hour prior to what we thought was an odd sighting.  As we looked from the SE to the NE we saw four red (round/cylindrical)close together--almost as if they were in a frame or structure.  But it was not moving, the 2 top red lights would disappear and then return.  Okay, someone as a drone or it's reflection off a cloud.

I saw some 'stars' that seem to be moving, so I was watching and making sure it wasn't an illusion.  We've seen these lights a few times now and didn't get excited.  We are just on the California side of the Sierras and I have assumed that these must be some sort of test craft. I was looking in a north-east direction at them (towards Nevada) when the sky lit up.  Suddenly there was a ""train"" of lights.  It started in the western sky behind me and then travelled east towards Nevada. There was some distance between each light and although they were travelling in a straight line, I'm pretty sure they weren't all always going the same speed.  They were uniformly going in a straight line, but like traffic on a one way road, they weren't all going the same speed.  I'm guessing here, but the line at it's longest must have been over 50 miles long - it spanned the entire sky west to east.  NO sound whatsoeve! r. The lights travelled like a train and when they were over the peak of the Sierras they headed DOWN and promptly disappeared.  This may be unrelated, but shortly before all this occured, when I went outside with the dogs, I noticed that our solar house battery lights flashed really strangely for about a minute.  Afterwards, we checked the outside security cameras to see if they caught anything but they were all aimed too low.  Then it occured to us that it may have been picked up on a public web cam. The only cams like this I could find that would allow me to ""playback"" in time were some set up by PG&E (power company) to monitor for fires. I quickly found footage of the event. Unfortunately, the video is timelapsed,  so the 5 minutes or so of this event is quite abreviated, but it shows the lights and the time/date info is all there.  I checked Mufon and other people elsewhere described the same thing on the same morning.  After the lights disappeared I saw the normal flashing lights of some sort of high-up jet plane flying east to west.

The sky was overcast, and the sun was setting, so it was pretty dark out. At first, I thought I was looking at Venus, but then I remembered the cloud cover. I slowed down to get a better look at the object. The object had moved from east to west for a short period of time, and then remained stationary. It seemed to be about a half of a mile away, and about 1500 ft in elevation. It was a golden white sphere, a little smaller than a pea at that distance. As I was watching, it ejected 5 smaller spheres, which remained for a couple seconds, and then disintegrated into a glittery looking substance that disappeared. Shortly after, the sphere ejected 5 more smaller spheres, which also disintegrated. The sphere remained for about 20 to 30 seconds following that, and then it disappeared, but it didn’t disintegrate.

As I stood there watching, at first, I thought I had just witnessed 2 planes flying way to close to each other. I don’t live far from The Ellsworth Airforce Base, so I did consider that they may be practicing maneuvers as they often do. If I tell anyone else about this, I will just be told that it was planes from the base and to forget about it. As I continued watching, one of the objects left the other very quickly and then turned it’s lights off. Because of the way the moon lit the sky tonight, I could still see its shadow (?), not sure how to describe it, but I could still see it. I then continued to walk my dogs and counted at least 7 more of the exact same objects in a circular formation, all standing still with the (main?) craft continuing to leave it’s lights on while also remaining stationary.

It was nearly as large as a harvest moon, but crescent-shaped.  Or maybe I could only see the lower part of an orb, couldn't tell. The light from the object was so bright it was hard to look at.  It cast a shadow inside the house when I held up my hand.  It remained largely motionless, but slowly drifted a bit to the south so that it was no longer shining directly through my window. It wasn't beaming light down, but instead was glowing brightly. It remained in roughly the same spot for at least 30 minutes.  I didn't see it leave, but it was gone by the time the sun started brightening the sky. This is the second time I have seen a bright motionless object in roughly the same spot of the sky.  The first time was in October 2019, but that object was smaller and shaped more like a wasp.  That object also lingered for more than 20 minutes, and sometimes swelled slightly in size and brilliance, then shrank back.  When it left, it shrank in on itself as if  disappearing into a hole. Both times, the objects appeared on nights where there was little moonlight but an abundnce of stars and very clear conditions.",2020-05-15T00:00:00,43.5676,-72.642

I stepped and turned away to pick up the binoculars I leave outside so I could get a better view.  As I was focusing them to that distance it went dark.

I observed it moving in an up and right direction . I first thought it must be a satalite as it was moving in a perfect strait line. The *star* did not blink- it stayed a solid, steady brightness until I lost sight of it. I measured 15 fingers (like how you measure amount of daylight left with your fingers stacked. I made this measurement at approximately the 8th/ninth object.) that I observed them.

In 1979 I was holiday ing at a place called Berowra waters on the South coast near Sussex Inlet with five friends' one of whose father owned the caravan park where we stayed.This caravan park is on a cliff overlooking the pacific ocean and we would go to the beach everyday and spend most of the day their swimming, surfing and sunbaking.On this particular day I was standing on the shore with my friends father and mother who owned the caravan park when we looked towards the water facing south-east on a clear hot day( no clouds) and observed a black metallic mass that looked similar to an aircraft carrier on its side (approx length 1500ft long-200-400ft across) and slowly moving towards a cliff face which eventually hid most of the object but not before we discussed what it was and how something that big could stay airbo rne when it was apparently moving so slowly and not making a sound.The object was approx: less than three miles away travelling at two to five miles an hour and started to slowly move in a westerly direction over land, it seemed to take so long to move out of view that other people on the beach had by this time noticed what we were looking at and started to point in the air and their was approx ten to twenty people who saw the same thing up and down the beach.As owner of the caravan park numerous people asked them what it was and they responded that they didn’t know, only that their was a Navy facility further down the coast, and Airforce Base at Nowra (ALBATROSS)The object (and it was a metal object)stayed in view for over half an hour from the time we first noticed it until it was lost behind the cliff face. We then proceed to climb the cliff to see if it could still be seen and their it was hovering for a considerable amount of time until a helicopter & jet could be heard in the vicinity, and it slowly moved away, but not taking any notice of either helicopter or jet.In the meantime the southcoast radio station had been inundated with phone calls about strange bright white craft (and they did say craft, I was listening to the broadcast to see if anyone had reported what we had seen earlier) people described the objects, and up to ten were seen, as flying up and down the coast in pairs and one at a time, out to sea, and close to land, as being as bright as the sun, and reflecting the sun, and travelling very fast and occasionally turning back towards the way they had come. When I heard this I remember thinking that this was not what we had seen as the objects were to small, (the size of a houses I seem to remember) not the size of an aircraft carrier as we had seen a few hours earlier. The reports on the radio were the same day, only hours apart from our encounter.My impression was that this was a controlled event as this was winter holidays and the weather was so beautiful that thousands of people were at the beaches up and down the coast, the two people who were with me, and, owned the caravan park were well known in the area ,he was on the local council and had lived in the area all of there lives, and even had a street named after them, and were very honest and humble people who had never seen anything like it in their life, they were also aware of the military bases locally and had seen experimental aircraft before fly over the region, including Jets. I was seventeen at the time I am now thirty five and this was a very close sighting of a very immense object that moved extremely slow and showed no signs of external movement, but it had what appeared to be rivets or welding on the bottom on the side which faced us.At the time I really thought that this was not anything which had been manufactured in Australia and never once thought this was from outer space, now I’m not so sure.Conclusion : Large black mass the size of an aircraft carrier: Moved slowly without sound: Stayed in view for a considerable amount of time: Was seen by numerous people: Weather was hot and cloudless: Other objects were also seen: Radio station reported strange craft seen up and down the coast: Object and smaller objects made of solid material: Reported to authorities: Was highly unusual The Next time (also 1979)In the same year a few friends of mine decided to go to a lookout near Baulkham Hills  in the west of Sydney which was about to become a new suburb, the time was approximately 7.00 - 8.30 PM in summer, (daylight saving ) late November and was a clear night with no clouds, we had been their for a short time when I noticed three circular bright red lights moving south (coming from a northerly direction) in a controlled movement, they were approximately less than five miles away and at that distance appeared to be quite large, about the size of a average house and were moving in a orderly fashion and in no hurry, they were moving in a triangular motion, travelling about 3-10 miles an hour.They did no abrupt moves and stayed in the same formation for a long time (20-30min) before they seemed to reach a point near Prospect Reservoir, and one dived towards the ground at a tremendous speed, one left skyward at high speed, and the other one just seemed to dissolve into the night. We turned the radio on and 2WS, which is a local radio station reported that they had received phone calls from people asking what the lights could be.I asked one of my friends who was there, recently, did he remember that particular night and he described the exact things I have just explained, and he said that they seemed to be under some kind of control and maybe connected to each other as they did a peculiar pattern as they moved across the sky, but the same pattern right across the sky.Conclusion : Three Bright Red Lights with some kind of shape (circular): In a fixed formation (triangular): Seen by five people for a period of at least 20 min: Was reported on the radio by others, independent people: Disappeared  within seconds of each other: Cloudless viewing.Eleven Years Later (1990)I had just returned from Florida, in the States, earlier in the year and had recently lost my job and found myself with time on my hands so I decided to be involved in this new craze which was sweeping the globe 3D images.I managed to find a job in the city (Sydney, Australia) and was working selling 3D posters at Central Railway Station, literally. This was around Christmas 1990 and they were very popular, on this particular day which was a Monday I was just about to go to lunch when a rather tall gentleman of about 6ft 10in, tall, and with large features, long White hair and looking very much like an American Indian, remarked to me that his friend thought  that the brain was similar to a 3D image and the universal acceptance of these images had some kind of lost meaning which we were about to grasp again after a very long time.He then brought up the subject of his friend who had worked for NASA as a photographer and had a very high clearance in the military and had been asked to photograph the inside and outside of a Circular craft which had somehow come into the possession of NASA. He told me in no uncertain terms that his friend took photos of the objects door and as he moved inside and looked  back towards the outside that the door was now twenty to thirty feet higher and the inside was of immense size, yet from the outside the door and craft were rather small, he also me about the underground  nuclear test explosion which was apparently detonated to contain alien forces who had Killed up to 25 scientists and 44 military elite who had complained of human abductions, we had talked so long that I missed my lunch break, and I was working 12 hour days so what he had been telling me had taken nearly one hour, a friend of mine who had come into to see me stood their for the whole time and told me after!wards that what he had just said was really over the top but very interesting.The next day a Tuesday I was sitting in the top floor of a double decker train at 6.30 in the morning on my way to work, the train had just left Strathfield station when I noticed in the distance, a shape like a plane that seemed to be banking towards the train, I was looking for markings and wings as I thought it was a plane making a turn towards the airport when it suddenly approached parallel to the train and proceeded to pace the train.Most people who were on the train were asleep and I had an urge to wake them and say look out the window at this silvery disk shaped object which had by now slowed considerably and was now only one mile away and slowing down as we slowed down as we approached the next stop, the train had just slowed down for track maintenance when I noticed a tower between the object and the train, by the time we passed the tower which was about thirty feet across, the object had disappeared from view, as if someone had turned a switch and the object had just disappearedConclusion   : Strange encounter with person with Indian like appearance: Told me about something which I had heard years earlier underground: Observed a craft of no known origin the next day: Had seen it disappear before my eyes on a clear day: Was definitely metallic and polished silver - reflected the early morning sunlight: Had no markings whatsoever: No exhaust or smoke at all: Was seen for 10-15 minIn early (1993)Near the middle of April I was at a friends place in Blacktown ( 25 miles West of Sydney) we had just been outside and had seen a bright red object shining in a westerly direction at a very high altitude and not doing the normal flight you would expect from any aircraft, this lasted about five minutes before we lost it behind a tree, there were three of us, at about one hour after this I decided to go home, the time was about 10-11 PM.I lived about three miles away and on the way home had a Incredible encounter with multiple craft over Blacktown (where I live) it started when I reached the top of a hill on Locke St and was stopped at a set of traffic lights and noticed directly ahead less than a mile away a Huge Object, and smaller craft above the main one, the lights changed and I proceeded down the hill past the local hospital, and as I rounded the corner I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, their above the road less than five -hundred feet away I saw two objects- One, the bigger of the two had lights of different shades and colours which moved around the base and middle in a fast movement so that the lights seemed to catch up with each other and I could see what seemed to be railings inside the craft, the lights which were luminous colours-Green-washed in purples and yellows with a touch of Blue. There seemed to be a bright light coming from inside the large object.The object above the larger one had to be large also but wasn’t doing anything other than sitting above the other one, I slowed down at another set of lights and saw a elderly gentleman who was walking along the footpath and I was going to wind down my window and ask him to look up at the Objects but thought  he might have a heart attack so I didn’t say anything, while I was waiting for the lights to change they started to slowly move away over the hospital and I thought to myself that I was going to chase them ( the objects) at that very second as if they had heard what I had thought they accelerated to a brisk pace and I turned around and started to chase them, as I drove up the hill and turned east down Bungarribee Rd I stopped my car which overlooked a disused quarry and got out I notice two more objects hovering above my head at no more than 200ft above me, I then looked East and about half a mile away noticed another two cigar shaped objects the same as the ones above my!head, I then looked to the south and saw another object similar to the one above the large object that I was chasing and saw the two craft I was chasing moving at a slow speed in a south-easterly direction, in the direction of Bankstown Airport about fifteen miles away.While I was watching them both move away the two above me were still there not moving at all, I was out of the car and could almost touch them, they made no sound and seemed to just hover without any wobbling or movement, I continued to watch all seven objects for the next hour or so until the first two disappeared in the vicinity of Sydney and seemed to be moving in a large arc around the panoramic view I had (that is moving from south to east to nth east before I lost sight of them) I then noticed that the two smaller cigar shaped objects to the east had come down a bit lower and were near a radio tower 2WS and soon they too had mysteriously vanished, the objects above my head had begun to move away slowly and I saw that they were staying close together and moved slowly towards the horizon until they too had disappeared.I decided to go home and ring up the airport where I had seen the original two craft head towards, when I arrived home I had to move my mothers car under the carport, but, when I tried to start the car it wouldn’t start, I finally gave up and got out of the car and looked up at the sky and the first craft I had seen with the revolving lights was directly above our house and was moving very slowly south back towards the location that I had first seen it, It was the same craft except I now had a better look at the whole Object, It was Large about 200ft in diameter and when I looked up was moving quite slowly almost as if it was waiting for something to catch it up. It then moved out of site and I went inside and rang up the airport who rang me three days later and asked me what I had seen and told me to ring the Airforce base at Richmond which I did and the person I talked to said that they had heard nothing about what I had just described.I left a message for my mother that her car wouldn’t start and she rang the NRMA which is road service in New South Wales and when he turned up the car wouldn’t start straight away and he said that it was a flat battery even though it was a new battery and the car had been driven less than four hours earlier that night.Conclusion   : Seven Objects seen in the space of a few hundred feet from each other: Coloured Lights seen emitting from around the Largest Object: Objects seen to Hover from a close distance: Seemed to hear what I was thinking: Some kind of railing seen inside large object: Bright White Light seen emitting from inside: Travelled right around the Metropolitan area: Somehow drained the power from the battery of car: Seen directly over my house so object had to of flown in a 360 deg arc around Sydney and surrounding areas: I had chased the first two objects which had been hovering over road near the HospitalBedroom Visitors 1994I had just arrived home from a friends place and was lying on the bed looking at the ceiling and looking out the window at the stars when I felt a sharp pain like a pin being stuck in my toes, the first thing I thought was that a white tailed spider had bitten me as there was an increase in these type of spiders around the house at the time.I felt like I was frozen and wanted to yell out but didn’t want to disturb my mother who was asleep in the other room, I was wide awake and had only just put my head on the pillow seconds earlier thinking about tomorrow and things I had to do, when I felt the presence in my room and sounds from the foot of my bed, I couldn’t see anything, and I still couldn’t move at all and it was then that I felt hands around my feet where the pin prick had been and I could only lift my head slightly and I saw five small figures looking at me at the foot of the bed (they had came out of my wardrobe) and I could see that the wall where the wardrobe was now different and looked like the inside of a giant hanger which went back into the wall a considerable distance.There were two small entities standing at the end of my bed and one had stuck me with a needle in the toe and one was holding my ankle and examining my ankle area, while this was happening I thought that I hope my mother in the next room doesn’t wake up and disturbs these entities as they might panic and hurt her, or she might panic and something bad might happen to her, then what seemed like a few seconds I noticed three more figures coming out of the wardrobe and stand at the foot of the bed and proceeded to stick something in my leg, I started to feel able to move again, only slightly and lifted my head off the pillow and saw right into their faces and they looked back with curious looks on their faces but never stopped doing whatever they were doing but they knew I was looking straight at them and I was wide awake.They were not trying to intentionally hurt me and I felt no fear and I could remember everything that they were doing and I was aware of  being awake and this was not a dream, I tried to communicate with them, I couldn’t talk, as no sounds came from my mouth, but I could hear my voice from deep down from within.They were quite solid, long arms but not abnormal, smallish heads not extremely large, more like small children feeling around, playing, around 3-4ft tall, dark greyish in appearance with lizard like scales, and the skin seemed the same colour throughout the body as far as I could see, and I could see just below their knees, they had a almost sad look about them and there was definitely some kind of rank as one or two ordered the others around, not with words or telepathy but they just seemed to obey without answering, and these other two stayed in the background moving around the room and observing, occasionally looking over to see what was happening.They still had hold of my ankle and reminded me of well trained doctors with nurses helping them, this was a real event, on one occasion one stepped back into the wardrobe to retrieve something and came back with it in its hand and I noticed that it had three large type fingers that seemed to be too large to do anything intricate yet here they were doing things to me with the skill of a surgeon, I felt no pain except for the initial discomfort of a pinprick in my toe, I heard no voices only muffled sounds and yet I could tell that this wasn’t going to be a adverse experience.They wanted to look at my legs and feet and didn’t come near my face or touch any part of me except my toes and ankles, although they had direct contact with my eyes. They seemed to me to be quite aware of my feelings and as they continued  they would look my way to see if I was in any discomfort and all looked when I thought of my mother, before they left I noticed they looked back at me as they went back into the wardrobe, one at a time, in a very orderly fashion, and the last thing before they vanished the wall came back to its original distance and the hanger like area which reminded me of inside a large ship gradually disappeared in a cloud like vapour.It was then that I felt the sensation of my foot and toe and I immediately jumped up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and could see that I was wide awake and when I checked the time it was less than three minutes since I had arrived home, which was impossible as I had made something to eat when I first arrived home.It was then when I heard my mother talk that I realised it was all over and I have since sold the wardrobe and painted the room and had a inbuilt wardrobe installed.Later in the week I went to a friend who has a paranormal interest and he took out of my toe a small black object that wasas hard as a needle and was giving me quite a bit of pain.Conclusion : Five Entities in my bedroom: A small metal as hard as a needle was found in my toe: I was wide awake the whole time: There was eye contact and concern on their part: I saw a kind of entrance to another dimension: Some type of medical procedure had happened: Two entities in charge of procedures: Grey in appearance with skin that was like a mold: They knew what to do and had me paralysed from the neck down.: They also had a sad look- the kind of look when you say goodbye to someone you have feelings for Early (1996)I had just came home and was going inside to  get my telescope to look at Jupiter and the Moon when I looked west and saw a fast moving object which I thought was a white aeroplane that looked like a wireframe, until I saw a smaller object either come out of the original object or came up alongside and seemed to refuel while all the time the other object was moving at a incredible speed. They stayed together for approximately 15 seconds which was a long time considering it travelled across the horizon and out of sight in that time.I rang Bankstown Airport and they told me to ring Richmond Airforce Base which I immediately did and was put through to the officer in charge of aircraft dispatches who told me that no planes would refuel over residential areas Ever and especially not at night. I know what I saw and that was a low, very high speed object with a smaller object that was seen to pace and be refuelled in mid air at about 11PM at night earlier this year 1996.Conclusion : High speed Object wireframe in appearance: Smaller Object seen to pace and be refuelled by larger object: In view for a short amount of time: Incredible speeds for both craft: Large Craft was white in appearance: Smaller Craft seemed to be see through.JUNE LONG WEEKEND (9/6/96)Sun: Time: 9.25-9.55This happened on Sun long weekend of June this year I had just dropped Lloyd who is a friend of mine at his place and he was taking his things inside when I noticed three orange/red/yellow lights pulsating and slowly moving high in the sky above Blacktown. They were in a large Triangular shape from three to five files apart, the top light of the triangle stayed in a constant spot as did the bottom left light, the light on the bottom right though moved away and pulsated in and out and disappeared on occasions and then reappeared slowly moving away from the other two until it completely disappeared from view. The other two started to slowly move away with the bottom left light going higher and the top light moving across and over the bottom light, moving east and moving very slowly, the other light moved away at the same speed going north-east and very slowly. We decided to ring a few friends who have cameras and videos and after a good half hour with the objects still in sight !I decided to go home as it was getting quite cold. We were looking through high powered binoculars and their appeared to be a solid object behind the light. As I drove home which is about two miles away I could see the remaining lights from the car quite clearly and thought that when I arrive home I would have a look through the telescope.

At a distance I assumed it was an airplane on the flight path to the international airport in the north-west. When it got close, only five lights were visible in an enormous triangular configuration.  Three lights were large, bright white, unblinking, and made a smaller triangle at the forward point of the object, the other two lights were dim, white, unblinking, and at the other two corners of the larger triangle.  It was 3 or 4 times the size of a passenger jet, and under 2000 feet, but no engine noise could be heard. Monday, December 1, 1997 	At about 9:45PM tonight I was driving southward on the Monterey Highway when I noticed what was either an experimental air craft or else I’ve had a sighting of one of the new triangular ufos.  I initially thought I was observing the bright landing lights of a couple of incoming commercial jet liners, since they were in the usual flight path for San Jose International Airport from the southeast toward the northwest. 	However, when I was stopped at the signal near the Edenvale shopping center on the approach to the Blossom Hill underpass, I was able to clearly see something which was not a plane with which I am familiar.  I wondered if it might have been some kind of stealth plane, because I could not make out the body of the plane against the night sky.  All I could see was five lights. 	Three lights were very bright, they were larger than normal running lights, and they were arranged in a tight equilateral triangle on the bottom of what I thought may be a plane’s fuselage (the triangle was about the size of a silver dollar at arms length).  But, if it is a conventional or experimental airplane, the fuselage is two or three times as wide as most commercial jets.  There were also two small white lights placed where I imagined the wingtips were located aft of the triangle, (from the triangle to a “wingtip” was about the span of a 5 inch ruler held at arms length, or it was between 11 and 12 inches from tip to tip) but once again, they indicated a much wider wing span than is typical. 	Looking for a place to park and observe the craft, I rolled down the window and turned off the radio to see if I could hear the engine, but I could not.  It may have been too high, although its unusually large size indicated it was low enough to hear (perhaps a couple thousand feet above the highway).  If it was too high to hear, then its dimensions had to be too enormous to contemplate. 	I proceeded onto the cloverleaf and emerged slowly onto the eastbound side of Blossom Hill so I could look toward the craft’s flight path, but it was long gone.  Never-the-less, off in the distance, on the same path were some large red lights which I assumed were probably the tail lights of the same air craft, primarily because they also were much larger than the running lights of most planes. 	 	I also watched other planes to make a comparison.  As expected, I was able to clearly see the bodies of the other planes.  I also found that their lights were not configured like those of this large craft, nor were the lights as bright, or as large.  Furthermore, there were the usual flashing lights on the airplanes, but all the lights of the other craft were steady and unblinking.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

He then seems withdrawn. And points to the sky where I look.  I was on the same side of the campfire as him.  I noticed a weird constellation a perfect equalalateal triangle the three points were the brightest points in the sky.

The three equally spaced lights on the apparent corners were white or very light orange.  The center light appeared to be made up of a white and red light; it appeared as if the bottom light was a red light ""engulfed"" by white light. I viewed the aircraft as it approached toward my line of sight from the direct south at a relatively low altitude, probably less than 1000 feet.  The craft was traveling slowly, slower than I have seen an airplane fly, and as it continued away from me towards the north, the appearance of what would be the lights on the rear corners changed appearance, and began to resemble the center light, as a red light surrounded by white lights.  The red portion of the rear lights (which appeared as being on the left and right) were blinking in a synchronized fashion, ie, there was still a white light on the front and corners, but the two ""rear"" lights also appeared to contain smaller red lights which blinked at the same time. The ""aircraft"" also made a very low-frequency pulsing sound, more like an earthquake or distant rolling thunder than any aircraft I have heard.  My house is located approximately 67 miles from Whiteman AFB, and I have witnessed stealth aircraft over my house before, however this unknown object made a completely different sound than the stealth Air Force craft I have heard/seen. I have also subsequently watches videos of stealth aircraft flying at night, and it's important to note that no lights extended beyond the three equally spaced white lights, like the red and green lights seen on the wingtips of known aircraft. I was unable to discern any shape beyond what was conveyed by the three equally spaced white lights. I think it is also important to note that I do not live near an airport approach, and have never witnessed an aircraft flying along this path at any altitude or time of day.

At first thinking it was a drifting plastic Walmart bag, I thought nothing of it. But then I noticed it was too far away for me to think that it was a garbage bag.  It wasn’t big by any means but around the length of 3-5 miles in the air, I wouldn’t be able to see a plastic Walmart bag so clearly.  I then pulled out my iPhone and began to record.  I ended up getting 10 good seconds of it. 	It was moving from the North to the South (Right to left according to my view), appearing to look like a plastic bag would drifting mid-air. But after I viewed my recording zoomed all the way in, it appeared to be possibly circulating(spinning), and sides dipping up and down similar to a teetertotter. It escaped my sight of my patio as it passed below the roof of the adjacent apartment in front of me. 	Out of curiosity, I quickly ran down and out to the parking lot beneath me to see if I could catch another glimpse of the flying object. I just wanted to see if it was a plastic bag or not. It took me precisely 1.5 minutes to get in position where I should have had a clear view.  The object wasn’t where it should have been had it continued its speed and course. I looked for a matter of maybe 20 seconds and then spotted it again. I am from North Dakota. I have visited sights and many national parks where I have been shown what 10-20 miles away looks like to the naked eye. According to my eye, this object turned west and was about 15+ miles away from where I had seen it on my patio. What I’d compare it to was looking at a star in a night’s sky; except it was day light at 10:30 in the morning. 	Now we live in an area close to the DFW airport. Hundreds if not thousands of planes fly over our area per day. A plane is really the easiest thing to notice. However, it is something that is really hard to mistake. When you see a plane, you see a plane. It moves at the same pace, it most of the time is going in the same direction. At one point it can be close. After a few moments it will pass and be gone as you watch it get further and further away. This was nothing like that. It was not a plane. I have video to prove that. This was something else. 	As I watched it in the west, it was moving right to the left at a very slow pace not getting any further away than it already was. A light seemed to be going in and out on it like a glimmer in the sun. Not like the light blinking on the air plane. It wasn’t moving at a consistent pace. It would move left, then stop, then movie left, then stop. 	As I was watching, I was recording with my iPhone. It was hard to keep a clear and still image due to the distance between me and the object. I couldn’t’ even see it on my phone. It was bright out and I was squinting. I just aimed my phone at the area and hoped that I could see it later on my phone. I was able to but it is blurry and not still unfortunately. You are able to follow it though on my phone.  It was coming up on a cloud and I didn’t want to miss the last part. I put my phone down and then what I saw next was uncertain. I was squinting and it was bright. I could have seen a lot but the sun was behind me. When I say that, I mean that it wasn’t obstructing my vision. It just created a bright atmosphere to my eyes were having a more difficult time staying wide open. I may or may not have seen this object, do a full loop up and down then disappear NE in the matter of a second. After questioning what I had seen, I looked for the object which wasn’t quite to the cloud ! yet and it was nowhere to be seen. Almost no time after, one of the hundreds of planes that fly over us flew right into the area that the object had been. This took place over the time span of maybe 4-6 minutes, start to finish. 	The weather this day was partly cloudy, mostly blue skies. The wind was little to non. There wasn’t the sound of a plane flying by. There were no plumes. It was just a white odd shaped ball you could see spinning and dipping. An interesting way to end the week.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,33.044733514986376,-97.01126376021797

This occurred in during my time in the US Air Force while stationed at Vandenberg AFB, near Lompoc, CA.  I was a member of a geodetic survey squadron that brought highly accurate geodetic, astronomic data to icbm silos, and other assets (SR 71, X 15, down range splash downs, etc) of the USAF, at VAFB, Edwards AFB, and Eniwetok.  We usually worked in teams of three individuals.  One person was an observer who actually made the measurements off the north star and triangle or quadrangle survey network at each missile silo.  A second person is the recorder.  The recorder simply documents the 16 measurements and time lapse of each for each station run.  The third person usually was backup for either position and also made sure the target lights on each station continued turned on.  We did this at VAFB and also for the 18 Titan around Tucson Arizona, and other areas.  This particular event took place in late 1966 or early 1967 at the far north end of VAFB.  I previously reported it as February 1967, however, frankly, after these years my recollection may be off 2 or 3 months.  I was assigned to VAFB in September or October of 1963 and was honorably discharged in May of 1967. Since our 1st Order survey measurements required optimal weather conditions, our work was done at night to minimize distortion and parallax by heat waves.  We would leave the Dayroom early evening about 6 or 7 pm.  This would allow us to set up our target lights on each concrete monolith then finally set up our Wild T3 theodolite while there was still enough light.  At dusk we would start our measurements of 16 positions at each of the 3 or 4 survey stations at each icbm silo.  Typically, we would finish one silo site per evening and return to the Dayroom about 10:00 or 10:30 pm. On the night of question, we were working an icbm silo at the far north end of VAFB near Lospe Mountain.  We were taking astro measurements on the north star, Polaris.  Therefore, please note that we were observing and focused completely toward the north with our backs to the south.   Most of the base and other icbm silos were to our rear, south of us. We completed our work and returned to the Dayroom.  When we arrived at the office, our Party Chief was waiting for us at the door.  Upon arrival, he immediately asked us whether we had observed what had happened at the silo in question.  We responded that we had not seen anything.  He then told us the Air Police at Headquarters, seeing an apparent ‘light show’ at that north end silo had at first thought there had been a missile launch.  He said that silo had been lit up as if there had been a launch.  Then, he said, they realized it was not a missile launch.  He said an object had approached that silo from the ocean side low and slow until it was over the silo.  There, he said, it hovered directly over the silo.   The Sgt, while a nice fellow, was no one to kid around or play jokes on anyone.  He was a very serious person who did not play around. I expected to hear more reports the following morning, however, the next day it was as if nothing had happened.  There was not even a hint of what had happened the previous night. It was not until many years later in the early 2000s that I heard of the report of a similar event in Montana around that approximate time.  Those two events appear similar in that both involved an unknown object hovering or next to an icbm silo.",,,

Clear dry SW sky. Where: 		Arches National Park Campground, Grand County, Utah, Zip Code 84532 Height in sky: 	About 200 ft. (not sure). Length of obj:	If 100-300 ft high in air, then maybe 150-600 ft in length (all approximates here) Speed:		Something like Helicopter speed (maybe 100 mph)  Duration:	About 10 minutes from horizon to horizon.

Dead silent.  Could not distinguish any form to the craft.  Sighting happened around 11 pm (10pm to Midnight) around August 23 – 25, 1978 in southern Utah at Arches National Park campground.  I was 28 years old at the time.  My younger brother and I were on a 4-week camping vacation through the Southwest.  We had rented a station wagon in Grand Junction, CO and drove and just slept in the back of the station wagon at various National Parks.  This night we and the other campers were settling down for the night.  I like staying up late, so I was sitting off the back of the station wagon enjoying the clear night sky and reflecting how nice it was to be traveling around for a few weeks.  Things were getting quieter and quieter around the campground until at last the last campers that were up had finally gone to sleep.  My brother had gone to sleep also.  It was about 11pm.  Around 15 minutes after everything went quiet, I saw a very bright solid white light in the sky off in the distance to my right.  The white light was coming closer, not flying very high, maybe about 200 ft (not sure) in a very straight line.  I was wondering what it was and figured it must be a small plane, maybe a search plane or maybe a search helicopter.  I thought maybe someone was missing that day, and they were searching for them that night.  Then I kind of laughed to myself because I could see it would be flying right over our campground and figured the noise would be so loud that it would probably wake up everyone.  As it started to fly past in front of me, coming from the bright white light in the front, the side view became a very, very long narrow band of 4 distinct and different rectangular colored lights moving from left to right across the side of whatever this was.   Red, blue, white, yellow.  (Not sure of the order, but white and yellow were next to each other, definitely.)  It was a continuous running rectangular strip of distinct lights.  You could see at least 3 of the colors at one time, and as one color ‘dropped off’ the back, it would appear again at the front end of the strip.  Evenly spaced colors, very bright, solid colors.  |      Yellow       |       White        |        Blue       |        Red         |  At first I thought it was just 3 colors, red, blue, white and that the white strip was twice as long as the other 2 colors; but looking very intently as this thing went past, I could see that there was a very faint yellow strip of light next to the white strip of light.  So, all 4 colors were the same length.  My jaw literally dropped open.  I was yelling and shaking my brother to wake him up and to look at this thing.  I could not wake him no matter how hard I tried.  There were no other lights on this anywhere; no blinking lights like aircraft is supposed to have.  And looking at this very intently, I could not for the life of me, make out any craft or shape to it at all.  It was just a strip of rectangular colors going by in the night sky.  And it made no noise at all, dead silent; so, it was not a plane or a helicopter.  I was gasping at the sight, and I wanted to scream to wake up the whole campground; but I stopped myself out of embarrassment because it would be gone by the time I woke anybody and because I thought what if it is just a blimp.  A blimp would be the only earthly thing that could possibly make any sense at all.   In 1978, I did not know if blimps made noise.  Now I know they are very noisy so this could not have been a blimp.  No noise coming or going.  After it went past, the back end of it just became the same type of bright white solid light (coming off the colored lights of the side) that the front end had been.  I watched that bright white light as it flew off to the horizon on my left until it just faded from my eyes, and I could no longer see it.  It went straight as an arrow across the sky past me.  Never wavering, at about the speed of a helicopter.  I was dumbfounded.  Several days later, we were camping at Capitol Reed National Park, Utah.  We met a couple from Rhode Island that were traveling across the country.  When the young woman found out that we had been at Arches N.P. the same night they were, she started telling me about a strange thing she had seen in the sky there.  I said, oh my gosh, did you see it too?  She described the exact same thing.  We were both so excited to corroborate each other.  She had thought that the white rectangular color of light was twice as long as the other colors, red and blue.  I told her I had thought the same thing at first, but then I had distinguished a very faint yellow rectangular color next to the white.  So, there was in fact 4 distinct colors of the same length.  She said, oh that explains that part then.  She had no idea what it was either. Also, she could not wake up her husband that night, so he did not see it either.  I don’t have a picture of it; but recently, I asked my son to write a little program that would portray it.  I sent a gif view of this via email.  It is a pretty good likeness of what I saw.  My son has a Physics PhD degree and is a skeptic.  He is convinced I saw a blimp in 1978.  I remain open-minded; but when searching 1978 blimps on-line now, I do not see any that look like what I saw.  And nothing out there currently looks like it either.  -Blimps are noisy; this was dead silent. -Blimps should have blinking and other lights on it; this had none. -I should have been able to distinguish some outline; I could not see any.  That seems very dangerous.  I wish now that I had screamed that night, if only to have made contact with the Rhode Island girl that night.  I wish I had her name so I could contact her now.  I always wonder if she ever made a report since she was as astonished as I was that night.",2020-07-03T00:00:00,,

I am a dual-degree engineer from the Colorado School of Mines.  This occurred when I was 12 but at the time (May, 1989), I understood that what I saw wasn’t possible with current technology.  Two friends and I had snuck out during a sleep over and were at a park, just after midnight, in central Jefferson County, Colorado.  We noticed a Stationary bright light  at about 15-20 degrees south of vertical.  At the time it appeared to me as an aircraft coming toward us - as it had no lateral movement but was much brighter than anything in the sky. It kept this position for several minutes.  As we began to walk back toward the house we were staying at we felt like it was moving with us (with my current knowledge, that can be explained as parallax).  Then, from a stationary position, the light moved at a high rate of speed to the East and disappeared over the horizon in a few seconds without leaving any sort of trail.  The horizon line from our vantage point was maybe 50 mi! les and depending on the “craft’s” altitude, could mean several hundred miles of travel for it pass beyond.  There was little or no acceleration period to get to speed - it went from stationary to really fast almost immediately.  Although young, I understood that what I saw wasn’t possible. I remember it vividly.  Just never thought about reporting it until now. I truly hope it coincides with other data the UFO Center may have.

I am a stargazer and loved watching the night sky.  Suddenly towards the North I saw a firey meteor come down and thought, ""Wow, that was a great meteor""  A couple minutes later a craft appeared overhead, slowly, silently, approched towards me over the house located behind me.  It was glowing red, like heated metal, the entire craft.  It was square and flat like a thick book.  It just slowly moved closer, estimating it was about 1/4 mile away.  The size of a one story home.  As I stood there in astonishment, it was nothing like I expected a UFO to look like, but there it was slowly approaching in a smooth, slow, gliding like movement then it banked in a turn towards the west and did a U turn towards the North.  It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen.   After completing its slow moving U turn it just continued its slow movement towards the North un! til it was out of sight.  The direction it came and left took it over the nearby Rt 84.  There is also a train depot nearby that had to have seen it since it was so bright, glowing red and so large, since the train depot for freight operates 24 hours and I can hear the connecting of rail cars from my home.  Also nearby is Caldwell Airport, a medium sized private airport and I believe it is controlled, but not sure if it is 24 hours.  I really don't care who believes me or not and that is to be expected.  I know what I saw and there isn't craft like I ever had seen before.   There were no signs of windows or anything, just a square shaped craft, silent, glowing hot red, smooth all over and flat, meaning the height or thickness was about 1/4 that of the square distance of the overall craft.  It was also glowing red uniformly over the entire craft.  I can see it clearly in my mind ever since.   I was watching a UFO documentary on TV about a year ago about a UFO sighting near a! military base in Utah that looked and flew almost exactly fro! m the on e I saw.  It however was traingular shaped and the sides had lines from top to bottom all the way around.  It made me wonder if mine only appeared to be square due to the angle it approached me, but it did expose its under belly to me during its turn and it looked square.   I didn't report it because I didn't know who to report it to, but there must have been many other witnesses being it flew over the freeway and stood out so much in color, glow, size and very unusual shape.  The timeline besides the 2am has faded over time.  I estimate it was in the spring of 2015 but I could be a year off at this point.  I wish I can find out if others reported it, but have no clue who would have that information.   I only found this website after reading an article yesterday about a recent sighting also here in Nampa which included video.  It looked nothing like my sighting but if you could advise me who may have records that I can research I would greatly appreciate it.

On the way to the house right after we had turned down a secluded road surrounded by trees I saw a large triangle shaped aircraft flying in the sky just above the trees.  I alerted my friends to the object and then we couldn’t see it for a second because of the angle from which we were driving and the trees because it was flying low right above the trees.  After a few more seconds we were able to see it again and then my other two friends could see it.   The object was flying low and slow paced almost as if it was flying at the same pace as the car we were in but it was big probably the size 2000 sq ft home if not bigger and there was no sound coming from it at all.  There were what appeared to be three lights close together on the edge of the craft in the middle of the side we were looking at and  appeared to be blinking lights on each corner of the side we were looking at.  We watched it for about a minute as we continued to travel to the house right when we were making a turn to get to the house we could no longer see it.  When we arrived we told the other people at the house of what we saw but they thought it was likely a military aircraft of some sort.  But we knew it was definitely not a normal aircraft.,2020-07-09T00:00:00,30.44264888888889,-89.12384592592592

The sky was crystal clear and not a cloud around, so they were quite obvious.  All three were a silver color and reflective.  The first one I spotted was traveling north along the tree line about 500 feet up.  At first, I thought it was just an odd shaped civilian aircraft but then realized it was like nothing I had seen before.  The front of it was a triangular shape and the back was rather flat.  I was driving so it was hard to make out further detail, especially at its height. I pulled up my FlightTracker App on phone to see if there were any registered aircraft in the area and there were None within at least 5 miles.  I was skeptical that it was anything extraterrestrial until I saw the other 2 craft just ahead of the first one.  The other two were the same or similar shaped and in much closer proximity to one another but further up and the first one I spotted went higher! and joined the others. At this point I realized they were not drones of any kind as they were far too big and the fact that two of them were circling around each other in sort of an erratic pattern made me think there’s no way approved aircraft could maneuver that way safely or legally. I tried getting photos and a quick video of them but unfortunately, they did not come out very clearly…but its evidence of what I saw in some fashion. If you zoom way in toward the middle of the photo, you can see all three of them lined up together while they got further away and in the video you can see my camera trying to focus on the one pacing traffic but then it quickly accelerates toward the end of the video before all three of them disappeared from view almost instantly so I have no idea where they went or in which direction. The whole encounter only lasted about 30 seconds, but I’d be shocked if no one else reported the same thing I saw as there were many cars under them travelling on the highway. I’ve always been a firm believer of extraterrestrial existence and alien UFO’s and there have been questionable things I’ve seen in the past that have been easily able to be debunked but this is the first time I’m pretty confident in what I saw as being something other wor! ldly.

It always returned to a sphere and maintained this shape more often than the others.  We went outside to take a closer look and we both witnessed it change shape again and, for a few seconds, disappear altogether.  For about 20 minutes, it appeared to not really move at all but then it would slide right (west).  We have had a closer look through binoculars (I was unable to get a bead on it with my telescope since it’s so sunny) and appears to be made of a rather shiny white material - the closest comparison is of polished white marble or mother of pearl.  The surface seems smooth but the light reflects oddly, which gives it the appearance of softness or liquid.  Thinking it could also be the comet, we looked through the binoculars several more times and agree that the object appears to be within our atmosphere and not on the outside.  It is very clearly 3 dimensional and there does not appear to be any of the distortion one might expect of an object visible in space.  At any rate, no idea what it is.  I thought for a minute it could be a simple weather balloon, based on its shape and the contours\colors of the surface, but it is in no way behaving like one.

At approximately 23:50, while exiting Highway 101, I noticed an object in the sky approximately 250-300 feet in the air over a shopping center across the street from my location.  The object was slightly oval and was flickering orange.  At first glance, I thought it was a light on a crane, until the object started to move.  I then thought it might be a helicopter.  I rolled down my window to hear it, however, the object made no noise.  I kept the object in view as I continued my drive three blocks down the road to my house.  When I exited my car, the object began to move towards my location and descended slightly in altitude. I immediately went into my home and got my 14 year old son to come outside and see what I was looking at.  As we both got outside, the object continued to hover over the intersection next to my home for about 30 seconds or so, then shot straight up in the air at an amazing velocity.  The object continued to climb until it disappeared. About 10-15 minutes later, I went outside and saw two more objects hovering at about the same location as the original object.  These two objects appeared to be identical to the first one and maintained the same distance from each other at all times.  Both my son and I took pictures of the objects and then as we began to discuss what we were seeing, both objects began the same maneuver that the first had done. We estimate the size of the objects to be about the size of a small automobile.  The objects flickered in the dark and had no other visible structure to them.  It should be noted that the sky condition was slightly smoky from nearby wildfires and the moon was creating sufficient light to create ample light to see non-illuminated objects in the area clearly.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,37.99526143250689,-122.52110826446282

It was still dark.  I went to the window, opened the window as I sometimes do when I wake that early in the morning.  I looked outside to take in the night view.  Clear sky, warm, calm, peaceful.  I looked up and noticed a string of bright single lights, almost as bright as Venus or Mars.  I just as quickly noticed they were moving.  Coming from the horizon to the South West moving toward the North East.  The got closer.  I first thought they might be satellites but as the leading lights came almost over the house, I could see the string of lights continued all the way back to the horizon from where I first noticed them.  They were all in line and evenly spaced.  All except one.  The first 4 or 5 were in line and then the next one was noticeably off the line but continuing to move as the others.  All the rest were perfectly in line and evenly spaced.  There was no sound of course.  They seemed to be very high almost as a! satellite may appear if you saw one on a dark clear night far from any light pollution.  This procession continued for about 15 minutes and I just watched in amazement and wonder.  Obviously wondering what it could possibly be.  Until the end of the line of lights finally came past and the show was over.  All were evenly spaced and moving at a speed that a plane moving through the sky over head at 20,00 feet would appear to be moving.  These were not airplanes, this is Switzerland.  Aircraft do not fly during these hours in most western European countries. Much less 50 or more in a straight line evenly spaced like that.  Satellites?  Again, I cannot imagine that many satellites all in a line moving across the sky like that but I suppose it is possible.  Been looking in the news for any other person making this report.  I could not have been the only one to have seen this.",2020-06-25T00:00:00,,

I had just gotten off work as a professional commercial bus driver, and was just looking up appreciating the still setting sun in tonight, even though it was near 9 p.m., or 2100 hours. There were no clouds in the sky, and the view  of the crystal clear bluish-maroon sky was amazing!  As I yet traveled only one eighth of a mile down Southbound Lovelace Avenue, I was still observing the sky on occasion as I was driving down this road, when I noticed appearing from my right, which would be the westbound side of Lovelace Avenue, a brilliantly lit bluish white sphere moving gracefully through the clear early evening sky. I say gracefully, because the first thing I noticed about this bluish sphere, was that it seemed to be ""pulled"" in the South, Southeast direction of the sky, as opposed to being propelled. I characterized this type of movement through the sky, because over 30 years ago, I had considered being an aviator in the United States Marine Corps.  I've read dozens of books about aircraft since its inception when the Wright brothers flew the Kitty Hawk, so I'm quite familiar with the characteristics of aircraft of different kinds that are publicly known.  Also, I have taken a few flight lessons before, so I'm pretty familiar which additional lights on aircraft, and how aircraft wood handle and performance in the sky, since I have flown propeller-driven aircraft before like the Piper Archer II. That the movement of this sphere was so graceful, I immediately started looking for typical navigational lights seen on a terrestrial aircraft that are required whenever flying in the evening into night time. I did not observe any standard navigation lights, like the red light on the left/port wing tip of a man-made terrestrial crafts, nor a green light on the right/starboard wing tip, then a white light on the aircraft tail, nor any other required position lights on a plane. As the bluish sphere traveled from my right to my left, I estimated it's altitude at approximately 800 to 1,000 ft.  The illumination of the sphere reminded me of a clearly lit LED  light,  which never pulsated, and remained at the same light level the entire time I witnessed it.  I could not discern any discernible shape within the light, and it was only one ""craft"" I observed. The next thing that occurred to me was to see if I could hear any sound from this sphere.  Since I was driving a 2015 Ford Fusion Hybrid, I decided to drop my speed so the car would run silently on its lithium ion battery rather than the gasoline engine.  Then I rolled down the driver side window so I can potentially hear any sound that could have been made in the wake of this bluish sphere, but did not hear any sounds at all, save for the ground noise made by the tires of my car.  And I did not hear any other sounds around me as I was traveling on this road by myself. As I approached a stop sign at the dead end of Lovelace Avenue and Union Road and pulled to the side just before the stop sign, I continued observing the craft as much as possible until I lost view of it behind some trees and some other Man-made obstructions on the ground in the distance. Again, what really captured my attention was how this craft seem to be ""pulled"", rather than ""pushed"" (propelled) in the direction, such as a plane would, as it moved along.  A very fascinating observation!",2020-06-25T00:00:00,37.77417,-121.2256556

There was no sound I noticed, and there were a few others walking their dogs or taking a stroll. It much resembles the lights captured two years ago in Honolulu on the news, but it was just one. I might have seen in flicker off like those lights, but it was towards the end so I can’t be sure. It was towards the freeway side that divides Mililani Town and Mauka, standing facing on the town center side of the main road. It did not move or anything.  ...It is possible this was some kind of Navy testing, but there are much more isolated islands nearby than the 1-mil strong most populated island in Hawaii......On more speculation, It happened as I was daydreaming about living to be 200+ year old with limited powers, and how I would probably try to make myself known to history, and the best use of magic would probably be to wait till humanity battles it out and comes to a good stopping place before undoing the damages and leaving people and plants at a blank slate being healthy and strong.

I was outside of my tribal housing residence with a friend of mine smoking a cigarette. I was looking up at the clear sky looking towards the venus planet SE of my hounding unit. N I have seen many UFOs since 1982  ,so I know how to identify them.  The ufo was high in the sky, a golden light without any normal flashing plane lights.  It was moving faster than any planes, in which I've noticed a lot fewer in the last 3 weeks of the Corinavirus.  I asked my friend if he had his phone, n he said no but did see what I was looking at.  I went inside to get my phone n it was less than 30 seconds I returned it had already passed by. No planes ever flew over my area so I know that it wasn't on a normal flight plan.  I would estimate this to be a golden glowing orb approximately 3k' in the air.  No sound, n faster than normal planes.  We're located by a airforce/Airport of the famous Doolittle Raiders, n the Renounced Black airforce group.  So I've seen 5 here since 1998.  One I seen in 2010 over I-84 east bound I call the SILVER SURFER.  This caused cars n semi trucks to slow down on the highway from 60 mph to 50ish so they can see the approximate 100' long surf board shaped vessel with5a with a silver white tail/trail that extended approximately 200 yards. I watched it follow the highway east bound n disappear over the hill CALLED CABBAGE HILL, part of the the cascade mountain range. One last year or before as well.

The “shooting star” did not shoot, however was moving very fast.  I then noticed the immediately behind it was another “shooting star”, and then another.

The object was approximately 2 1/2 to 3 inches at arm's length.  She ran back in doors frightened as it passed over.  The sighting duration was approximately 2-3 minutes.

It was a long hexagon shaped object with 6 large lights and several smaller illuminations. The two lights at the end points of the object were red, while the four lights that made up the center of the object were white. In the inner surface of the object were what looked like a smaller ring of lights, but the were very dim. These lights on the object were different from what a normal aircraft lights look like. First off, they did not blink. Second, the appeared diffused like the light from a LED, not the bright bulb type lights that you would see on a airplane. While the object was at a fairly high altitude I was able to see the actual body of the object. It was definitely a solid mass, hexagon in shape. I couldn't make out anything on the surface but it appeared to be a dark grey or black. The total time I could see the object was about 4 minutes.

However, TV cameramen were unable to film them as they did on Monday. On December 22 cameramen from two local television channels filmed at least a dozen ""flying saucers"" in the sky south of the Costa Rican capital. Before the eyes of hundreds of people, they made zigzag maneuvers for several minutes. Flight controllers of the International Juan Santamaria Airport counted ""approximately fifty thousand traces"" of their movements. Some car drivers stopped to watch the phenomenon. According to Ufologist Carlos Vilchez, most remarkable is the fact that these UFOs appeared in daytime, that they were seen by hundreds of people and were filmed by TV cameramen. He also expressed the view that an influx of UFOs into the air space of this Central American country could be expected within the next two months. About ten ""saucers"" were watched by hundreds of people over San Jose exactly one month ago. They flew over the city for several minutes. They were also filmed by TV cameramen.

I have been searching all over the internet for information on ""cross-shaped"" UFOs. Sadly, my search has come up empty. I seriously hope you can help. I don't know where to report this or what resources to use. It was December 31, 1997, the time was between 9:05pm and 9:10pm. We were heading westward on  Rt22 Express De Diego and at the end of Avenida de Diego we witnessed a cross-shaped UFO (called an OVNI in PR). I noticed it initially and at first thought it a large jet at extremely low altitude. Unlike a jumbo jet, there was no engine noise and its position in the sky didn't change. It was hovering over what I could see in the dark was a large parking lot full of what appeared to be delivery vans. It was roughly cross-shaped with white lights at all 4 ends of the cross shape. These white lights were steady and did not blink. There appeared to be something in the center of the underside, however I cannot remember too much detail. My Fiancee said it was concave shaped in the middle, curving inwards. Also, off-center of the underside was a flashing red light, which at first led me to believe that it was a plane. If it was a plane, it was motionless. I considered it a helicopter, but it was twice as large as the building it was over. I've seen Sikorsky Skycrane helos before, and this wasn't one of them. Besides, the make a terrible racket in low hover. We had stopped our van, and all five of us watched in awe...not quite believing what it could be. I am the type who is open minded but still requires proof. We returned to the salida (exit) where we saw the OVNI (UFO) the following day. We then observed that there were powerlines where we saw the OVNI hovering. The industrial park where we witnessed the OVNI, there are many high-tension wires. Not being a UFO-ologist, I have a few questions: are UFOs commonly seen near powerlines? Why? I would like very much to ask an expert if this type of UFO (cross-shaped) is common. When I usually think of UFOs, I think a saucer-shaped type craft. This was the strangest thing I've ever seen, and the 4 other people present in the vehicle. All of the witnesses were college-educated and despite the date, New Year's eve, no one had been drinking. I would appreciate some resources to come forward and let me know where I may find (preferably on the web, otherwise in book-form) further information on this cross-shaped UFO, and if its type has ever been spotted before, whether in Puerto Rico or elsewhere. Thank you I am a database analyst for a ISP in Connecticut. While I've no objections to the release of my story, I do NOT want my name appended to the story. I have never seen anything like this and I'd rather not risk any harassment. I drew and scanned what we saw, that is everyone present in the vehicle agreed that the object I drew was what we saw. Unfortunately, this was left in a wor document in Puerto Rico with a relative. As soon as I receive the Word document I had scanned the image into, I will forward that onto you if you wish. Thank you",1998-03-07T00:00:00,,

Me and my exgf heard/ the &quot;Boom&quot; from the Reptile wars In December 2011, Three friends and I saw a handful of orange orbs in the distant sky to the left in the mountains of Willetts, CA.  They were moving around in the same area of each other, never breaking from the group.  We didn’t know what were seeing. We didn’t say UFO’s at first.  I said out loud, “Maybe their lights from a movie set in the woods?”  We sat on a boulder for approximately 30 minutes watching them. Eventually, were agreed we’re seeing something paranormal.  I’m a musician/videographer, and I record so much that I annoy my friends.  That night I was so mad that I left my camera in Long Beach, the first time I see something like this.  I thought, how convenient? I can’t believe if I talk about this, I have to answer, “Did you get proof” with “No I forgot my camera”.  I didn’t own a smartphone in 2011.  I can’t for anyone else. It wasn’t until 2014 I saw the same orange orbs on Youtube.  After that, there was no denying I saw astronauts from somewhere else. I got deep into researching and today my mind state is this. I know we are not alone. I don’t have a book or a bunch of social media posts trying to convert people into believers. I know how that conversation goes. Humans are so egocentric, if you tell them you experienced something they didn’t and were raised to ridicule it, they will not only ridicule it, they will also tell you that you didn’t see it. Or that you didn’t experience seeing a UFO. How egotistical is that? People who were not present, telling you what you did and did not experience. I’m from Vietnam. I was born in Saigon and found by the delta river when I was a couple days old in 1975 Nov. I’m just now learning about UFO’s in the Vietnam War. I had no idea that these events were happening. Knowing what I saw and know, there’s no doubt in my mind I believe it. A separate incident that is not UFO related, but paranormal, happened in 2017 at my studio in downtown LA. In 2016 I started watching videos on Youtube about the “Boom” explosion happening all over the planet. I read it’s some kind of war with the Reptilian race underground. Summer 2017, while hanging out with my ex-GF, we both heard and felt that, “Boom” underground shaking the whole building for a few seconds. There was no earthquake. No one said anything about it in the news or social media. I revisited those Youtube videos and I was in disbelief, that my tuition was right, yet completely at ease and enlightened, we experienced that same event. To this day, I am still astonished that there’s things in the sky, the ocean, the Cold, the underground, and the general public are angrily against the whole notion of something smarter, perhaps even better, exists. I get why. It’s like the government are The Monkeys, and they secretly discover The Doors, a way more advanced act that blows them out the water. In order for The Monkeys to make their fans still think they’re the best band there is, they cover up the discovery of The Doors. Because they know if the people find out about there’s someone more powerful, they will be seen as Top dog anymore. It’s another sign of egocentrics in the human character. There’s more out there that we do not know, than we do know, and we’ll most likely die that way.  Yet, we behave like we know everything there is to know and pretend we’re going to live forever.",2020-07-03T00:00:00,,
Multiple triangle shaped spacecraft seen buzzing from cloud to cloud on a full moon above the Tennessee River at the Shoals.,Sheffield,AL,2013-06-30T02:30:00,triangle,10 minutes,"Occurred : 6/30/2013 02:30  (Entered as : 06/30/2013 2:30) Reported: 7/2/2020 8:55:02 AM 08:55 Posted: 7/3/2020 Location: Sheffield, AL Shape: Triangle Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/157/S157262.html,"Multiple triangle shaped spacecraft seen buzzing from cloud to cloud on a full moon above the Tennessee River at the Shoals. At the time, I was living in an apartment on the Tennessee River, also known as Pickwick Lake at Sheffield, Alabama.  Unusually and out of routine, my three dogs, woke me up to go outside.  I had them trained to sleep through the night, so it was strange.  We left the apartment and went to the inner road and immediately I noticed how bright it was outside with smallish clouds suspended in the air above the river, their shapes perfectly defined against the black night because of the moon light. It was a spectacular view in and of itself.  But then I saw something even more spectacular, these small shapes were moving about behind the clouds going from one cloud to the next, seemingly secreting themselves behind the clouds, and they seemed so close, like around 1000 feet up.  There were multiple air crafts moving in a buzz like fashion, not like a typical airplane-like movement, straight with little variation.  These were moving like you see insects move, like bumble! bees, or flies. I had never seen any air craft in my lifetime move like that with lights on it, no less.  I stared at the scene for at least 10 or so minutes, completely aware that I was seeing something quite special and other-worldly.  It was one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen. I felt peaceful and not at all frightened.  The part of the river I lived on is considered a holy place to several Native American tribes that consider the river their 'mother', back before the Corps of Engineers changed it permanently with installing dams for hydro power.  Formerly, it was a place the umbilical cord from newborns were thrown as an honor to their 'mother'.  There is a famous story of a teenager forcibly taken on the Trails of Tears, and was miserable in Oklahoma, so she broke away and completely alone, walked back to the 'mother' or 'singing river' as it is also called, finally arriving five years later.  She married a Methodist Preacher and became known as a premier medicine woman for the region, touching many people's lives, with ! her exte nsive knowledge of plants and their healing and nutritious qualities.  The reason I mention this, is that the area the spacecraft were seen, is not some random stretch of the Tennessee river, it was a holy place for thousands of years before white man came and changed everything.  I appreciate being able to tell you this story. I was unaware of your organization until I read the story about Idaho having the most sightings of any state in the first quarter of 2020.  Everything I told you about the spacecraft sighting is 100% true and accurate.  Thank you.",2020-07-03T00:00:00,34.7566,-87.6963

One person headed to bed about an hour after it got dark while the other person and I remained awake for a little while, just looking at the dark sky (no campfire, dimmed camp lantern) and talking.  I don't recall exactly what time it was during the sighting but I assume it was sometime after 8pm.  We were facing south east from the coordinates (40°46'58.42""N, 119°30'58.67""W)  and saw a single orange light rise up from the horizon, unsure of the distance from it.  It maintained a steady vertical path until it got close to the moon.  I only mention it since the moon was a fixed point in the sky we used for reference.  Once it neared the moon, it started darting all over the place, up, down, diagonal, no apparent pattern or reason for movement.  It slowed at one point and alm! ost appeared to hover for ten seconds or so then continued the erratic movement.  Then it headed our direction in a straight line, no erratic movement.  Once it grew closer, we could hear something very faint, almost like a commercial airline at cruising altitude but it was nowhere that high.  I'd say it wasn't more than a couple thousand feet off the ground, if that.  It was not moving fast at all as it flew by us.  I'd guess that it was only a couple miles away from us but we couldn't see anything other than the one orange light.  It didn't pulse, get brighter, nothing, just solid the whole time.  We watched it for another couple of minutes until it disappeared over the northwest horizon.

At about 7:45pm my boyfriend and I left our home at ((address deleted)) Rd, Worcester, MA 01604 in our car to pick up dinner at Dinos Restaurant located on 13 Lord St, Worcester, MA, 01604.  As we drove to the restaurant we noted black smoke in the sky that was getting thicker and thicker as we drove our ordinary path to the restaurant.  While we were driving, we started seeing people run towards the smoke and take out their phones to get video…as we got to the red light on Hamilton St, Worcester, MA 01604 we were finally able to see the entire front of a car was engulfed in flames in a parking spot across the street.  Fire engines were just starting to arrive at the scene.  One firetruck came up Hamilton St, then the light at the intersection turned green and we proceeded a few hundred feet up the street (past the fire) and a second firetruck came driving towards the fire.  We continued to drive about a quarter of a mile on Plantation St when I saw what I thought was a white flare shoot up from the ground.  I expected to see it come back down with a burnout trail like most flares do.  I was wondering if it was even a firework.  I don’t know why the “flare” stood out to me at that moment but there was nothing else around it in the sky and it was in front of me over to the right a little (I’ll get exact directions and coordinates for you tomorrow), to the left of me was a large field used for baseball games and other city events (Holmes Field).  Its distance seemed like a few football fields away….as high as a plane could be. I then wondered if it was a plane because it hovered in the sky for a few seconds…then it turned red (looking like a red light) and flew in a circle formation parallel to the ground, stopped, and shot off increasing speed as it shot to the left, out of sight.  It appeared to accelerate to about 100 miles (or more) an hour, a! nd it disappeared behind the trees.  Me and my boyfriend looked at each other (this happened all while we were driving) and said “Woah, we just saw that!”  We were both simply in shock because this object moved unlike anything we had ever seen.  I have never seen a drone go that fast.  We finally reached our destination a mile up the road and purchased our dinner and went home.  I did not have any alcohol or drugs in my system, just blood pressure meds and an SSRI for anxiety.  On the way home I called my twin brother who is a rocket scientist and explained what I saw.  He said it could have been a firework.  My boyfriend also took the phone to explain in detail what we saw and my brother just talked to us a little longer and listened to us and we said goodbye.  I wrote about the sighting on facebook and another friend immediately wrote that his wife had just driven by the car in flames.  She wrote in a few minutes later that she saw the same thing we did (the flare/light) and she identified it as a drone heading in the direction of the fire.  However she didn’t see it do a circle formation and shoot off and disappear in the trees like we did, and she also only saw it as a white light (she didn’t see it turn red).  So I’m thinking we weren’t looking at the same object.  Both my boyfriend and I have seen drones in flight before and we have never seen a drone fly with this much power behind it…it was definitely being controlled somehow and not just r! andomly shooting off in the sky like a firework.  A few hours later another friend said her husband saw what we described the previous Wednesday in the same area.  She told me he also doesn’t believe it was a drone and had started doing research to find out what it could have been.  She found a news spot that the ISS was visible in the sky that evening.  But the space station does not move that fast in those directions.  One thing that stands out to me besides this sighting is the other woman who saw it (a friend of mine) and said it was a drone, visited me the day before on my birthday (July 31) at work and I hadn’t seen her in about a year.  I thought that was ironic.  About my background:  I’m 44 years old and I worked for 10 years as a broadcast journalist and 10 years in community relations.

(Note for investigators:  I'm submitting this for someone else, the contact info I gave is my own as I'm not sure if they'd be okay with me giving out theirs, however, I do have their permission to submit this here. I hope that isn't an issue). At approximately 9:20pm on Saturday, April 4th of 2020, my aunt and uncle were outside, back behind their out-of-town house.  After a few minutes, they noticed an orange, almost reddish light above the far treeline that they'd never seen before, and after observing it briefly my uncle pulled out his phone and began recording it (1). After watching it hover in place for a few minutes, they watched the object slowly move towards and subsequently disappear behind the treeline, before reappearing a few minutes later (about 10 minutes or so), this time in a slightly different spot.  My uncle pulled out his phone and began recording again, and then passed the phone to my aunt so he could use his binoculars to get a closer look at the object (2). My aunt, unfortunately, ends up losing sight of the object with the camera about 57 seconds in, and they head down the driveway in an attempt at getting a better view of it - but it ends up disappearing again. The third video picks up once it appears for the third time, and my uncle gets a good look at it through his binoculars.  He described it as a ball of orange light with a sort of yellow aura around it, and the light emanating from it seemed to be coming from the bottom of the object, and traveling up it.  The object made no noise (though there is a highway located a bit far in the opposite direction, and the noises you hear occasionally are from passing cars).  After watching the object sit still for about 3 minutes, it begins to move again (though hard to see as the camera is zoomed in, it happens at about 3:28), and then 12 seconds later at 3:40 in the video, it completely vanishes from the sky.  My uncle observes it as it does so, and says that in its place was what looked to be a black orb, with a sort of ""smoke"" around it. The object made no noise that they could hear, and this is the only time that they've seen anything like it there (they've been living in that area for some years).  I've been up there as well and haven't seen anything like it, either.

(2)  Second video:  Taken a few minutes later, after they watched it move in and out of sight and reappear.  Around the 57-second mark, my aunt accidentally moves the camera too much and lose s sight of the object for the remainder of the video. (3)  Third video: Taken once the object reappeared for the third time, and towards the end of the video you see it slowly fade out before disappearing.

It looked like fire, so I thought maybe it was the flame at the top of a refinery stack, but as I got closer, I realized the orb was hovering.  There weren’t any visible stars (due to smog and light pollution) so it had to be hanging low to be that visible. The light faded out momentarily, only to reappear 30 seconds later. It slowly moved towards the right side of the freeway, spending a good minute over the center of the freeway.  As I got closer, I could see it better; it appeared to have multiple lights (I could identify at least 2 or 3) that seemed to be stacked vertically (but not symmetrically). In the video I took on my iPhone, you can see the lights flicker, but can’t make out the shape beyond an orb.  Once it reached the right side of the freeway, about 5 minutes later, it was no longer flickering. Then, after about a minute, it U-turned, moving quickly from right to left and slightly upward, like a backwards Nike swoosh. As it did, the light began to turn off as iff on a dimmer, although once it was out, the dark object was still visible over the bright clouds as it flew away. As it did, a faint red light flashed in its trail, but it was hard to tell if it was from the object itself or something that the object emitted (I am leaning towards the latter).",2020-11-05T00:00:00,34.05638785714286,-117.91550821428571

I am a professional analyst and investigator with some law enforcement background and a lifelong interest in astronomy and space.  My wife grew up on Kauai and has had a variety of managerial and administrative positions.  My two children, daughter age 12 and son age 10 were also present.  The elevation at the location was approximately 1400'.  We had an unobstructed view of the sky from West-North-West to North-East.  We saw a bright light coming into view from the west, approximately 10 degrees above the horizon.  It was approximately 5 times brighter than the brightest visible star.  I thought at first it was an aircraft and we all were looking at it because of the brightness.  We then saw it exhibit some non-ballistic motion; it was speeding up and then rapidly slowing to a stop, sometimes abruptly jumping up or down 2 degrees from its base course, and jinking around as it proceeded generally eastward.  I had a pair of 10-22 x 50 binoculars (to see the comet) and was able to get the light in view.  It was jinking around enough that its motion, combined with the binocular motion, made it too blurry to see any shape.  When I was watching it magnified it started to pulse the brightness and change color; we saw the brightness vary by about 33% up and down, and the colors shift from white to red, blue green and purple in no particular order.  We tracked the object across our entire field of view, which took about 2 minutes.  We also saw one plane in the sky on a northward path (likely a Portland to Seattle flight) which made a stark contrast to the object as the plane had distinctly separate lights on the wingtips, did not change color, and was nowhere near as bright.  As the object was nearing the eastern limit of our view, my wife and daughter saw 4 more objects in a line that started changing color and brightening as the one object we were observing approached.  I was able to see 3 of the four from my location with the binoculars.  None of them were as bright - they were about the same brightness as the nearby starfield.  They did not move during the next 10 minutes.  They also displayed multiple colors, however only white, red and blue.  The brightness did not vary much.  Due to the lack of motion and different visibility profile, I could not personally confirm if they were other objects or distorted stars.  It is not possible to get a good estimate of distance on a light in the sky without reference points and knowledge of the object, but my best guess is given the brightness and comparing it to the plane we did see it was in the atmosphere at least 20 miles away.",2020-07-23T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

I called my neighbor over to look.  He also thought it was strange.  He grabbed his binoculars and several of us looked at the object with binoculars.  We all came to the same conclusion that this was some sort of saucer like craft.  The sun was shining off of it brightly but you could clearly see it had shapes and edges and something protruding from its bottom.  There is no doubt about it that it was a ship of some sort.  Whether it was alien I do not know.  We watched it for hours waiting for it to disappear but eventually we gave up.  We thought we could see it moving on it’s own slightly because it did change locations in the sky over time but it was not drifting like a ballon would.  It had its own cont! rol and was definitely in our atmosphere.  I did take pictures and video but without some enhancement it looks like a star to the naked eye.

I watch them almost every night, I basically know the planes patterns .  I’ve always admired the sky and wished I could know more!  Let me just say I KNOW WHAT I SAW!!  I saw what looked to be a flying/gliding star/object!  It flew northbound, right into this fast-moving cloud. NOW it could have been the clouds that made it look like the star was moving OR it could have been a satellite or space station. NO! I quickly pulled out my phone and opened my star map (which shows space stations and satellites).  It wasn't in our atmosphere!  Before I knew it, it was gone. My husband didn't see it.  I kept looking and saw another coming from the same direction but going downward then away from us, he didn't see that either!  Within 10 minutes I saw 3 more Unidentified flying objects all coming from the Jupiter/Saturn area headed northbound! FINALLY, my husband saw the last one!! I'M NOT CRAZY!  There is no way it was an airplane it did not have lights and was way too far out!  It was not a shooting star either, there was no trail and it made it to the other side of the sky until it was too far to see and all from the SAME direction? I don't think so!!  I could not believe it!!  I searched for 10 more minutes and didn't see anymore!  So, as I was going to go inside, I looked once more! I see ANOTHER UFO, but this time coming from where they disappeared, traveling straight towards Jupiter!!!  We followed it until Jupiter’s massive light engulfed it.  HOW CRAZY!!!!  There was no way I was going inside after that!! There had to be at least 4 more coming back!!

While watching sky waiting for our dog to finish, we noticed a UFO coming out of the east then turning north towards DFW.  The UFO was a bright reddish orange light, moving at the speed and approximate altitude of DFW air traffic, but curiously in the opposite direction as the south and outbound DFW traffic.  The UFO light was steady on, and color was not at all like typical aircraft aircraft (reddish orange instead of white, red, and green).  The light color did not change when the UFO changed direction to the north, which was odd because it was moving north and I should have seen a red light on that side which would have been typical of routine aircraft moving in that direction.  This was very odd since it would have posed collision risk! s, unless they were much much higher in altitude.  I lost sight of it when it went behind neighborhood trees.  Once it was gone, I noticed a second light that appeared the same, and behaved just like the first.  It was repeated like this at least 5-6 more times by UFO’s that appeared and behaved exactly the same, albeit completely different from typical aircraft and traffic flow.

I was setting up my telescope for astrophotography when a bright light appeared in the NNW beside the roof of a house but off in the distance.  It was well under 500 feet altitude and anywhere from a quarter mile to a mile away.  It was a very bright white light with an undulating mist cloud in front of it.  The light seemed to be saucer shaped but it was hard to see with the undulating cloud in front of it. I scrambled to set my phone up to take a video and when I looked up the bright light was now a tiny white circular dot light and the undulating cloud was now a perfect sphere around the white light which slowly changed into more of a donut shape darker in the center but still spherical looking from my angle.  This cloud was also about 1 1/2 times larger than the initial cloud around the bright light. It was slowly traveling south at the same speed the entire time. Even the cloud kept moving south. After about five or so seconds the tiny dot light disappeared and I was just a cloud moving south and it went behind trees out of sight and didn’t emerge out the other side. I reported this to MUFON that night and respect this organization as well and wanted to report it here also since there were numerous people within a 250km radius that saw the exact same thing.,2020-09-04T00:00:00,,

The moon was starting to peek through the trees from the south,  and I gazed up at the stars, noticing that it was a clear night.  I looked north north-east and saw a fuzzy point above the trees and initially thought it was a small plane, but there was no sound, and no blinking lights. I watched it slowly move south, and as it moved it appeared to develop halos - at first they appeared to be moving in a very slight counter-clockwise rotation.  Never complete, but fading imperceptibly so as to never show a full spiral halo.  It was at this point that I tried to grab a photo using my cell phone, knowing that it would likely not turn out. I grabbed 2 shots. I found it odd that the halo was building and that it was still moving south without noise or distinct airplane lights.  I ran to tell my husband and a friend of his who were already outside on our deck.  They both looked out and by this time it had grown even more.  We ran down the steps to get a better vantage point. I had grabbed my DSLR (Nikon D200) with my Nikkor AF-S 70-300 mm lens to see if I could get some long exposure images on the fly.  As soon as we were in the driveway I tried a long exposure shot.  Moved to what I thought was a more stable place and grabbed a second shot.  The third was the last attempt as by this time it had begun to move behind the tree line.  Of these three long exposure shots the first turned out the best.  The halo had grown quite a bit from start to finish.  When it started it was a small, white/yellow fuzzy spot, before it went out of view it had a fuzzy center and a few vertical mostly-complete halos .

Aug.30,2020 was outside talking to a family member on the phone in the south end of Oshawa, Ontario, where I live and is within 5 min. walk to Lake Ontario. My neighborhood is in a direct line for small aircraft traveling from W. to E. with low altitudes between 3,000ft-12,000ft.  E. to W. corridor for small craft fly a few km's to the North of City.  Commercial flights use same corridors but at altitudes of 20,000ft - 35,000ft.  (Occasional Police & Search/Rescue Heli's w/ powerful searchlights can be seen flying low near Lake Ontario's coast in all directions) Weather on this night is clear with a near full-moon coming around from the East and no clouds visible in the West over the Lake at that time. I noticed what appeared to be the usual small aircraft traffic coming from W.-E. A small plane at approx. 3,500ft-5,000ft. with standard flashing night-time lights. I then spotted another craft flying in the same direction roughly 1,000ft to the north and approx. 500ft-1,000ft lower than the first and did not appear to be in dangerous proximity to each other although unusually close in my experiences watching planes. Also, I took notice of the first craft maneuvering away in a lazy South-East direction to put some more distance between them which also told me that the pilot had most probably seen it and took avoidance measures. I could not identify what kind of craft the second lower flying one was. It was over Lake Ontario, traveling West to East and flew about as fast as the other at first but its speed varied at times, slowing or speeding up but also making altitude adjustments, up and/or down with no rhyme or reason. It was circular in shape, like a very large orb.  I couldn't be sure of its size due to not having a reference such as clouds for scale, but seeing the other craft taking proximity avoidance maneuvers and comparing both, I would estimate that it was at least the same size or 50% larger than what may have been a Cessna. I ruled out a drone due to its size and speed. The strange thing about this unknown craft was its color and what it was doing.  It was as bright as a flood-light but a deep, deep red. It pulsated in brightness with almost translucent properties.  I immediately thought of those 'Chinese Lanterns' but also ruled them out when I realized that the pulses of red light had a specific frequency and did not 'flicker.' The pulsating 'Orb' went from really, really bright, would dim a bit then pulsate brightly again and again.  This happened for almost 3 t0 5 minutes while I watched completely gobsmacked. I even hung up on my sister to go get my binoculars in the house. It was still there when I came back out but was not able to focus on it before it pulsed a few last times then suddenly just stopped and disappeared. I searched all over that area with my binoculars under clear skies and a near-full moon. Did not see it again but it bothered me enough to google this web page and report what I had seen.

The light seemed very high up, and seemed similar to a satellite, except for the fact that it was slowly pulsating . The light would dim to almost nothing and then grow bright again about every two seconds.  It also seemed to be traveling in a slight arc rather than a straight line. I know it could not have been a satellite because they only brighten a dim depending on their reflection of the sun beneath our horizon.  This object was self illuminated.  It had no flashing lights.  It only appeared as an orange pulsating light . I followed the light with my eyes until it was no longer visible. A few minutes later I saw an object that probably was a satellite. It was white in color, traveling in the same direction and did not pulsate. It seemed to disappear from sight as it flew into the earths shadow. I was born and raised in San Diego very close to the San Diego airport. I am familiar with commercial air traffic. I also lived close to Miramar air base for a long time and am familiar with military air traffic. This object was neither of these.

Early this morning on june 23, 2020 around 2-3 am my wife and I were at the wells hot springs. (12 mile hot springs outside of wells)  While watching the sky, she pointed out some lights and asked if they were moving.  They were. We watched with another group of people, 6 of us in total, as bright white dots of light would appear then continue in a south/southwest direction before disappearing behind the mountain.  In the front were four lights in a straight line followed by two pairs of lights running parallel making a square.  Their distance and speed was constant.  Behind those 4 lights was a continuous string of individual lights that would appear from nowhere then move with the rest of the formation, all in what appeared to be a perfect straight line while maintaining a precise and steady distance from the one in front of it. Side notes to point out. The space within the ""square"" of the 4 lights was not blacked out as if an object were blocking the view of the stars behind it. Also, as the individual lights ""appeared"", we observed that they seemed to show up already moving in a south/southwest direction but would slow down to the pace of the other lights in front. All of the lights that were seen, appeared in the sky at the same spot. We know this because we were using the mountain as a point of reference. Throughout the night, my wife had thought she had seen stars ""disappear"" but did not mention it until I had said something to her about seeing the same thing. I was looking at a particularly twinkling star when it suddenly was no longer visible. I saw no light from it at all. This next part I'm hoping can be addressed by someone more knowledgeable with astronomy. As we were leaving, we realized one last thing that weirded us out. We noticed the big dipper looked freakishly huge. As if the whole constellation was suddenly maybe half the distance away. I'm not a conspiracy theorist by any means, but after talking with my wife and the other people who witnessed these events, I cannot come up with any sensible explanation. I'm typing this in a word document, and am not sure if I'll have an opportunity to provide contact info, but hope I can. I would really appreciate someone to get ahold of me and share their opinions. My wife was on google trying to see if anyone else had seen this phenomenon and said something but did not find anything at that point. (Between 4 and almost 6 am Pacific time.) She did however find that an almost an exact event happened in the early hours (dark skies) of November 10th, 2019. The lights observed on that morning were also moving in a southwest direction and also appeared a few seconds apart. If someone could get me into contact with the person who made that report, it would be oh so much appreciated. Backgrounds: myself, 27. Construction worker/mechanic and a traveller. My wife, 25.

The skies were partly cloudy, quite dark, with wind blowing from south to north, about 5 mph. I could hear military aircraft well above my home, and to the south, which are usually F-22’s or F-23’s from Eglin AFB practicing aerial combat. Since they had their nav lights off, they could not be picked out (about ten minutes later they could be observed when they did turn on anti-collision lights). I also observed a passenger aircraft fly to the west way past  Hurlburt Field flying from south to north, and either a U-28 or PC-12 recon aircraft circling near Hurlburt. I then caught some movement in the sky to my left, and observed a low flying (several thousand feet altitude), bat wing shaped object travelling from west to east, almost directly overhead, around 70 degrees high to the north, almost overhead, and about the size of a fingernail when the arm is held out. It was a light tan color, which at first I presumed to be a falcon or owl. However the speed was too fast, covering a good arc of the sky straight and level from nearly 20 degrees off the horizon from west to east in four to five seconds (there were no wings flapping, and it was too high for an owl, which are usually in the trees at night, and I haven’t heard any for over a year). The shape of the object was crescent shaped, almost bat like, and from my angle almost like the silhouette of a B-2 but with a very round nose and rounded wings (much like the craft drawn by Lockheed engineer Clarence Kelly on 16 December 1953). There was no glow, and no apparent appendages such a! s an exhaust as one would see in current drone production.

One fades away and other two fly playful formation An unusual light in the sky drew my attention so I continued to watch it for 15-20 seconds (noting that it did not seem to have any blinking lights that conventional aircraft are required to have by law ). Craft was on a south to north heading and by the feel of the motion and brightness of the object, It seemed to be quite high in altitude.  Which struck me as odd because it was moving across the sky at a faster pace then any jets that I commonly see in the day/night sky.  The craft would also do these very smooth and consistent horizontal sweeps as it flew. Back and forth from left to right and back again.  Almost playful really... Suddenly the craft turned a very bright light downward towards the ground.  Seemed as bright as fog lights on a jetliner, but no jetliner i know of has their foglights mounted on such a swivel as to be able to point from the front of the craft to the bottom. Shortly after the light was shone downward, the craft quickly faded in brightness until I lost sight of it.  It either blinked out of existence or simply turned all the crafts lights off.  Hard to tell really. My attention was immediately diverted to another two craft, identical to the first, not very far away in the evening sky.  These two craft were very interesting.  Upon first glance of the two craft, I could immediately tell that one craft was travelling at much higher speed ( again , north to south heading ) than its counterpart.  The thing is though... the slower of these two craft was still traversing the night sky faster then any plane or jet that commonly fly these skies. As they came directly overhead ( at similar high altitude of first craft ) the two craft were weaving left and right in graceful sweeping arcs.  With the speed and fluid grace they displayed, it again felt as if they were playing.  Almost similar to how two small birds may interact with each other mid-flight. As the two craft continued travelling northbound, I was suprised to see the craft in 2nd place gaining, and eventually overtaking the craft that was previosuly winning what i then considered to be a playful race between the two lights.  The two craft flew far enough for me to lose sight of them about 25-40 seconds after first seeing them. I am no ufo enthusiast nor conspiracy theorist. I dont believe in farfetched ideas about aliens and their possible agendas.  I am simply a man who has seen something highly unusual and suspicious in the sky.  Was it aliens?  Who's to say.  But I can say the lights showed no conventional signs of normalcy for aircraft.  From the speed and maneuverability, to the nature of their flightpath.

First I noticed a strange shaped, lit object brighter than any of the stars in the clear night sky. There were no clouds and the stars were not as bright as they are on some nights. While looking at Orion's 3 stars in the belt, one of the objects was twinkling And looked like a stick with a light on top, with 2 or more lights down below the stick shaped object- like a tripod with 2 legs. It was way below orion, in almost the same direction as the belt in said constellation. It looked like possibly red or blue or white colored lights. This didn't appear to move, but twinkled. The 2nd more dimmer object was to the left of Orion. It was to the right & lower than the moon and appeared higher up in the sky because it looked smaller and less bright as the first one that I noticed. I did see 1 or 2 airplanes in the sky around my house but they were further away, and tiny compared to these other 2 bright objects. Finally while looking around by the 1st object, fairly closer to me, and not so far above the treeline, I saw the brightest and biggest of that same shape moving. It was moving slowly in a straight line above the tree lines, to the right of Orion, and much farther below that plus the 2 other ones . Travelling from left to right at a slow but straight pace. This definitely looked like this same tripod shape stick with 3 or 4 lights. The lights did not blink but stayed on while it was moving in a Westerly direction. But then I saw that a plane was coming towards it, but was still far away & tinier than this object, Both were flying in the same direction when this bright tripod shaped object turned off its lights. I didn't see any clouds in the sky for this object to get hidden. And I imagined it To be located over on the next block from my house. I stayed outside for a little while, but the bigger, lowest and brightest object did not reappear after this. It looked like the other 2 objects we're still in their same locations as when first noticed by me. After this I came in the house to look up 'how to report unusual sightings' and telephoned this number *82-1-206-722-3000 at 11;46pm. I stated exactly what I saw to a man who answered the phone. He believed I was seeing the star sirius . And asked if I took any pictures, which I did not. After doing all this, I got dressed again to take my cellphone back outside in 28 degrees. The first object was still visible but looked lower. The very bright one that was closer to the ground was not spotted anywhere or oin any direction. And it might have looked that the dimmer object was either farther up in the sky and not as visible like before. I stayed outside for another 20 minutes searching the sky in all directions, However this time I did take some pictures of that first one I did notice, which was still able to be seen with the naked eye. I don't think it was the star sirius. Because I researched some charts and photos online when I came inside. All three objects looked like a pole or distinctive stick with a bright light on the very top of it. Then below the stick there were more lights ,possibly 2 to 3 lights of a different color . I checked the box below that the item changed color. It just went off, or went blank and disappeared in a split second. Sorry but I don't know how to upload my photos.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,,

(West Los Angeles).  I also reported the incident to MUFON (Case # 109330) hoping they reach out to me but they still haven’t. On June 7, 2020 (Sunday) from 11:20 AM - 11:25 A.M., I was working a security detail in Brentwood which is considered West Los Angeles near Santa Monica beach.  This particular day was beautiful, there were no clouds, it was warm/bright (74°), and it was windy with a wind gust of 8.1 mph (per the weather map).  My attention was drawn to what I thought at the time was a chrome helium balloon.  I didn't think much of it because it's normal to see neighborhood children or people at the beach releasing balloons, but this one captured my attention. While staring at the object for several seconds, I kept asking myself why wasn't the balloon flying away in the direction of the wind and why was the object hovering over residential homes for several seconds.  Then for a quick second, I thought maybe someone decided to tie this balloon to a very long string and let it loose, well I was wrong. As I kept looking at the object, my analytical mind went on overload and that's when I realized, I wasn't looking at a balloon, a plane, a helicopter, a blimp, or even a drone.  The object I was looking at was white or chrome and it was in the shape of a round sphere.  The object kept hovering up & down in a very fast manner.  At times the object will move from side-to-side and on a few occasions, the object will hover downward and disappear showing a circular flashing light then it will reappear in a different location.  During the movements, the object appeared to be slowly rotating while it produced a glowing brilliant light.  While the object continued moving, I saw it morphed into two round spheres.  Both objects were connected and glowing.  It almost looked like a dome but I wasn't sure.  The objects were producing what I call a strobing light as it appeared in and out of the camera frame.  As the object hovered, it turned into what I call a ""donut"" shape.  It had a black circle in the middle of the strobing object while it hovered towards Santa Monica beach.  I lost the object for several seconds allowing me the opportunity to retrieve a pair of binoculars from my car.  It took me seconds to find the object, but when I did, it was a spectacular sight the object was rotating counter-clockwise as it produces a brilliant chrome light, that's when I saw the second sphere (or dome) that was connected.  I eventually lost the object as it traveled west towards the beach.   To remove any doubts, this object was not a plane, helicopter, blimp, or a drone. These mentioned items make some type of noise, the sphere never made any noise and hovered in the direction towards the wind. I’m a retired Law Enforcement officer with over 20 yrs. of patrol and investigation experience.  As a lawman, you are trained to see, hear, and find rational explanations of what’s occurring.  You also develop a “7 sense” that many people will never have.  In my career, I have seen my share of strange, unusual, and unexplained things but this time it's beyond my explanation. For reference, I recorded the object on my Samsung Note 8 cellular phone.  I recorded the object three times and I took several still images.  On some of the images, I added a dark background showing unusual things within the flashing pictures. Thank you,",2020-07-09T00:00:00,34.0464,-118.4481

This in a summery of an event, of a unexplained flying object encounter on a flight between Anchorage and Hong Kong.  I was flying as a relief pilot sitting in the captains seat on a commercial cargo flight when I first spotted the object.  I immediately pointed the object out to the first officer who also saw it.  The Captain was in the back on his rest period. The location of the event was on an airway, R220, between NOGAL & NIPPI intersection, 21.4NM NE of NOGAL at FL400.  The coordinates were N4632.8/W15332.6. The closest land was 67.7NM off our right.  This land would be the Kuril Islands SW of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia.  The only other know air traffic were two other aircraft that were on our TCAS.  They were on our route same direction of travel within 60NM ahead of us. It was daylight as the time was 1346 local (0346 Zulu). There was a low undercast layer of clouds, some towering clouds 100+ miles in the distance, but clear at our altitude. Our ground speed was 408 knots, true airspeed 476 knots, MACH # .830, wind 252/73 and total air temperature -20 something.  Our magnetic heading was 238°   While I was sitting looking at the first officer in conversation, I noticed a bubble like object off the right side of the aircraft.  I immediately pointed it out to the first officer.  He quickly grabbed his phone and tried to take several pictures of it.  Unfortunately due to bugs or dirt on the side windows, the camera focused in on the window instead of the unexplained object. The object looked like a clear sphere or bubble.  It appears to be rigged like glass or plastic, however I can’t rule out a balloon.  The size is relative to the distance it was from our aircraft.  This is where the first officer and I have a difference in opinion. In the window, it was the size of pencil eraser.  I felt that the object was within a couple of hundred yards and was maybe the size of a car.  The first officer felt that it might have been more like a couple of miles away and therefore much larger.  The strangest thing about this object was that we didn’t speed past it.  We did overtake this object but slowly.  We were moving over the ground at 408 knots into a nearly 70 knot headwind.  If the object was a balloon, I feel we would’ve blown past it very fast.  So what ever this object was, it seems it was propelled by something.  There was no visible engines, exhaust or any thing else that resemble a know aircraft capable of traveling at such speed.   Needless to say, this consumer or conversation for the next several hours. When the captain returned to the flight deck, we explained our siting and continued to discuss what it could have possibly been.  The Captain was a previous F-18 pilot and both the first officer and I were civilian pilots.",2020-07-09T00:00:00,33.68843322932917,-118.00499422776912

There is some difference of opinion, but the aura may have been brighter and wider on the short ends.

The sun had just went down and the sky was clear with just a few wispy clouds.  It was still light out, dusk.  My toddler son and I were looking at the full moon and for birds in the trees when I saw it.  I had never seen a UFO or other sky phenomena before but I knew this was not a plane or star.  I immediately sensed it was abnormal.  Abnormal because of its brightness, size and type of light it emitted.  I immediately grabbed my binoculars and watched it for the next 45 mins into total darkness. Within a few mins of watching it I also noticed Venus began to show up in the sky just a few degrees away (about the same height), so I had that to compare it to.  The whole time I was observing the object it moved slowly away from venus toward Orion, specifically the belt. It was moving toward orion as Orion was ""moving"" toward the object.  I observed this by standing in the same spot.  No fast movements were ever observed.  Desciption of the object: Size - When I first saw it the object was maybe the size of a golf ball (from my POV) if someone was like 10ft away and threw it up in the air. I had the sense that it was an object that was very high in the air and a good distance away. I never felt like it was ""close"". As the time went on it  got smaller and seemed like the shape flattened out.  Shape - When I viewed the object with binoculars it appeared spherical. Little doubt in my mind that it was not ball or sphere shaped. The shape became flattened or distorted as it moved away and got smaller.  Light and Color - When I observed it at first with the naked eye, it had the familiar light color of a welders ""spark, flame"" (whatever its called) but did not hurt my eyes. Kind of a hot electric blue-white light. When I viewed through binoculars it was almost like it had a prism of colors in it like it was one color. It had an outline but was kind of undefined. It was like an ""electric bubble"". Really the best way to describe is ""a perfect ball of energy"". It got dimmer as time went on.  Other observations: before I grabbed my binoculars I noticed for a second that it appeared to emit a greenish light, almost like a flame, on the top then on the side. That only lasted for a second. This initially made me think maybe it was a green light from a plane but of course it wasnt after further observation and behavior and seeing it through binoculars.  Like I said I noticed venus nearby shortly after seeing the object. The object was much larger, much brighter than Venus.  When I looked at Venus with binoculars or any other larger star later on, they kind of just look like a ""pin prick"". When I looked at this object with the binoculars, I knew I was looking at a three dimensional object.  Of course this was at the time when Venus was the only thing observable other than the moon. I actually pulled up my SkyMap app to confirm and there are no stars that it could have been.  I cannot stress enough how the object was a perfect sphere when observed through binoculars.  This was not something I saw for 5 seconds and said UFO! I observed this for close to an hour straight. An entire dialogue played through my head trying to figure out what it was or at least disprove it being a ufo.  I'm just a layman but theres no way it was a manmade object and I find it hard to believe it was some natural atmospheric phenomena based on how long it lasted. I really want to know what it was if it was in fact something like that. First time in my life Ive seen something I cant explain.",2020-04-09T00:00:00,,

Curry road almost directy runs into Sky Harbor International Airport before curving around and becoming Washington Street which runs into Phoenix.  As I was driving, my girlfriend in the passenger seat said, ""Hey what is that?"" and pointed at 6 glowing lights that were orange/amber in color that looked like inbound aircraft.  Except instead of moving in for what looked like an approach to land, they simply hovered in a pattern. I couldn't determine if they were directly over the airport, due to the fact I was still several miles east of Sky Harbor, or if they were beyond the airport itself. I thought they might have been signal flares, since there is a large Air Force base in the west valley, but it seemed highly unusual that would happen.  They also did not behave like signal flares as they did not drop in altitutde and maintained their movements in! a pattern together.  As I turned left on Mill Avenue, now going southbound, my girlfriend and I both saw that their lights were disappearing.  It seemed like they were moving northwest and gaining in altitude before the light would disappear.  I crossed the Mill Avenue bridge and turned going westbound onto Rio Salado Parkway to try to keep a visual on them.  I stopped my car and pulled over just before Hardy Drive on the north side of Rio Salado Parkway and saw only one of them left.  From what I could tell it was some kind of aircraft, but it seemed to be traveling eastbound at a high rate of speed, before it would slow down to almost a hover, then would speed along some more.  Then it seemed to abruptly change directions and head northwest gaining altitude before the light completely disappeared from view.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,33.414035671514114,-111.92091958939265

I kept seeing a light flashing outside the window. It looked as if someone was outside checking stuff out and every once in a while I would get a beam of light almost directly on my window. So I started to shine my cell phone flashlight out the window, basically telling whoever it is that I’m aware they are outside. After doing this off and on for about 5-10 minutes, it stopped but seemed awfully bright outside for a foggy september night. So I opened the curtain and this mechanical figure flew down from the corner edge if the roof and turned to expose itself to me. Before it got one to my window, the big chicken that I am, I closed the window. The next day I had asked my friend if there was a light outside that building that I was unaware of, I knew there wasn’t, but I had to be sure. They confirmed there was not. I thought nothing of it. I though it was the neighbors messaging around, so I didn’t think anything of it. About 3 or 4 days go by and by this time Im sleeping in the main house, again I’m a chicken, with my exboyfriend/current boyfriend. I didn’t want anyone to mess with me or my child, so I slept where I’ve always felt safe. Anyways, I’m laying in bed, its probably 1:30 and I see this light outside, almost a flashlight, but it was too high, too bright and moved smoothly. I’d assumed it was a drone. It was checking out my friends property. So I stare at it, suddenly my vision becomes distorted and everything is black. I wake up my boyfriend and he sees nothing, ofcourse. A week goes by and I see this thing everynight and from what I can tell, it does the same thing every night, but I think it has a “watcher"" drone or thing. I say this for many reasons, one mainly because whenever I would try to show someone this thing, the light outside shuts of instantly. Either it is telepathic or someone is very close paying attention being a distraction maybe. We put up game cams and al! l 3 cameras stop recording video between the times this thing is here. It doesn’t show anyone shut it off at all. Maybe it has a camera distortion deal. There is so much more detail that I really do not have time to explain. This is the jist of it. Idk if its government or alien. But whatever it is, its very very intelligent. To be completely honest, it hasn’t hurt anyone or anything, it hasn’t stolen anything. Everyone is this house is nothing big enough for any government to want anything to do with or investigate. The property is beautiful, but that’s not a reason to sneak and hide in the middle of the night. I’m scared for my life and my family and for our home. I’m a little tech savvy, but I don’t have the equipment or funding to do any further investigating. This thing has stumped us and our only form of security.",2020-11-05T00:00:00,,

We are aware of the Perseids meteor shower so we were keeping an eye out but not expecting to see much yet, especially with the city glow.  We saw a couple of satellites heading from south to north and were surprised at how much we had already seen while waiting. At about 10:13 a flashing bright light starting soaring across the sky. We were sure that it was the space station. It was flashing red and blue. We all followed it, passing around the 2 pairs of binoculars we had and watched it soar about as fast as a satellite. Maybe a little bit faster. Then it stopped. We thought at first that it was still heading away from us so we were seeing it go into the distance. Then one of us was looking towards the West and saw the actual Space Station. There was no arguing that the second object was the actual Space Station, it was zooming by pretty fast and the brightest thing we had seen yet. What I noticed was that it passed right by the object that was flashing red and blue staying  still in the sky still flashing, and kept going off into the distance over the horizon. We stayed out watching other satellites, tried to find the positions of the planets and get one more peek at the Comet. We were still were able to see the flashing red and blue whatever-it-was hanging out. When we went inside it was still there.

I was looking for falling stars, and would NOT have even seen or noticed it at all but that it flew over the trees where I was looking, and it obviously blocked out the sky behind it.  There was NO sound—it was eerily quiet, in fact.  And it didn’t seem like it was in a big hurry, just steadily going by, and it disappeared from my view when it passed over another bunch of trees on the other side of my house. What struck me the most was how stealthy it was.  No lights at all.  No sound.  Just a solid, dark shape blocking out the sky behind it.  I couldn’t help but realize that this object would not be seen at all by most people, even if it was right over their heads—you just very likely would not notice it at all unless you were specifically looking where it was flying.  I woke up my husband immediately, and we sat outside for another hour or so, but didn’t see anything else (although we did see several falling stars).  After I went back inside I began looking up known stealth-type aircraft from our government for comparative purposes, and what I found online was not remotely close to what I saw, and the videos I saw showed aircraft that made noise.

Disk-Shaped Object hovers at high distance for 12 minutes.,Rio Medina,TX,2020-07-21T12:18:00,disk,12 minutes,"Occurred : 7/21/2020 12:18  (Entered as : 07212020 12:18) Reported: 7/21/2020 1:22:07 PM 13:22 Posted: 7/23/2020 Location: Rio Medina, TX Shape: Disk Duration:12 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/157/S157788.html,"Disk-Shaped Object hovers at high distance for 12 minutes. Location: Rio Medina, Texas Date: 21 July 2020 Time: 12:18pm to 12:30pm  Today, my wife and I were in our backyard. Our backyard faces to the SSE. To our right, would be westward and so forth.  At approximately 12:18pm, while facing Southward, I happened to look straight upwards and slightly to the South and noticed one (1) object in the sky. This object seemed perfectly rounded and cylindrical with a dull silver appearance. The object itself was very high in the atmosphere. Judging height distance, I would say approximately 45,000ft or higher. Adjacent to this area is a small airport and an Air Force training aircraft was seen flying Eastward near the object but at a much lower altitude. I would estimate the USAF training aircraft to have flown below the object at approximately 20,000 to 30,000ft. I am very familiar with spotting aircraft, orbiting objects, and weather. My wife and I initially thought it was a balloon of some sort.  This was quickly thrown aside as the object did not move in any direction during our observational period of 12 minutes.  If it were a balloon, winds would eventually have directed some lateral movement.  This never happened. This object remained in the same location the entire time.  Looking in the sky, clouds began to intermittingly cover the object, then reveal itself as the clouds moved along.  This was not an aircraft. Aircraft that are capable of suspending themselves at high altitudes do not resemble a small round silver dot.  It was not a bird. I have seen Vultures and many bird species fly at very high elevations here in this area. At the distance this object was it would have not been capable of being a drone. Frequency distance would cause communication distortion and drone failure. I spent many years in the Air Force around multiple aircraft and Nuclear Weapons.  To better understand how small the object was you would have to imagine looking in the sky and seeing the size of a pencil eraser head at a distance of 30 to 40ft. It was not large by any means at the distance observed. When the USAF training aircraft crossed under the object heading Eastward, I used that moment for size and distance reference. The object was still significantly smaller and higher than the aircraft. This object was difficult to see as I had to assist my wife in finding it numerous times over again. We both were able to see the object several times when clouds were not obstructing our views.  I immediately grabbed my camera and waited for the object to reappear from the clouds. I was able to see the object with my eyes so the last three pictures I took had the object in them. When I processed the last three images I was not able to see anything. For clarification, I took several photos of the same area when I was unable to see it momentarily. I wanted to capture something. The last three pictures I took, I could see the object with my own eyes. But when I processed the images I was not able to see much. I believe I may have found the object by manipulating background colors. But for the most part you cannot see anything in any of the photos I took. Perhaps it was just too far away. Either way, I took the pictures in attempt to capture the object.  Since this happened I have made numerous additional attempts to view this with the naked-eye again with no success. I additionally reached out to a NASA friend to ask the following question,  “Are we able to see planets, stars or celestial objects with the naked-eye in the middle of the day?”  His response: “No, not with the naked eye, you would need to know exactly where an object was and it could be viewed through a Telescope during daylight times.”  I would like to mention that I have absolutely no reason to lie or make this up. This is 100% true to the best of my and my wife’s knowledge.  If you have any additional questions please feel free to reach out. Thank you for your time.",2020-07-23T00:00:00,,

The female observer responded, ""yea I think it is"" and I and my friend were easily able to make out the object they were looking at right away -- it was hard to miss, even in the night sky.  It was a gray oval/circle that did not appear illuminated such that a star, planet or terrestrial aircraft would be (or what I'd imagine a UFO would be) and it was stationary.  It also did not appear that high up, almost as if you could reach out and pluck it from the sky.  We wondered whether it was a balloon or a drone, but it did not move in a way that would suggest that and both observers we encountered confirmed it has been stationary for about ten minutes and they stayed looking at it wond! ering if it would move.  The object appeared solid, almost as if it could be made of dark grey metal.  To my observation it seemed to ""wobble"" somewhat as if ever so slightly hovering, but gave the impression of being stationary.  It was clear sky with no clouds and there were a few stars that could be made out to give a basis of comparison.  We stayed for about five minutes staring until my friend became spooked and we then walked around the corner to my apartment.

Just as quickly as the lights appeared they disappeared just as the first two had. This is where things really got interesting.  After about 10 minutes we noticed a line of white lights appear and they continued to move north towards our location.  As the line of white lights approached it was determined that this line of white lights was a group of around 10-15 military jets.  While closing in on the location of the first witnessed orange lights the jets proceeded to scatter and start what could only be described as a search flight pattern.  After roughly 15 minutes of the search flight pattern the jets reformed into a line and departed south back from the direction that they appeared from. Finally once the military jets were no longer in sight another craft(s) appeared but much closer to our location.

The internal glow seemed to have a plasma effect. My dog even began barking when he saw the object and you can hear him in the video. His barking alerted my wife who opened the front door. I pointed the object out to her and she then alerted my father in law who also saw the orb. I am a veteran law enforcement official.

At approximately 830pm, my husband and I were walking our dog in the dark. We live in a very rural location with woods all around, no city or town in sight with only a couple neighbors. It was dark but we were not using a flashlight as the moon was out enough to light our way faintly. It was overcast, but not raining/snowing. At almost the same time, my husband and I saw an illuminating, circular (disk) light coming from an area above the woods, which appeared like it was shining down through the clouds, rather than from the ground up. We both pointed and acknowledged it to each other when, all of a sudden, the light moved literally at warp speed to the left and vanished. Then almost immediately, it reappeared in the same spot that we had just seen it. It hovered for a few seconds then darted to the right (again at a VERY high rate of speed). Once again, it reappeared in the same spot. We both never saw the light coming back to the spot, it would just reappear. It made a final dart to the left and disappeared, not to return. We stood there in awe for a minute or two waiting for it to come back, which it didn't. We turned around and headed back home (that was enough excitement for us!). We walked about a 1/4 mile or so back to our house and before we turned into our driveway, the light reappeared from our right, made a sharp turn and went in a straight line from in front of us, then over our heads, and behind us...and disappeared. Again, we were in awe and stayed out in our field (in the complete darkness, no neighbors in site, no towns, no cities, etc) and waited for over about 15 minutes. It once again reappeared in the night sky, hovered, and took off. That was the last of it we saw. We did not hear any noise from an airplane or helicopter and the speed at which this object was traveling was absolutely astonishing - it would go from one side of the horizon to the other in a fraction of a second. There is nothing that we can think of that has the ability to go that fast (airplane, helicopter, drone, etc). We thought perhaps it was a deer hunter with a very high powered spot light shining it into the sky; however, the light appeared to be shining down from the clouds rather than up and we assumed that if it was a spotlight, we would see some sort of ""beam"" of light illuminating the woods/tree line and extending into the night sky, which we did not witness. The entire surroundings and night sky was very dark, just this light illuminating in one spot in the sky, coming from the clouds. Also, if it was a hunter with a spot light, the manner in which the light presented itself didn't seem ""human-like"", if it was a hunter ""playing"" with his spot light we would think it would of been more human-like behavior with the light waving back and forth, etc. and what we witnessed was split second speeds, hovering then darting off, reappearing without any light coming back to that same spot, etc. There very well could be a good explanation of what we saw; however, witnessing it first hand, it just didn't seem like anything we could explain away (airplane, Chinese lantern, helicopter, drone, etc).

It moved slow and steady.  I thought it was a satellite. I then noticed another small Orb following the 1st Orb, slow and steady. The first Orb then changed course and moved towards the South and disappeared (or went up real fast) at the tail end of Orion. The next one followed the first and disappeared. I then noticed another Orb following the 2nd Orb, and so on and so on, when the count got up to 10, I ran into the house and got my Husband.  We lost track of how many we observed and watched until about 5:30 AM when my Husband went back into the house. They seemed to be ending, with 2 close (like traveling together) and brighter to the others. After these 2 traveling together, was one smaller Orb traveling slow and disappeared. I was about to go inside, when suddenly, a stream of Orbs moved quickly from Southwest to Northeast! . I couldn’t believe my eyes. I called my Husband’s phone at 5:34 AM, it was off and no answer, so, I ran to the window and knocked frantically. I then ran back to where I was standing and saw the stream of Orbs still flowing appearing from one fixed point in the Southwest sky to about a ruler length to the other fixed point to the Northeast where they disappeared.  My Husband ran out and saw what I saw.  We tried to film it, but I don’t know how to work my phone.  We watched till about 5:36 AM and then the Orb stream stopped.  There were hundreds of them, too many to count. Husband’s Report: It looked like a military exercise.  The Orbs came out of an area (could have been a big ship we can’t see) in semi-circle, dropping out of sky in single file. They were spread apart at equal distances. When I came back outside, I saw a row of 3 Orbs per unit side by side stacked in a broad formation line from Southwest to Northeast of Holbrook, AZ. They lit up the sky by hundreds flying in unison. The Orbs disappeared into the sky, like entering a portal. They all disappeared and then a straggler followed them. You’d have to see it to believe it.

It was just one light at first, like a really bright star, appearing white in color. It would move back and forth in a general area, moving up very quickly, then left, so forth and so on, but never moving that far in the sky. At one point it multiplied into three dots of light, which we both witnessed, that were in a perfect line and moved with each other. It blinked into six lights at one point, still in a perfect line (but with a gap in between the two sets of three), though she didn't see it, as where she was on the porch she couldn't see the craft as well as I could see it.

Then second craft about a mile above us racing over our heads at an incredible speed that came to a dead stop unlike any aircraft. It was Saturday morning 1/24/98. The time was 5:45am. It was unusual I was up so early (for some unknown reason) after having a long 15 hour work day. I was wide awake so I turned on my television and sat on my couch when I noticed a peculiar bright light in the corner of my eye coming from my kitchen window. I got up from the couch to get a closer look and it did'nt seem to be moving. It was a very large (size of a school bus?) bright light in the sky just hovering above a nearby mountain (apprx.4 miles away). From my distant view the light was clearly shaped like a very wide letter ""A"". I immediately told my wife who first thought I was teasing then responding with a jump out of bed after my unsettled behavior. She quickly acknowledged this was definetly no plane, no helicopter and  no weather balloon. We both ran outside to get a closer look. I then called my brother who lives next door, who joined us with his 3 children aged 12,13 & 15. All eyes were totally glued to the sky for a good 2 hours as the craft very slowly ascended. It's movement was so slow it took the 2 hours for the craft to become just a speck in the sky, at which time it came to a dead stop. It was about 10 minutes later after the craft had stopped that we then were alarmed by a second craft about a mile above us racing over our heads at an incredible speed that I have never seen before from any aircraft. I had been to air shows before watching such events like Thunderbirds & Blue Angels and is somewhat familiar with jet speed. To better describe the speed at which the second craft was moving is to take your hand and put it on top of your head and fling it forward as fast as you can. By doing this you can experience the same feeling we all had from the second craft. It was the speed from the second craft that  confirmed that the first very slow craft was a genuine UFO. To continue with the second craft maneuvers - after streaking through the sky it came to a dead stop and then also hovered over the same mountain as the first craft di! d. Now we could see both craft within our sight of view. The first in the very very far distant and now the second craft which we could'nt determine it's simular shape until it had come to a stop atop the mountain. The second craft hovered for about 5 minutes and just disappeared. We did'nt see it streak off or anything; we just could'nt see it anymore. We all just said ""where did it go""? The first craft was still just a speck in the sky and just stayed in the now bright sky (getting hard to maintain a constant view in the daylight) by which time our eyes were irritated and we just got tired of looking at it so long. But before I went inside I remebered it's location in the sky by using some telephone wires to refer to as a guide to where it's location was. 3 to 4 hours later I went outside and it was still there. Went to work told some fellow co-workers, made some more phone calls in addition to earlier conversations with the police station and a military base (felt foolishly uncomfortable) to see if anyone had reported any sightings to no avail - bought a telescope came home that night 9 hours later and it was still there. Frantically I set up the Celestron scope with a 4 1/2"" (114mm) x 910mm accommodated by a 10 & 25mm lense and 1/2 hour later went outside with it where we had a clear view but not a satisfied magnification of it. My wife and I was sure and precise to it's location but we lost interest after a couple of hours when it would no longer perform for us. As I sit and type this report 42 hours later from that first moment I saw that bright light outside my kitchen window......(pause) I stopped to look at my now frequent favorite spot in the sky between the telephone wires and see what looks like a distant star in our exact location......will it move again? Who knows? You can bet we will keep looking. But, it has been nice to tell our experience to someone after those foolish sounding phone calls. However foolish, to see what we saw was fun and exciting and a  previlege to have had a little disc! overy channel stuff right in our backyard. Thanks for your time - we are your newest fans of your great web site and the job that your doing.....maybe you can reccommend a quality telescope with photographic capabilities.

I spotted it while I was looking at the moon.  With the moon as a reference point, and the nearby treetops, I noticed that the object was actually slowly moving at high altitude generally in a Westerly direction but not in a perfectly straight path.  Movement was smooth and slow.  I assumed it was some type of weather balloon.  The sun was glinting off of it but at that great of a distance I couldn’t tell a shape.  There was no contrail.  I kept checking on it every few minutes and I filmed it for a few uneventful minutes on my phone.  Finally I grabbed my binoculars to try to get a better look.  When I finally got focus on the object it it expelled a small smoke plume that looked like what I can best describe as what an eject seat looks like when it’s fired.  Like a small rocket shot upward from it for what appeared to be a short distance.  The object immediately dimmed and disappeared and I believe I saw a small dark speck fall rapidly back to earth in my binoculars but I can’t say for certain because it was so far away.  I continued to watch but there was nothing.  No chute, no more smoke, nothing.  My best guess is a weather balloon with some kind of self-distruct mechanism where it blows its balloon top?  Either that or a high flying balloon that somehow launched a small rocket into the upper atmosphere.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,33.48091579651941,-86.77946934404284

Last night on July 26, 2020, my wife and I decided to head out to the desert south of the town of Mojave to observe the comet.  We found a great spot just north of Lancaster and about 5 miles south of Rosamond on a small wadi on West Avenue B just off of Sierra Highway.  It was a very clear evening with just some haze in the west. We set up an evening camp just in time to watch the sun set.  At about 8:05pm or so, as we were digging into dinner, my wife said “Look at that, out to the west”.  I looked and saw what almost appeared to be a dark cloud among some sunset haze.  I looked closer through the small binoculars we brought with us, and it looked like a wide pyramid, with a top that almost billowed (may have been the clouds/haze).  It appeared to just hover in the sky, about 20 degrees up from the horizon.  We used a mountain range between us and the object to observe.  It never moved or changed shape as normal clouds do.  It definitely looked out of plac! e and like a firm, fixed object.  I saw what looked to be two small aircraft moving around the shape (just below it and moving right to left).  My wife did not see these two smaller objects, despite looking through the binoculars.  We observed for about 4 minutes, and then it seemed to “disappear”.  It may have been from the haze/clouds. Then about 2-3 minutes later, again, my wife said—“Look!  Over in that direction!”  I looked over to the northwest, just to the west of the town of Rosamond, and I saw a black orb just above the horizon.  It was moving west to east, about 300 feet over the horizon and descending slowly.  It was moving at around 300 knots estimated (I am a retired Navy Fighter Pilot and civilian pilot with nearly 4,000 hours, so it is my best guess).  It was about as big as a Jeep Wrangler and moving silently.  It appeared to fly over the town of Rosamond.  It never slowed, only descended slightly to about 100 feet above the ground after it passed well behind us.  As it moved past, it appeared not only as a black ball, but also almost hexagonal, like the child toy that you used to plug different shapes into.  There were no lights that I could see until it was directly behind us, then a reddish/white steady light (not anti-collision or position lights like on a normal aircraft).  Since it appe! ared to fly over Mojave and the airport, my guess is that it was about five miles to the north of us.  Then, we lost track. I went to my Jeep to get some things out of the back, and my wife called and said that the first large object was back in the west and that now there were two of them.  I looked through the binoculars, and sure enough, the original object was in the same exact spot that it was before and flanked by another similar object.  We watched them until the light faded, roughly another ten minutes or so.  In their place once it the light had faded enough where they were no longer visible, we saw a single distinctive single light right at their exact location.  This light remained for about 15 minutes. We left our evening camp spot at around 9:45pm with nothing else significant happening (aside from a pretty good view of the comet).",2020-07-31T00:00:00,34.71551165644171,-118.16635122699385
