The weather was crisp and slightly cold. It was low in the sky (say about the size of a pen point at first sighting and as we drew closer by about 10 miles about the size of a pencil eraser at arms length). It was a very dark color...Gray bordering on black. At first it had definite edges. It reflected light at the edges. It stayed in one spot, seemingly motionless. I mentioned to my friend after a few minutes who is a skeptic and asked him, ""What the h*ll is that?"".  He didn't know either.  By the time we were as close to it as we were going to get it had dissipated into a cylinder shaped ""cloud"" or ""mist"" and was losing shape slowly. My father being a pilot I grew up around airports, airplanes and airshows and have always kept an eye to the sky. I have never seen anything like it. If it was a ""cloud"", why would one tiny, dark cloud form in a sky barren of any other weather formations? My friend was a little bothered by it and chalked it up to weather.

The object had the shape of a comet or large meteorite, with a “head” about 1/2 lunar diameter and a “tail” about 3 lunar diameters in size. It passed at a high rate of speed from right to left, in a generally North or Northeast direction, also moving downward at about a 30 degree angle relative to the horizon.  It was visible to me for less than a second. What made it highly unusual to me was its color.  It appeared to be a consistant shade of green, perhaps yellow green, bright, almost of a flourescent quality.  The surface of both the object and its tail appeared mottled, broken up by dark patches between the green.  It had the appearance of something colored by a flourescent pen on an animation gel, with no variation in color aside from the mottled appearance.  The mottling and the detail of the object’s tail appeared to be changing slightly as it quickly passed, convincing me it was no reflection. It did appear to be travelling beneath the cloud cover, indicating a fairly low altitude.  Under that cloud cover, I had clear visibility well beyond the range of the object, which I would guess to be 1/2 to 1 mile away.

We hurriedly retrieved binoculars from the house. My brother looked first.  He was apparently taken aback by what he saw, and exclaimed in a shakey voice that it was a ""UFO.""  Nevertheless, I was sure he was looking at an airplane that was out of focus; so I took the binoculars and zeroed in on the object.  I could not believe what I saw.  It was not an airplane.  Rather, it was a tear-shaped object with a dim, fixed light at the top, and several lights at the bottom, seemingly surrounded by a haze, that moved together in an irregular fashion in a wobbly circle.  It appeared as though the object were tumbling across the sky.  It then turned some 30 degrees to the right, and eventually disappeared into the haze. We looked at the sky intently for another half hour or so, but did not see the object again.  I did, however, notice what I think was an iridium satelite.  It was a pinpoint of light moving steadily north to south that briefly flared in brightness and then disappeared. At around midnight, I continued to look at the sky, but only saw a solitary meteor cross the Big Dipper's Handle.  Although beautiful, I retired to bed curious at what I had witnessed.

I went about my work for a few more minutes, looked up again, and was VERY surprised to see the balloon in EXACTLY the same place in the sky...I would find this strange on ANY day, but particularly strange today because the wind was blowing about 20kts out of the west. I again thought ""it must be a balloon"", and again went about my work...a few minutes later, I looked up again, and the balloon had moved WEST...that's INTO to wind. Now my curiousity was piqued. I finished up my work, and planned to go into the house, get binoculars, and take a picture...however I still had no sense of urgency because I felt it HAD to be a balloon. To my AMAZEMENT, by the time I got into the house, I was distracted and FORGOT to go back outside and have another look! So ends my story. I did feel like I was being watched when on the roof...but this could have very well been my own imagination. I'm sorry I did not get pictures. Thanks for the fine service you provide. Follow-up Report: Peter, I have since found out that the object I saw is/was an atmospheric research balloon.  See the enclosed scan of the paperwork description we had at work. Quite an object! I don't know for a fact of course if this is what the other folks reported seeing around here today. Signed,  ((deleted))",2000-06-06T00:00:00,35.2913,-106.4469

The over the next 15 minutes the 'star' turned a deep yellowish or golden color and then to bright red and very slowly seemed to be shrinking. That's  when we realized it was not a star and that it was moving away from us. We got out our telescope and saw that the object was actually 3 bright red lights in a very symetrical  triangle formation.  You could see the sky backround through the center of the triangle. There appeared to be a white line that connected the three red lights.  We lost sight of it with the naked eye around 8:00 PM but we still saw it through the telescope for another 20 min.or so.  It was very high much higher than any plane could fly. We lost sight of it in the north/northeastern sky.  We couldn't really tell if was a single craft or 3 separate crafts. The single 'point' light was not as bright or as red as the other two. It also appeared to be moving in a forward direction as if the  two brighter lights werte the front, and the single point being the rear. My husband said it didn't look to him as if the white line that connected (and surronded) the red lights,  actually met and touched at the single point end. Like it was a little bit open at the single point  end.   Each of the lights seemed to be the same distance from each other.  This was NOT one of ours!   It was too high. moved much to slowly for any of our aircraft, and didn't seem to show any type of exhaust coming from anywhere.  Which was why it was hard to tell which end was the front or back.

Came up from the horizon in the Northeast over Kaneohe;   (my first thought was fireworks).  Two witnesses involved,  second witness arrived approximately 30 sec. after the initial observation.  2.)  Traveled from left to right towards the Southwest in an unorganized group.  3.)  Some objects seemed to circle others and even back track a bit.  4.)  Continued toward Soutwest and without stoping appeared to ""degroup themselves"" and with incredible precision seemed to go to their assigned positions on ""que"" and stop......""remarkable""    5.)  The formation seemed to form a ""V"" with the apex point ing in the approximate direction of the northwest and located directly over the Koolau's ( a formation of vertical cliffs.  approx. 3000 ft in height) so steep that NASA Satellites cannot accurately photograph.   6.)   After the formation  appeared there were less points of light then seen in the origninal unorganized group;  Almost as if groups of lights had taken up their various positions.  That would account for the points of light in the formation appearing larger.  7.)   As luck would have it, at this point the whole formation became obscured by clouds ( a common occurrence due to the trade winds rising over the mountains.)  8.)    While the clouds were obscuring the formation one point of light  (muted amber red)  took off in the direction of the south with great speed and another took off to the north a millisecond later (white); both disappeared quickly.  9.)    The other  witness claims to have seen a red point of light proceed the original grouping;  ""I did not see that light"".  10.)   Interesting to note that at approximately the same time our observation was taking place; NASA  was to have a controlled re-entry of the 17 ton Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, launched in 1991.  The Satellite was supposed to enter the atmosphere along a 1,000-mile srtip of the Pacific about 2,500 miles southeast of Hawaii.  It was said that if it left its projected course sufficiently it would be in the southeast sky about 8:30 p.m. and could be obsereved here in Hawaii.  It is my opinion what we saw was a completely seperate sighting.  11.)    Added note.....at approximately 22:30 the same evening my curiosity drove me outside again to look at the sky and much to my surprise I observed another object traveling in the same direction (straight line) muted amber red in color.  This object had a ghost like form directly in front which seemed to move back and forth from right to center forward.  It seemed ghost like because I could only observe it  when I would look to the side of the main object. ( I assume this is due to the optical nerve phenomena where the object disappears when observed straight on in the dark.)  12.)     I might add I am a trained observer.  My profession is to observe even the ""smallest""  morphological structures of the human cell under the microscope.",2000-06-06T00:00:00,21.45263009708738,-157.82844563106798

At this time I noticed a very bright white light sped into the area at relatively low altitude traveling roughly east to west from my vantage point. Estimated distance from the object to me was around a mile. The light sped into view from behind a row of trees at a fairly fast clip, intensified slightly in brightness as it reached a due-north angle from me, and then its flight curved to the right during the last second of the event and quickly faded from view. The light itself was a steady bright white circular shaped light that was slightly bigger than a pencil eraser held at arms length. I did not notice any sound or ""tail"" coming from behind the object. The light traveled about 10-15 degrees above the horizon and judging it's relative brightness I figure it was at a fairly low altitude 3,000 to maybe 5,000 feet AGL. Speed was a bit harder to judge, although it was traveling much faster than the commercial air traffic that routinely fly over my area into Pittsburgh Int'l, albeit at a much higher altitude. A rough guestimate would be around 500-600 mph, maybe more. Total duration of the sighting was a little less than 3 seconds. I've taken a few flight lessons and have 25 hrs credit (1 hr solo), and from what I saw it was traveling much too fast to be a plane at any altitude. It also didn't travel quite as fast to be a meteor not to mention I saw no visible tail and it curved to the right noticeably during the last split second it was viewable to me.

As the night went on we decided to lay on the ground and make things out of clouds, after about 30 mins we noticed a football shaped object hovering low above Rooty Hill (which is located about 500m from his house and is also the name of the suburb). immediantly i went inside to inform his parents and relatives, at first nobody followed me but after the heard everyone out the back they went straight out the front (which faces straight at the hill) i followed them. When i got down the hall way enough to see the top of the hill i was ammased to see it was only about 5m off the ground, instead of about 15m which it was when we first noticed it. At this point it had been in veiw for about 3 mins. We were all in shock, there was a shinning silver, perfect football shaped ufo that would have been 30m long by 15m high, there was no visible windows or wngs or jets, But still it hovered perfect. after about 5 mins it began to rotate then it began to rise till it was about 50m above the hill, Then 'shot' straight up, it looked like when the enterprise or whatever it is off that show with captain spok, took off into space and just became a dot with the big light streak. The streak of light was red in colour and lasted for a couple of seconds. THIS IS THE FREAKIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!! This all happened tonight. there are easy 50 ppl who can varify my story. I didnt know if i should call the police or what!?! So when i got home (about 20mins ago) i put ufo in the search and ended up here.

See full description At 1132 PDT on 3/18/00 while flying a cessna C206 at 5,500' on a heading of 155 magnetic, approximately between Bremerton and Tacoma, WA airport, we sighted an extremely bight light with an intensity approaching that of the sun at about our 12:30 to 1:00 position. The haze layer top was about 4,000' and this light appeared to be below the haze layer top.  It was judged to be south of Fort Lewis Army base but north of the hills south of Fort Lewis.  Sky conditons were clear and unlimited visibility above the haze layer.  We initially thought it to be light reflected from a metal roof but the light stayed in the same relative position making that unlikely.  I held my thumb to the light and was able to block it out but the size of the light must have been very large as I judged it to be many miles away.  After a couple of minutes another light appeared over and separated from the large round light.  This was a more flat or crescent shape, roughly the same diameter as the round light.  I attempted to call Tacoma Tower to ask if they had it in sight but they did not answer.  Due to airspace restrictions I had to descend to pass over the southern tip of Vashon Island.  In the descent, at about 4,500' the light suddenly disappeared. I have been a pilot for 47 years, military and civilian with over 20,000 flying hours.  I have not seen a similar event during that time and judge this to be out of the limits of anything I have noted during those flying hours. I did not have a camera with me so have no photos. The intensity would be similar to White Phosphorus burning but in this sighting, no sign of drifting or descending as a white Phosphorus shell or flare  would exhibit so I ruled that out.

I went camping/biking at Arroy Seco last week with three other friends. the plan was to bike the Indians Road to the top of the mountain and turn back before it began it's descent to Big Sur. My friends were pretty much too out of shape to make the 14 mile ride so I went alone while they stayed at the gorge, roughly three miles from the camp site. I began the ride well before noon to avoid direct sunlight since the trail is on the west side of mountain. Initially, I was at this same mountain last summer, when i only completed about 7 miles of the trail. I was determined to make it to the top since then. About 9 miles up the mountain, I paused for a short break at the 9 mile marker. There is a sign there outlining the trails you can access from there and thier distances. While I was resting and eating, I noticed a small 'rainbow' in the sky near a cluster of common clouds. The 'rainbow' had an unusual shape. More like that of the Aurora Borealis (did I spell that right?) then a conventional rainbow. It appeared to be eminating from the cluster of clouds in a sheet-like pattern. I really didn't pay a great deal of attention to it since the colors were familiar to that of a regular rainbow. Other then the fact that it was extremely pretty, it really didn't strike me as odd. However, when I got back on my bike and rode for maybe another mile or two, I came around a blind curve all the while glancing up at the rainbow. When I came around though, I noticed an additional cloud that was out of view before. This cloud had a strange shape in the sense that it was not like the other clouds around. It was more like a heavy mist below the rest of the clouds. The strangest thing about this cloud though was it's color: the top half of the cloud was normal white/grey, but the bottom half was a neon blue! No kiddin! I have never seen such a color that was not man made, i.e., it had the color of a those glow sticks you would see at a dance or perhaps on Halloween. It seemed to just hang above the mountain I was riding. Being so high in the mountains has a somewhat breathtaking feeling by itself, add a sight that you have never before seen, and you can become downright freaked-out. I stopped riding and just watched the cloud and it's unusual color. I thought I would continue my ride and hope to 'get a closer look' at the 'object'. I began riding again for another mile or so when the trail began a descent for about a quarter mile in a very curvey fashion. The road ended at this point due to a landslide that had occured, perhaps this last winter. I climbed the slide and realized that it was surely unstable. Should I fall, I would have been screwed. I looked up to see if I could still see the 'cloud' but could not. I assumed that because of my position, my vision was impaired. Note: when i first saw the cloud, it was in the S/SE sky. At the current postion I was in, I was facing SW and because I still had a ways to go to reach the top of the mountain, it is possible that the cloud was much lower to the mountain top then I had once though. At this point, rather then hiking my bike over the land slide, I decided to turn around head back to camp. The rest of the trail would all be down hill. I stopped at the same point in the trail that I first saw the cloud to see if it was still there...of course, it wasn't. Witness note: I have always been fascinated with space/science, etc and have never been one to accept things without a logical explaination. Yet, there is certainly a part of me that wants to believe in such things as intelligent beings from other worlds, spirits, ghosts, god, etc. But until now, I usually have an explaination for things that most people would rather just excuse as 'miracles' 'un-explained phenomona' 'UFO sightings', etc. I have begun a search for such Meteorological anomolies(?) but have turned up empty handed. A friend told me that there is a talk show host that believes that the government is conducting experiments to control the weather patterns. I surely cannot give that much credit to our government. I think that there is a logical explanation for what I saw, I just have yet to find it. If anyone has any info on such 'lights in the clouds' please post them on this site or contact me via e-mail. Thanks for 'listening'.",2000-05-03T00:00:00,,

I have done research on U.F.O's and this one went very slow. it was also low flying or it must have been HUGE. Also the U.F.O was kinda of tilted to the left. P.S.

We were standing and talking when I noticed a pyramid like shape of six lights above the hotel. I first believed it to be some sort of Jet, But there was no sound and also no FDA regulated strobbing lights. Then the lights changed its configuration from a large pyramid of six lights into two small pyramids of three lights each. I gasped and called attention to the lights. All of us looking then watched it go back into a large pyramid. It changed again into a almost figure 8 symbol, then back into a large pyramid before disappearing quickly into the horizon.(Towards the directiion of the Tropicana) Like I said there was no strobbing lights, and they seemed to be small individual lights. The configurations happened so quickly I didn't see them move. It was as if It went from one to the other faster than the eye. The lights were a yellowish-gold to green color and they were dim.

Round silver object as seen from above with rounded top as a shadow was cast.,Nevada,NV,2000-04-23T18:40:00,disk,12 seconds,"Occurred : 4/23/2000 18:40  (Entered as : 04/23/00 18:40) Reported: 5/3/2000 07:18 Posted: 5/3/2000 Location: Nevada (On west bound airplane over northern), NV Shape: Disk Duration:12 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/012/S12776.html,"Round silver object as seen from above with rounded top as a shadow was cast. While traveling on United flight 739 from Denver to San Jose, in a window seat, I saw a round silvery object with a ""hump"" or rounded top pass below the plane in the opposite direction from West to East.  The rounded top was identifiable by a shadow that was cast by the low setting sun at 1840 PDT.  Assuming we were at about 30,000 feet, the craft was at about 25,000 feet as it looked about a mile away, at the 7 o'clock position in reference to the planes forward motion, i.e. pilots 7 o'clock position.  That means I saw it along the bottom of my window, as well as the window in front and in back of the one next to me.  I first caught a glimpse in the window in front of me, across the window next to me, and followed it through the window behind me until it disappeared underneath the wing.  I was in row 10 on the left side of the plane, so I was looking down and to the South.  It took about 10-12 seconds to cover that span of sight.  Ten minutes later I saw another jet liner about 3 miles away, also going from West to East and it took about 40 seconds to cross my view in just the window next to me - hence the UFO was traveling at about 5 times faster than that airliner. I believe we were over northern Nevada at the time, just after clearing a very rugged mountain range.  I estimate the object to be 50-60 feet in diameter based on the width of the occasional dirt road I could see on the desert floor.  It was a very desolate area. I tried to seek out the pilot and crew after the flight, by waiting for them about 20 minutes to deplane, but they didn't get off, so I went about my business.  Some research of who piloted that flight aught to identify the crew, and they may be willing to confirm the sighting.  I didn't say anything to anyone on the plane about what I just saw.",2000-05-03T00:00:00,,

One of the lights was red, one was white.  The star was the largest light and it was white.  The red light began above both the others, then descended in a fairly straight line to be below the others, then moved north to be directly under the one white light, which was to the left of the star in my view.  Then the red light disappeared; just winked out.  Then the white light above it winked out as well.  I checked for haze or clouds, but there were none and I continued to see a clear view of the star.  On our way driving out, we saw a white flash of light from the left of the road (south), but were unsure what it was. I had what I believe may qualify as a UFO sighting just 45 minutes ago.  My friend, ((deleted)), and I were driving, trying to get away from town and out and about.  Went down Eagle River Road.  Eagle River is a town about 10 miles outside Anchorage.  We took this road ... it's pretty long.  I need to gauge it.  I remember hitting the odometer on our way out and noting the time.  Anyhow ... it dead-ends in the midst of mountains, part of Chugach State Park.  We stopped and ((deleted)) said she had to go, so I took the time to step out and gaze at the stars, hoping that maybe I'd see some planets as I know they're about to align.  Didn't really expect to, since we're so far north ... spotted a satellite in the southern sky.  Turned my gaze to the east and saw 2 white lights and a red one.  At first, I assumed they were stars or planets.  The red one began to move. It was above the other two, then went downward and below, then crossed under the white light on the left.  Then it disappeared.  The white light above where the red one disappeared also disappeared.  I thought that perhaps they were planes that went behind a haze or clouds or something, but the one star that was in the same vicinity had never disappeared.  As the red light was descending, I remember waving my arm at Trista, who had jumped in the van, and saying, ""((deleted)), come here and look at this! ((deleted)), come here and look at this!""  She absolutely refused to get out of the van.  I stayed and watched the sky a few moments after the two lights winked out, but saw nothing more, so returned to the van and asked why she hadn't come out.  She said she'd had a terrifying feeling and didn't want to get out.  She'd jumped in the van and locked the door just before I'd noticed the strange movement of the lights.  When I got back in the van, the time was 11:45.  I can't recall, bummer that it is, what time it was when we arrived.  We were last at a funeral reception and the last time I'd checked the time, it was 10:38.   We might not have left until 11 PM, and it could well have taken 45 minutes to get way back where we were, so I don't think there was any missing time.  However, after I got back in the van and we waited a few minutes to see if anything else would show, we started to drive out and saw a flash of white light.  There were no other vehicles around; perhaps it was a ranger with a flashlight? I don't know.  We just left! <G>",2000-05-03T00:00:00,61.2149,-149.2583

Initially we saw a V shaped formation of extremely bright lights travelling at an incredible speed towards north-east. This lights mantained an incredibly perfect and fixed relationship to each other for a while, to the point that my mom said: ""they are like snow gheese"" (Lit by what?). After a few seconds some of the lights- which seemed to have an aura or glow about them- made some strange right to left and left to right movement, like a shuffling a very quick and perfect shuffle, to them form a perfectly straight line before reassuimg the V shape. We kept looking up till we could no longer see them/it and the whole event must have lasted at least 3 minutes. I have worked in the film industry for years and edited with video special effects... I have looked up at the night sky many times in my life, admired the stars from many corners of the globe.   I have seen satellites, planes, birds, Northern Lights, fireworks, falling stars (and so have my parents) but this time we all agree, we have seen something that we cannot explain!          If you wish to contact me please do:  ((deleted))    PS: On Thursday Night I saw a show on the Discovery Channel titled: ""Into the unknown"", The lights shown seen and witnessed by hundreds of people over Phoenix, Arizona and the V formation reported were exactly like the ones we saw over San Felipe, Baja de California on April 27/2000 the only difference was the speed of travel and the shuffling.  The brightness and spacing looked identical!!",2000-05-11T00:00:00,,

I was leaving my house to pick up my daughter from the Miss Utah pageant (she was not a contestant).  After backing out of my driveway and turning the car north (I was not yet moving forward which would count out a reflected light on my windshield) I observed a pearl white lighted sphere descending down at a 45 degree angle about 15 degrees off to my left from geographic north.  Most city roads in Utah are laid out on a precise north, south, east and west grid so my car was pointed straight north and I observed this apparent sphere for about two seconds before the view of it was blocked by the roof of a neighbor's house.  In describing it over the phone I was given the option of describing it in comparison to a star or the full moon and it seemed to me to show a distinct spherical shape about one fifth the diameter of the moon from my position.  I have seen meteors numerous times and this was moving much slower than a meteor and much faster than any aircraft I have ever seen but it did travel in a straight line.  The light was not bright and the object did not leave a trail.  The object seemed to be moving north while descending into Salt Lake City but without having any reference points to judge its size, I can't say how far it was away from me. I have flown for recreation and I have been through Air Traffic Control School and part of flying in uncontrolled airspace is looking for other air traffic that may be a hazard to you while you fly.  I can't say I am a trained observer but I have had some experience and my overriding impression was that the object was over the west side of Salt Lake City.  On the chance that it might have been a meteor, I checked the Comets and Meteors website at http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/june_radiants.html to see if there was any activity for tonight.  No major activity is slated for June but there is some minor activity that might explain it (Aquilids, Sagittariids, Lyrids, Theta Ophiuchids) but again, it was quite slow for a meteor and quite constant in luminosity, speed and size.",2000-06-21T00:00:00,40.0278,-111.5547

Southwest sky at 11:00 position. Several aircraft in northeast sky flying southwest at the time.  They, too should have see it. My husband and I saw the fireballs March 9, 2000, at 10:09p.m. It lit up our forest brighter than daylight.  A bright, white light held us and all the wildlife in silence for about 45 seconds. I was looking up (at the 11:00 position in the sky, toward the southwest) when the bright ball hit a glass like dome above the planet.  The ball was about the size of a golf ball.  It hurt my right eye; it was so bright. We stood in the white-light waiting for it to stop.  When it did I quickly looked at my watch.  It was 10:09p.m. We next saw several airplanes in the sky flying toward the southwest from the northeast. At 10:10p.m. a second ball was above us in the exact same path that the first had taken.  It looked like a large meteor.  It had a golden-red color and trails of blue flying from its sides. The second ball was not round.  It had the long tail of a meteor;  unlike the large white ball I saw the first time. The other strange thing to this is that at 10:00p.m. (before this all happened) my husband said to me that he thought we should go outside for a walk down our driveway (we live deep in the woods).  I was already ready for bed but his tone of voice sounded strange - so I said OK.  We stepped outside our house knowing that something was going to happen.  We both joked that maybe he was being called by UFO's.  Well, when the white light hit us, we didn't laugh. One more note -  yesterday, March 22, 2000, when I mentioned this to someone, they said they had a friend who was out on the lake that night fishing, and he too, saw the fireballs.  He was so frightned by the first long, white-night light that he thoutht it was the rapture (second coming of Christ). I have to admit that during the light-night(45 seconds long) I, too, thought it was the rapture or something else on a cosmic level. For the next few days we were often confused about what night it actually all happened.  It was difficult for us to remember if it was Thursday or Wednesday.  We thought that was strange.  I had journaled it on Thursday. When the first fireball hit it revealed a glass like dome above the planet.  Its white-light spread above the dome which than revealed a clear distinction from above the dome to below the dome.  I was giving my husband a hug when it hit.  He is a tall man so my head was looking up at the night sky - in the exact spot that it appeared when it hit.  The flash hurt my right eye but not my left.  We felt suspended in a sort of time warp as the light-night surrounded us.  Everything was brighter than white, except the trees seemed to be shadows, yet they, too, were bright.  It was just that the bright light was so bright that the trees seemed shadowed. There was no sound of anykind except my husband and I. We held each other and asked each other - what do ya think it is? The second fireball was the lenghth about 4"".  Typical teardrop shape.  It followed in the same ark of the first, and it hit the same spot on the glass dome - but it did not make the dome. The dome was no longer there. That only lasted a few seconds while the first light was at is greatest intensity. The second fireball looked like a meteor. I often stay up late to watch the meteor showers in the fall.  This one was not only 4"" long, it was 1/2"" wide in its front.  Trails of blue light curled from its sides. It was the largest meteor I have ever seen.

Friday, March 10th..my family and friends were downstairs at the Arlington of Rockford on East State St.  At about 9:10 pm, a security officer rushed through the door from outside to grab anyones attention to come out and see what was outside.  He seemed rather disturbed, so we all ran from our table to see what he was talking about.  There was about 12 of us witnesses to his discovery.  He pointed south and up in the overcast sky.  There was a formation of 5 orange/amber, bright lights.  He said, earlier they came right over the building in a single file, and at that time I thought I heard him say he saw 9 all together and 4 of them left. They made no sound and I don't remember even seeing any stars because it was so overcast...but these lights sure stood out though. When we got there, they were in sort of a circular formation.  One by one would either vanish or fade off with time.  One in particular sort of floated to the top of the rest and stayed there the longest as the others faded.  While we were out there, this process took at least 10 minutes itself with the one standing alone.  This particular one let off like a ""fire-spray"" underneath it or something.  It was still out there when I walked back in the building to tell the rest of our party.  Small world as it now seems, coincidently, my daughter saw what she discribed as the same thing on New Years Eve near her house.  I was on the phone with her as she saw an amber-like light glow and move unusually with no sound over her area. I knew by the sound of her voice that she was concerned enough to know it was not normal or like anything she's ever seen. This seems to happen quite often around here.

These pieces went out after a few seconds.  As the remaining two objects approached about 45 degree off the southern horizon, each burned out within about 10 seconds of each other.  They also dropped pieces that were lit for about 2-3 seconds.  This is all I saw. My first guess was some kind of missle.  What is strange is that they were moving north to south.  I am not aware of any missle ranges north of Sacramento.  Also, if they were dropping debris, it is likely that some might fall onto a city.  Beale AFB is close by.

Before I continue I would just like to state for the record that I've never had any mental problems nor do I have any now. As I was saying, I was walking to my car.  I live in an apartment complex and each building has four two bedroom apartments in it.  I live alone.  I was the only person outside at the time.  I looked up and I saw this ""star"".  I kept thinking that it sure was pretty.  An off orange or red color.  Well it looked kind of strange, like it was moving which did not make sense.  I told myself I was just seeing things and continued walking.  Once more I thought I saw it move. So I stopped to make sure I wasn't seeing things.  Sure enough it was moving, straight towards my area.  I won't lie.  I got real scared. I wanted to run to my car, which is a Neon Sport-Black.  I knew it was not a plane because just off to the right was a plane and this light was too bright to be a plane.  But I did not run to the car.  I did however walk very fast because it was getting closer and since I was the only one outside I panicked.  My hands were shaking really bad as I tried to unlock my vehicle while I kept my eyes on the thing.  Finally I got the door open and I threw my purse and notebook inside then jumped in.  It took me a moment because I was really shaken up to get the doors all locked and my car started.  I then sat there while my vehicle was warming up and continued to watch the thing.  It changed course going left once I got inside the vehicle.  The light did not change at all in intensity as it went on the new course which further convinced me that this was not the ""headlights"" of a plane or helicopter.  It was going at average speed.  I looked away while I put in a CD to calm me down and when I looked back it was gone. I went to work and told my co-worker.  She said that I looked like I had seen a ghost.  And to be honest the experience still shakes me up because in all my life of watching the stars at night I've never seen a thing like this.  And I grew up in Texas where the stars are very bright and un-polluted by light from the city. I'm a 23 year old woman, single, no children with a good job and a nice place to live.  I hope you can make sense out of this because I can't.

As we watched the fireball began tilting upward instead of falling and then did a circle and flew towards the southwest. My parents, and my son and I were driving down Bardstown Rd. heading from our small city of Mt. Washington into the city of Louisville which we are about 10 miles or so south of. We were headed northeast on Bardstown Rd. and my son said look a plane is falling. I looked out the window and immediately got excited because I've never seen any type of plane that would be that distance in the sky above appear that large. We are in an airpath that routinely has airplanes fly over our house night and day. We've lived in this same house for 23+ years so I know what the normal planes look like in this area. This looked like a big fireball falling from the sky. It was a color of light orange and had like a ripply haze around it. Whethere this haze was the effect of the setting sun or not I can't be sure. My mother said it looked to her like something out of the movie Armageddon. This fireball was going in a course straight down. My father argued it was just a plane going over the horizon but he could get a proper look at it since he was driving the vehicle. My mother, my son and I continued to watch this fireball spellbound. I can't say for certain the exact height this fireball was in the sky but I know it appeared to be above where the planes usually fly. If I strectched my arm out the fireball would have been at least the size of my fist. If it was any smaller than that it wouldn't be by much. Now as I said my father argued it was an aircraft going over the horizon. Keep in mind that it was still daylight here as we were watching this fireball in the sky. The sun was starting to settle in the horizon and the sky was still pretty light. It got dark maybe a half hour or so later. Now as my mother, son and I were watching this fireball go down, i noticed a shift as did both of them. The fireball changed from a falling pattern, went up about a 90 degree angle then it completed a loop and moved off in a southwestern position. We were floored. This fireball was clearing falling straight down and then did what was a! basic l oop and headed a new direction. There were no planes in the area at all either that we could see. Just this lone fireball trailing it's tail. It was about that time that we went up a hill on Bardstown Rd and around a curve and could no longer see the fireball in the sky. Later this night after we returned back to our home I watched our 11pm news on Channel 11 broadcast from Louisville Ky and found that the story had made the nightly news. They of course reported that it was either a meteor(which there is no way.this thing was way too large) or that it was falling space debree. Since I've never seen space debree fall I've no idea but space debree doesn't do loops in midair to any of my knowledge. Also on this newscast on Channel 11 they had a State Trooper from Seymour, Indian on there. He actually got this object on video tape except it was darker when he taped it as he said it was 7:00 PM or so and you can see different colored lights in the fireballs tail. He also said on the news as I told you that he'd never seen anything like it. If I can help with anymore info please contact me. I'm also a commercial artist so if a sketch of this thing and the loop it did would help you let me know and I'll do one and email it out to you.",1999-11-17T00:00:00,38.0417,-85.5753

At approximately 01:15 am central standard time on 12/19/99 I noticed a object moving across the sky with the naked eye. At first glance it looked like a commercial airliner because the speed was about the same. But there was no sound and no blinking lights.  The light was constant with no fluctuation and was copper/amber in color. The object was coming from the southeast and moving toward the west. I was facing the south and looking up.  The object was at about 75 to 80 degrees.  This made me curious as to what the object was. I swung my telescope around and was able to lock onto the object with my 9X50 finder scope. Then I focused my finder scope.  At that point I could tell the object was not an airplane or jet liner. I could make out multiple disc shaped objects all clustered closely together. At that point I lined up the objects in my Astro-Physics 130 mm telescope.  I had to refocus because I was previously observing the moon. I had to bring the focus in closer because the object was definitely closer to earth. My telescope was set up with a 22mm panoptic eyepiece.  This was giving me about 35 times magnification.  I tracked and observed the object across the sky.  There was 15 to 20 disc-shaped objects. They were like bubbles that had been partially flattened. They were dark and transparent looking in the middle of the discs.  The discs were emitting an amber colored light around the outer edge and it was constant and nonfluctuating.  Some of the objects held a steady position as they moved across the sky while others swayed back and forth. All of the discs were of the same size.  I followed them as far as I could to the west util my view was obstructed by a tree. By then the discs were very dim. The cluster stayed together for the duration of my observation.  After I lost site of the objects, ! I contin ued to observe the night sky for another hour.  There was no other objects sited during that time.  I took my compass and lined it up with the direction my telescope was pointed at the last site of the objects.  The compass reading was 275 degrees.  This is almost due west.

Then to my astonishment it shrank down to a small point of orange light (about 1/5 it's original size) & began to move away faster, it was coming towards me at first & was about 200'to 250'up & at it's closest 75'. as it moved away about a mile it turned into three orange lights in a triangle shape, this was by naked eye due to my getting back into my truck & chasing after it. it then stopped abruptly & went back towards the north west. I slammed on my brakes & jumped out again & by the time I got my bynoc's trained on it, it was slowing down & then stopped, it immediately lower itself to the ground. it was about 300 to 500 ft. away now, it went into a big stand of tree's, I could see it on the ground inside the tree's, but not so good anymore. but I could still see the glow of the orange lights inside the stand of trees.  I watched for about 4 or 5 min, when I desided to try & get closer ! to the s tand of tree's, I had to get back in my truck & get off the freeway to try & find where it went down, I had no luck in finding it again even though I did find the spot in the tree's where it went down. I also discovered a large crowd of people standing outside of a house that wasn't far from where the stand of trees where, I stopped to ask them if they had seen anything, they hadn't. After I watched this thing land I began to shake a great deal, no dought due to fear & excitement.  I stayed aroud the general area for about 20 min. & saw nothing more.  I was a little tired, but not on drugs or any mind altering substance.  Thank you",2000-01-07T00:00:00,,

Thought it was a plane crashing.  When it went over the horizon, I waited for the sound of a crash which never came. I walked outside of my house just before 6:00 pm to walk the dog.  The sky was clear, dark and the air temp cool.  I noticed how starry the night was. About 10 seconds after walking outside I looked up straight up and saw this massive fireball with a long trail behind it.  My first instinct was it was some sort of a jet plane going down.  Although the airport is 5 - 7 miles away, planes from Milwaukee & Chicago fly over my neighborhood on their approach.  This ""plane"" was coming from what seemed to be SE and headed E/NE.  I thought that if it was a plane, it had taken off from the Madison airport to the SW, encountered problems and continued an arc that brought it E/NE and over my house.  Elevation seemed to be maybe 4000 feet and then as it headed towards the horizon & went over the trees, it looked like it was going to crash on the east side of town or in the village of Cottage Grove. The speed of the object was no faster than a plane making a landing approach.  It moved silently.  When I first noticed the fireball, it was directly overhead.  From that moment until it went over the tree horizon, about 45 seconds to maybe a minute went by.  It was long enough that I contemplated running to my next door neighboor's house to tell him to come out and watch this. After the object dissapered and I heard no explosion, I went on my walk with the dog (who by the way did not act strange during this event)all the while trying to figure out what I had just seen.  I knew about the upcoming meteor shower, but I thought that 1) it was so huge, I didn't know meteors looked like that 2) I thought the meteor shower was going to be in the middle of the night.  When I got home, I ran in the house & turned on the local news.  The Channel 3 weatherman was on and talking about the meteor shower.  Since I turned on the TV in the middle of talk, I missed most of what he said.  He was indicating however that the meteor shower was already starting & that was what people were seing.  He said (paraphrased), ""we've just had several calls about sightings, and that's what you're seeing folks - the meteor shower.""  So that did it - I just assumed I saw a meteor. Then last night I turned on Art Bell, because I was curious to hear if he would talk about these impressive meteors.  Boy was I in for a surprise.  When you came on and played the tape from that lady in Northern Michigan, I nearly died.  It was incredibly similar to what I saw.  Like she said, it was moving slow enough to pull over and get out of a car.  Just incredible. To give you a bit of background - although open to the idea of UFOs and such, I have never seen anything which I would describe as unidentifiable until last night.",1999-11-17T00:00:00,43.066514168714164,-89.38736175266175

We again saw this object and it's beam in what seemed like a closer view and we were able to see what looked like 5 exhaust ""pipes"" from where the light beams came from. Then the light beams seemed to slowly extinquish themselves until there was nothing. We witnessed the object and plane formation two more times while driving to and from this area. As we drove through Stoughton after taking the exit 19B to rte. 138 enroute to Canton Christmas, my son and I saw a Bright round luminous object in the sky.  This object was much bigger than any star we have seen and the beam of light coming from it was straight and round, long and thick beam. Then after about what seemed a minute, the object suddenly disappeared from the sky.  About 2 minutes later we witnessed 4 planes take v-formation in the sky and they appeared to be searching for something. As we drove down 138, we again seen this object. This time it appeared to be bigger, perhaps closer and we were able to see the exhaust area that the beams came from.  The exhaust area looked like 5 round holes, brightly lit. As we witnessed this object for the 2nd time, we both felt our hearts stop and were extremely frightened. Just then the object disappeared, shortly thereafter, the 4 planes took formation.  On the way back from Canton as we approached the Christmas Tree Shoppe parking lot, we again seen the object, it appeared as it did earlier with the beam of light but now it sort of had a trailing light also. As we watched, a young man approached and looked into the sky. My son pointed to the object and the young man stood looking with his mouth wide open.  He yelled to us that he could see it also.  Just then, it disappeared and sure enough, here comes the 4 planes in formation.  We then went inside the Shop.

At first I dismissed them as an airplane, but apon closer observation it did not appear to be lights to an air plane. It seemed to be moving to slow, and the wingspan seemed a lot bigger than any airplane I had ever seen. The two blue lights were on both ends of the object. I proceeded down the road watching this object in the sky. It came from the southwest out of Jackson county. This area is farm and woods, within a few miles of a tri county junction. Eaton,  Ingham, and Jackson Counties all come together in this area. It came in from Jackson County in the southwest sky. Slowly moved in at about 25-30 miles an hour. I watched and tried to figure out what it was. I then thought it looked like a helicopter, carrying some kind of lighted shaft or tube. similar to what is used for major construction for setting or carrying posts.  but I had never seen one at night and no post I had ever seen had lights on it.As I approached tucker road it was just starting to clear some trees and coming across an open field. I noticed it was moving very slow and was only about 35-40 feet above the tops of the trees. I was driving by the open field whatching and saw that it was not a Helicopter but it appeared to be one solid peice as though the shaft or tube was not being carried but was actually part of the object. it was about as wide as an airplaine is long but skinny in the middle. It did not move straight through the air but actually sideways.  From looking at it from underneath of it was shaped like a crooked star. Realy long sideways  but all ends pointed with a tube sticking out of the middle pointing at the ground. At the top of it it seemed to be a dome type lid that was poited ontop. It actually resembled a cigar tube that was pointed on each end, that had some kind of tube or shaft on the bottom and had apointed dome shaped top. It had a light on the top of it that resembled a search light but it did not point in any! one dir ection it seemed to be cicling the top and wasnt like a spot light, it just seemed to glow bright.

I rolled down the window andbrought half my body out of the driver side window and looked across the roof of the car and watched as it flew past the next tree line.

While working as a truck driver on the Trans Alaskan Pipeline construction north of the Prospect Creek construction camp my assistant and I were on break reading by the interior light of our truck.  We were about one half mile from a group of about forty workers putting support members in the ground for the pipeline.  My partner pointed out a bright light on a mountain directly across from us about 40 miles away.  As we watched the light it appeared to ""step"" down in four moves to the bottom of the mountain.  It then came towards us accross the treeless tundra (light got larger than the moon which was visible), stopped, and went back to just a bit to the right of the original mountain site.  The light did this three more times (about three seconds each trip) as if searching the tundra.  As the light came closer the last time, I turned on the spotlight and directed it towards the light.  It approached us coming to about a quarter mile away and slowly came closer.  The light was then about three times the size of the moon.  As it was getting closer we got scared, shut off the spotlight and sped off down the haul road. We could see the light at its present size accompanying us on our left side the two miles to the construction camp.  We slid in to the warm-up shack and ran inside where there were about ten men  on break.  We all went outside to see what it was but it was gone.  The next morning at breakfast it was found that many people had seen this ""light"" and truckers coming up the haul road could see a large red light on the back of the craft.  No description of the body of this craft was given because of the darkness.  I was transferred to another camp a couple of days later but was told that many people were interviewed by Air Force representatives from Eilson AFB in Fairbanks.  I have always wondered if this event was recorded anywhere as it made a firm believer out of me.",1999-11-23T00:00:00,,

The evening was rather dark, the moon, if it was ""up,"" provided no illumination. The sky was clear and starry with good definition to the horizon except for a hint of ground fog settling in the lowest pockets of the valley floor. Suddenly our attention was drawn by an intensely bright, white light that rose abruptly into the low western sky ahead of us just slightly left of center. Both the nature of its sudden and jerky rise, and the intensity of this light source, caused us to watch the object closely, and it appeared to be either stationary or slowly heading towards us at a constant elevation. As we continued driving, we noticed that it was indeed getting closer and that there were in fact two, not one, bright lights. We also noticed that the lights were not white as first thought, but a very strange amber white that projected from the object like piercing ""pencil beams"" of light. It also soon became clear to us that out paths would soon cross and this object was no airplane or helicopter. We were about one mile west of the Napa Rd. turnoff when we got our first good look at the object and realized that if its course remained the same, it was going to pass directly over us in a matter of moments. Realizing this, I pulled off the road onto the shoulder and looking up out of my open window, watched it do just that. My best guess on its altitude is about 2000 ft and at it was at least 300 ft across (wide) and approximately 250 ft long. It may well have been even larger if I underestimated its altitude. Its shape was very similar to that of a manta ray (which I realize makes this account seem less credible) with its underside dark and muted browns. The underside was also highly detailed, not spherical and aerodynamic, with what may have been low-profile compartments or holds. The aforementioned 2 lights were on the front of the craft, and between them appeared to be a dimly lit area of some possibly transparent material. The 2 lights were still on as it passed overhead and they were quite unlike anything we had everr seen—intensely bright and focused. It also seemed to have some sort of revolving light arrays at the end of each wing that had briefly emanated a flashing red and white pattern (ike a commercial jet) only moments before. There was no visible means of propulsion as the craft passed silently overhead, but both of us could swear that we could ""feel"" it, like a low resonant vibration. After it passed overhead, I spun the car around in the shoulder area to pursue the craft, but as I did, the craft bolted southeast, displaying ""instantaneous"" acceleration, and was some 5 miles away before I had reached the paved road surface. As I reached the roadway, it bolted again and was now only faintly visible some 10-15 miles away, and then it was gone.",2000-03-16T00:00:00,38.46812121212121,-122.19507146464646

I looked for a spot to watch the meteor shower. I drove up a dark road north of Tucson, in the mountains looking down into the valley. Approx twelve other people were present, including a few students from Univ of Arizona. Sometime after 11 I heard someone say (not shout) ""what is that?"". I looked to the east and saw three huge bright lights heading in our direction. As the craft banked, it was clear that it was a solid, triangle-shaped object. As throughout the night you could occasionally see planes flying towards Tucson Int'l Airport, it was easy to get an approximation of the size. It was at least twice the size of a large commercial airline, and probably three times the size. Without a doubt, it is the largest aircraft I have ever seen. As the craft passed by, it made NO SOUND. This was not a trick of the wind as you could hear other planes all night long. Approx five minutes after the craft passed, three military planes passed overhead in loose formation, heading in the general direction (east to west) of the first craft. Five minutes after that, three more jets passed over in a tight formation moving fast and in the exact direction of the original craft. Several people had to plug their ears when the second group of three passed. I am an executive level individual, which I only tell you to hopefully help validate what this report states. If I were asked, I would think that what I saw was a large military transport of some sort. I know the size is accurate since there was plenty to which to make comparisons. It was the only aircraft to emit no noise that night. It made a graceful arc in front of our location, so the shape was easy to see. I would judge the speed as similar to a jumbo jet while landing (ie it seems they are going slower than they really are). I had a hard time finding this report format, so this is a bit dated. If someone would like additional info, it is ok to call or e-mail me. Anyone who states these craft do not exist does not know what he or she is talking about. I am not saying it was aliens or anything like that, but the craft is there. Thank you.",1999-12-16T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

We were traveling east on I-5 towards Northbend, WA. About 5 miles from our exit I spotted what appeared to be an airplane flying over the hills near the Highway. I noticed that the object was not moving and was sitting staitionary above the hill. The Sun was not up above the surrounding mountains yet at this time and the sky was clear with no clouds. I looked very carefully for a tower that may have been supporting this object like a beacon. I did not see a tower and brought it to the attention of the person driving the car. When I first noticed the object it was giving off a bright white light. As I observed the object it very slowly faded color from white to a very bright red light before it disappeared behind the hill we were going by next to the road. The light reminded of an airport beacon which changes color as it rotates from white to green. the light changed at a much slower rotation, if indeed it was rotating at all. I have seen many beacons and it did not have the same look when it changed. it was as if the light faded out then came back on red increasing in intensity. I cannot speak for the person driving as to his background in observation. I am a trained weather watcher for NOAA and an amatuer Radio operator. I am an amatuer astronomer and very familiar with most types of aircraft. The object if it was above the hill was very small it appeared to be about 200 feet above the top. about the size of an F-16 or smaller. Since we were traveling about 60 MPH then if the object was not above the hill it was moving at a speed which made it appear to be sitting stationary in relationship to us. I looked very carefully at the object and did not see any rotors above the object which would have been associated with Rotary wing aircraft. It could have been a Harrier Jump jet, on training exercise holding position and signaling someone in the distance. but with the gust of winds we had that day, the pilot was doing an exceptional job of holding his craft stationary. when we passed the obstruction to ou! r veiw t he object was gone. If the object was a beacon on a tower and we could not see the original spot when we came around the hill, well the other towers on top of the other hills nearby were plainly visible that morning and I could not see any structure supporting this object and like I said all the other towers were plainly visible.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,,

I looked up and saw a huge triangular object hovering above with NO sound. I was hit by a beam of white light and fell backward onto the sole of the cabin. I grabbed my Ruger 10-22 rifle loaded with a 100 round banana magazine and stared firing as fast as I could until the clif was empty. I was able to shoot out the light. While grabbing for a second clip, I saw a hatch open up on the bottom side of the object and two people leaned down to yell ""STOP SHOOTING AS US YOU IDIOT"". The only other noise I heard was a hissing sound like air escapeing from a flat tire or something. As the object move off to the south, I saw a helocopter come out off the top and move in next to my boat about 20' off the water and 50' way. Someone in the side door held up a camera and flash off a picture of me in the boat holding the rifle. The helocopter made no noise and had no markings on it. It was solid flat black as was the huge Triangle. The chopper then took off toward the Golden Gate bridge climbing up. The Triangle slowing gained altitude and was last seen heading south. I left the area for port and went out Wednesday to finish hauling in my traps. At first I thought it was an alien UFO and was genunly startled by it. However, I now believe it was an experimental military platform for transporting a small fleet of black helocopters that leave and enter out of the top of a huge silent floating triangle the size of a football field.

There was no sound like a normal plane would make, but a low humming sound. There were also no other planes in the area. I watched it until it passed; I did not have any cameras, so I could not get a picture of it. I always look up at night and look for things, but I did not expect to really find anything around here. I think I saw the common triangle UFO. It was passing over my house, at a distance of about 300 feet up, and 100 away. it was moving west to east. I have always been watching the skies, and I know what one is supposed to do if something is spotted. I made sure I remembered where I saw it, day, time, weather conditions, anyone else around, anything else strange, etc. all I noticed which was strange was there were no other sounds at all. It was a fairly nice night, and usually people have their dogs out side. There are usually bugs out making noise as well. I heard nothing, absolutely nothing. It was strange, the only thing I heard was the low humming. When it left, I can not remember anything like normal sounds starting up again, but I would not be surprised if they did. This is almost exactly what I saw.",2000-02-23T00:00:00,39.7615,-75.1245

At first I thought it was a star or planet (was brighter then Jupiter) as it was starting to get dark and stars were starting to appear in the twilight.  Then I noticed it was moving slowly south, and my impression was it must be an airplane landing light. (To the east and southeast is the landing pattern for flights coming into Burbank Airport.)  But as I watched the light suddenly went out.  I noticed a very faint star like appearance in the same vicinity moving in the same direction for a few seconds as I searched for the object, and then it was gone. I thought that was odd.  I then noted a couple of planes coming into Burbank further away than what I had seen and a light plane flying in the northeast, none of which looked like what I had seen.  Thinking about this now, it was as if something had jumped from near to far instantly.  Also the light went out and I didn't see anything until I noticed the very faint star-like object in the area and it also seemed to be moving southward, albeit more slowly.

On the night of the lunar eclipse, a friend and I went to the Bishop planetarium to observe it.  They had set up many lg. and sm. telescopes to see the event.  All of them were trained either on Saturn, Jupiter or the moon.   The night was chilly and very breezy and they had set up an area apart from the 'scopes with tables and chairs and partial cover to sit out of the wind.  My friend and I had been sitting there for a few min., I was facing east, she west.    Approx. 9:30 p.m., I was looking at the east sky and noticed a red light thru the branches of a palm tree on the edge of the property.  At first I thought it was a tower light.  Then I noticed it was moving and thought perhaps it was a plane.   When it cleared the top of the tree I noticed it had a tail behind it and at that point remarked to my friend, ""Look at that"".   She turned and exclaimed, ""What the hell is that?!""  This was echoed by the other three people sitting near us, a mother and her two teenage sons.   The five of us watched this red ball of light for approx. a minute.  It seemed to be heading southwest.  After that the tail disappeared and it turned dullish white and seemed to change its direction to a much more West.  Then suddenly it was gone, but only for a few seconds.  It came back in the same spot it had been and continued on for a few more seconds then disappeared.   After talking about it for a couple of minutes between us, I walked over to the group by the 'scopes and asked random people if any of them had seen it.  No one had.  They had all been looking at the moon or planets.   I find this really ironic because had someone with one of the smaller 'scopes seen they could have gotten a real good look at it.   Also the local television crews were there covering the eclipse.  THE OBJECT:  It looked approx. (proportion in sky) to be about 1 and 1/2 cent, with a tail about the same length.  It was reddish/orange in color then dull white.   It never glowed like a distress flare and definitly wasn't one.  Also it traveled over land not water.  It also was not a meteorite.  I have watched the last 3 showers and others before that it didn't even vaguely resemble one.   The entire event only lasted a couple of minutes, 1 of the min.  I didn't know what I was looking at, the other min. with the five of us observing and still not knowing.

Could not retain sight of object lor a longer period because of driving coniderations. UFO Center - I have followed Mr.Davenport on Art Bell's show for years, but never expected to be writing such a report. Notably, I only consulted the Center's website last evening because I thought what I had seen on 2-8-00 was some form of elaborate prank.  What was incredibly sobering for me, however, was 2-8 report from someone in North Hollywood California, of an object slowly moving east at 17:47. North Hollywood California is located approximately ten miles to the west of the location where my observation took place. Basically, it was dark and a storm was clearing.  There was a modest amount of broken cloud cover to the west.  I was heading north up the #2 freeway at approximately 65 mph.  This location placed me about seven or eight air miles north of downtown Los Angeles and almost directly to the east of North Hollywood. This time night traffic monitoring helicopters and other aircraft are not uncommon overhead, but I noted enough light from three or four sources (I think at least one or or two of the other sources were aircraft) to turn and look 90 degrees to my left.  Turning this far, I picked up a light source further to my left and then turned my head to near maximum.  Doing such, I was visually able to scan an object perhaps 35 degrees above the horizon and 110 degrees to the left and west of the direction I was driving. I only maintain this object in my vision for perhaps two seconds before safety required a return to the roadway.  I was unable to look again for another 30 seconds because of traffic considerations. However brief the observation time, the object observed was very clear. It was cleary disc or saucer-shaped.  The sharpness of its features were not diminished by clouds or weather. Dimensions are difficult to estimate, but my best estimate would be from 60 to 80 feet in diameter and perhaps 20 feet high in the middle.  The object glowed in a soft neon-type of manner and almost appeared transleuscent - - about the consistency of a jellyfish (!). Perhaps the best indicator of authenticity of my seeing this object was my immediate emotional reaction - laughter.  I could not believe this object to be any type of ""genuine"" UFO - - After all, it was so obviously a ""flying saucer"" and over a large urban area during commuter time, with sufficiently good enough visibility for it to be easily seen from both the ground and from the air.  I thought it to be a prank - an elaborate one, mind you - - cooked up by USC, UCLA or CAL TECH science students to measure societal reaction to such a blatantly obvious object.  The fact is there is a good part of me that still feels it to be a prank and that the joke's on me. Approximately 3/4 of a mile north of where I observed the object, the #2 FW begins a straight-graded climb into the San Rafael Hills.  When I reached this area I undid my safety belt and tried a couple of quick body turns in the seat.  I saw lights, but nothing distinct. In retrospect, that I didn't pull over as soon as possible after the initial sighting is pretty much explained by my laughter - that this object was clearly and distinctly there is a fact - - that this sighting was also defined as a joke or a prank by me at the time is also true. Concluding comment.  I am convinced that this object must have been seen by hundreds of people.  -Those driving south on the #2 FW and down the grade would have been afforded an exceptional view when this object was in the location it was when seen by me.  I made no special effort to monitor the local news for sighting or prank related information at the time.  I'm inclined now to go back and do some checking.  I admire the person who reported what was probably the same object - seen fifteen minutes earlier - in North Hollywood.  Had that report not been earlier made and published by the Center, I would not be making this report at this time. I would certainly appreciate any additional information the comes to the Center on this matter.",2000-02-23T00:00:00,34.1593126984127,-118.25281964285715

I was out on the deck listening to the waves and gazing at the stars when I thought I saw a metorite. Yet, it I thought it was strange that the light appeared on the horizon looking west at the Gulf of Mexico and moved upward into the sky in a 45 degree arc. I payed closer attention thinking it might be a satellite or who knows maybe the space shuttle was up in a mission ( I didn't really know...but I have seen the shuttle coming in before in the evening sky in my home state of Texas)...anyway this is where is gets strange...as the pinpoint of white light arched across the sky it got larger...it was spherical in shape (about the size of a fingernail at arms length)  and I noticed a color shift to orange. It seemed to emit a hazy glow maybe from heat...then, as it continued to arch across the sky I noticed that it was not flying a straight course but was oscillating rapidly up and down as it continued moving forward...seemed unstable...then it dropped down approx 500 to 1000 feet, hovered for an instant and then did a reverse arch back and above its original course and finally proceeded to the SouthEast at 5 times the speed it was moving before...It just dissapeared.

Saturday, April 15th, at 3:35 PM, my girlfriend and her son were driving east on Lomita Blvd. in Torrance California near the intersection of Lomita and Hawthorne Blvd. when they witnesses a silvery object at about 30 degrees off the horizon slightly north of due east. They were on their way to my office and were only a couple of minutes from my front door when they spotted it. The object was about 1/8"" diameter at arms length and was clearly visible. The sky was absolutely clear with no smog or clouds. It was described to me by her son, who is 12 and a half years old as a saucer shaped object with a line at its girth separating the top half from the bottom. Interestingly, the top half was described as rotating on its axis while the bottom was stationary to the top. My girlfriend's son also described some purple and blue flashes that were being emitted from the surface of the object. He described these as flashes that would have the perspective as if you were looking into a tunnel. After viewing the video, these are clearly visible. Also, from his vantage point where he saw the object lower on the horizon, these would have been more in direct line with his line of sight and would have given him this tunnel perspective view. In contrast to this view, my video shows the object directly from its bottom. The object was hovering motionless for several seconds when two airplanes crossed ahead of it. These two airplanes were seen by both the mother who was driving and the son. Immediately after the planes crossed each other's paths, the object disappeared from view until the two planes were a fair distance away. It then re-appeared and began moving westward into the wind direction. Upon arriving at my office, they both frantically called out to me to get my video camera out, that there was a UFO. I immediately grabbed my camera and went out to take a look and hopefully get a shot. When I first viewed it, it was about 65 degrees off the horizon looking due east. I was in the parking lot of my office complex situated directly at the corner of Lomita Blvd. and Madison. I took my 5X telephoto lens with me to make sure that I got a good close up shot of it. It was climbing steeply and getting smaller very quickly as it moved westward. It was very hard to get a fix on it with my long lens. I simply couldn't find it fast enough, so I laid down on the pavement to steady the camera pressing my elbows against my ribcage. I found it and got about 4 seconds of video and quickly lost it again. In my video, it appears that the UFO is jumping around, but it was in fact moving very steadily. It continued west for about ten seconds, then took a fairly sharp turn to the north, crossways to the wind. It continued north with apparent slowing as it was climbing very fast until it was out of sight. I immediately took the video into my office where I have several computers and image processing programs. Upon looking at it, I not only got a very good shot of the object even though it was nothing more than a speck in the sky, but was able to get a few good frames of these purple and blue flashes that my girlfriend's son had described. When I looked at with my naked eye, I did not notice these probably because the object was so small. I took some of the frames and began doing some computer enhancements using only the hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, histogram, midtone enhancements and so on to bring out what detail that might be obtainable from the unchanged original video frame. I own an engineering company and have won several photography awards with the Kodak International Snapshot competition and PSA the Photographic Society of America.",2000-04-26T00:00:00,33.83267537437604,-118.33263344425957

They seemed to float like small white baloons.  I followed their path looking out the window while walking to the end of the terminal.  As they floated away to tiny white spots in the sky, one drifted away, but one stayed. I could judge position by seeing the roof of the terminal looking almost straight up. It held that position for 10 min. I went to get my camera and came back (30 sec.) to find it was gone. (I thought ok maybe just balloons.) I went to the next set of windows to keep searching looked up and there were 2 objects again, this time closer and lower in the horizon. They held that position for another 5 min with out moving.  (I thought cool a pair of ufos).  I watched for a while and looked away for maybe 30 seconds. I looked again and one was gone!  The other just floated off in the distance after another 5 minutes..

The light was continuing and varied in intensness over several magnitudes of brightness I noticed a smaller light blinking at about 7:00 o'clock to the left of the main light, and another small light blinking at about 5:00 o'clock to the right. I still thought it might be a conventional air craft until I noticed that both of the secondary lights were blinking at random rates independent of each other. I then noticed a second main light at about 35-40 degrees east of the first light and at similar apparent height. It displayed similar properties of fluctuating light intensity as the first. The second main light appeared to have a single smaller light directly below it slowly blinking on and of. I saw a parking lot just before the intersection of San Mateo and Montgomery and pulled into it to better observe the lights. When I got out of my car I noticed that the two lights seemed to have increased the space between them but were moving almost imperceptably slow. Then I saw a third bright light about 25-35 degrees south of the first light. It appeared to be closer than the first two and was extremely bright. I could make out no shapes but all of the light fluctuated in light intensity. At the brightest they looked as bright as the sun (perhaps as a star the size of our sun were to look if it were in a binary orbit less than a light year away) the lights were many thims brighter than venus or jupiter would be under the best nighttime viewing conditions. As I watched, all three light moved very slowly, The first light moving toward the south east, the second moving due east, and the third moving towards the south. At one point I noticed that the second light seemed to take on an elongated shape but it could have been glare on the windsheild of my car. As I watched, I heard the sound of a commercial jet comong from the south (were the airport is) and as it came into view, all three light started to fade out. By the time the jet came into view, all lights had disapeared. I waited for a couple of more minutes but they did not reappear. I saw no other motorists stop to look at the lights.

I believe the object was 40-50 degrees above the horizon when we first saw it and about 20 when it disappeared behind a ridge.

We studied it for a little while and then stopped the truck.  We got out to look at it were we had a good view.  As we were debating, If it were a weather balloon or not, a door slid open in a downward motion near the bottom of the object.  We stood motionless watching!  We stood there in silence.  A smaller silver ball came out of the opening and went to our right.  Then as second came out and went to our left.   They both hovered there for about five minutes.

Then began moving slowly toward the NE.  Suddenly with incredible speed it went upward and to the NE out of view.  My father and I in silence got back into the truck.

The absence of clous that day allowed us a continuous view of the object. The light did not decelerate upon achievig vertical but seeed to accelrate oncagain as if piloted. I estimate considering the size and velocity of the object that it was between 12 and 14000 feet. With this considered I estimate the object to have been fairly small somewhere around 25ft. in diameter. The episode captivated us for quite some time and I emediately began to put the sighting through close scruitiny. Although I never found an answer of which I was satisfied. I had just seperated from the Air Force having spent five years as an aircraft mechanic. I worked F-4E and F-15E fighter jets and knew how high performance aircraft behaved when in flight. I knew that even during an FCF ( Functional Check Flight ) post maintenance flight a jet with no external tanks or pylons, in afterburner could not perform such absolute verticle accelerated maneuvers. Afterburners are visible as yellow light until over 33 thousand feet. This objects velocity to height ratio proved it to be near the ground in an atitudinal sense so there should have been at least turbulence related sound accompanied by vapor or if hot,residual particulate smoke. It was most clearly defined as a mirror reflection being shot against the sky. I had explored the possibilities of it having been a meteor with just the right entry angle to deflect it back out into space. This didn't hold water due to the physical anomolies associated with the sightng. If it were a meteor there would have been sound and vapor if not a sonic boom. Although gradual the upwrd arc to verticle was, in the grand scale of the atmosphere, quite short and erratic. At this velocity an aircraft would have surely have been destroyed due to overgee. Clearly this wa! s a uniq ue sighting that challenges the physical world as we know it. Since then I have had a newfound respect for those who believe. I look up much more often.",2000-03-07T00:00:00,35.2984,-80.6443

Would flicker out and then reappear at least five times.  One the third sighting, it split into two lights before dissappearing. My wife and I were driving back to Dallas from San Angelo, TX.  We were perhaps 40 miles outside of Coleman when I saw a light in the sky perhaos twice as big as a star, and with more of a yellowish hue.  I thought it might be just an extremely bright star, but after perhaps two seconds, it flickered and went out.  My initial reaction was that I had witnessed a shooting star, which somehow approached the earth at such an angle as to appear to not be moving (coming straight at me).  I then wondered if perhaps I had somehow witnessed the death of a star. My wife did not notice this first sighting, and I said nothing. Perhaps 3 minutes later, it reappeared at exactly the same spot in the sky, and this time, my wife noticed and asked what it was.  My next assumption was that it was a flare-gun, but I also thought that a flare should be seen falling back towards earth.  Instead, this light remained in place for several seconds, then flickered out.  We began watching the sky intently as we drove.  Perhaps 5 mintues passed, and again the light appeared, in what I would guess to be the same place.  (We were driving, and it is possible that our road's curves would change the location of the light).  This time however, the light divided in two... but the two lights remained the same size as the first original.  Each light moved horizontally outward from the original position.  If I had been holding a ruler up against the windshield of my truck, I would say that each light moved half an inch from it's original position.  To diagram what I mean, Suppose ""O"" is the Original position, and ""N"" represents the new position of the lights.  Here is how it would look:  N<---O--->N These two new lights then flickered and went out, remaining for about the same duration as the others... perhaps 3 to 5 seconds. At least twice more we witnessed the light, but only once did it split as I described.  Each time, the instances occurred perhaps 3 to 5 minutes apart.  Due to the number of sightings being between 5 and 6, I would say the entire episode lasted perhaps thirty minutes, all while I was driving perhaps 70mph.  There were no sightings after passing through Coleman, although I did see two planes, which I would tend to describe as a ""military search plane.""",2000-01-22T00:00:00,31.8176,-99.4701

It was late afternoon but the sun was still up. My wife and I were on our way to Denver through Kansas on I-70 just passing Fort Riley army base. I saw chem trails from several jets which I found very odd because they were flying very close to the same altitude. I looked at what they might be doing when I noticed that they were flying around a white object.  I took out my binoculars and asked my wife to tell me what the white object was they were surrounding.  I then spotted another white object about the same size.  maybe a couple of thousand feet direct south from the other.  I then came to the realization that I was witnessing a very, very possible military unit responding to an actuall UFO. The objects were bright white, my wife thought they were military crafts or clouds.  But when she looked through the binoculars she said she had never seen anything like them and couldn't tell what they were.  I immediatly stopped and had to look for myself.  My father was in the air force and have seen many aircraft and weather balloons. occasions.  The thing that impressed me was when one decided he had enough or was just having fun and took off in a S.W.direction.  The one jet that had been assigned to that particular object had to put on the after burners and had a tough time catching it.  The second object followed the first.  I started driving again at 65 mph and if these things were weather balloons they were go in and out of the jet stream. We had been watching now for about an hour, the two finally were far enough to where we could only see two small white objects on the horizon, but far enough that we could no longer see the jets.  Then we saw the third and it was real close.  We could also see two jets returning back to where we first saw them.  The third object had a lone aircraft escort. We got so close, but the wierd part is how it moved when it moved it was like if you were following a rainbow(The harder we tried to close to it, it some how moved so fluid you could not detect any motion). We got real close I would say it was less than a half mile in front of us and less than a mile in altitude.  It then moved slowly away from us (East) then in less than a second it was no longer there.  Another reason I don't think it was a balloon is because the horizon was a burnt orange but the objects stayed a bright white.  The next morning my wife was sleeping and I saw another object, less than a mile off of my nine oclock.  I have to keep my eyes on the road so I kept looking forward than looking back at the object. I saw three jets speeding in the same direction of the object so I watched the object as close as I could but it did the same thing as the third object the day before.

We live about 12 miles west of the municipal airport, so we see a lot of air traffic.  A lot of the planes that I see flying over from east to west are displaying their bright white spotlights, and then it seems like once they reach altitude their spotlight goes out and then you see their blinking ""running lights""; it's pretty obvious that it's a plane.

The bright light on the right continued on about 5 more seconds, and then it went out and the running lights came on.

I kept glancing at it because it was directly in front of us and I asked my rider if she saw it too. She said she did and we discussed it's characteristics. We watched it steadily for the next ten minutes. When we first saw it it was the size of a baby aspirin at arm's length. The road was windy at times and the object would disappear behind pine trees. When the road would turn back due east it would appear again in the exact same spot. It was totally motionless and stationary in the sky. We watched it until the Perryville turnoff came up. By this time it was the size of a quarter at arm's length. Just before we turned off a vertical gray bar appeared at the front of the object and immeadiatly moved to the rear. When this happened the object faded, came back and then disappeared. My rider said ""did you see that!"" when the gray bar appeared and moved. We both agreed that we had seen the same things. The object tilted about a 10 degree angle to the horizon front to back and about 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon. The sky was clear with no other objects such as airplanes or balloons in view. There was a solid bank of low clouds on the horizon up to about 5 degrees. The object was well above the cloud bank.

Also on the mountian above there are cars that drive along the mountian, and sometimes for a few seconds you can see the headlights or tail-lights, and it looks weird if you you don't know what it is. But this was not a plane or a car. It was twice the size of a plane, and I was a few miles away. If I held up my thumb at arms lenth, my thumbnail was about the same size as what I saw. As the object flew from the radio tower toward Hot Springs tower it flew very fast. It made it in about five seconds. And when it was by the Hot Springs tower, which glows with a few orange window lights, and looks like a UFO at night. It hovered a few seconds and was about the same size as the lights in the windows of the tower. It was a little bit away from the tower, and I could see the four bright window lights twinkling. The craft appeared to be spinning. I have seen simular objects appearing just over the mountians. Once I saw the object and the four lights kind of angled downward. As I looked at it a few seconds, long enough for me to think ""I know that's no plane!"" it blinked out.",2000-05-03T00:00:00,34.450566037735854,-93.03055566037736

It was about 8:38pm CST, on Thursday April 27 when I witnessed the object. I met a girlfriend of mine in the parking lot of my apartment complex, and while she was talking with my best friends fiance(they also live in my complex) I witnessed a triangular object moving at incredible speed from the north to south. The object was lit on its underside in the shape of a rod, but I could make out a black triangular shape outside of the lit area. I could see the object moving for about 3 seconds, then it seemed to just disappear. There was no clouds in the area to hide in, so where it went is beyond me. The speed was incredible, in the couple of seconds I witnessed it it covered a good portion of the sky. To compare in speed, I witnessed the space shuttle coming back in orbit a couple of months ago, it took about 30-35 seconds to cross the horizon. If this object would have stayed visible it would have cleared the horizon in less than 10 seconds. I was fully expecting to hear a sonic boom. My best guess of the size of the object is about 3 times of the size of a 727(in comparison to a 727 flying at 30,000 feet, like this object appeared to be flying at). It definitely dodn't appear to be a meteor, becuase of the color, size, direction of movement(it moved in a staight line). It was definitely a strange site.hhhhhhhhhhhhhh",2000-05-03T00:00:00,33.04812150466045,-96.74114607190413

I am an Amateur Astronomer and on Saturday night 5/29/00 (sic),  it was the first clear night in a while over the New York area. I was trying out my new 150mm refactor telescope and I was searching for star clusters near Ursa Major. I started to set up the scope at 9 P.M., and I aligned the scope to Polaris, and was setting up the tripod for 1/2 hour at the most. I decided to search for M13 in Hercules, but it was straight overhead at R.A 16hours, and I decided not to bother since the scope would be inproperly positioned for a decent view. (Too low to the ground on a small tripod.) The time was approximately 9:30 P.M. I then decided to search for M51 in Canes Venitaci when the neighbor turned on the garage light and I waited for the light to turn off. I went into the house at this time to get a cup of coffee and proceeded to got back out to the yard after the garage light went out. I started to view in the scope at a 45 degree angle due East. After searching around a bit I saw a white rotating streak in the field of view which was spiraling but figured it was a meteor falling to Earth. No problem, a typical event to see as an Amateur astronomer. After that I pointed the scope at the Star, I believe it was Altair or Arcturus. Not sure cause I didn't have the map with me. Anyway, I decided to focus the scope on the Star to see how much cromatic distortion the scope had. After all that, I decided to stop viewing. When I got off my chair and stood up, I looked at the sky for incoming clouds and saw some coming from the West. When I turned around to the East, I saw an object, rather large hovering and moving East. The object looked disc like but it was a dark shaded craft, black/dark gray. It had 4 lights, 2 red horizontal lights pointing North/South, and the other 2 lights were green pointed East / West (toward me). The lights were mounted at exact opposites to each other. The object was rather low, around 1,000 feet and was the size of a plane. The lights did NOT blink, and the craft or object made absolutely N! O NOISE. The object was hovering but moving slowly toward the East in a bobbing up and down fashion. There were 2 slow bobbing actions while it was in  my view. It did that twice, while moving East and then it slowly moved East to the horizon and over the neighbors tree and out of my viewing sight. This sighting occurred at the 10:30 P.M. time frame. I saw it for around 10-15 seconds. I immediately went into the house to tell my relative (mother) what I had saw. The time was checked at 10:34 P.M. I was not abducted cause I had a strict account of the time. I started setting up the scope at 9:00 P.M. and I was out there for around 1.5 hours. I did not wear a watch. I used the kitchen clock for all time references. Though I live near an airport, all the planes move from South to North, and North to South always. There was never a plane moving in the West to East direction here and I 've been living here since 1969. The only aircraft were helicopters, but they make lots of noise when they come over here. THe object seemed to have appeared suddenly cause I didn't notice it come over my head from the West. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has indicated that the event occurred on 29MY00.

This is not a jet or an airplane, it is much higher, no blinking lights, like a satellite would look crossing the sky, and I am a fairly seasoned sky watcher and I know what satellites look like and this appears to be one.  And I see that it is moving from NW to SE across the face of the Big Dipper and so I pick up the binoculars and find it and all of a sudden I see 3 of them in my binocular (10 x 50) field!  At this time they are almost straight overhead.  The original one was the brightest and the others were a little fainter, you would not of been able to see them naked eye, only with the binoculars.  The fainter 2 were traveling at the same speed as the brighter one and they appeared to be ahead of the brighter one.  They all traveled together from NW to SE and of course they disappeared as they reached approximately 45 degrees above the horizon due to the city lights.  This was for real folks!  I was alone and so there are no other witnesses but I am a perfectly normal sane guy that was just out stargazing.  I don't think satellites travel in 3's like this but maybe they do.

I always smoke outside, never inside; but, I do not ever expect to see anything strange.  Barksdale Air Force Base is about three miles south of my house.  Generally, aircraft are flying about here quite frequently.  At 10:28 p.m. there were no planes, and I was thinking only of the show about to start.   I was facing directly East.  There are some street lights in backyards which illuminate trees and yards that surround my yard.  Suddenly to my left, North, I noticed something entering from behind me into my field of vision.  I turned my head to the left, North, to see something about four times the size of an eagle in flight.  It was light or off-white colored.  The shape was that of a large bird or boomerang.  Immediately, I thought, it's not a bird, maybe a big kite.  Although there was no wind, and it was travelling about the same height as the Blue Angels were a week and a half ago when they frequently flew over this same backyard preparing for their two day air show at Barksdale.   My mind quickly returned to the idea of it being a bird, but it was way too big to be a bird.  And, I wanted to see wings flap.  Rather, it just soared without any flapping.  At that time, I started to panic and think UFO because I realized there were absolutely no lights, or sounds associated with it.  I lost vision of it because of a tree line.  Although, after losing sight of it, I did move around in the yard hoping I could spot it, then became fearful and ran inside to tell my son.  It was 10:30 when I was back inside. I saw a light colored boomerang shape soaring across my backyard at 10:28 p.m. on April 28, 2000.  It was completely silent and perhaps 200 feet above me.  There are street lights inside two neighboring yards which illuminated it.  When it first came into my field of vision I was facing East, and saw something approaching from behind me which was West, and to my left, or North.  It seemed at first to be the size of a huge bird, perhaps four times the size of an Eagle's wingspread.  But, there was no sound of wings flapping.  And, there was only the movement of it travelling straight across from West to East soaring, not flapping wings.  That's when I relized that it was not a bird.  Of course, when I had initially thought of it perhaps being a bird, I also was thinking it was the biggest bird I had ever seen.  At that time I knew I was losing sight of it because it was approach a tree line which I knew would obscure it from my sight.  I quickly moved around the yard to try to catch another sight of it, but did not.  I knew that because there were absolutely no lights, nor sound, that it might have been a UFO.  I rushed inside to tell my son, and saw that it was then 10:30 p.m.  I estimate that I was looking at it soaring past me for about eight seconds, no less than five, and no more than ten seconds.  I am about to return to the yard to smoke again, and hope I get to see this once again, but I rather doubt that I will.  Silent, no lights, boomerang shape.

Red, blue, green and white. It moved at what had to be a high rate of speed left and right, stopping quickly at times and changing directions.  When I observed a jet liner heading for it I noticed it faded in brightness and remained still then resumed its right and left movement as soon as the aircraft cleared.  It finally lowered so that we lost sight of the ""object""at approximately 23:00 PM Object, at first appeared to be an overly bright star.  The abrupt right and left movements said differently.  It was located in the lower northwest sky of my home, in the direction of Lake Pleasant, but further out.  The object had flickering lights of red, blue, green and white and looked as if it was rotating to show the different colors as they would be bright then fade and the other color would take its place. When I saw it head one direction then stop and head back as if in a straight line to it's starting point and repeat the movement in the other direction  <----x----> I was very sceptable, but curious. Sometimes it would move in one direction in short bursts then reversed and do the long movement. From my perspective it was moving approximately three inches in one direction then reversing to go back to it's original spot.  The short burst were about one inch in length and it was either three burst or two at a time.  I am not sure how that would calculate in miles.  The distance is too great to even estimate for me. I called my daughter out to confirm.  She said she was seeing the same thing.  She called her boyfriend out and he also saw what we were seeing.  We watched this strange occurance for about 45 minutes, using other stars and hand held object to determine if it was a star or something else.  The hand held object were stationary and the ""object"" was mobile.  It kept the same distance from the reference star until it slowly lowered and disappeared from our sight, the reference star(Cappella) remained where it was. This is my third sighting in 53 years.  At age 9 I witnessed a group of 5 lights dancing (moving up and down and sideways and going brighter and fading) on the horizon while I lived in Tucson, AZ. Tucson has no street lights in 1956. There were about 100 people, police and military included, who witnessed the event. My Dad a military man was told not to say anything.  That was in the days of ""Project Bluebook"". In 1976 I saw a strange object in the sky near Redlands, CA.  My date and I watched it ""hover"" for about 15 minutes then shoot off at a 45 degree angle and disappear.  The newspaper report that several people in that area witnessed the same thing. When I checked the sky on the night of May 4, 2000 It did not see anything unusual as I had the night before. Our reference star was, however, present. ADDENDUM TO REPORT (Submitted 05MY00): I would like to change my report given to you last night.  Details below After summiting my report I again found myself in my backyard, but at a later time.  When I looked where I had seen the ""object"" the night before I again witnessed the ""light"" doing the same movements with the same color changes. (Red, blue, green and white) I now feel that it is a star and as the earth rotates changing the placment of the stars this particular one is in an area that distorts it due to something in our atmosphere.

About 9:05 am i saw what looked like a single white/silver object circling in the air due west and about 45 degrees off the horizon. This aircraft I presume to be circular or egg shaped since it appeared ovallike at that angle of viewing. It appeared to be at a high altitude since it was small and so I don't really know how big it might really be. This object moved in a tight circular pattern, presumably observing something. It moved incredibly rapidly from my vantage point, over 600 miles per hour or so. It turned too tightly and too fast to be any known type of jet of aircraft and did not leave any trails, which a jet would have, at that height. The craft did not make any perceivable type of noise and did not emit any other things. There were no other aircraft in the area. It repeated the same manuever for about a minute before very rapidly zooming off towards the northwest at an even higher rate of speed. Again it made no visible or audible marks and this puzzled me as to how an aircraft could travel(presumably)several times the speed of sound and not produce a sonic boom After disappearing no other objects like it were visible and i could see no other evidence of its presence.

I am an aviation buff, and I have never seen any man-made aircraft move across the sky this fast. I would estimate it covered at least 30 or 40 miles in those few seconds. The duration of it's appearance was approx 4 or 5 seconds, and it appeared at though it was heading at a 30 degree angle toward the ground. It was impossible to tell how far away it was, but it moved NW toward the mountains and disappeared over the horizon. I watched for a flash from an explosion, but never saw one. I assume it was moving toward the NW and simply was following the earth's curvature. I'd be curious if anyone in the Phoenix or Las Vegas areas witnessed it as well. It was impossible to see what shape it was; all you could see is a brightly blinking white light. I have watched many satellites and jet aircraft cross the skies at night here in the desert, but I have NEVER seen something moving this fast. There was no sonic boom, or noise of any kind from the object.  Also, at the same time, I saw the lights of an approaching jet airliner from roughly the same direction.  The jet was inbound from the NW, heading for Tucson Intl, and it took about 10-15 minutes for it to come close enough to my viewpoint to identify it as an aircraft. I wonder if the crew on that aircraft saw this object, which was heading roughly toward it's path? The weather was clear, with a bright, full moon.

The craft was flying low in front of me, only a couple of hundred feet up, and passed out of sight behind some low hills to the west.  Its flight path was a straight line with no sudden accelerations.  There were two oddities:  it was going very slowly for such a narrow, wingless hull, and it wobbled quite noticeably. Traveling north on I-5 on clear, moonless night, with desert mountains on the right, low hills on left, and no trees anywhere, my attention was drawn to my right, where, over the crest of the mountains, I saw what appeared to be a plane with multiple white lights, such as are turned on when a large plane is about to land.  The lights were numerous and extremely bright and the object was flying low over the mountain on a bearing from northeast to southwest, a diagonal to the oncoming north-south traffic.  I looked at it for awhile, remarking to myself how bright it was (""never seen that many lights on a plane before,"" I thought), then I looked back to the road to keep my eye on oncoming traffic.  The object crossed the road and I realized it was traveling quite slowly, about on a par with the automobiles (45 to 65 mph).  As it passed from the right side of the road to the left at a distance of at most a half a mile, I could see that it was illuminated from stem to stern by brilliant white lights of varied shape.  The lights were confined to the perimeter of the craft, which became apparent because the ""plane"" (I was still under the impression that it was an ordinary jetliner about to land at an unknown airfield over the hills to my left), was wobbling about its central axis.  As it wobbled I could see that the lights clearly outlined an elongated triangle.  The triangle was shaped like a spearhead, much longer on its sides than its base was wide, with quite a sharp point.  There were no wings, and no stabilizer that I could make out, except perhaps a low fin-like ridge (also triangle shaped) toward the rear, but I wouldn't swear to it).  It occurred to me at this point that I might be seeing one of the famous flying triangles from the Netherlands flap, or such as had been reported in Lancester (which it so happens was east of my location, though I did not know it at the time), or in upstate New York.  I was incredulous at the triangular shape of the craft, so I did my best to confirm it by focusing my a! ttention between the lights on the shadowy contours.  I recall remarking to myself several times that, yes, it WAS a triangle, because the ENTIRE perimeter of bright white lights was filled in by the dark shadow of the hull, occluding stars or terrain that passed behind the craft.  More about the lights:  All were bright white, similar to the new halogen lamps on automobile headlights.  However, they were not of uniform shape.  Some were roundish, others were blobby, or egg shaped.  It was an impressive array in sheer number and in variety, but all were confined to the edges of the craft, except ONE.  On the underbelly of the craft, about where you would find the center of gravity, there was a slowly blinking RED light.  It was this red light that made me think it was definitely a terrestrial or military craft.  As the craft neared the hills to my left, now at about an 8 o'clock position, taking I-5 North as my 12 o'clock pointer, I saw the tail section of the craft outlined.  It was diamond-shaped, similar to the tail section of, for want of a better comparison, the Imperial Star Destroyer in the STAR WARS movies.  In other words, it was like two long isosceles triangles joined at the base.  The craft passed out of sight over the low hills to the left, much lower now than the mountains to the right where it had first appeared.  As I drove up I-5 about a mile farther, I looked to the left to see the ""airfield.""  Instead I saw that there were city lights there in the distance, though I'm not sure which city it was or how far away (see the map I will send in the mail for my best guess).  As the craft passed out of sight I was struck by how much the craft wobbled, but I remarked to myself, ""Well, that's what you'd expect from a plane with a wing-shape like that.""  But I was tired: it occurred to me later that this craft didn't have enough wing surface to keep it up AT ALL when flying at that slow speed, unless my sense of distance and time was badly off.  I would expect that only a supersonic jet flying at several hundred miles per hour would be able to stay aloft with a wing pattern such as I saw.  My final verdict is ""undecided, need more information.""  Whatever I saw, it was quite unusual, and it kept me thinking for the rest of the night.",2000-04-01T00:00:00,34.12998527397261,-118.14257345890411

He said that if he had measured it in the car window it may have been about 1 1/2 to 2 inches long. He's not sure about the width as his view was partially obscured from the trees. He noticed it for quite a few minutes from what I gather. He said it didn't seem to move, in fact it seemed to follow his car. He said it was very bright and was greenish/white in color. He thought he'd get a better view when he came around a curve and it was less wooded. When he did, where this object should have been it was just gone. He slowed down and looked for it but it was gone. I believe he said it was in the western sky.  If it helps, on the map we're about in the middle of Tennesse, nearly on the TN/KY border.

My wife wrote to you earlier of my observation.  I was traveling home on the evening of the 16th, and at 6:05 p.m., a light out of the corner of my eye caught my attention.  When I looked up into the sky, just above the woodline, I saw a streak of white light with a greenish tint to it traveling very slow in a northern direction.  There seemed to be broken up in sections, like the lights might have been windows.  I had heard earlier that day that there was a meteor shower scheduled for that evening, so I thought I was seeing one of the meteors.  But it traveled so slowly, so I continued to watch it while driving down this curvy road.  The view of the object was cut-off by the woodline every so often so I couldn't tell if it was a low flying airplane of some sort.  I've been in the reserves for 13 years now and I've flown in transport planes and they can fly at a very slow rate also, so my next guess was that, maybe a C-130 or something like that.  I knew that in a moment I would come to a clearing and I would get a good view of the craft, because by the time I came to a curve, the object was completely obscured by the woodline.  When I came to the clearing, which was only 8 seconds from the last time I saw the object, it had vanished.  It was a clear, starlit night.  I heard nothing, but I had the windows up.  There wasn't any traffic in front of me or behind me during this event.  It wasn't a reflection of any lights on the inside of the vehicle or the other side of the vehicle.  The craft, or object, was moving ever so slow in the same direction as I went around a few curves.  I'm not a believer in UFO's, but I don't renounce them either.  I'm the type of person who has to see it to believe it.  I would like to know what it was though.  I know the heading of the craft is right because the next morning (this morning) I took a compass to the sight and noted my bearing.  Just thought you'd like to know.

Now I started thinking something was strange as everything around me started getting very bright. The object stopped in  south of me  almost instantly and kind of hovered for about 15 to 30 seconds.

It rapidly moved east as could see it for sometime. I could see it glwoing as it went through a small cloud cover and I could then see it going straight upwards.

The light landed at Holloman AFB ever so slowly decellerating to a stop on the airstrip. As the light decended there were 3 stealth fighter jets circling at approximately a 14 mile radius. All 3 jets landed directly after the event. As we were leaving the White Sands Natl. monument at approximately  19:15 pm mst. after watching the solstice full moon rise, I noticed due east a  piercing white light, about half the size of my little finger held at arms length, decending from approx. 5000 ft. vertically very slowly toward the middle of Holloman AFB. I stopped the car, grabbed the binoculars, and watched the object decend for approx. 2 minutes. 2 others got out of the car and 2 others watched from within the car. I noticed 3 circling stealth f-117 nighthawks circling the light in an approx.14 mile diameter circle. The object was approx 7 miles away and through the binoculars looked just like a very bright light with no stobes, beacons , or any other kind of aircraft type navigational lights. As the object neared the ground I noticed the underside of the light changing to a mellow yellow-gold glow. I then passed the binoculars off to another friend. The light did not seem to stop and hover, it decended in a very deliberate yet exponetially slower manner until it landed at what appeared to be the middle of the airfield. I could not resolve a shape to the intense light, yet at the same distance I had no problem resolving the very dim navigational lights outlining the circling stealth jets. The light could have been a helicopter with some sort of amazingly bright battlefield night light, or an aircraft with a super set of landing lights approaching head on from my position, but from my perspective it definitely looked like a vertical decent of a very bright star with no discernable outlines of any solidity. I could hear the stealth as they flew overhead, but there was no sound from the starlike object. The 2 of us outside with the binoculars were impressed  and amazed that our airforce has come so far with their technology, the others observing from within and outside the car didn't think much of bright lights descending into an airbase and dismissed our awe as silliness.

On Wednesday, December 22, at 10:30PM Central time, I went out to take some pictures of the Moon when it was supposedly 16% brighter than normal.  I stood in the courtyard of our appartment complex and snapped 3 fotos of the Moon in about 10 seconds.  I viewed each shot on the digital display, on the back of my camera, just to mak sure the shot was good, and then immediately took another shot.  I was unaware of anything in the photos but the Moon and the sky.  It was only after downloading them into my computer, and viewing them, was I able to detect a strange green dot in each of the images.  I use a viewing program called ""ACDSee"" that really puts up the images fast, so, after noticeing the green dot in each one, I clicked on each image in succession, and could detect that whatever it was, it moved from left to right and then back left again.  I then decided to enlarge and enhance them to try to detect what the object actually looked like.  It turned out to look somewhat like a marker-bouy, possibly hexagonal at the bottom, and with a center that protruded upward from the larger haxagonal platform at the bottom.  After enhancement, the object in the 3rd image seems to have a yellow luminance on the tip of the protrusion, but the object definately has a green appearance overall.

It did not seem to move and after a few minutes I reached for binoculars (always at hand for bird-watching) and continued talking while gazing at the object.  It was the size of a large comet but flattish on bottom and rounded on top, with not-quite-sharply-defined edges.  It wavered and shimmered like something seen through heated air.  It was quite beautiful: my subjective reaction.  I am in my 60's, have spent much time gawking at the skies, but have never seen anything comparable.  It was absolutely not a cloud, nor a flock of birds.

I awoke around 4:00 am on Christmas morning due to a bright light outside my window.  I'm a light sleeper, but I was roused from my slumber because I felt like something was ""out-of-place.""  It was a weird intuitive feeling that someone/something was outside peering in.  I had the window blinds open and since I'm nearsighted, the bright light was blurry and very large (grapefruit size) through the glass, until I put my glasses on, then as the light came into focus, I could tell that it was something in the sky.  I watched it for a bit, but after seeing that the light was stationary, my curiousity prevented me from going back to sleep.  The light hovered; it was not a airplane or helicopter.  And there were smaller red lights, located around the edges of the white central light, which blinked slowly.  As I watched the light through the window on and off for over an hour (I finally got up and got ready for a trip to see family), I noticed that the light moved from window pane to another; meaning that it was slowly moving across the sky.  The UFO was hovering above the ground at what I would estimate at several hundred feet (a little higher than a radio or cell tower).  My window faces south/southwest so the UFO was hovering above northern Williamson County, TN; I live in southern Davidson County near Brentwood.  My apt. is on the 3rd floor atop a good-sized hill, so I have a fantastic view of the horizon through my bedroom window. I'm a 31-year old, well-educated, white male, and I have seen UFOs before, but I've never reported one until now.  A UFO that I saw a couple of years ago hovering in urban Nashville was seen by several people and the local newspaper (Tennessean) ran an article, but I did not notice an article regarding this UFO siting.  This siting was extremely vivid and I'm convinced that it was ""real""; because the image has stuck with me, I've decided to report it to someone that might find the information useful.",2000-01-07T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

She came out and I asked her if she saw the object or heard any sound.  At this time the object was passing overhead at about a 15 degree angle.  She could not see it, I supposed because her eyes were not yet accustomed to the light.  I continued to observe and I got a real good look at it.  There was no moon to the south/east/north so it was not a shadow.  I could not see a defined leading edge of the ""wing"", it looked so black and impossibly thin.  It almost reminded me of smoke.  I kind of thought it was a flock of geese, but it did not change shape.  As I continued looking I could see the faded orange glow of the Poughkeepsie Galleria mall lights along the rear edge.  I could see surface texture so the object was not smooth.  The orange glow was jagged, and there was a small ""squarish"" bump on the right side.  The craft still made no noise.  I continued to study the object untill it dissapeared from view in the treeline.  I estimate the size of the object to be approximately 200 to 300 feet wide from tip to tip.

I heard my husband calling the cat to let it out the door near the room where I was sleeping.  The door closed with a familiar bang and a short time later I heard my husband talking quite loudly in the hallway.  It sounded like he was talking with my daughter and I changed my position in bed, straining to hear what they were talking about, wondering if I should get up and perhaps reassure my daughter for some reason.  Their voices were loud but the tonality wasn't stressed or upset so I just continued to listen very carefully trying to hear what they were talking about.  There was qite a bit of loud opening and closing of doors  and a very loud thump on the wall behind my pillow which confused me.  I tried to figure out what would make such a sharp loud bang on the wall.  I at first though maybe our dog could have somehow made the noise but quickly realized the dog could not have hit the wall because of a low stack of firewood that would prevent the dog from getting close to the wall.  I then wondered why the dog wasn't barking.  If someone was in our yard the dog is slightly aggresive and would surely bark.  At the same time I started wondering about a very, very loud mechanical whirring noise outside my window.  It was a noise I recognized as hearing before but had never been able to really identify or explain.  It was much louder than usual.  Near this same time my body felt suddenly electrified as if a force field or some kind electromagnetic field was emanating from and enveloping me.  It was a light buzzy type of feeling I somehow felt responsible for but then I felt a discrete circle of electricity, like a hula hoop, pass up my body up past my head and then back down my body again.  It was a very powerful force and made every small hair on my body stand on end as it passed up and down me just once.  As it passed over my head I felt a little worried that it would pull me right out of my body and did my best to hold on tight.! I was actively trying to figure out what was going on and streams of rational explanations ran through my mind and were discarded.  As my eyes shifted to follow the pattern of exposure to the strange electric field I noticed a dark ephmeral figure at my bedside.  It was about even with where my hands were folded on my chest and I had the impression it was holding me in place.  I stared wide-eyed at it, not particularly frightened but angry that it was violating my personal space.  I immediately noted a much larger figure directly  looming over my head from behind me.  I could just see the edges of its presence and thought it odd that it could get between my pillows and the bedroom wall.  I wanted to  push the smaller bedside creature away from me but knew I couldn't move my hands or legs, so , instinctually, I raised my head in its direction, gave a little snarl and bit at it!  Even at the point of doing it I realized what a strange funny thing that was to do and was a little amused at myself.  It was very irritating to have these things so close to me but I didn't really seem to have much choice.  I was still trying to figure out what was happening to me.  I started to think back to some experiences I had had years ago and recalled that a psychic had told me I was being crowded by spirits who wandered towards me because I was so bright.  The psychic had helped me send the spirits away and told me if and when I meditated to stay in the Christlight.  I wasn't sure if this experience had anything to do with spirits but I was comforted to know I could perhaps look for the Christlight to protect myself.  At the time I couldn't remember the term 'Christlight' and instead started mentally asking for the Godlight and then I asked  Christ to protect me a couple of times and finally and suddenly the creatures were gone.  One of the most striking things about this experience was the distinct way the whirring sound from outside slowly moved away when the creatures left.  As the sound from outside receeded I was left froz! en in ab solute stunning silence.  I laid there for only a moment impressed with the incredible absence of sound and  awestruck by how deafeningly loud things had been just moments ago, and then realizing I was able to move again I lept out of bed and ran into the hallway to check on my family.  They were all absolutely sound asleep.  I tried to wake my husband (who sleeps in a seperate room) to find out why he had been talking to my daughter earlier but he was really sound asleep and wouldn't reply to me.  I checked the children again and even looked outside for the dog, who was also asleep in her doggie bed.  I walked around the house and looked out the windows and opened the front door to see if I could hear anything like the whirring noise but all was silent. I was a little frightened at this time but I decided whatever had just happened was beyond my control and there for some reason just wasn't much point in being scared about it.  I went back to bed, turned on all the lights in my room, noted it was just after 5am, and laid there trying and make sense of the whole experience.  I relfected back onto the very vivid dream I had been having just before I had woken up and all this had taken place.  I wondered if the dream had anything to do with the experience I had just had.  In the dream I had been participating in some kind of a game show.  It was sunny and bright.  I was required to dress in a bright yellow pantsuit with little fuzzy white socks and white clogs like nurses sometimes wear.  I remember dressing and thinking the fuzzy socks were funny but that I needed to wear them to be eligible for the game show.  I was very happy and peaceful throughout the dream.  Anyway, after dressing I drove to a large marble office type building with a large airy anteroom and lots of glass windows and large smooth marble pillars.  A smiling man in a normal looking business suit greeted me warmly and put his arm on my shoulders to guide me to my first task.  He was talking to me and kind of giving me a little orientation so I would know what was coming next and I could do my best to win the game.  It didn't seem like a usual game show.  There were no lights or cameras and no audience just a few people here and there walking about in the background.  I noticed there was a gentleman just ahead of me in line for the tasks.  The first task my guide said apologetically was to spin horizontally about six inches off the marble floor of the room.  He put his arm around me and placed a little yellow piece of plastic the shape of small ruler but different ( I can't describe it but could draw it) in front of us and we kind of fell forward like we would hit the floor but instead began to spin over the yellow object.  I was smiling.  It only lasted a couple of seconds and then we ju! st stood up and the guide told me I had done very well, much better than the fellow before me.  I was quite proud of myself.  Next we turned to where another man was holding a large book.  He put the book very close to my face and then slowly drew it away from me.  I didn't think I could read or recognize what he was showing me but everyone seemed pleased.  Behind him was a very large blue screen with white letters or symbols being quickly flashed on it.  I was allowed to look at the screen for a few moments and then I was taken to another large screen and allowed to sit down and watch the symbols being scanned onto it.  The letters or symbols were moving very quickly similar to scanning rapidly through text on a computer screen.  I didn't feel that I could understand any of what I was being shown because it was moving so fast, but again it seemed they thought I was doing a good job.  In my dream this game show thing went on for three days because I kept doing a better job than the other contestants.  Finally on the third day I was used to the routine and the guide and people working there were like old friends.  On that third day, at the point after the spinning session, when the man showed me the book, I recognized the particular book he showed this time and I recognized words on the cover of the book and being normal english letters.  The book cover included the word 'Fisher' and I knew it from the scientific supply company from which I sometimes order supplies in my 'real life'.  I was very interested to see this book and I wanted to look at it longer.  It suddenly struck me that what I was being shown was very important if only I could understand it.  I felt that book had valuable information related to my field of biology in it and I wanted very badly to have a longer look at it.  Instead I was directed to the seat and the usual blue screen where I studied the flashing symbols until I was done for the day.  I felt that they didn't realize that I couldn't understand the information on the screen because it ! was movi ng so fast.  I then thought maybe the information was somehow being absorbed by me but then reconvinced myself that they had just made a slight error in their planning and that they really didn't know I wasn't able to read the symbols so quickly.  I felt that they thought they were doing a very good job, a good thing.  This third day I was told I was the winner and I would be getting my prize in a few days.  I was very happy and wondered what my prize would be.  I knew it would be something really good. I woke from the dream feeling very proud of myself and contented and excited about the prize.  Then I started having the experience already  discussed at the beginning of this letter.  I feel strongly that the dream and the experience following are related. I am not a very religous person or someone who has spent more than a casual amount of time investigating the psychic world etc.  I have had some other strange experiences that could be considered both paranormal and otherworldly in the past and my interest in these matters has stemmed from a desire to explain what I have experienced.  On your web-page introduction the question ""Why me?"" grabbed me by the shirt front.  I am an open minded, creative, intelligent person but mostly no different from anyone I know.  I certainly don't look remarkable though not hideous.  42 years old, married 20 years, mother of two, student of genetics and developmental biology soon to be a college professor.  Can you help me discover the purpose behind this phenomenon and help me figure out, why me?  I apologize for the somewhat jumbled nature of this letter.  I am relieved to get it written down at least.",1999-11-23T00:00:00,34.29657455830389,-119.23991625441697

Out of the corner of my eye I saw a large light in the sky approaching from the NE.  At first it reminded me of a spotlight.  I watched it briefly(3 or 4 seconds at most) before it seemed to disappear behind some very faint and thin clouds low in the southern sky, which was my first indication that it was not a light originating from the ground since it was visible in clear skies but not visible when it entered the lightly clouded area. The light was sort of a semi-circle, boomerang, like shape that kinda reminded me of a bird.  I concluded that it was not a bird, however, because birds are not luminescent and the sun was completely set.  Also the bird would have had to have been ENORMOUS to take up as much sky as it did at an altitude that was obviously higher than the thin clouds(which were very high).  The color was sort of pinkish-brown if that makes sense.  Not all that bright but clearly visible because it was first caught in my perifreals. No lights or blinkers. No sound.

This however was no aircraft I have ever seen before. The 3 lights were steady, not blinking in any way, and not red or green like typical aircraft lights. They were not traveling very fast, maybe between 300 and 600 km/h. At first it looked like one triangular object with 3 lights at each corner, but then one of the lights began to shift position rapidly, changing the appearance/angle of the triangular craft. This led me to believe that I was seeing three separate objects with one steady light each, flying in a very precise geometric formation, until they began to shift. The sighting lasted only 15-20 seconds because we lost sight of it as it moved further away. It was a clear night with considerable air traffic. There were several commercial airliners in the sky in various altitudes around the time of the sighting. This was definitely not one of them though.

Watched two flying objects headed NW, very low, very slow, at junction of Duamish River and West Seattle Bridge. At approx 1949 hrs I witnessed two large low flying objects. These objects appeared to be less than 2000' in altitude. Unknown speed, but very very slow. I work in an environment that is located right on the water of the Duamish River, and adjacent to the West Seattle Bridge. As this employment results in working all shifts day or night, I physically see numerous aircraft arriving and departing Boeing Field which is very close by. The ONLY two times that I have physically seen ANY aircraft in this area that were as low as the two objects sighted was the departure of Air Force 1, and the Blue Angels. Even Air Force 1 was travelling faster on dearture (which went directly over me) than these two sighted objects. Although the shape was hard to discern, there were two distinctive white strobe type lights on what appeared to be the outer edges of the objects, both had the same lighting structure, which I also will state I have never seen this type of lighting on commercial aircraft landing at Boeing Field. NOTE: C17 link below has a excellent pic of a up close wing tip, I cannot see a large type beacon/strobe that would simulate the type of strobe I witnessed. Both objects were (to my experience and location) too far east for a Boeing Field departure, and were almost directly above the River. They then passed over the West Seattle Bridge and did not appear to change altitude or speed, they continued this heading until my view was blocked by buildings, and cargo cranes on the north side of the bridge. I did not see these objects again, however, listening to Art Bell and hearing Peter speak of this event at the end of the 10:00 hr, my shift change took place at 11:00pm, I then immediately turned on KIRO 7 Eyewitness news @ 11, newsperson Hutchinson addressed the sighting and to the best of my recollection she stated that the DOD informed their  office of 2 F117A's, out of McCord Air Force Base.

My bedroom window faces south, so I get a good view of planes landing at Boeing Field, and lights moving outside don't usually get me thinking.  This time, it was different.  The lights were moving too slow and their altitude was too low for them to be on a landing path.  At first glance, I thought they looked like Boeing 777s.  But at a closer look, things didn't seem to add up.  There were two craft, both moving at 200-250 mph.  Their altitude was approximately 2000 feet and they were lined up precisely one behind the other and about 1000 feet distance.  Their running and strobe lights were all green, which I know does not comply with FAA regulations.  They were noisy, just like any commercial jet aircraft. Their course never deviated at all, until they were out of sight.  What puzzled me the most is that they came back in the exact same formation ten minutes later, moving at the same speed, altitude, and direction as before, until they disappeared into the southeastern sky.  My home is located in the Panther Lake area of East Hill in Kent, Washington.

While walking back to our apartment my girlfriend and I noticed a bright star-like object in the sky.  The object was coming from the east, star-like object in the sky. The object was coming from the east, traveling in a westerly direction toward us. (We are 6 miles from the west coast of Florida) The object grew larger in size as it approched us. The only way to explain it is that it was a large mass of light, white in color. Our first thought was that is was something launched from the cape, but as it got closer we could tell that it was traveling at a rather low altitude. Suddenly it dropped something from the bottom of it like glowing embers that rained toward the ground. When it dropped the embers, the color of the light mass turned to a more reddish color. It continued to move closer to us, and turned to the south. At it's closest point to us we could see that something large was projecting from the light mass. I believed it to be a flat beam of light however my girlfriend believes that it looked like it was of substance, and not light.  It slilently moved by us slower than a plane, but faster than a balloon. As it traveled away from us to the south it's color slowly changed back to more of a white color. When it was a couple of miles away it again dropped these embers, which again rained down through the sky, and it again turned to a more reddish color. The object was visible for about 10 minutes until it was just a small red star in the distance, and then we lost sight of it. I'm not good with altitudes, but if i had to guess I would say that it was only a couple of thousand feet up. As far as size, the light mass seemed to be about 100 feet in diameter, and whatever was prjecting from it was three times that width. I am 38 years old, a college graduate, a business owner, and until now, a non-believer in UFO's.  Whatever this was, it was like nothing that I have ever seen before.  It prompted me to call law enforcement, and my local newspaper.

My wife and I sat in the car with our windows down and intently watched as these objects not only flew in intelligent formation but at times changed formation as follows:  First..  They were flying staggered vertically..  Then two of the lower ones flew directly along side each other.. almost touching each other.  Immediately after that, One of those objects flew below the other then in a counterclockwise rotation.. arced up and around the other object, then resumed position again along side it.. shortly after this four of the objects began flying in a straight line vertically one over the top of the other flying east to west.. almost seemed to be hovvering at a slow speed.. so it seemed.  The highest object which will call the fifth object appeared to always stay a little bit ahead of the rest of the objects below it.. almost as if It was the lead object, and always stayed to the left of the objects.  After the lower objects flew a couple of arial acrobatic moves , the next too above them also made a few arial moves then the lower objects appeared to one by one rapidly speed away till they disappeared..  From the bottom one by one..

As I came into a clearer view of the sky I saw a round black object remaining motionless. Initially I thought this was simply a child's balloon that had been lost. This was near a supermarket so this does happen sometimes. However, this thing (judging by its distance and height) was far too large to be a balloon, also its stillness was strange enough to capture my attention. After about ten minutes planes began to appear, one with the black exhaust trail. Within a  minute of the planes' appearance the object began moving away in an arc, and was gone within a minute or so. I thought I may have seen some movement on the sides of the thing, not unlike the movements of a bird's wings (this is perhaps the strangest part of the whole affair). My initial thought was weather balloon, yet this was in a very populated area and no where near the airport or weather stations. Also, the absence of lights on the object, to me, disqualified it as a plane. I had been pulled over in the parking lot of a supermarket, when I came out there were planes all over the sky, six all at about the relatively same altitude and running parallel.

Feb.16,2000 I had just come out of the logli's grocery store on State st. in Rockford, IL. I placed my groceries in the van and turned to return my cart, that is when I saw four amber orbs in the night sky. Three of the orbs formed a triangle, while one was positioned down below.The orbs were a very bright amber color, a bit larger then the north star at it's largest. The orb  that formed the left point of the triangle was a floater. It floated between the top orb and the bottom orb. The moon was 3/4 full and it was a cold,clear well lite night.I called to a gentleman getting out of his vehicle and he stood for a couple of minutes and watched them with me.... he had also never seen anything like them.I was not sure of there altitude so I got in the car to drive closer. After only a short distance they began to leave, so I pulled into a quiet paking lot behind Khols on State st.and watched. They would blink briefly then zoom into the southern sky. I watched until all you could see was a pin point and then the orb would be gone. Each one left individually. I am the wife of a pilot/airplane mechanic and I have speant much of my adult life with my eyes pointed toward the sky, but never have I seen such a sight as I saw on Feb 16,2000. As I said before it was a very clear well lite night. The stars were beautiful and the moon was approximately 3/4 full.... but nothing compaired to the four amber colored orbs that floated in the night sky over Rockford,IL. When I first saw the orbs it was 9:30 pm, I had just looked at my watch upon leaving the store that I was coming out of. After placing my groceries in the van I saw the orbs glowing in the night sky. I quickly scanned the surrounding sky and discovered several aircraft flying in other parts of the sky, but none around the orbs. The orbs did not have any other colored lights on them that would indicate that they were an FAA approved aircraft.After observing them for several minutes, I also ruled out hot air balloons due to the fact that I could see stars all around the orbs. They also did not make the tell tale sound that a hot air balloon would make.I am confident that this was not one solid craft due to the fact that stars shone through the center of the triagle shape that they were forming.The orbs were very bright, but not too bright to comfotably look at with the naked eye.The orb that formed the left corner of the triagle was a floater... It first blinked a couple of times and appeared to float toward that top orb... paused...blinked... then floated to its original location. Then the whole process started again only this time it floated toward the bottom  right orb. At this point I was unable to determine what altitude all of this was taking place at, so I thought to get a better look. I got in my van and started to drive closer to them. Unfortunately as I did this one by one they would blink and disappear into the southern sky.So I opted to pull over into a parking lot behind Khols on State St. and watch.As I sat there I decided that if they were the size of a jet liner I would guess them to be at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Now I do not claim that this was their size or altitude. I am only stating that it is my best guess at an approximate altitude if they were the size of an airliner.It actually looked liked the orbs were suspended in air... I watched the last orb rapidly blink and then zoom out of sight into the southern sky. I looked down and the time was 9:40pm. I sat for a few more minutes wa! tching t he sky for any other signs of the orbs, there were none... so I headed for home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness did indicate a time in the Event Time box.

I got a few more seconds of footage before I was distracted by the other lights that where in the sky.  I think that most if not all of the other lights where commercail aircraft.  I tried taking footage of them but didn't do to well, they where further away.  This area is really close to where I saw another light in the sky back in Sept. or Oct. 99, in Windser.  It's as the crow flies about 1 to 1 1/2 miles away.  The triangle was traveling with the point in the front or pointed in the direction it was going.  it never turned up or down, left or right, yaw & roll, or speed.  I could only see the faint/small lights when it was at it's closest.  I could not make out a body or outline off the craft.",2000-04-26T00:00:00,38.6319,-122.8971

While driving on Route 341 between Kent, CT and Warren, CT, I noticed an unusually large and bright white light in the sky above a low-lying hill/mountain located to the north.  The sky was still somewhat light from the daylight. I continued to drive, glancing at the light for a few minutes, at which point I realized that it was too large to be a star and/or a planet (and probably still too early in the evening to even make out a star/planet).  The light was shaped like a triangle with rounded corners, and there was a slight illumination around the outside. It was not moving, but stationery. As I continued to drive, I pondered what it could possible be, thinking that it might be a weather balloon or perhaps a helicopter of some sort.  I slowed my car to really focus in on it.  And then just stopped.  All of sudden, it was directly above my car, clearly visable from the driver's side window.  The movement from the distance was undiscernable, and as to whether I really saw movement or not is beyond me. The object that was above me was made up of maybe 10 or 11 very large bright white lights -- kind of like klieg lights -- maybe six of which arced around one side of it, and the others staggering away from the arc -- I believe these ones were a bit smaller.  Almost like an arrow with a rounded point. (It would be best to show it drawn.) The lights were so bright, that it was impossible to see what they were attached to.  It lingered above me in the sky.  I turned off the radio and unrolled the window to see if I could hear anything.  There was no sound.  Realizing that I was stopped in the middle of the road (dangerous), I continued on the road for about 15 seconds to the nearest intersection, where I pulled off and immediately got out of the car.   Whatever it was that I had seen was no where to be seen.  After studying the sky for a minute or so, I got back in the car and drove back in the direction I had come from to see if I could find it again.  Nothing.  Continued on my way (stopping in the town of L! itchfiel d) to meet a friend of mine in Waterbury for the evening.  While telling her about what I had seen, the color left her face.  During the afternoon, she had received a call (she thought it was around 3pm or 3:30pm) at the newspaper from a male who had witnessed a similar event with a friend while leaving the Home Depot.  For natural reasons, this added validity to what I had experienced.  This morning (Monday, January 10), I contacted the FAA, who directed me to the UFO reporting center. If you would like to contact me, I have provided my work phone number (thus, a collect call would probably not go over real well...).  I would be more than willing to speak to someone at my expense if a mutually agreeable time could be arranged.",2000-01-22T00:00:00,41.7287,-73.4551

The viewing location was in my pasture about 32 miles west of Tulsa, Okla and 5 miles south, in the area 6 miles west and 2 1/2 miles south of Mannford, Okla near 2 east and 2 south of Silver City, Okla (but it's probably not on a map). About 1 1/2 hours after sunset my wife and I were unloading hay out in an open pasture for the cattle. The evening was cool, clear, and silent, with no wind or clouds,and I don't believe there was any moon yet. I saw the Orion constellation in the east and looked higher and saw the constellation above Orion that looks like a little letter ""Y"". Directly over my head I noticed a bright roundish object moving at a high rate of speed from due west to due east. It was brighter than any star in the sky and appeared to be a single glob of white light. Thinking it to be a meteorite I told my wife to look straight up. She did and listening, there was no sound, and no trail behind it or anything. I then noticed motion in the southern sky and saw an identical bright white object speeding due north. Both objects were now in clear view and I judged by their heading, that they would barely miss crashing into one another. They kept coming, never slowed, and they didn't burn out or weaken in intensity of their light. They both seemed fairly large considering the distance, or altitude they seemed to be at, larger than a big jetliner I would say, yet there was no noise, no vapor trail, no winding jet turbo-drone type sound, and going way too fast, yet it was perfectly quiet. The object coming from the south passed just over the top of the object coming from the west and both continued straight ahead on their same respective courses. As I watched the first object continue due east, it unexpectedly disappeared at about a 60 degree angle up from the east horizon as measured along the path of my line of vision. It went from full bright white, to dim blue white, to gone in half a second. No sparks, no tail, no trail, nothing. I looked back north to the other object and it continued bright and was getting further away, racing along at the same high speed. Low on the horizon to the east I could see the soft glow of the city lights from Tulsa, hidden from my view by hills, yet illuminating the humidity and/or dust and pollution hanging in the air. I noticed an airplane low to the east northeast about where the Tulsa Int'l Airport is located. The plane looked like it was heading west, and probably had just taken off. The plane had a solid white light on the front and a red blinking light to the side, as is common. I strained to hear the plane, but it was still too far away, as it is at least 45 miles to where the airport is located. I realized when looking back to the bright white object that the object was traveling at least twice or more than the speed of the airplane, and was much brighter. As I watched the object speed due north, now in the distance, it suddenly dimmed to off white for a fraction of a second, then just vanished from sight. Maybe both objects individually turned off their light at different times, but there was never so much as a blink of any colored light, or any warning light, only a bright white, a single, same intensity, solid white light. I'm thinking that maybe the altitude where they were passing through was high enough that surface reflection was occuring from the sun, which had already set in the west, an hour and a half earlier. As we watched the first object speed east it could have gone into the Earth's shadow, making it invisible to us. Same with the second object a few seconds later, as it was higher because it passed over the first object at their point of crossing, so it may have reflected sunlight for a little bit longer time until it got too far to the north in the Earth's shadow and just seemed to disappear. We looked back to the airplane, and it continued it's slow progress forward. We are both used to seeing satellites circling the Earth, falling stars, meteorites, meteor showers, comet tails, etc. I've never seen anything like this, both were clearly bright, fast, and seemed to have purpose in their close pass at each other. We stood a few more minutes and looked around, scanning for more information, more clues, but there was none. I have no idea what the objects were, or what they were doing.",2000-01-22T00:00:00,36.0969,-96.3963

As I drove towards it, the light got dim and it started moving very quickly and as it passed over I saw it was a triangle shape (but the sides were concave not straight). I was leaving work very late.  I was driving west on Roosevelt Road from 25th street in Westchester.  It was a cold, clear night.  The stars were easily visible.  As I drove, I noticed a very bright light in the sky (almost exactly south southwest).  It was high enough in the sky that, at first, I thought it was a star.  But as I watched, I realized that it was really bright, which is why it caught my eye in the first place.  So bright, that when I looked away, I had blue circles in my vision.  At this point I realized that it couldn't be a star, so it must be a plane.  I continued heading in its general direction.  It appeared to be about 3 miles away or so.  I judged that it must have been over the next town, Oak Brook.  As I approached Wolf Road, the light suddenly dimmed and, for the first time, it appeared to move in my direction.  I turned south on Wolf Road because its direction seemed that it would pass over just a few blocks south of my position.  At this point, I really just wanted to see what kind of plane it was since I have never seen a headlight that bright before.  The roads were very empty that morning, so I drove very slowly with my head hanging out the window watching it approach.  I stopped directly under it as it went over.  It appeared to be triangular, except that the sides were sloped inward.  It didn't seem to be more than a few hundred feet in the air.  And it wasn't until later that I realized I never heard any noise, not even as it passed directly over me.  I didn't notice any lights on the bottom of it, but, after it passed over, I did see a blinking light on top, which appeared to be the same kind of beacon all airplanes have, with a few other red lights near the front portion on top.  It was heading directly northeast.  I realized after it passed over that I forgot to look at the front where I had seen the bright light earlier.  So, I decided to follow it.  I turned east on a side street.  I watched as it moved away, so slowly that it appeared to be floating.  I decided to! turn no rth so I could get back to Roosevelt Road and continue the chase.  I lost sight of it due to trees and houses for the two blocks ride.  When I came back out on Roosevelt Road, maybe 20 seconds later, it was gone.  I stopped my car and searched the entire sky, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I had my cell phone in my hand the entire time, but I was so distracted that I never made a call to anyone who could have witnessed it too.  So, I went home.  I didn't think that much about it until a few days later when I heard a local television station news break teaser.  It was something like, ""are there UFO's in the night skies over Illinois?""  But, I forgot to watch the news that night, so I didn't see the story.  I decided over the weekend to search the internet for the story.  That is how I came across this web site and read about some other sightings almost identical to mine.  So, I decided to report it.",2000-01-22T00:00:00,41.8487,-87.8921

We routinely sleep with our blinds open to view the stars... what few of them we can see here in the light polluted southern California sky. At about 9pm I saw what I initially thought was an unusually bright star. It was brighter than anything in the sky. I would describe it as nearly the same color as those new auto headlights... the kind that make other headlights look yellow by comparison. Same with this star -- it made the others look yellow by comparison. Another unusual attribute of this star was that it seemed to flicker more than other stars. At about 10pm I noticed that there was a red flash in the star. I got out my binoculars to confirm. The red flashing didn't look like that of an aero plane. It was random, not steady like an aircraft. My thought at this time was that is was some kind of natural space event like a sun going nova or something. I hadn't detected any movement up to this point. I called a couple of my ham radio buddies to ask if they could see it. One could view it by standing on a ladder. It's about 10:20pm now. My buddy noticed it was moving very slowly... like the minute hand on a clock. He said it was dropping relative to the phone wires. He couldn't see the red flashes per say, but thought the atmosphere was altering the color and causing the unusual flickering. We also noticed it was starting to dim. From then on I made note of the movement and brightness of the object. At this point I was thinking that it was falling out of the sky and on fire, gradually growing dimmer as the fire burned out... maybe it was a weather balloon. Eventually I threw out that idea and decided it was not falling but remaining an the same altitude and moving south-west away from me... growing dimmer as the distance increased. I continued to observe the object until about 11:15 pm when it went dimmed to nothing. My opinion at this time, Sunday morning, it that this was some kind of very high altitude aircraft.",2000-04-15T00:00:00,33.68843322932917,-118.00499422776912

While playing a medieval type re-enactment game, on 4/29/00  Myself and at least 5 others witnessed this event.  I was looking up at the sky waiting for a sword combat to be worked out and I noticed a light high up in the sky. (I used to fly planes and I am currently a student at an accredited aeronautical school).  I first figured it to be a plane due to the close proximity of the sighting location to the Pittsburgh International Airport.  I then however noticed a second light directly behind the first and they were moving the same speed as each other.  I then believed the objects to be in a formation at high altitude.  I then noticed a third light somewhat down and back from the second I noticed.  This formed a sharp triangle formation. (This still could have been military aircraft flying in a formation)  However,  When this triangular formation flew infront of stars, the star was blocked from vision until the object had passed.  This suggested a definite mass in between the lights.  I then began to look at it as a triangle.  These lights could not have been an aircraft, because the formation was spread quite far(suggesting a large object).  Had this been a jet on a very low inbound approach, the jet would have passed over us at about 100 feet and the noise would have been deafening. (So an airplane is ruled out).  The mass blocking the stars suggests that this was not 3 aircraft in a formation at high altitude.  This leaves only one classification: (Unidentified Flying Object).  At least 5 others witnessed this event, one witness in a different location than myself and the others.  I am also sure, that Pittsburgh International Airport must have picked up this event on their radar.  That would be a logical place to start an investigation.",2000-05-03T00:00:00,,

SE to NW. No sound. Subdued lighting. I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of my job. The night was clear and I had binoculars in my car, so I was observing the Sirius star, the Orion constellation and the Pleiades. While focused on the belt of Orion a sudden blur moved across my field of vision. I quickly turned with the object and was able to discern two objects. The object which would be closest to me was the larger of the two. On this I made out to be several light sources, reddish in appearance. Simultaneously I could see the other object was smaller with what appeared to be only two light sources. No other lights, or colors were visible that I could see. What was immediately apparent was that these were at a rather low flight level and they did not emit any distinguishable sound. They were traveling at what I would state to be a speed greater then that of a commercial aircraft. I state this because my locale is home to three(3)major airports, 2(two) of them are international. JFK and NEWARK. LAGUARDIA is nearby, as are several smaller commercially used airports. So aircraft are a very common sight. You get used to seeing so many overhead. These two were not at all common. They were traveling from a south east position to a north west position. The lights were quite subdued in intensity. I compare these lights to those of any commercial and/or private aircraft that I have observed. And the lights on these two objects were dim in comparison. And I must emphasize here, there was NO SOUND. Unfortunately I can not guess at the shape(s). As I followed them it became necessary to exit my car to continue viewing them. In the moments it took the leave my car I lost them. Let me state here, that from my position on the ground I had clear sky and a rather broad scope of sky to see. But I couldn't locate them at this point. I immediately marked the time. It was 8:27pm. Living on Long Island you get used to aircraft overhead. You even get familiar with being able to see aircraft at night from a great distance. You can distinguish a jet by its speed, its apparent altitude and from the lights blinking. And of course from the sound. On very clear nights I have seen satellites in orbit with no optical assistance. I have seen shooting stars. And I have seen the occasional flare from a meteorite.  These two objects were none of the above. They were to fast. To dimly lit. And low in the sky. I am a 43yr old man. Married for 13 yrs. Have 2 children and 3 step children. I have worked in the same building for 12 years doing computer processing for banks. My hobby is photography and my vegetable garden. Prior to tonight I cannot ever recall seeing anything which would compel me to make a report. I am very familiar with the UFO issues. They have been an interest of mine for over 20yrs. Yet I have not before seen anything to call a UFO. My only reason for doing so tonight is to assist in evaluation should other reports arise from the New York area which might be similiar. I wish I could offer more detail, however I at least can offer some tracing ability if you can use it. The only other detail I can offer is that there were other aircraft in the sky at the time.

The light traveled in a southwest to north east direction across an arc of the sky roughly equal to the apparent distance between the tip of my thumb and the tip of my outstretched forefinger at arms length. The light seemed to follow  a slightly meandering path, though that might have been an optical illusion (I&#8217;ve noticed that the eye is often fooled when trying to follow the path of blinking lights, like a distant airplane, at night. While this light was not blinking, the same effect might have been occurring here.)The light started out bright white and gradually faded to a tiny dull red point before disappearing completely. In total the object was in view for 7-10 seconds. In my opinion it was moving too slow for a typical meteor. It also lacked the characteristic streak of a meteor. This light was a distinct pinprick of light throughout the observation. It actually resembled a satellite, but the fading effect and the apparent erratic course was unlike any satellite I&#8217;ve ever seen.

They will be submitting a report as well a bit later as they are not at home right now. This is as fresh as it gets as I wrote down the descritions as they talked verbatum.*** Mother and son were driving South in the town of Sycamore Ill to Dekalb, Il to visit her daughter. They were still within the city limits and on a main road when the sighting occured. The son excitedly told his mother to look out of the window to the right and at first saw the lights of a small low flying airplane. Then she saw what the son saw and she said, ""almost had a heart attack"". She pulled the car over to the shoulder extreemly quickly and both exited the car to look at the object. The mother and son both saw what appeared to be a large ""fireball"" type object streaking across the sky from the West to the East. She described the size as that of a basketball or two in diameter with a long, solid tail coming off of the end that was 10 ""heads"" long. she said that the head of it was very clearly defined and circular. They both agreed that both the head and the tail were multi-colored and that the head was mostly red with white, purple, and yellow. They both watched the event for what theysaid could have been as long as 4 minutes from the time the son saw it until it dissapeared below the horison to the East. The object was moving quickly but slow enough for them to stop get out of the car and watch it traverse the sky for some time. The son was particulary adiment on the fact that the object ""lit"" the surounding area enough that when he looked into the car he could clearly see the dirt on the floor of the car in an otherwise dark area. The woman also agreed that the surroundings were definately illuminted by the object but oculd give no exact mesurement because she never took her eyes off of the object. The woman was particulary shaken because she grew up in a house where her brother was a meterologist and spent much of her life with her head pointed to the sky and said it looked like no meteor she had ever seen. She said, ""I'm fourty years old and I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life."" The last thing she mentioned was that after the event, both her and her sons eyes ""felt strange"" and that they ""stung and felt slightly burned"". She said that her eyesight was physically diffrent as they drove on and even an hour and a half after the event when I spoke to them her eyes still felt a bit strange. Finally I asked her if she could give some kind of real life example and she said the only thing she could equate it to was how the ""meteor"" looked in the movie Deep Impact.",1999-11-17T00:00:00,42.0106,-88.6671

The object was not traveling in an exact straight line because at times it seemed to be slightly moving  from side to side but continued to move in a southerly direction.

I could also see a dark triangle in the center of the orange light. I estimate the object to have been maybe 1,000 ft across from tip to tip. As the object continued south the orange light became brighter and seemed to display brighter flashes now and then, almost like the afterburners on a fighter jet.

You could also see a rope like outline connecting the two objects. Then a third, fourth, and fith object appeared out in front of the last in a similar fashion.

And headed opposite directions from where they were coming. I didn't hear an airplane, nor a helicopter. This was very strange.

A friend and I were driving from El Centro to San Diego West on Highway 8 in the mountains approximately 50 miles East of San Diego.  The elevation was 4100 feet.  We had just passed a sign, so that is how I know it was that elevation.  I was driving, and something made me look to the sky above the mountains to my in a Northwest direction - I think it was the movement in the sky.   I was surprised to see something that was clearly not a plane because it had no wings or tail, no lights, and no trail behind it.  It looked like a silver metallic cigar-shaped craft that with rounded edges, and was larger at one end (the left as I was looking at it) than the other.  I could not see if it had windows, but it was very large.  I am not a pilot so have no reference for size, but my guess is that it was quite a bit larger than an airplane. The object was moving very slowly from North to South just above the peak of a mountain.   It would periodically slow down and then speed up.  I said to my friend a couple of seconds after I first sighted it - ""((name deleted)), what the heck is that?""  To which she replied that she had no idea, and that she had already been watching it for at least 1 - 1 1/2 minutes and was trying to figure that out herself.  She kept thinking (and hoping) it would show some wings or something to indicate that it was a plane.  We both got very excited and said ""oh my God, I think it is a UFO"" at the same time! At that point I looked at my watch to verify time, and it said 4:20 PM.  The sun was setting in the West, and it caused the craft to shine quite brightly.  We were behind a mountain at the time, so the sun was not shining in our eyes.  I did look for signs for some reference as to the exact point, but there were none around.  There are quite a few mountains in this area.  We both watched the object for approximately 30 seconds, and were discussing it when it took a 90-degree turn very quickly due West, became transparent, and then disappeared.  ((Name deleted)) did not witness it becoming transparent first, only that it disappeared instantly.  We believe she must have blinked during this time because that is how fast it occurred.  I then pulled over on the side of the road and grabbed my camera and video camera in case it came back, because at that point I was convinced that I saw something otherworldly or perhaps an experimental craft of some type. We both remarked how it began to move away as we were talking about it.  We then kept looking to see if we would see anything further, or perhaps see planes in the area that would indicate a flight line to or from an airport, but saw nothing until we reached the San Diego Area.  We saw no planes or helicopters whatsoever going to or from El Centro at all once we reached the mountains.  We are from the Midwest and are unfamiliar with mountains, but perhaps a topographical map would indicate the tallest one (the one we were on) for a better reference. ((name deleted)) had never seen a UFO in her life (she is now 53), and is convinced that this was a UFO.  I should also mention that ((name deleted)) was driving first, and then I got very sick and made her let me drive to minimize the sickness.  I do get carsick, but this time was probably the worst I've ever felt.  Also, about 10 minutes after the sighting, I was compelled to pull off to the side of the road to collect rocks two times.  The second time, we pulled 100 feet behind a stalled van, and right as I returned to the car I looked in the rear view mirror and saw a semi truck cab driving at around 90 MPH on the side of the road straight for us.  Just before it would have hit us, it swerved back onto the highway.  I have the overwhelming feeling that that was a message of some sort.",1999-11-23T00:00:00,32.77397551020408,-115.60140204081631

I didn't give much thought to seeing a shooting star, as I have seen many before.  Suddenly, some motion in the sky to my left and towards the front of the house caught my eye.  As there is a streetlight there I could not quite see clearly with the artificial light as four sphere shaped objects came into view.  Once they were above me I could see them against the background of the clear night sky without the contaminating light from the street.  Three of the objects were traveling in a tight, equilateral triangle formation, as the fourth traveled behind and perhaps two to three times the distance between the objects in the triangle formation.  I am an empirical person, and I attempted to explain away to myself these objects as something else, but found that I could not as I watched them until they disappeared over the trees.  I can not be sure what the altitude of these objects was, but they seemed to be fairly close to the earth.  Due to the fact that they were only visible to me (from horizon to horizon) for about 5-10 seconds, I tend to think that these objects were traveling at a fairly low altitude.

Visible until disappeared on horizon Travelling from Cheney to George, Wa, I was awakened by my stepfather (who was driving) at approximately 12:45 a.m.  He said jokingly that there was a UFO outside my window.  A bright blue-white flashing object appeared coming from the west, parallel to the freeway. I estimate it was 2000-4000 above us, moving at barely subsonic speed.  There were no green or red marking lights, only the flashing light.  As it went nearly directly overhead, each time it flashed, I could make out the shape of the craft.  The flash came directly from the center of mass of the object.  The easiest way to describe it is to (no joke) start with a mental picture of the Batman searchlight image, then make the ""wings"" a little thinner and angle them back another 20-30 degrees.  There appeared to be a pointed projection where the ""head"" would be and it continued towards the rear like half of a pencil thin fuselage might be attached to the integral ""wings"".  Then halfway out, on each side were similar projections, front and rear of the ""wings"" and again at the tip.  I think there were 5 in all: one center, two midway, two at tips. The brightness was such that it would be equivalent to several parking lot searchlights combined: several million candlepower!  We joked about it for 30 seconds or so, I looked out the back window, and it flashed brightly until it disappeared below the horizon to the east.  Presumably it was headed for the air force base near Spokane.  There must have been others that noticed it, as there was still quite a bit of traffic on the freeway.  We heard nothing, but at 75 mph, wind noise is significant.  The abscence of normal marker lights was strange. I am a soil scientist.  I read quite a bit and know a little bit about aircraft-not too much.  This did not look quite like the ""flying wing"" (B-something or other) that is commonly talked about.  Maybe other descriptions will help you piece this puzzle together.  Hope this helps.  This is my first report, but not first sighting.",1999-11-23T00:00:00,,

More from Little Rock. Last Thursday night march 9th around 10 pm two of my friends saw a huge portion of the sky north of little rock light up for 5 seconds. From their perspective this is the description I was given. Looking north from the most northeast side of one of the tallest hills in North Little Rock, In clear view of the city lights to the south over downtown and the dark sky to the north, as well as the entire eastern skyline (mostly the lights of NLR). It was a partly cloudy comfortable evening, the northern night sky lit up like a fireball. There was no streak from the sky, it looked more like a tremendous explosion which lasted for almost 5 seconds. They went on and on about how they were actually able to stand there watching the tremendous north lights and talk about it at the same time. Both kept asking the other ""do you see that, look at that!"" and was able to ask each other that question 3 times each while the light stayed illunminated. Niether of my friends, whom both are intelligent people, would make up such a story. I have sat with one of them in his backyard on the Arkansas River on meteor storm evenings and watched meteors with him. He would have identified the light as a meteor if he thought it was one. That night at 11:00pm i met up with them both and they shared the story with me. It dominated the conversation for the next 20 minutes. They left approx 11:30 and I remained on the back porch of my friends house looking from the same perspective. Around 11:50pm, right before the art bell show so the time is approx, I heard a boom noise, almost like an explosion sound, come from the southeast. Turning around I saw what appeared to be a mushroom cloud come from the south. To be honest I was scared to death and quite shaken, not quite sure what i saw. I ended up staying up to 2am listening to art bell wondering if the local radio would report anything. I went to sleep and learned about the fire the next day. All 3 of us have seen the local TV coverage of the fire south of little rock. The local talk radio shows on Art's affiliate here in Little Rock have mentioned the fire. Details however are very limited. I do know however that the area of the large fire had camera crews on the seen either 1 or 2 days later, because i saw it on TV.  The scanner reports apparently is what makes this case interesting. I have heard 2 local media personalities talk about what the people on the scene said. However niether of the media guys mentioned any specifics. Good luck with this, hope others can confirm what I saw. Please only contact me through email and do not release my information to anyone.

I have also included my first sighting in great detail. At first I thought it was a plane because of the two bright head lights as it moved Northwest; however, it made an slow, short turn north-bound.  It seemed to move slow north until it stoped.   There were three colors of lights on base of the object.  Two green lights, two red lights and one larger pulsating light at the center. The two green lights were perpendicular with the two red lights.  I was driving down Clemens center parkway when I noticed the craft turning north bound while slowing down.  It was on my left hand side about 40 feet in the air.  It seemed to descend sightly. Then it stopped in mid air!  It made no sound!  I expected to hear helocopter or hovercraft engines, but I heard nothing!  Even as I stopped at the light, still heard nothing. There were other small lights on the rim that gave it a disk-like shape.   The wind was blowing quite hard from the North and yet it remained so still.  You might have thought it was secured by a long tower base.  It  reminded me the of the CN Tower in Toronto, CANADA.  I was intrigued how it seemed to break the laws of physics.  After I had stopped the car at the light, the object began to move again northward.  I wanted to turn left down fifth Street to follow it but the traffic light caught me. A police car was in the lane perpendicular to my lane so it did not behoove me to make a U-turn on yellow.  Not realizing that there also was a police car behind me I backed my car up slightly since I just had missed the yellow light and tried to back my car up from the intersection.  The Officer honked to make his presence known.  As a result, I was unable to track down the object.  As I hopelessly tried to quickly get on to Clemens center pkwy North-bound, I realized that I lost track of this stange phemnomena. This was my second sighting. My first sighting was an Iron-shaped object with a small pulsating blue light at tail tip of this a the top rear of the object.  As I traveled down hoffman street in Elmira, October 1993 at 8:30 PM on a thursday, as my father and I were driving to Geroulds Pharmacy.  I noticed the two bright heads lights from the distance.  The object seemed to ascend from a distance as it appeared to come over a hill.  As we were driving south bound I marverled at how slow this object seemed as it moved towards our car.  Normally a plane would be faster.  After parking in back of the westside Geroulds pharmacy my father went into the store to pickup his perscriptions.  I got out of the Car to see this slow moving object pass by.  The base of the object was trianglar and so metalic and shining that it reflected the Orange lights at the southern tier pedictric heath center.  There was also a blue light at the two rear bottom corners of the object.  There were no indentations where wheels might be dislodged, it was a completely flat mirror-like base.  I'd say the vehihcle was about 7-feet long with small dark window sand moved no more than 15 miles per hour.  This area was very well lite and I cound see every detail of this object.  Another stricking feature of this object was that it had no wings.  It was a dark gray color and gave off no emmissions.  It literally looked like a flying iron without a handle.  It flew just above the trees. It also made no sound.  I pinched myself, and moved to different areas of the street to hear an echo of sound that might be ricorchete from buildings, yet I heard no sound at all.  This craft was heading north-bound as I headed south. I have always been skeptical about UFO sightings.  However, I have come to appreciate organizations who are familiar with this phenomenna.  Now I do believe people who see these things are not inviting delusions.  When I see airplanes, there some instances where they appear like flying saucers from certain angles.  I was expecting a plane or helocopter, but saw objects that seemed to break the laws of aerodynamics.  Nor did these objects resemble anything that I have ever seen.  I am going to start keeping a camera or video camera in my car, once I can afford it.",2000-03-16T00:00:00,42.08283608247423,-76.80816185567011

While driving north on Interstate 15 in San Bernadino County, California, me and a business associate both saw a meteor fall due north of us. The path did not reach the ground. What was very odd was that the path left by the falling meteor was exactly vertical. That seems very odd to me. The earth and the meteor would have to be travelling exactly towards each other for it to streak perfectly vertical. It is even more odd considering I saw another vertical meteor 1 week before this while travelling home from thanksgiving dinner. That night I was travelling due west and saw a meteor leave a streak due west from my location. I was just entering the Hemet area where a large valley occurs. The meteor streak appeared over the San Jacinto mountains west of hemet. The streak was again exactly vertical. It was almost as if a star just fell straight down out of the sky. A very odd sight.

They looked like the lights I had seen on TV from an earlier sighting in Arizona in May of 1997.  I froze.  Another person was walking out with me and I said ""look at that, what is that?""

They were in the triangle formation by now. I looked long enough to see if the fireballs were crafts. I noticed that they were traingle shaped crafts with a brighter light on each point of the triangle and in the center. I got in my car and went home. Leaving the parking lot there were several cars parked with people looking at the objects outside there from the end of the parking lot.

People were standing outside the house across the street. They saw the objects too. I overheard them say that they were calling 911. Twenty minutes later a  police van appeared the people left in a black car with the van they returned 45 minutes later. The objects were still in the sky in a formation but it was harder to see the fromation because of trees. We called the local police! departm ent and left a report.

My girlfriend asked me what it was and I told her it was a tower and not a plane because it was completely motionless in the sky.  Then I remembered that there was no tower there, so we both took a second look as we drove closer.  This became more frightening because there was only space between the two lights and the ground, and a boomerang-shaped craft came into focus.  We were driving approximateley 35 miles per hour.  ""What the #!@! is that?,"" we both repeated.  I began to slow down but the driver behind me didn't even notice and was beeping at me to keep driving. Finally we got closer and I saw a black metallic ship between the two lights in an extremely aerodynamic shape (almost like a bug, almost a V shaped pattern).  I do not know what was scarier, the fact that the color of the metal was a glossy black and grey (unlike any kind of metal I've seen) or the fact that it hovered motionlessly as I drove under it.

It was just a moment after they merge that they dispersed and circulated again. They took about 2 seconds to complete one  cycle. I took serveral photos of the sighting using a normal camera, but i am not sure whether the lights could be seen upon development of the film. The lights were oval in shape and white in colour. It seemed like someone have used a very powerful spotlight to shine it into the sky, but there was no beam/spectrum from the source of the light. The sky and the moon was covered with some clouds. The lights were not flying in the clear sky. They seemed to be flying among the cloud. It was about 15 minutes later where they disappeared.

I was driving home from my part-time weekend job at about 12:20 am on 4-24-00.  I noticed to the south what appeared to be an airliner flying with a pronounced yaw from the south to the northwest.  What struck me was the speed, the yaw, the light patterns, and the altitude for the size of the object.  As I got closer I noticed that the ""plane"" wasn't progressing past me toward Hartsfield Airport to the North.  Finally I drove right beside/underneath it, and found it to be in a dead hover or maybe a very slow drift.  It appeared to be ~1/4 mi directly to the west, at an altitude of ~1000 to 2000 ft. At that point I really perked up.  This thing was the size of a jumbo jet ""parked"" silently over high voltage power lines just north of a trailer park.  As I looked closer, I could make out the shape of a black triangle that was more acute or narrow than an equilateral triangle.  Also the lights were not conventional.  To the best of my recollection there were red and bluish-white lights around the edges and what appeared to be red ""tail lights"". One feature that I remember without question is that their were two strobe lights positioned toward the rear, but not in the corners of the triangle.  They strobed rapidly, in short flurries, and in perfect tandem.  As I was traveling south and the object was traveling north, I pulled off at the next exit and got out of my car to look.  I had traveled away from object at 70mph for a full 60 seconds and it was still roughly in the same position and only appeared slightly smaller in it's angular view.  A jet would have moved on much farther north. I have never seen something so ""out of place"" and unusual in the sky in my life.  I am a 34 yr. old college grad; married, father of two.  I have a spotless reputation in my community.  I am dying to know if anyone else saw this thing.  There were cars on the interstate and people in the trailer park that this thing drifted over.

First, the object appeared to be moving very rapidly compared to conventional aircraft.  Second, the head of the object was indeed a distinct fireball shape with no clear separation between the object itself and the vapor trail as you expect in a jet.  Third the jet is rarely perceived at all or - if it is the object is smaller than the vapor trail itself especially in width - that is one usually perceives the contrail but no jet.  Fourth, the contrail was not in a straight vector as it trailed from the object, but was more whispy and appeared carried by the winds or the atmosphere.  Fifth, the contrail varied in size - both in length and width - as the object traveled. In fact, soon afterwards we observed a jet contrail and noted the distinct differences between it and what we just saw. For a brief moment we saw another object like the first.  The parties and myself are in a disagreement over whether this was the original object we saw at a greater distance, another object, or a jet.

I frankly didn't think a great deal about what she had told me, thinking they were probably planes from Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton, until I felt I should go take a look for myself; at which point I witnessed one of the most amazing unexplained events I've ever seen.  From North/Northeast to South/Southwest, the *lights* came, one after the other.  At times, the *lights* were in a V pattern (mostly consisting of 3 *lights* ~ sometimes 5).  The V pattern *lights* were mostly in the middle of the huge number of *lights*, while the outside edges of the majority of the *lights* were lined with patterns of 2 *lights* ~ one closing following another, or running parallel to each other. At times, the outside *lights* appeared to be moving exceptionally rapidly, as though chasing one another; but could and did come to a complete halt at times, in mid-movement.  The *lights* appeared to be quite high in altitude, although at times, we could see them move through the clouds, as a small airplane would do if flying at a lower level.  Time and time again, 10 to 20  *lights* would move in this southerly fashion from the north, and stop directly overhead (over our home ~ my neck is still somewhat stiff from leaning my head back to watch them.  I saw a UFO once before, up close and personal, during the daylight hours on the campus of the Univ. of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky, in 1973, which I have never forgotten, nor have seen anything like it since: immense cigar-shaped craft with 4 huge square windows of brightly colored flashing lights).  Anyway, then as now, I never in my life witnessed anything like what my daughter, my husband and I saw several nights! ago.  T hese *lights* could stop~completely at rest; other times they would *flash* a pale sea green color; at times, they'd flash and disappear, only to flash again in a few seconds (appeared as communication between 2 craft); there were 2 much larger *lights* which flashed different colors so swiftly (blue, green red) and they could turn very quickly (a 90 degree turn on a dime, so to speak).  These *lights* just kept coming and coming over a 2 or so hour period...unreal.  At one point, next to a group of 2 V shaped patterned lights, there appeared, as if through a cloud, a much larger object (possibly cylindrical?) ~ on which I could not make out a distinct pattern...flashing all colored lights at once ~ a mix of lights, not specific light colors at separate times.  There wasn't any noise from these *lights*...completely silent.  My husband witnessed these *lights*, and this man does NOT believe in easily in anything out of the ordinary.  About these lights, he merely states ""I'm not sure what I saw.""  This is the first time my daughter has ever witnessed anything like this, and when she first told me about what she had witnessed outdoors, she was startled and scared.  After I went outdoors with her, she was exhilarated, and her fear calmed.  Since my experience in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1973, I have never had any fear of UFO's.

They were turning back and forth in the same location in the sky not going any direction. They would appear and dissappear as they turned and my reasoning was one side of the birds must be silver and the other side dark. They would dissappear in a wave motion and as I looked harder for them I couldn't see any sign of a one. Then they would appear in a wave motion and be in a flock pattern. I was thinking that I was seeing some native birds that live in the mountains, since i live in the L.A. area and wouldn't see this type of bird there. But as they appeared again, I'll be darned if the flock started to make a big circle, with other birds staying in the flock. Then the circle broke up and they started making horizontal lines , 2 or 3 at a time and at different levels in the flock and still staying in the same area above the mountains. The driver also saw this and stated that '' that's pretty strange''. As we drove into the beginning of the town of Olancha, I spotted a couple standing in a lot off the hwy. looking at the same flock and pointing towards them, so I felt better that someone else had noticed the same thing.

This is the first time I have ever seen such a sighting. I had gone outside to observe the stars for a while before going to bed, I was standing facing south and looking at the Orion Nebula, when something caught my eye coming over our house. Looking almost directly straight up and just slightly south, I observed a bright green light, the green was the same color as the green of a traffic light and about the same brightness. The size was about the same size as Venus looks in the night sky. The green object was traveling at a very high rate of speed. What looked like about four times the speed of aircraft passing over the same area. This object took about 12 seconds to go from almost straight up and about 10 degrees south to completely out of sight over some trees down the street looking north. When I first saw the green light I noticed that there was another object just like the first one also green in color, same brightness and also traveling the same direction and speed. This object was just to the right of the first object, and slightly behind it. I remember thinking, ""is this a low-flying aircraft?"" ""It sure is moving fast for an aircraft"". Then I grabbed my binoculars to try to get a better look at the objects, When I viewed the leading object through the binoculars, I noticed that I could see the clouds behind the object and that there was no body or wings visible. The clouds were illuminated by the city lights, which made it a rather brightly lit evening, especially for 9:35PM. I could clearly see the clouds contrasted against the object as it moved under them. The clouds were patchy and scattered, and spread out evenly across the sky except for further north, where they were denser. You could also see many stars between the clouds. These objects did not look anything like stars, since they were moving at a high rate of speed. I also noticed that there was no solid object attached to these lights; they seemed to be traveling by them selves. There was one aspect to this sighting that I thought was a bit strange, the objects seemed to be gaining speed rapidly, just prior to dropping down and disappearing behind the trees, which were about a quarter of a mile away. Early in my observation, when I first spotted the leading object looking through my binoculars, I noticed an orange much smaller light or object that seemed to be dancing very rapidly back and forth going past the green object in either direction, not a tight zigzag but a much more exaggerated movement, and quite rapid, more so than what would be expected for eye movement or movement of the binoculars. I could see the green object at the same time as the orange one and could tell that it was moving past the green one in a rapid movement. I was also able to pan the green object fairly easily allowing me to view the orange object as it danced around or back and forth by the green object. The orange object otherwise kept pace with the leading green object as it traversed the sky. There were no sparks, or tails visible and there were no flashing or strobe lights visible at any time on any of these objects. This whole episode caught me totally by surprise, as I had gone out to do some star gazing, not UFO gazing. I had not planned on looking for anything strange tonight. This has left me totally spooked and quite excited, definitely High Strangeness. This is the first time I have ever seen anything quite like this; it truly made my night. What I have described above was not the planet Venus or Jupiter, or a star. I was able to see both planets during this sighting. It also was not an aircraft, balloon or a helicopter as there was no sound at all, emanating from this object., and it moved much too fast and smoothly.

I looked out the windshield and saw a large oval shaped light streak from approximately directly overhead, and a little to the east, as I was parked facing directly South.

Well, I continued driving yet now more alert, out of the edge of the trees (Beach trees mind you, these were not as tall as normal trees) I saw a strange formation with bluish white lights just above the trees. I past it & slammed on my brakes & got out of my car to see what it was. I had to get out in the middle of the street to see it over the trees & there it was, nothing was holding it up, it just hovered there. It was just over the trees, it was very big & low to the ground, if I had been on the highest tree I think (assuming) that I would be able to touch it. The craft was a diamond shape, I drew it when I returned home. There was a big bluish light on the bottom of the craft that covered most of the underneath & along the sides/edges of thecraft were the same bluish white lights yet smaller. The light was very bright but it didn't hurt my eyes to look at it, it just illuminated the craft. I just stood there looking at it & b/t the lights was this scaffolding of metal, but the brightest most beautifully colored chrome silver I'd ever seen. It was really beautiful. There was no sound emitting from it, the night was silent. I just stood there watching it, hypnotized it seemed by it & then all of a sudden I was overcome with a fear/ terror that I had never before experienced in my entire life. I ran to my car, my heart was racing & I sped away. I kept feeling as if I should turn around & go back but that strange fear kept me from doing so.   About 5 miles down from that a van came racing up behind me, VERY fast & passed me continuing to speed away- my hunch is that they saw the same thing I did & got the heck away from there! *I do not take drugs of any kind & I was completely sober during this whole experience. That's why it impacted me so much, it happened exactly as I have related it here.* **Do you have any explanation or other sitings that were reported thatsame time, place, & night? Any information would GREATLY be appreciated!!! I'm sorry I just gave the full description above. I didn't know that this was here! The summary description is that I saw a diamond shaped craft illuminated with a bluish-white light & no sound came from it & nothing held it up. It was very big & low to the ground, about 13-14 feet above me off to the left of me, just over the trees.",2000-04-15T00:00:00,27.65600487804878,-80.43302384823848

After the 747 passed by I was looking at the clouds formation. Since it was a very bright and glaring day I wore my red tinted sunglasses that reduced the glare alot so I was able to make out shapes of the clouds. As I watched I noticed this formation in the clouds that very dim (The clouds were about 10,000-11,000 ft up) They were very dim and white I thought they might be stars, but they changed shapes. And were in a perfect formation. The first formation was of a diamond formation with two objects away in the formation. Second there were about 8-9 objects in the formation. And they seemed to go in and out of the clouds. I thought It was balloons there were loose but they were too high. They seemed to change into different formations and fade or go higher. After watching these I noticed a ""Silver"" egg shaped object go from west to east over downtown and it was at least 2500-3000 feet up There was no sound or shape they I would see as a airplane because I study and watch aircraft all the time and play the ""Microsoft Flight Sim 2000"" This object that was silver just flew over the city and the other formations seemed to fade away.

Primarily white, although with a greenish tint. I was driving south on interstate 5 about 5 or 10 miles south of Oceanside, CA.  This is in north San Diego county.  The highway heads generally south by southeast, not counting the curves, of course.  I noticed a bright light source in the upper left corner of the windshield.  I had emerged from a point along my line of sight where it was blocked by the roof of the car.  In less than a second, it disappeared behind some high ground that was fairly near the highway. The light source had the appearance of a fireball; mostly white but with a greenish tint.  It was about the size of the cross-section of a pencil held at arm's length, or about half the diameter of my smallest fingernail.  It had a divided tail, more distinct along the top and bottom of the tail, and less distinct in the center.  It was bright but not uncomfortable to look at, akin to looking at a bright streetlight.  I can't give a very good account of my position, or its direction from me, or the angle above the horizontal when it disappeared; I was busy driving.  I thought for a moment about what I had seen, then remembered to look at the clock.  The clock read 1:11.  I guessed that I had actually seen the fireball at 1:10. Here are some impressions (as opposed to observations).  The fireball seemed to come roughly out of the northwest and to be heading roughly southeast.  I had that impression that it was heading away from be at about a 45 degree aspect (as if I were going south and it was going southeast).  I guessed that it was coming down at about a 45 degree angle, although the down angle looked more like 60 degrees because of the aspect angle (my impression of it).  It did not look simply like a round light source; I could see irregularities.  I could also see irregularities in the tail.  From this, I think that it was close (whatever that means, in a relative sense, for fireballs).  It looked so low to the ground and was moving so fast (about 10-15 degrees line of sight in less than a second) and coming down at such a steep angle that I was sure that it would hit the ground.  I saw no evidence of any such hit (such as a brighter flash, for example).  (note: using a fist at arm's length as 12 degrees) In thinking about the tail, it doesn't seem likely that the split appearance was due to any asymmetry in the object.  That is certainly possible, of course.  It seems more likely, though, for the tail to be eminating from the ""limb"" area that was closest to the undisturbed air.  That is, for the tail to be coming off in a ring, forming a hollow cylinder behind the fireball.  In looking roughly tangent to the cylinder (at the edge), the observer would be looking through more of the tail material than when looking at the middle.  This would (I think) result in the effect that I saw.",2000-04-15T00:00:00,33.247651756440284,-117.33448852459017

The SEG cannot be detected by radar because it absorbs radiation and when inside the generator, the g force does not exist.  Searl also noticed that the SEG gave off some form of radiation that TOTALLY healed his burns from a spill a couple of weeks beforehand that docters said would never completely heal.  The lack of g's in the center can possibly explain the darty movement noticed in UFO's and the pink halo can possibly explain ""the light"" seen in many UFO sightings.

The lights were travelling almost due west and directly overhead when first observed.  they were elongated in the direction of travel (estimated 3:1 ratio) and were situated one behind the other.  I estimate they were separated by about 4-5 degrees of arc.  They appeared to be flickering rapidly (several times per second).  There also appeared to be a very thin line of smaller or dimmer lights connecting the pair.  This, however, could have been an ionization trail or optical afterimage.  The lights maintained the same relative distance as they moved from overhead to about 45 degrees above the western horizon in approximately 10 or 12 seconds.  The lights then swung in a wide arc to the south and vanished behind a cluster of tall pine trees.  During this ""swing"", they appeared to move into a side-by-side orientation, rather than the fore-and-aft arrangement when they were travelling west.  At the point where I lost sight of them, they appeared to be about 30 to 35 degrees above the southwestern horizon.  During the entire episode, there was no sound. Weather conditions in the area were thin scattered clouds (elevation unknown) and little wind.  I believe the objects were below the clouds, as they did not appear to dim when passing one or two of the clouds. My first impression was that these were a pair of Air Force fighters on a night training mission.  However, there was no sign of the normal red and green marker lights, and absolutely no sound.

I would characterize it as something entering the atmosphere except it appeared to be lower than normal 747 style traffic, or it was quite large, but the detail in the flame would make me believe that it was closer to the ground that far away.  Also there where small orange lights coming out the back.  I believed it to be ember type material breaking away but the lights fell directly back, one at a time evening spaced and they didnt fall away as I would expect waste material to do.  They were evenly spaced and fell directly behind the object, but still seemed to be keeping up with the green flame which is why I think it was not just a meteorite.  Apparently from the number of calls you were getting many people seen it,  i was in my car pulling out of a coffee shop at the time so I dont know if it made noise.  there were probably 10 to 15 people seated outside the coffee shop and I noticed that all of them were up and looking as well.",1999-11-17T00:00:00,42.75875688073394,-84.44804770642202

She watched it for about 15 minutes, then woke me up to take a look. I immediately could tell this was no ordinary plane.

While doing some amateur astronomy, I was aiming my telescope at the Orion nebula, while a companion visually observed the object (without the scope) originating from about the same area in the sky.  It moved VERY slowly.  For about the first thirty seconds as it approached, we looked for airplane blinkers, and the object definitley passed ""close"" enough to see some sort of shape with absolutely no blinkers. Then I tried to get the object sighted in my finder scope but could not (that was for probably another 30 seconds). Then four other observers wandered out into the backyard and they watched, while I ran back inside to fetch my binoculars.  It took about another 45 seconds for me to get back.  I quickly found the object in my binoculars and watched for about another minute or two.  I tried to be conservative in my time estimates -- several other observers think it took much longer on the order of 4-6 minutes.  There was no sound at all.  The object was glowing a fairly bright orange.  It moved entirely in a straight line, with no apparent trail.  It was also fairly large visually, about as large as an airplane looks when passing overhead still in ascent (we are very near Lambert Airport).  The object generally went east to west, at about 45 degrees from us when it passed the closest.  Although I had the binoculars and noted that there was some apparent shape, I could not steady the view enough to determine the shape.  Another observer with keen eyesight described it as a ""flattened egg"" or oval.  The time of 19:30 CST is a very rough estimate, as none of us thought to check our watches at the time.  It was definitely well before 20:15 CST. The object did not originate anywhere at all near where there is supposed to be some meteor activity.  My first guess would be a sattelite reentry.

""The unusual sightings were reported Friday night by several spectators at Rockford's downtown New Year's Eve celebration. Accounts continued surfacing Saturday from outlying areas as well. Most described reddish-orange lights moving across the sky about 10 or 11 p.m. -- before most fireworks demonstrations began. Veroni, who was celebrating on Main Street north of downtown Rockford, was startled enough to stop at a gas station and dial 9-1-1. She said she feared a Y2K computer foulup had launched missiles at the United States. ""It was either missiles, or -- man, I'm telling you -- spaceships,"" she said. ""It was like nothing I've ever seen."" """,2000-01-07T00:00:00,42.27738134206219,-89.04477790507364

We left about 15 minutes late from the gate and didn't take off for about another 35 minutes.  After we left the ground the pilot came over the PA and said we had Philadelphia out the left and would soon see Wilmington.  I looked out my window to the North.  I knew it was north because I had located the big dipper and had found the North star.  We were heading close to due west.  Out my window I noticed a light and thought it was another airplane.  The light appeared to be at a slightly lower altitude than the one we were at.  I watched the light and noticed that it was getting brighter.  Thus it was either getting closer or increasing in brightness.  I thought it was an airplane and started getting nervous as it appeared to be coming directly at us.  That is it's brightness increased.  I then noticed that it got extremely bright in the center and appeared to have an airplane like shape.  That is a bright center and tapered to the east and west as if it had two bright wings.  All this time it appeared as a bright white light.  Next I heard the pilot say something about a meteor out of my side of the plane.  I then noticed that the bright flattened shaped light appeared to explode into two or three more objects heading due east.  I then truned and told the fellow next to me that he should look at the meteor too.  He did and also saw what followed.  The bright initial light appeared to slowly fade into nothing.  The 2 or 3 objects that were left then headed due east.  One after the other apparently on the same course.  They moved very slowly and had a long tails that were about the same distance or a little less than the distance between the two stars of the big dipper which point to the north star.  The tails appeared to be the same length.  The were about the same luminosity except for the front which was slightly different.  I did notice that after the length of the tail there was no sign of a dim tail, it was totally dark as was the rest of the sky.  The objects moved off to the east at constant altitude.  The total episode taking from 30 seconds to as much as two minutes.  I was distracted by the pilots comments and then that it was a meteor so I didn't watch it continuously and really did not see the objects disappear.  I did notice that at some point they were no longer visible.  The trajectory of the objects was neither up or down in the vertical direction.  The witnesses included myself, the person sitting next to me and at least one pilot.  I am not sure about whether other people on the plane had noticed the event.

The moon was full and I had the porch lights on, but the balls of light were highly visible. They were as bright, if not brighter than the moon. What was remarkable, to me, was their size. They looked like baseballs, compared to the other stars in the sky. The main one was about the size of half the moon.  They seemed to travel in a cluster, but not necessarily at the same rate of speed, but it may have just been my perspective. I said ""oh my god!"" and ran along the deck of the house to keep it in view as it went behind a tree.  There was a trail arcing behind the cluster, each ball had it's own trail and they merged into one tapering trail. This trail was very colorful, starting with a green, then red, orange, then sort of purpleyblue. It was beautiful, and I've never seen anything like it before. It arched across the sky and was visible for about 30 seconds, maybe less, and then suddenly disappeared.  The tail didn't linger after the balls of light went out.

Light bacame bright and changed into elongated form then split into 3 or four objects heading east somewhere around ~20,000 feet I was in the American Airlines flight 785 scheduled to leave New York Laguardia at 17:55 on 17 November 1999.  We left about 15 minutes late from the gate and didn't take off for about another 35 minutes.  After we left the ground the pilot came over the PA and said we had Philadelphia out the left and would soon see Wilmington.  I looked out my window to the North.  I knew it was north because I had located the big dipper and had found the North star.  We were heading close to due west.  Out my window I noticed a light and thought it was another airplane.  The light appeared to be at a slightly lower altitude than the one we were at.  I watched the light and noticed that it was getting brighter.  Thus it was either getting closer or increasing in brightness.  I thought it was an airplane and started getting nervous as it appeared to be coming directly at us.  That is it's brightness increased.  I then noticed that it got extremely bright in the center and appeared to have an airplane like shape.  That is a bright center and tapered to the east and west as if it had two bright wings.  All this time it appeared as a bright white light.  Next I heard the pilot say something about a meteor out of my side of the plane.  I then noticed that the bright flattened shaped light appeared to explode into two or three more objects heading due east.  I then truned and told the fellow next to me that he should look at the meteor too.  He did and also saw what followed.  The bright initial light appeared to slowly fade into nothing.  The 2 or 3 objects that were left then headed due east.  One after the other apparently on the same course.  They moved very slowly and had a long tails that were about the same distance or a little less than the distance between the two stars of the big dipper which point to the north star.  The tails appeared to be the same length.  The were about the same luminosity except for the front which was slightly different.  I did notice that after the length of the tail there was no sign of ! a dim ta il, it was totally dark as was the rest of the sky.  The objects moved off to the east at constant altitude.  The total episode taking from 30 seconds to as much as two minutes.  I was distracted by the pilots comments and then that it was a meteor so I didn't watch it continuously and really did not see the objects disappear.  I did notice that at some point they were no longer visible.  The trajectory of the objects was neither up or down in the vertical direction.  The witnesses included myself, the person sitting next to me and at least one pilot.  I am not sure about whether other people on the plane had noticed the event.  I am not sure of the time but believe it to be between 18:45 and 19:15 Eastern.",1999-11-23T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but on this cloudy night it really stood out in the sky.

I WAS WALKING UP NELSON ROAD HEADING TOWARDS MADRONE ST. BUT I DID'NT GET THERE JUST YET. I HAD STOPPED BETWEEN TWO BUILDINGS. ONE WAS A CHURCH AND THE OTHER WAS THE SIDE OF A MINI MART.

THERE WERE NO CARS AROUND WICH IS TYPICAL IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN.  BUT THE ODD THING WAS NOT THAT. IT WAS THE FACT THAT I FELT MY HAIR RISE LIKE THERE WAS STATIC ENERGY OR SOMETHING. NOT ONLY THAT IN A YARD NEXT TO THE CHURCH WAS A DOG. THIS DOG JUST STARTED GOING BERSERK. IT WAS WHINING AND BARKING. WELL STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD I LOOKED AT THE DOG FIGURING IT WAS BARKING AT ME AND THEN THATS WHEN IT HIT ME. THE DOG WAS LOOKING UPWARDS TOWARDS THE SKY AT SOME TREES IN MY DIRECTION. AT THAT TIME I DID'NT KNOW WHAT TO THINK. I LOOKED AROUND FIRST TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYBODY BEHIND ME OR STANDING AROUND. BUT THERE WAS'NT. SO I LOOKED BACK AT THE DOG AND THE DOG WAS RUNNING AROUND AND STARING AT THE TREE THAT WAS IN FRONT OF ME. SO I FIGURED I TAKE A LOOK AT THE TREES TO SEE IF THERE WAS A CAT OR RACOON UP THERE. THEN RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES I KIND OF PANICKED AND MY HEART WAS THROBBING. RIGHT ABOVE THE TREES WERE TWO OBJECTS. THEY WERE THE SIZE OF CARS AND THEY WERE GLOWING WHITE. THE TWO OBJECTS WERE HOVERING THERE MOTIONLESSLY AND AT TIMES MOVED AROUND JUST A LITTLE BIT.  THE OBJECTS WERE AT LEAST SIX TO TEN FEET ABOVE THE TREES.

I TOOK OFF MY GLASSES JUST TO SEE! IF I WA S SEEING A REFLECTION OF LIGHT BUT THEY WERE STILL THERE. THESE OBJECTS WERE FANTASTIC. I HAD A FEELING THAT THEY KNEW I KNEW I WAS WATCHING THEM AS THEY WERE WATCHING ME. NOW I TURNED MY ATTENTION AT THE DOG AND THE DOG LOOKED AT ME AND WHINED AND LOOKED BACK UP AT THE OBJECTS. I LOOKED AT THE OBJECTS AGAIN AND THEN THE OBJECTS MOVED UP  HIGHER FROM THE TREE TOPS SLOWLY. THEN THEY PAUSED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAD ME RUNNING HOME. THE OBJECTS SHIFTED AND MOVED IN A DIAGONAL MOVEMENT TOWARDS SPACE. THEN THEY PICKED UP SPEED AND THEN QUICKLY SHOT UP TOWARDS SPACE AND I COULD SEE THEM AS THEY GOT HIGHER AND SMALLER LOOKING. THEN WHEN THE OBJECTS GOT SO SMALL LOOKING I SEEN THE TWO OBJECTS FLASH AND DISAPEAR. I THEN RAN HOME AND TOLD MY FAMILY ABOUT WHAT JUST HAD HAPPENED. NOW WHAT AMAZED ME WAS WHEN I TOLD MY FAMILY ABOUT IT AND ON THE TELEVISION WAS A SHOW CALLED SIGHTINGS AND I HAD AN UTTER LOOK ON MY FACE. I AM NOW A BELEIVER AND NOT A SKEPTIC.

All of us saw them as one color, but none of us saw them the same color as any one else. I saw the most beautiful, clear orange color.  They stayed in that formation traveling from north to south above the Kittatinny Mountain range. One year later, I went up to Sunrise Mtn (same range) at 5 AM.  I have no idea why I awakened and went up there.  There were 2 young men who were frightened and saw the same lights, they tried to take them on their camcorder.  I explained to the boys that I did not feel they were harmful in the slightest.  Then went home and back to bed. Shortly after that when I was enjoying my field (on the top of a hill), I was watching 2 hawks circling overhead.  The clouds were formed in a funnel shape, the smallest point at the top, the hawks climbed higher and higher until they disappeared (which isn't logical) Then I felt myself being lifted off of the ground, grabbed onto the car to hold myself down.  Wish I was brave enough to have gone with it. A couple of years later, a mother and her two sons were coming to my house in the evening and saw them.  The mother and older son was happy and excited but the younger son was scared. It seems that I sense when they are around, such as last night even though the sky was overcast.  It seems a new comprehension comes to me when I sense they are around, I don't know what, I just know it is there.

I have overworked myself for the last 2 years, bone tired, ended up with asmatic bronchitis and slept for a week. Then, last night I sensed them again.  This morning my energy is back. Another thing is that I bought some fiber-optic beads in different colors in October.  The orange of those beads is the closest to the color that I saw that night. Such a pure orange. Another thought, it could just be co-incidence, is that my ability to channel healing and physic work improves after I sense or see them.  It could be psychological .... maybe you have an answer. Also, I haven't got the slightest idea how I ended up with your website. I should be cleaning the house.

I was sitting in history class in the eighth grade (four years ago) when I happened to glance out the window and see a large object about 50 yards in diameter floating over my neighborhood in the northwestern suburbs of Austin. It looked to be about half a mile away and moving slowly at a speed of 20 to 30 mph. It was only about 50 feet off the ground so I know that others must have seen it as well. The top and bottom pie plate-shaped portions of the craft were orange and the center cylindrical portion was yellow. I don't think it was metallic because I couldn't see any kind of a shine (and the sun was very bright at the time with no cloud cover at all). I blinked a few times to make sure I wasn't seeing things and then turned to one of my classmates to see if I could get another witness.

(She lives a few blocks south of BEST BUY on E. State st., where earlier sightings occurred.) She urged us to look! We saw 5 bright orange kite-shaped lights arranged in a ""question mark"" formation.  The sky was cloudy  but we could tell they were much larger and closer than stars.  They were up very high, like planes, but we knew they weren't moving like planes. We saw them in formation for about 15 minutes, and then they started fading in color. They looked almost like flames painted in the sky. Their shape, from where WE were watching, was a cross between  a kite or teardrop, and a flame, but they didn't ""flicker"" like flames. Their size seemed to remain the same as they paled to light cream, and then suddenly, one by one, they were only a white dot higher in the western sky. My husband(engineer) thinks they disappeared like an extinguished flame. He thinks it's all a hoax. To me, it looked like their speed changed rapidly when they changed from pale lights to white dots(WARP SPEED!) As the first 5 were fading one by one, 3 more started rising slowly from the north. They seemed to come over the horizon from approximately E. State St., possibly over St. Anthony's Hospital, which has a HUGE steel helicopter port with  lots of blinking  red and white lights on it.( BEST BUY is directly across the street.) As these final 3 lights moved towards us, 2 of them seemed to be directly side by side, and at one point it looked as though their side ""arms"" actually touched.  Then they separated and moved higher in the sky.  Those 3 did not make any particular formation, and 2 faded out fairly quickly, but the last one stayed alone in the same spot for close to 10 minutes, as though it was ""observing "" all the people watching it ! There were many people out observing, from our house all the mile and a half to E. State St. On our block alone we know of 10, plus 2 others on nearby streets. In addition , someone in the area of Alpine and Newberg Roads,(1 mi.west and north)got it on Video and reported this sighting to the local T.V.news.(The video wasn't shown on T.V.) Also, while WE saw lights that did not seem to be round, our neighbors further north saw what they called ""balls of light,"" but they saw the same formation and number of light, and at the same time, so it may have been the angle at which we were viewing this phenomena. I first heard about these mysterious light several weeks ago, when a fellow teacher confided inme that he had seen them on a Friday night at 9 PM, just as he was leaving the store next to BEST BUY. He lives close by, so he had time to get home and videotape the lights he saw.  I asked to see his tape and hee is making me a copy, so that the original does not get lost. If it looks useable, we will send you a copy.  Today one of my students told me her neighbor also made a video of one of the sightings, so I'll check into that as well.The one thing I want to stress is that some people here in Rockford have tried to dismiss these incidences as shooting stars or ""Northern Lights,"" meteor showers, flares, etc. Flares are the closest possible explanation to what WE saw, but I don't know if flares could remain stationary for 15 minutes. (My son wondered if they could have been flares on balloons?) The other suggestions all fall DOWNWARD, and these lights started low and moved upward. In addition, another reliable person said he saw the lights some weeks ago, and he saw them move into several different formations: Diamond, square, circle, etc. Finally, the girl that first called us to go out and look said she saw what looked like ashes falling from one of the several lights she saw.",2000-03-16T00:00:00,42.27738134206219,-89.04477790507364

Lights were far too much apart to have been an airplane. Visible for about six minutes. The lights disappeared one by one. On 3/11/00 at 7:04pm PST, our 16 year-old son invited my wife and I to step outside and view some lights in the sky. We all saw three redish-tinted lights moving across the sky at about 45 degrees elevation in the northeast. The lights were traveling from north to south at about the speed of an airliner at a long distance. The thing that really drew our attention was the way the lights moved in synch with each other--as if they were a single object. However, the lights were so far apart that to have been eminating from an airplane, the plane would have had to have been extrememly close and visible, which it was not. The lights had a slight flicker, but they definately did not blink or flash. At 7:06, the middle light disappeared completely and never reappeared. The other two lights continued to move across the sky at the same speed and at their original distance from each other. My wife and son say they saw the middle light fall downward very rapidly before disappearing. I was focusing on the left light and did not observe the fall. Though there were some areas of patchy clouds visable, there were none in that area of the sky. We then moved from the back yard to the front in order to continue watching the prossession. The two remaining lights moved across 80% of the sky over the next four minutes. At about 7:10pm the rightmost light disappeared. Initially, I thought it might have gone behind a bank of clouds to the south. A minute later the leftmost light also vanished suddenly. The lights had disappeared instantaneously--not gradually as they would have had they gone behind a cloud. When the clouds cleared a few minutes later, we confirmed the lights were totally gone. This phenomenon was clearly enough visible that it should have been witnessed from anywhere in the Sacramento area.",2000-03-16T00:00:00,38.6501,-121.2534

I witnessed a light that lit up my entire back yard and then an explosion sound followed. I also witnessed what I and 3 other people consider to be a UFO. It was visable for over an hour. At approximately 4:30 Sunday morning, December 5, 1999, I woke up from falling asleep on the couch.  I proceeded to bed and when I did I woke up my wife to ask her to move over, she then sat up and questioned me about the time.  Before I could climb into bed a bright light like I have never seen before lit up my back yard.  The light the proceeded to slowly climb up both of my windows at the same time climbing up them at a slow pace.  The light illlumated my entire house as if it were day.  Just as the light came it went, with the darkness came up the windows in the same fashion.  We estimate the light lasted around ten to fifteen seconds.  I then ran outside where I saw nothing at all.  I do have a clear view of each horizon.  I live on about a five hundred acre farm.  As I walked back inside an explosion sound rattle the house such as an earthquake might.  At this point I was completely in shock and had no idea what was going on.  I then ran back outside and this time I noticed an object in the sky in which I had never seen before.  This object appeared to be in a saucer/disk shape.  I estimate it was about one thousand feet away.  The object appeared to be hovering over the mountain behind my house.  It came across as slowly drifting around and sometimes with great burts of speed.  One thing that stands out is that the object appeared to be circular with spotlights all the way around it.It would shine just like a lighthouse.  Myself, my wife, her father and her grandmother all witnessed this event.  We believed that it might have been a planet but as we blocked it out with a tree we noticed that it moved on both sides of the tree.  It moved with great distance.  It was in the southeastern sky.  We watched this object for over an hour and half.  I have no explanation for this nor the light.  But most of Shelby County reported to 911 seeing the lights in the sky and hearing and feeling the ""sonic boom"" as some people call it.  Though it has been on the news, many reports are conflicting and many peopl! e and ra dio stations are calling this event a coverup.  The news is reporting that a meteor, a very large meteor came through and made the night time day.  I know what a meteor is.  I have seen several come through the Earth's atmosphere and burn up.  If this was a meteor then it was one that had to be as large as a car.  Though that still does not explain what the four of us witnessed for over and hour. I hope that you can help shed some light on this.  Maybe you can help me understand why there are so many meteor sightings lately all across the U.S. Is there something that we should know that the government is not telling?  Please call or email me back with any questions that you may have!  Thanks for your time.",1999-12-16T00:00:00,33.4183,-86.5378

The object was circular with a lime-green ""corona""(I guess you'd call it).  It sort of resembled a fire ball, yellow center with the lime-green surrounding it and a very short green tail. At first I thought I was just seeing a street light or some kind of reflection, so I did a double-take.  When I looked back, I could clearly see that it wasn't a street light, but rather something that was definately air-born.  It traveled directly from west to east, decending at approximately a 45 degree angle to the ground. I only saw the object for a few seconds, and then it just seemed to disappear with an extremely bright flash.  At the time it disappeared, I thought that it must have been a crash of some kind due to the flash.  It appeared to be about 5 miles south of my location and the diameter was about the same as the length of a Boeing 727 at 5 miles. Since it appeared to be so close, I drove to a nearby ridge which was about 3 mile SSE of my location.  From that vantage point, I had an unobstructed view of over 15 miles in all directions.  I saw nothing of a plane crash or and king of brush fire that I would expect from a meteorite of that size.(The color also ruled out a meteorite to me because every comet or meteorite I have ever seen is either white or a whitish-blue color. I didn't really give it much thought until later that morning when I was traveling with my father and happened to mention the experience to him.  We both had a good laugh and chalked it up to lack of sleep and went on discussing other matters.  About 15 minutes later, there was a newsbrief from an Atlanta radio station which said that several people, most notably a couple of Atlanta firemen, had reported seeing a strange light in the sky a little after 5 that morning.  They were just getting off work and heading home to Ellijay, which means they were traveling north when they saw it. If we all saw the same thing, it must have been larger, brighter, and further south than I had first thought. Later that night, the TV news said that the National Weather Service in Atlanta said that what the firemen saw was a meteor.  That was the last I heard of the incident. I am in my late twenties, have a college degree, and run my own business.  I have always had a real love for aviation, especially military aircraft.  I have family members that have made careers in the military, and through those connections have learned alot about the aircraft we are currently flying.  On several occasions I have tried to discuss those that don't officially exist, such as the projects profiled in periodicals such as Janes Defence, usually getting responses like, ""Now where did you read that?"", or more often, ""Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction."" I have personally witnessed F15s, F16a, F4s, A10s, B1-Bs, F117s, B2s, and even F22s(which is being developed at Lockeed in Atlanta) in flight both during daylight and at night. All I can tell you is that whatever it was I saw that morning was nothing I have ever seen before.  That's not to say it wasn't ours -- but it it was ours it's nothing that has ever been publicly acknowledged or even speculated on in any military or aviation journal I've ever read. It was truly a UFO -- an Unidentified Flying Object. I found your website after seeking information on this subject and debated whether or not to tell my seemingly insignificant story.  But here I am nearly two weeks later, and what I saw is still as vivid in my mind as it was that morning.  What bothers me is that I just haven't heard any more concerning the incident, and the Nt'l Weather Service's explaination of a ""meteorite"" just doesn't wash. I ask that my name or personal information not be revealed, I seek no notariety, I just hope that I can make some small contribution toward solving this puzzle.",1999-12-16T00:00:00,34.780650602409644,-84.93673734939757

Green fireball falling from sky I had gone out for a cigarette, and was looking approximately South to Southwest of my position. I had just glance away from that direction, when a green flash caught my eye. I turned in the original direction and saw a green fireball with a tail, like a comet's.  I would say it was not more than 1/4 mile from me. It was not real large, I probably could have covered it with my thumb at arm's length. It was approxiamtely 100 to 150 feet in the air when I first noticed it.  I lost site of it seconds later as it went below the roofline of a hotel in front of me.  I listened for a impact, thinking it had to hit the ground, but heard nothing.  I called two hotels that faced the direction of the fireball, but neither saw or heard anything.  The fireball did not make a sound as it fell.  I don't know where it came from, it just suddenly appeared in my vision.  I immediately went in and wrote the basics of what I saw down.  Beyond this there is no more to add. Mr. Davenport,   As I was standing looking south to southwest, the object was coming from my right to my left. athough during the time I saw it, about 5 to 10 seconds it didn't appear to go very far.  It didn't shoot across the whole sky, but seemed to appear and then drop out of my sight in the same area of sky.  The tail came off the object at a 30 to 45 degree angle.  The object seemed to be falling slowly, I believe this is so because I had time to start seeing the object out of the corner of my eye (at which time it didn't appear to be to high off the ground) turn my head and focus on the object before it fell out of view.   Our local news reported it as a ""exploding meteor"".   They also said that the object was seen as far as Alabama.  That strikes me as not possible, but you'd know better than I.  They apparently got calls all day long about the object.  Also our local airport, McGhee Tyson received calls about it. Should out local paper have an article on it in tomorrow's paper I'll forward that you. Sincerely  Mr Davenport, I posted a report to your page earlier this morning, Green Fireball in Knoxville, TN.  My name is ((name deleted)). I saw a news report after I filled out your form.  They said they had received numerous calls about a green fireball in the sky over Blount County, just south of Knox County.  Apparently I was wrong on how far it was from me, although it looked that close.  The local news is reporting as a (yep you guessed it) meteor.  This is my first siting of something like this, now I understand your cynicism about the news media.  I've seen meteor storms and such, never have I seen a green one.   I apologize if my report may be a little inaccurate, especially on the distance I thought it was from me, but it did look that close.

We are facing southern direction according to the map, time is 17:50 or 18:00 (5:50pm or 6:00pm) and the sun has gone down, but the sky is very clear. Out of nowhere, neither ascending nor descending, a circular ""thing"" appears - it simply just appeared. In appearance, the ""thing"" has the gray/white color that lightning has, and it appears as if to be glowing in an electric manner whereas the edges are very jagged and leave the same impression and feeling that electric sparks do although this has no variation in color but for gray/white colors. As far as the contours and shapes go, there is no shadow or light falling on the ""thing"" itself, so it does not look three-dimensional. Instead, it is a ""flat"" two-dimensional, yet perfectly circular, ""thing"" that appears right in front of our eyes at an unapproximated distance. However, an approximated, yet unqualified, guess is that it is is 20 seconds at 45mph down the road. Its altitude can only be estimated from seeing it by the top of the highest pinetree in the pinetree-horizon. It does not do justice, though, becauseits size is much greater and very hard to estimate. Looking at it, its radius would be approximately 1/4 inches measured by the eye, which is corrected by contact lenses that were in at the moment. For the record, I see an optician every six months. The ""thing"" traveled in a very controlled line to the east without leaving a tail of light, smoke, or other trace after itself. It did not move in anything such as a sinusoidal wave and it was neither ascending ! nor descending. It was simply a straight line to the east - not coming from the west, but appearing in a spot that would make a straight line between my eyes and the ""thing."" As the grande finale, it quickly disappeared around the house-corner after being observerved for less than 1 second. I ran around the corner but saw nothing, then to the front of the building, but saw nothing there either. Note that although it was not near the building, it was at such as angle that it disappeared ""around the corner."" Final notes from the characteristics checkboxes: The aura or haze around the object only apply if the whole thing is considered a ""solid jagged glow"" as described above. It left no trail, it had no lights (it were a huge light itself). It emitted no objects or beams. It never changed color, landed, or made a sound. No other aircraft was spotted, and no electrical or magnetic effects were experienced - we were standing outside in the grass with no electrical dependencies around.",1999-12-16T00:00:00,32.3382,-81.3983

Very fluid and fast. No sound. A little bit of light seemed to be reflecting off of the forward section of the object. Then it disappeared into the city glow. The time of my sighting is quite an odd coincidence and coincides with many events that are happening in my life. That particular night I was just feeling the cusp of a new contentness and so while hanging out with my friends in their upstairs apartment, I decided to go outside for a quick breather to be alone with myself. On the balcony (note: the balcony is only 2 feet of the ground), I was contemplating all the coincidences that had happened that entire week and even up to that day. I had no idea that something bizarre was also going to be added to the rest of them. Well I guess I felt frisky, so I hopped the balcony and walked over to the sidewalk and layed back to stargaze. We live in the Kinnear section of Queen Anne (the west side of the hill). And our apartments look out over Magnolia. I was only out on the sidewalk for a good five to seven minutes when the sighting occured. I want to stress the fact that I did ""ask"" for a sighting that night like so many other times I've done in the past but have been so awfully disappointed. My family does have a UFO/e.t. history so I thought I was being neglected, I should say. Before that night I had never seen a UFO or a visitor contact. To continue with my sighting; I noticed a good amount of planes that night and I noted that they seemed to have more blinking lights these days. They may have always been that way, but maybe just now I realized it? I could hear all these planes just fine, but the object I saw made no sound at all. I must have been staring out into nothingness (basically straight up) when a dark object entered into my line of sight. I want to note that I did not see it coming out of the corner of my eye, but rather it entered very near to the exact spot I was looking at. I was a dark shadowy object that emitted no light and was heading sort of in a SSE direction toward the city. I believe when I first saw it, it was completely dark. But as it flew in toward the city I think it did start to reflect some city light (I only speculate here) on ! the forw ard section of the craft. As it drew near the glow of the downtown area it sort of faded away and disappeared. I'm not sure if it merely flew into a misty pollution of the city lights or if it purposely made itself invisible. Anyways, the object made no sound and I really have nothing to compare it's size to, since I was looking straight up. Compared to the other planes I saw that night it did seem like it was flying about as low as the normally can go, and it seemed more solid, as the object I saw was circular in shape. Also, when comparing the object I saw to all the rest of the planes that night. This object sort of ""swooshed"" in and was not using a direct line of flight. All the other planes up there seemed to be stiff and rigid in the flight plans, while this was like a bird swooping on in. That's about it. The important thing that this sighting has taught me is that, despite my family's history of seeing UFO's and E.T.'s, I am even now doubting my sighting. And unless an E.T. comes up to me and taps me on the shoulder, or a gov't agent comes up to me and explains the entire truth behind the whole enigma, all of us will have doubts. Descartes was really on to something I guess. Thank you.",2000-02-16T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

It hung directly over the freeway above the treeline. Although there was nothing in the sky to compare it to, my sense was that the object was about 30 feet long and about one quarter of a mile away at an altitude of maybe 100 to 150 feet. What first attracted my attention was a series of 4 to 6 sequentially flashing bright white lights, with possibly one or two smaller non-flashing lights inbetween the flashing lights. The object seemed to be in fairly sharp focus and I could see a thin gray or black rod that the lights seemed to be mounted to. The rod was at an angle of about 60 degrees, like a clock arm pointing at the number 11. It did not appear to be moving. My first thought was that it was a plane approaching the airport, although if it was approaching from the north it would be perpendicular to the runway. This was quickly followed by the thought that it might be a radio tower with flashers on it, although as I said, it hung directly over the freeway. Then it just simply disappeared as though someone threw a switch. I couldn't believe it and kept staring at the spot in the sky where I saw it. It made me wonder if any of the other motorists saw it.

IT was backlit by the moon, which was at that particular time hidden by the clouds producing a diffused background glow. IT appeared to be gunmetal dark gray/black, and I had the impression of IT having a muted red glow on the lower half. I also had the impression of panels or planes on both upper and lower halves, and in the center at the equator, a row of windows. I also had the impression that the bottom half had an internal ring which was rotating. Nothing on this craft was bright, there were no blinding lights. Size is indeterminate, however holding a 25-cent piece at my arm’s length gave me an estimate. Notable was the flat top and bottom, exactly like two inverted china tea cups. Going from right to left in my ""3 foot window-of-view"" it took less than 2 seconds. The movement was smooth, without any sound. I did have the ""impression"" of subliminal sound, kind of like the Jetson’s car, but it may have been purely overactive imagining. It was at that time I looked at my bedside clock: 9:45 pm. I was shocked. I didn’t move for a minute or so, but then I ran to the window to see if IT was hovering anywhere around. As I checked out the sky (lit up by the moon), a commercial jet flew by at the usual approach altitude to SFO (maybe 3000 feet?), making the usual noise.

At that point I had to concentrate on driving, because that road has a very sharp turn to the left--almost a 90 degree angle, which I had to make.

My attention was immediately drawn to what looked like a silver balloon-type object ""maneuvering"" over the parking lot.  In fact, I would have dismissed it as a balloon had its movements not struck me as rather peculiar after watching it for a couple of minutes.  Rather than be whipped around as a balloon typically would be in a breeze or wind, it moved slowly around the cars and would occasionally seem to ""hover"" in a spot for a minute or so before slowly moving on. By now most of my co-workers had left for lunch, but I managed to get the attention of a man who was walking by my area and asked him to take a look and tell me if he saw the same thing I was looking at!  He also saw it and agreed that its movements were unusual for a balloon.  I made it a point to see if anybody else was in the parking lot who might be observing the balloon up close and personal, but there was no one.  While I considered the incident strange even as I experienced it, it obviously was not enough to make me go tearing to the elevator and out into the parking lot to get a better look (the other witness, as far as I know, didn't check it out further either).

I looked around and didnt get it and said ""what,what""? He grabbed my head and pointed me to the southeast and up. We both just shut up and watched then. What we saw looked like a very large ,softly glowing boomerang. It approached fairly slowly and looked to be only about 100 or so feet up. one thing that seemed strange to me was that it flew absolutey perfectly level and straight. It had no lights or sound whatsoever. The whole body of it had a very soft glow like one of those lightsticks only a bit softer and white not green. It seemed to trail a vapor or mist off of its entire rear edge. It flew almost directly overhead and i noticed it blocked out the stars as it went by. Because of its low light and it being night i couldnt say for sure but it was large. Maybe 200 or so feet from one end to the other. We watched it go by overhead and kept watching until it eventually flew beyond our site. Afterward we both kept asking eachother what the hell was it and it became obvious to both of us we didnt have a clue. I remember being quite excited and we both mentioned it to several people together just so we wouldnt get laughed at as bad . A few people told us that about at the same time the tv reception in the nieghborhood had gone out briefly.

Then it began to move at speeds and G's thats humans can't handle. I am an airforce depended.  We were stationed at Holloman AFB New Mexico (Just out side of Alomgordo and White Sands).  One night Me and my brother was out side talking. I looked over and saw a orange star.  It was just above the moutains.  Now I like to look at stars and New Mexico has some beautiful sky most of the time.  This night the sky clear.  I turned to my brother and said, ""look at that star.""  Then the star started to move to the left.  It was moving about the speed of a fighter jet in afterburner.  Then I thought to myself that is was most like and aircraft and it was most likly experimental.  Holloman is a very big base.  There is a road on it that allows you to drive 45mph and you probably drive for over an half an hour and still be on the base.  So I Know there is alot of experimental aircraft there.  The object moved left for about 5 seconds.  Then without hesitation it began to move to the right.  Now I've been around aircraft all my life and I had never seen a aircraft of any sourt make a manuver like that, It was a 180 degree turn.  It move right for about 5 more seconds after that it made 90 degree turn up.  It danced in the sky for about three minutes.  And it was moving at speeds imposible for fighter jets to move at.  The reason I Know this is because of the distance the craft was from us.  As it was dancing in the sky the craft made it's way above us.  And at one point the craft came staight down and I got a good look at it. Now there was no sound at all Coming from the craft.  But there was jets flying around and the reason i know this is because they have flashing lights of red and white.  This jets seem to ingore the object.  Also If there was and UFO flying over a base that at the time had Top Secert stuff on it, The UFO would have been pursued or shot down. It wasn't.  The object got so close that we ran inside the house.  There are about 5 more times that we saw objects like that in the sky in a two year period, but this one is the best one.

The light cut through the fog not unlike a laser light will cut through smoke and catch the eddies. The object made no sound neither when it was coming toward my house nor when it blew up. At 6:15 PM (1815hrs.) it was dark and clear outside and clearly visable were the moon, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. There was a cloud bank low on the eastern horizon. There were a few intermittant clouds to the northwest of our position as I had been outside doing work since about 6PM (1800hrs.) A strong sideways facing light came toward our house from about the ssw about 500 to 800' off the ground. The ovalish object resembled a helicopter with a bright spot light but the light had a green hue & did not move around. Surrounding the object was a sort of fog or smoke because the light caught the smoke as a laser light catches smoke. The object itself was difficult to see because of the haze surrounding it. The objects light got very bright then dimmed and then the object imploded. It blew up sort of like a sky rocket does and a small ringed cloud appeared where the object was. The light turned bright green and became plasma like but remained stretched straight out and angled at about 45 degrees down toward the ground. The straight green light remained for a good 10 minutes after the object was gone. The cloud which had surrounded the object shrunk in with the light and exploded outwards into a huge cloud. The green light hung in the sky for upwards of 40 minutes after the implosion. The way the light looked was a lot like the norhtern lights but without the pulsating movements. It was straight to begin with, then slowly drifted together and remained noticable for a long time. No sound was heard when the object blew up. No sound was heard when the object was approching my house. I called 911 and they were real excited about it and had the Fallon Naval Air Station on the phone and would know in about an hour. When I called back the military told the police that it was just a titan missle from Vandenberg AFB and it was nothing to worry about. When I mentioned the lack of debris and the fact that an glowing green cloud hung my place for a half an hour or so they said that they were told that there is nothing t! o worry about. The object blew over my house an nothing fell out of the sky. I have never seen anything with no sound blow up and still have no sound. Also, if it is a titan missle shouldn't there be stuff that fell off of it around here? The three observers were myself, my daughter and her friend.

The white field was in a cone shape and from the the ""inner-tip"" projected a long blue beam of light that was unlike anything I could easily describe.  The long beam got longer and the white cone light faded by time I got a good look.  What struck me that this was a ""U.F.O."" was because after whatever was producing the cone had faded into the night sky the blue beam remained for another 20 minutes or so.

Movements appeared slow, then it stopped for a short time.  It then changed direction, and traveled back to the northeast.

The sighting occured in eastern Eugene, almost above the city of Springfield.  I was returning home from eating dinner at a restraunt with a date when we observed a light about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was initially at too far a distance to see clearly, but as it approached I realized it didn't have the usual aircraft lighting.  I proceeded to pull the car into a parking lot and stopped to look at the light, now almost above us, at a 75 degree off the horizon. The light's intensity seemed to flux as it faded in and out.  Note: This effect was clearly NOT due to haze difracting the light.  The light made no sound at all.  The sky was cloudy that night, and the craft was definately below these clouds.  The moon was behind us, allowing the craft to shine clearly against the cloudy sky.  The light is best described as a small flame, similar to a lit candle.  No clear shape was observed.  I was in the parking lot for about 30-45 seconds.  Another car had pulled in and seemed to observing the same light.  It then began to travel in the Northeast direction and I got back into the car and attempted to get a different view of the light.  My passenger kept an eye on the light when she could for the breif drive to a stop light in which we again had a clear view of the light.  There were at least 3 students in the street yelling and pointing at the same light.  Suddenly, the light emmitted a glowing fireball that shot down towards earth.  The glowing ball emitted had short red fire like streamers.  However, the ball emitted seemed to disapear before it came in contact with the ground.  Trees and structures blocked my view of the ground in relation to the now seemingly distant object.  Everyone starting yelling as others witnessed the event.

I got out of the car to listen for the 'boom' and began to realize that the 'bottle rocket' was on a horizontal trajectory and was not making any noise.  As it travelled overhead I tried hard to make sense of what I was seeing: the light of the leading part was very bright and there seemed to be trails of light off of it, but they did not expand in size the further they got away from the further they got away from the main source of light - they seemed more like dashes. I don't know how many of these following trails there were - more than one, I am sure.  I can't judge distance.  It seemed so close.  And it seemed to travel leisurely, unlike the brief blips of shooting stars I have witnessed. The 'bottle rocket' continued to the east, disappearing into the trees to the right. Another man who was also in the lot at the same time and I briefly discussed the event with him.  I asked him what he thought he saw.  He said it was a large plane with trails of ""fire"".  We both agreed that it made no noise.  I said that it seemed very close. We looked up to where it had been and could see the blinking lights from a far away plane; we agreed that it seemed to be much closer than the plane.

On 11/16/99, my 4-year-old son and I were driving north on US 27 from Decatur, IN to Fort Wayne for an amateur radio club meeting. It was about 19:05, and we had crossed over the Adams-Allen county line about 4 miles ago. I had heard about the meteor shower expected to start that night, so I'm trying to look at the sky frequently. About that time, I noticed a bright green light about 10-15 degrees above the horizon, at about my 10 o'clock position. From the angle that US 27 runs, this would have been about due west of me. I thought it was too low to be a meteor, but kept glancing at it, thinking it was probably an airplane. After a few seconds, I could start to see a short, green tail below and to the left. This got my interest, so I kept watching it. It appeared to be moving in our general direction, because it was getting higher in the sky and I could see more of the tail. Thinking this was going to be one spectacular meteor, I slowed down and pulled the car over. By this time, we had been watching the fireball for about 30 seconds, and it was now so high in the sky that I had to lean forward against the steering wheel and look almost straight up to see it. The tail was bright green, and took up a good 30 degrees of arc. It wasn't nearly as bright as the fireball, which was an intense white-green light, but it was bright enough to be easily seen. The tail was also as wide as the fireball, and had a cluster of about 5 bright greenish-white points of light in it, immediately behind the fireball. Trailing farther back in the tail were about 3 more lights, not grouped together. All of these were about the same color, and were bright enough to be easily seen in the tail, but the fireball was by far the brightest. I was stunned enough by what I was seeing that I didn't pay as much attention to some of the details as I should have. For example, the exact number lights in the tail, their motion relative to the fireball and each other, the exact time or duration, or the exact spot I pulled over at. I had n! ever see n anything like this, and kept thinking that it was moving awfully slow for a meteor. We sat and watched, discussing what we were seeing, while it moved farther down the sky toward my 4 o'clock position, or about due east of me. As it got closer to the horizon, I noticed a gradual color change from the intense green-white to an orange color. Also, the fireball and tail were much dimmer and hard to see now. The trailing lights were all we could see as they became dimmer and darker orange, until I lost sight of them about 10-15 degrees above the horizon.

It would hover and then move, hover and move again.  My daughter found her camera but by the time she got it ready, the object had disappeared out of sight.

The illumination was easier to see than the shape itself, it just kinda of glowed above the cloud cover. It was about the size of a harvest moon, but not that far away. It was definately in our atomosphere and above the clouds. Thankyou, maybe others saw also?",1999-12-16T00:00:00,33.56413757440476,-111.9050830357143

Faintly comet-shaped. Military rocket launch? I am a computer-graphics animator with interest in weather, astronomy, space travel, etc. I watch the sky a lot, and what I saw wouldn't have raised the average person's eyebrow but I found it hard to explain. I was driving westbound on the 101 freeway at about 4:45pm on Friday, December 10. There was a very strong wind (around 30 mph) blowing out of the north. The sun had set earlier but the western sky was still bright with upward-slanting sunlight. The sky was completely cloudless (except for 2-3 cumulus clouds very far to the north end of the San Fernando Valley which were no longer lit by direct sunlight). There were a number of contrails from overflying jets (there are many major airways over the SF Valley). These all appeared as salmon and orange-colored lines of about two inches at arm's length. They didn't persist but followed close behind the jets. As I drove West through Sherman Oaks, I saw a small cloud to the WNW, a little to the right of the freeway and just above treetop level. It appeared a bit smaller than my thumbnail at arm's length. The cloud appeared to be illuminated by sunlight, but it was very fuzzy and not as dense or as detailed as a cumulus cloud. Still, it had visible volume and the side facing the sun (now hidden by the horizon) was brighter than the other side. It was not a bright orange or yellow as the nearby contrails but rather had a slight pinkish quality. It rather looked like a vaporous ball that had been smudged horizontally. I judged it to be fairly high and far away, based on the fact that it was still receiving sunlight even though all the mountains in the valley were in total shadow. It struck me as odd, being the only visible cloud in the sky, and not dispersing from winds. As I watched over a period of 5 minutes it drifted to the left of the freeway, still around treetop level and still being hit by sunlight. When I looked at the cloud with my peripheral vision it appeared to take on a cometary appearance, being pointed on the leading edge and fanning out on the trailing side. This detail wasn't as obvious with my direct vision. As time passed the cloud did seem to shrink slightly, perhaps to 3/4ths its original size. Eventually it disappeared from view, but given its path it wasn't going to pass behind any visual obstructions. I got the impression it simply stopped existing. My guess is: this was an exhaust plume from a military space launch from some facility to the north or northwest of the LA region. We've had a number beautiful upper-atmosphere tests here in recent years and I rather expected this to be another of those launches, but I didn't observe anything more than the one cloud. The quality of the cloud's density and shape was similar to the clips I've seen of rocket exhausts in the upper atmosphere/low orbit realm where there isn't any turbulence to speak of. If it was a rocket, then it must have been travelling westward from the launch point. That's unusual (but not unheard of) because most rockets lauch to the east to take advantage of the earth's rotational speed. If it wasn't a rocket, then I'm at a loss to explain it. Are there any records of a launch on that day?",1999-12-16T00:00:00,34.14653157894737,-118.4467076555024

The weird thing was that the flashing didn't move.  It stayed about 13 arc minutes to the east of M42.  Flashing about once every 8 seconds.  The intensity of flashes was not the same, and the interval was not the same between the flashes.  But the big flashes seemed to be around 6 - 10 seconds apart.

I was at work at the Goodyear/Dunlop Tire corporation plant on D crew (night shift) in the process of training another employee on my job. Around 6:27am I went outside for a cigarette break leaving my fellow associate to run the machine alone. After a few drags something caught the corner of my eye. I immediately looked up at it to see it was an orange egg shaped object with a bright white glow around it travelling on an upwardward diagonal course at a steady fast rate of speed with a bright white tail or trail of sparks behind it. Then within milliseconds it accellerated 2 to 3 times faster and then accellerated about 5 times faster than that and dissapeared with a small cascade of the white light from behind it either breaking the atmosphere or disintegrating. Puzzled I took a few more drags of my cigarette coaming the sky with my eyes then looked to my far right (which would be the direction where the egg would end up had it warped or jumped) and I saw a black triangular shaped shadow of an object about cloud level or slightly above fly at a very fast rate of speed in the same direction as the egg. The black triangular craft flew out of site as it was obscured by the warehouse part of the plant. Niether object made any noise. I immediately told my foreman of the incedent and he had a compass on hand. There was a magnetic disturbance at first as his compass read approximately 90 degrees off (the general direction both objects had travelled.) After my shift was over at 7:00am He came outside with me to the exact location I was standing to figure out the location of such crafts in the sky. His compass seemed to work properly then and we came to these conclusions. I was facing 330 degrees. The first egg shaped object travelled approximately 30 degrees North by NorthEast. The second dark triangular craft flew in the same 30 degrees NNE from the east.,2000-02-27T00:00:00,42.99173310344827,-78.8435848275862

The object was almost invisible, but seemed to be reflecting ambient light either from ground lights or from the eclipsed moon, as the color was almost that of the eclipsed moon. At about 10:22 CST, my brother-in-law and I were outside in his backyard. We had been observing the lunar eclipse through his telescope, but having become bored with that, we turned the scope on M42 in the constellation of Orion. I had already located M42, my brother-in-law was in the process of changing the lens to a higher power while I was observing the constellation and waiting. I noticed movement above me. Looking directly overhead, I saw what I first took to be an atmospheric disturbance, like a vortex of air. The night was exceedingly clear and full of stars, without much ambient ground light, and there was no wind. However, the leading edge (as this was the direction it was moving) of the object or vortex was faintly illuminated by a light of nearly the same color as the eclipsed moon (reddish-brown). It was almost invisible, and for a moment, I doubted what I saw, thinking perhaps it was a floater in my eye. I asked my brother-in-law to look, and he immediately spotted the object and exclaimed ""what is that?"" The object, as I said, was an arc shape, about 90 degrees of a full circle, with a relative size of a baseball held at arm's length. Within the arc, there was no apparent blocking of the starfield, such as there would have been had the object been spherical or disk-shaped and reflecting light on its leading edge or underside. It moved very quickly from overhead to between Sirius and the constellation of Orion, toward the southern horizon, when it seemed to pass beyond our range of vision. There was no sound, and no wind. I would guess that it was visible no more than six seconds. In addition, the arc shape did not remain constant, as it would if it were the leading edge or underside of a spherical or disk-shaped object. It seemed to flow, not-unlike the way a line of geese or ducks flow and waver as they fly. My brother-in-law, who has better eyesight than I do, even said that he thought it was numerous objects flying in an arc-shaped formation, but that they flowed and shifted, not unlik! e geese. However, I have considerable experience 'in the wild' and have seen flights of migratory birds both during the day and at night. First of all, to have formed this impression of an arc, there would have to have been numerous birds flying at a great height, much to high to have been seen from the ground at night. If the same formation had been seen during the day, and if they were ducks or geese, then they would have had to have been moving at super-sonic speed. To move across the sky in that amount of time, the birds would have had to have been much closer to the ground, in which case they would have been easily discernable as being birds of some sort, and at that height, given the size of the arc, could not have been more than five or six birds, in which case they could hardly have been mistaken for an arc shape. Also, they made no sound, whereas ducks and geese will honk and quack as they fly, and even when not, you can hear their wings - but there was no sound. Instead, my best description of the object is of a non-solid sherical object, clear, with light either reflecting along its forward edge or underside. As to size and speed, I can only hazard a guess or impression, as there was nothing to judge by; it could have been very large and high and moving very fast, or small and low and moving slowly. But my impression was that of an object about the size of a house, flying at two-to-four thousand feet, at about the speed of a cruise missile.",2000-01-22T00:00:00,35.12547266265719,-89.92692482230727

Their relative size was a little smaller than the full moon. The three lights seemed to difuse a bit as they reached the outside of their circle before coming together in the middle when they crossed paths again and again.

It was as large as my thumb extended at arms length. At 22:43 Jan 03, 2000 I observed in the night sky, an object traveling at a very high rate of speed, flat on the horizon. It traveled from north to south. It came into my vision at a point just below and to the south of the North Star. It traveled below Cassiopia to a point just about exactly West of me. I am in Reno, Nevada. The object was very bright (not like a fireball)like a white light. It appeared at least as bright as Venus. It took only 3 sceonds to travel this great distance of sky. It's elevation was very difficult for me to even estimate. I was looking about 12 to 15 degrees above the horizon. The object was as large as my thumb extended at arms length. It didn't get appreciably brighter nor did it fade out. It just traveled at a high rate of speed in and out of vision. I watch satellites all the time. I can usually figure how high up they are and the characteristics they demonstrate. Including how long it takes them to travel across our sky at 17,500 miles per hour. This was traveling at many times that speed. Even if it was lower, it traveled many times faster than any planes I know of. Within a very short time after I saw this object two aircraft appeared in the sky going in the direction where Lost sight of the bright object. They were very large and traveling at the speed I would expect chase aircraft to travel at. The only thing is they had very bright lights on all the way accross the sky (unlike regular aircraft)and they made no sound. It was very quiet and there was no wind. I watch aircraft all the time and I know you can hear them in these circumstances. These made no sound. They did have, in addition to the regular appearing aircraft lights, red and white strobes. Two things were very strange however; I watched the one that was traveling from North to south, in the direction of the object, for an inordinately long time and distance. I watch planes all the time and I know I cannot see them at such a distance and again I must mention they made no sound. The other aircraft appeard from the East and traveled west to the direction of the Object. I am a cool headed person in my fifty's. I  love the sky, planes and things celestial as did my mom before me. I have been observing the sky since I was a very young man. I don't know what I saw but I did see this interesting object and the craft I described. I felt I should report it.

Myself (Lebanon PD), Shiloh, Millstadt, and Dupo,.  All are in Illinois. At 0415, I was dispatched to the north side of Lebanon, Illinois, in reference to a call received by the St. Clair County Sheriff's Dept. about an object that was described to be as big as a two story house with bright lights flying around the northern end of Lebanon.   While heading east on Widicus Road, I saw what looked like two big, very bright white lights, very close together,in a stationary position,over the town of Summerfield.  I called this in to the dispatcher,and advised that I was going over there to check on it.  I also told them it definitely wasn't the moon or a star.  While heading south on Rt. 4, it changed shape, and looked like the two lights merged into one big one before my eyes.  After getting into the town of Lebanon, I turned eastbound onto Rt.50.  While traveling eastbound, I watched it change into what looked like an elongated cigar.  It was to the south-east of me at this time.  There were a few cars on the road, so I turned on my overhead emergency lights, I was going approx.75-80 mph while heading in the direction of the object.  When I turned onto old Rt.50, it started moving slowly north-east.  I stopped my squad car, turned off the overhead lights ,and turned off the car.  It then headed south-west at a very high rate of speed.  It looked like it was somewhere around 2000 ft above the ground.It passed just south of my position, approx. 150-200 feet away from me.  When I began to tell the dispatcher, it then accelerated, and headed south-west, towards Shiloh, before I could finish what I was going to tell the dispatcher, it looked like it was over Shiloh's south-east side.  I told the dispatcher that if a Shiloh officer would look up, he should see it.  Right after the end of my transmission, Shiloh advised he could see it, and that it was still heading south-west at a high rate of speed.Soon after that,the Millstadt officer told the dispatcher that he could see it.  The next reporting agency was the Dupo police Dept., who said he was watching it through his field glasses.  I couldn't discern what shape it was until it flew almost overhead.  When it did,it looked like a large, narrow triangle, with the sides being longer than the base.  It had three large, very bright white lights in what appeared to be the three corners. The lights were pointing straight down, with no oscilation.  There was one red light that blinked near the base, just in front of, and in between, the large white lights.  When it was moving away from me,the back end looked long and narrow,with white light coming from it.  The light looked like it was one long unit.  There were multi-colored lights spaning the length of the back.  I could tell there was more than one color,but not sure which ones because they seemed to blend together.  Total length of observation was approx. 4-5 minutes.  Also, when it flew past me, it made no noise.  I've drawn a total of five pictures of what I saw, and the Shiloh officer has drawn one.

My husband was actually looking through the scope and my mother and I were standing up looking at the planet unaided when I saw movement in the sky just below and to the right of Jupiter. I looked and saw what appeared to be a very large, irregularly shaped ""object"" moving at an accelerated rate through the sky. Now when I say I saw it, I'm not sure that entirely describes how I witnessed it. This thing, whatever it was, was camouflaged exquisetely. To be perfectly honest, I don't know how it even caught my attention in the first place. It almost appeared to be a piece of the night sky itself. Immedeatly, I started screaming and pointing at the object as it glided silently almost entirely undetectable. I was screaming ""Oh my God, look! Look! Look! It's f---ing huge! What the f--- is that?"" My mother spotted it a half second later and began screaming as well. When my husband saw it he began saying it might be a military aircraft and to watch closely as it passed by the stars that were in it's path. The military theory was quickly extinguished when we saw light from the stars behind it pass through revealing that it was actually transluscent. We began to run to keep it in our sights but then lost it in the glare of streetlights. We were unable to re-establish visual contact with the phenomenon. We returned to the house and scrambled to call Buckley Air National Guard. The individual there procceded to remind us of the meteor shower and offered the number of the Denver Airfield. The person there was equally apathetic and offered us the number of NUFORC. All three of us  then drew pictures of the object independently without disscussing the details and ! came up with three remarkably similar shapes. The shape, like I've stated before, was an oddly irregular boomerang shape. I say boomerang for loss of any other descriptive word, for the object lacked the symmetry associated with a boomerang yet retained a decidedly boomerang shape. It appeared to be a slightly different texture than the sky which is probably the only reason it was visible at all.

We watched for about a minuet or two and it to blinked out of sight in the middle of the sky like the first sighting earlier that evening.  This sighting occurred approximately three hours and some odd minuets after the first sighting which we phoned in.  The difference in this sighting is we had more witnesses this time.  The physician has a good knowledge of the stars and was at a loss for words about the sighting.

As it grew closer I noticed it was triangular in shape.  It made a banking turn and continued north and out of sight. I am a police officer for a suburb of Columbus, OH.  I had a ride-along passenger, who is a reserve officer for another agency in the area.  We were attempting to find a dark area within the city to observe the Leonid Meteor Shower as it was a slow night.  We had driven back into a railroad yard and stopped the cruiser.  We had been there no longer than five minutes when I noticed an object coming from east to west just west of downtown Columbus.  At first I assumed it was an airplane.  I quickly realized this was not the case.  It appeared similar in shape to an F-117 Stealth Fighter as it approached head-on.  I say this because it seemed to have similar sharp angled features.  After watching it for about 5-10 seconds I told my partner to get out of the car as I was doing the same.  I pointed in it's direction and said ""Do you see that thing?""  He too spotted the object just before it began to make a slow right banking turn.  As it turned, it showed it's underside completely to us.  It appeared to be an equalateral triangle shape.  There were no flashing lights of any kind on the craft.  It's underside had some sort of distortion to it almost as if it were camaflouged.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft.  It appeared to be relatively close to us and I actually tried to shine my spotlight on it to light it up but it was too far away to be illuminated by it.  We often have the police helicopter fly by as we are close to the heliport and it was much larger in size comparison than the helicopter although it appeared to be at a similar altitude.  After completing it's turn it leveled off and continued north having just made a 90 degree turn.  It was travelling slowly across the sky; slower than the helicopter would to use it as a comparison again.  It just seemed to glide as a stingray does through the ocean.  It disappeared out of sight to the north of our location.  I called another officer to meet me and we told him about the incident.  He suggested I call Port Columbus Airport.  I end! ed up ca lling the Airport Police and identified myself to them and asked if there was anyway they could find out if the tower had anything unidentified on their radar.  After being on hold for a couple minutes the dispatcher advised me she'd been in touch with Tracon and they had nothing unusual on their radar in the time frame I'd reported.  I cannot say what the craft was but I can say it was like nothing I've ever seen and the odd part is that it was completely silent.  I have seen and F-117 fly and I know they are quite loud.  I can also say with 100% certainty it was not any type of meteor.  It was close enough to us that we could distinctly see it's edges and shape although it was not self illuminated.  I could not say for sure what color it was as it just appeared dark in the sky.  It would have been very easy to miss had we not been looking right at it.
