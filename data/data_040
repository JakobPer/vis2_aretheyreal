I live on Fairview Ct. in Auburn. On 03/16 around 6:36pm I was going out to my car to put some dishes in it to take to my grandmother's house.  Well, I had parked on the side of the road in front of my house so my wife could get out of the driveway earlier and when I was at my car I heard an airplane above me.  I looked up to see it, and it was pretty close due to me living not far from the Lew/Aub airport.  I was checking out the lights on the plane and thinking to myself how cool would it be to see a UFO that close with the lights and all. I have a prior interest in the subject.  No sooner than that, I looked to my left (while still gazing up) and I saw a bright white light traveling from left to right far off in the distance but above the horizon.  I stared at it for a few seconds trying to make out what it was and when I realized that there were no blinking lights, I went into my house and grabbed my video cam and got about 20 seconds of footage before it disappeared. It didn't zigzag at all, just a straight path across the horizon.  It moves behind some trees and then disappears.  The sky was clear except for a haze around the horizon so I think it just may have moved into the haze.  My plans that night were to go to my grandmothers first and then to church for worship team practice and then to my friend's house to hang out with some buddies one of who is a huge UFO buff. Since I know he loves this stuff, I brought my cam in the car with me to show him the footage.  Well, I get to my grandmothers and pull over to the side of her building on Lincoln Street in Lewiston and before I got out of the car I called my friend on my cell to tell him what I got.  Two seconds later as I'm talking to him, I see the light again! Still going in the same path (left to right). I told my friend that I would call him back and threw my phone down and grabbed the camera again and caught some more footage before it disappeared behind a building.  This time was much quicker but clearer than the first.  I had zoomed in too much on the first and totally distorted part of the footage.  I really have no idea what it was but I'm pretty sure it wasn't an airplane because it was a solid bright white light only, no flashing lights or colored ones.  I called Lifeflight the next day to see if maybe their copter was in the air and they said that it was around 7pm but they said the only lights they use are landing lights and only when they are landing. Lifeflight is an emergency service for our local hospital.  Whatever it was did not make a sound as far as I could tell. It was too far away when I shot the vid at my house and when I shot the vid at my grandmother's there was too much traffic driving by to here much of anything other than the cars.  I did some more research in the next few weeks and a friend of mine got me in touch with a local newspaper reporter.  I brought the video to him and he wrote up an article about it and tied it in with a recent visit he took to Nevada and Area 51.   You can read the article by following this link:  http://www.sunjournal.com/search/story.php?ID=102716   He also checked with the local drug enforcement agency and unofficially they stated that they did not have a search copter in the air on that night but officially they would not confirm nor deny that they did.  He also checked with the local airport manager and they said that he checked his flight logs and helped the reporter rule out other possibilities.  A friend of mine mentioned the possibility of it being an iridium flare so we checked into that and found out that there was one in the area on the night in question but the altitude was too high and flares do not last as long as the light I videotaped and are of a different shape.  Mine was totally round and white and very bright.   The tape was taken in a Hi-8mm format.  I have made only one copy on VHS and that was given to the reporter.  My video camera is a Sony CCD-TRV68 which has an s-video out so I will try to have a friend of mine transfer the video into a digital format on his PC in the near future.   I would be more than happy to provide the original for analysis if needed, as long as it can be returned to me because it has one of a kind footage of other family events on it as well.

I'm an aviation freak, so I'm always looking for small general aviation planes (day or night).   The lights were so bright, it naturally grabbed my attention.   It didn't look like airplane lights flying directly toward me...looked like fire.  I seriously started to wonder if there was a mid-air with two planes, a plane with an engine fire....or even a flare from a flare gun.   Totally unexplainable ...it only lasted about 30 seconds to less than a minute.  (thought I would never see it again).   Months later it happened a second time (later 2004).   I was on the same road in my truck heading in the same westerly direction....towards that same stop sign.

In 1975 I was a marine stationed at Camp Lejeune. North Carolina. I was a military policeman and was working the graveyard shift with my partner.  As we turned down this certain street I noticed a silvery light about 100 yards away on the left side of the road.I told my partner to check it out and to keep his eyes on it since I was driving.  As we got within 50 yards or so I could not figured out what the light was.  I thought that maybe, since the light was near a trash dumpster, that an scavanging animal had maybe pulled out a plastic bag and it was reflecting back our headlight beams. This part of the base is near a wooded area right next to a large inlet of water, so I thought that my animal theory was probably correct.  When we got to about 25 yards away from the light to my surprise it was not an animal with plastic trash bag but a silvery color sphere about approximately 48 to 60 inches wide.  It hovered off the ground approximately 2 ft.  It made no noise and just kinda floated just a bit to and fro. By this time I had slowed my patrol vehicle to less than 5 miles per hour and was slowly inching our way towards the sphere.  At about 10 yards away from the object, I got a good look at it.  It didnot have a smooth surface but rather a surfaced made of crumpled tin foil and every time it shifted positions it would reflect our headlight beams. By this time my partner was mesmerized he seem to be in a trance and would not answer my questions.  At this time I grabbed hold of my spotlight control and aimed at the object. The object began to move to the edge of the road. I then shot it with the spotlight beam and the object stopped and rotated on its axis several times and than shot across the road at a tremendous rate of speed. It was so fast that one second it was right in front of us then it was gone leaving like a trail of light behind it. '' It dissappeared into a patch of trees. I had been in radio communications with my Desk Sargeant who had dispatched some backup patrols to my location but they got there to late.

On my left I was approaching the newly built Hudson High School.  I was traveling only about 25 mph. since it was a school zone. It was dark already by about 4-4:30 pm, in mid November.  There were no leaves on the large old trees which lined Joslen Blvd. at that time.  It was at this point I saw two large bright lights off to my left, in the distance, approaching from the east, above a house located on Joslen Blvd.  I took my foot off the gas and rolled down my window.  I was sure I was seeing a large plane with it’s landing lights on, about to crash. At the same time, I noticed there was no sound of jets or any engine noise at all, except my own car engine.  The lights came over top of  the house, then sharply turned south, following the road.( Joslen )  The lights flew in what seemed to be perfect unison, above the roadway, maybe 15 to 20 feet in the air, ( judging from the height of the trees along the road ).  The lights followed the road for a few seconds.  At that moment I thought it was going to crash into a small grocery store to the right of the intersection.  But when it got to the intersection , it changed direction again and shot quickly up in the air, and over the trees going east toward route 9 and out of my sight. The same lights remained visible even after changing direction and heading away from me. I could see no outline of any air craft, only the 2 lights.  Instead of going home, I turned right at the intersection and immediately drove over to the shopping center on route 9 to see where it went or if anyone there had also seen it.  I found no one else had seen it.  Driving home, I realized that the trees along the back road could never accommodate the wing span of a plane that size without some contact or damage.  These lights were the size of what you would see on a large passenger plane or jet coming in at night for a runway landing. But these lights did not seem to throw light into the distance as the landing lights do on an aircraft.  I went home and told my children and my husband what I saw.

My childhood friend and I were playing a game of catch with a baseball in our neighborhood.  The ball went over our heads and up the street.  We both ran after it to see who could get it first.  We got to the ball at the same time.  Neither one of us touched the ball, we were both distracted by what we saw ahead of us in the sky.   We were looking south and there was a Catholic church across the road from our neighborhood.  What we saw looked like it was perched on top of the tall pointed steeple.  I quickly realized that what I was seeing was actually miles away from us, and it had to be very large.  It was a very unique geometric shape, unlike anything else I have ever seen.  It was taller than it was wide.  It was very symmetric in shape.  It looked like a tall triangle was sitting on a mirror and the top point had been cut off about 3/4 of the way up, so it had a flat top and bottom.  It also looked like two more shorter stubbed triangles had been placed on either side of the object directly in the middle tapering out.  It appeared that the object was black and it had what looked like red flourescent light bulbs on it that followed the same pattern as the outer edges of the shape.  The lights were blinking on and off in a random but slow pattern.  The sky in the background was pure blue without a cloud in the sky, so the object was very distinct in the sky.  It seemed to hover in place for about thirty seconds and then started to slowly rise and move away.  Then it suddenly bolted faster than my eyes could keep up, I just remember knowing that it had traveled faster than anything on this planet could ever go, except maybe a bullet. My friend and I just stood there with our mouths hanging open in awe at what we had just seen.  We looked at each other for a few seconds without saying anything and then I said ""Did you just see that?"".  He said yes.  I told him not to say anything to me about what he saw, just to go home and write it all down and draw the object.  I then told him that we would compare our notes the next morning when we were on the bus for school.  Just for the record, I only new to do all of this because the TV show 'Project Blue Book' was a series on TV at the time and I had seen the Air Force investigators on the show tell people to do that, so they could buid a more credible case.  Anyway, we both went home and wrote and drew what we had seen.  I told my parents about it, but of course they were not going to believe a little boy telling such wild tales.  The next day my friend and I compared our notes and drawings and they were identical.  I have never forgotten that event nor have I ever seen any other drawings or pictures that looked like the object we saw.  I have always wondered if anyone else saw that object that night.  I also want it to be known that I am not sure of the exact date that this took place, but I believe that I am fairly close to it.

As I was getting out of my car I heard a humming sound with a deep vibration type bass included above me. I was across the street from my high school football field when Ilooked up and nearly had a heart attack when i saw the object hovering over the football field.  I was so scared and surprised at what I was looking at that I could barely get the words out to my 3 friends to get out of the car and look at this!  It was a Saucer shaped object of metalic looking structure with detail around it on the bottom that appeared to be holes of many in numbers and small. It was so close to the ground that I would say to be approxmatly 50ft. or so.  I at first as did my friends try to find an explanation that would discount what we were actually seeing and then we all gave into the reality of it and accepted the fact that we were wittnessing an event that would haunt our memories for the rest of our lives.  I and my friends got back into the car as the object began to move to the east very slowly.

Until then I will only know what I saw and that the Lord didn't tell us about other life forms in the universe for reasons of his own. That I can accept and that is how I deal with that event!  Since that event I have seen questionable UFOs, but never anything as clearly visible in description as that object was and I hope to never experience anything like that again for now.

Miami), FL Shape: Cigar Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46169.html,"Fleet of silver-ish cigar shaped objects, one appearing after another and then disappearing. Although I saw what I am about to describe a long time ago,  I can still recall it exactly, as if it happened yesterday.  I am by no means saying that what I saw came from ""outer space:""  just that I have never seen anything like it before or since and that it was very strange and un-earthly.  And while I believe that there is a good chance that there is intelligent life out there in the universe, I do not particularly believe that it is coming here.  Furthermore, I am the type of person who needs to see proof of something that is so unimaginable before being convinced that it exists.  Not a skeptic - but not a believer either.  My mind is open.  I am writing to you because I would like to know if what I saw matches the description of anything that anyone else has seen, or if there is an explanation for it.  Although there was another witness, I have not seen him for many years and we never really spoke about it afterwards, probably because I was facing the scene and got a much better look.  However, he definitely did see some of what I saw, so it was not just me.  Anyway, this is what I saw.  It was around dusk.  We were sitting at an outside swimming pool area in South Miami-Dade County in Florida, which is about thirty five miles south of Miami and near the Florida Keys (and the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico).  I was facing south/southwest.  I was absentmindedly looking at the sky, since we were just sitting there and relaxing and not doing much else.  All of the sudden I saw a fairly large, cigar shaped object that was silver-grey in color.  It was very strange because it's not like it came from anywhere, it was just -there-.  The sky was relatively clear, and I should have been able to see it come from somewhere before it appeared in my view.  For example, if you are watching an airplane fly, you can see it coming from somewhere and then it is in front of you and then you can watch it go away from you.  But this object did not behave like that - one moment there was nothing there, and the next moment there was.  And it is not like I even saw it appear - it was just ""there"" if that makes any sense to whoever is reading this.  It did not appear like ""poof!"" and it's there, it just WAS there, where it WAS NOT before.  I cannot explain it any more clearly than that.  So it is in the sky and I am watching it.  It makes no noise at all.  Another strange thing was that it was hard to tell how high in the air it was.  It's as if it was both close and far away at the same time.  Overall, it did not seem to be very high - it seemed to be lower than a typical stratus cloud.  My best estimate of the altitude is around 1,000 ft.  Not being able to tell the altitude also makes it hard to estimate the size of the the thing, but I am guessing anywhere from 100 feet long to 300 feet long.  It did not seem to be larger than any airplane or blimp that we have on Earth.  It was also going slow, but not other-worldly slow (ie. too slow to remain in the air). However, speed  is also hard to estimate without knowing how far it was from me.  It did not make any strange or sudden moves, and moved in a south to southwest direction, as if heading towards the Gulf of Mexico.  It did not seem to have any lights on it per se, but it did sort of glow - consider that it was near end of dusk when I saw it and the sky was fairly dark.  It had no lights, yet I could see it.  So it must have been illuminated in some way but it was sort of ""hazy.""  Now - I would probably have forgotten about this a long time ago and figured that it was something that was somehow explainable.  However - what happened next is what convinced me that I was seeing something -very- strange.  Just as the object appeared, so did many others.  First one, two, and by the time they were done there were around fifteen to twenty of them.  They -seemed- to be emanating from the first one and then flying in a slow formation.  They also seemed to be smaller, but of uniform shape and size.  The strangest part of this whole thing was that I could never actually -see- the new ones appear.  It was like the first one - it WAS NOT there, and then it WAS there.  It's not like I could see it come from the first one, or see it ""blink on.""  I really cannot explain - even to myself - how exactly they came into view.  After a couple of the new ones appeared, I pointed it out to my friend, who had his back to it at the time.  He saw about half of what I saw, I suppose.  So we watched them for a couple of minutes more, then just as strangely as they appeared - they were gone and I never saw them, or anything like them again.  I expected to see or hear something about this the next day, but there was nothing.  Other people HAD to see it.  The only thing that could help to explain what I saw is that it occurred in the general area of Homestead Air Force Base - but these things were nothing like anything else that I ever saw come from the base (or anywhere else) and I lived there for almost twenty years. They were not searchlights, nor did they look like anything else that man has ever made.  And the way that they ""appeared;""  I have never seen anything even remotely like that, anywhere else.  That's my one UFO sighting.  I say UFO because as far as I am concerned, that is exactly what they were - unidentified flying objects.  I am not saying that they came from another galaxy.  I do not know.  It was definitely strange enough for me to write to you about it, around twenty-five years later (please note that the date of viewing that I entered here is very much approximate.  It happened sometime between 1980 and 1983, and probably closer to 1980.  The day and the month are a total guess - it was a warm evening, but we are talking about the Miami area and it's always warm in the evening).  I'd be interested to hear from anyone who has seen something similar, or who can explain this.  Please - only write to me if you saw either exactly what I saw or something very close - or if you think that you can explain what I saw, or if you are an investigator who wishes to hear more.  But I am not a UFO ""buff.""  Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2005-09-15T00:00:00,,

This UFO has been described as having several lights that are turned on and off, and described as being very large, square, pizza shaped, and very quite or silent. And capable of moving extremely slow for it's size. I saw the UFO up close and analyzed it closely to try and figure out how it was able to stay suspended at such a slow speed, and wondered how it was powered, and naturally if it was human. What I noticed first off, was that the body skin was made of dimensional metal that was riveted. This told me that it was indeed an Earthly craft. I then noticed a retractable landing gear that was in fact folded up under the wing structure, that I also see as being earthly in structure, shaped for a gear and tire setup. Then the two most telling and interesting features that I noticed was; the thickness of the wing and craft structure, the center fuselage and intake and exhaust louvers. These features, not only were all suggestive of human engineering, but explained clearly how the craft worked as it did. This craft was able to fly slowly and quietly because it was designed to use the very large wing structure as both a muffler for the internal jet engines, and as a source of lift, similar to that of a hot air balloon, by trapping the exhaust heat within that large thick wing structure, thus allowing it to fly very slow and quiet. In trying to guess the thickness of the wing structure from what I was viewing, I’d have to guess that it was between eight and twelve foot thick, plenty of room for both the jet engines and the space to create the volume of heat storage to create the lift that was needed.  My conclusion is this; Not only is this a human aircraft, but it is in fact an American made aircraft. In my opinion it was designed and built to fool the naive and the inexperienced, so as to stimulate fears within the American public for the intention of justifying research and development projects that would otherwise be deemed unnecessary. A way of continuing to justify some ‘special interest groups cash flow’. That is partly why this individual UFO effort is done most always at night, and when not done at night, then from great distances away from people’s analytical view. Are we to believe that the American air space is this vulnerable to invasion? And if by chance this is the case, then we need to do something about that!  We should not allow our selves to be fooled by such ridiculous efforts. And we should cut all funding to those who are responsible for such antics. Our time and hard earned money should be spent on justifiable projects, not hoaxes. Don’t get me wrong. Though, I do not logically believe that any physical spacecraft could ever cross the vastness of the space between earth and it’s closest star safely and within a reasonable and rational amount of time to justify ever doing it   with living creatures inside, because it would take at least 100 years at extremely unsafe speeds as we know them. A small pebble would pierce any spacecraft that we humans could potentially  build today, if able to travel anywhere near the speed of light which is only half as fast as would be necessary to even get close to traversing such a vast span of space.  I could how ever rationalize potentially sending a very small, strong, highspeed craft that was projecting different types of signaled information, across our galaxy for the sake of it potentially being heard someday by another intelligent and more advanced planet, within our own galaxy, that possibly could sent something back directly at us to let us know that they are too.  Don’t think for a second that I don’t believe in unexplained objects seen in space, because I myself have seen such phenomena, and absolutely could not rationalize what it was, that I was seeing. These objects or images were both viewed on clear nights without any apparent visual interference about 30 years apart. They were to far away to have a shape or visual image other than a single light source. They both were actually being see as faint stars that just suddenly seemed to start moving. Both changed directions several times. They both gave the appearance of extreme acceleration for the distance that they were considered to be at. Then they both appeared to accelerate directly towards us, in that the small faint light grew to several times the brightness then both seemed to turn and fade as if traveling away, then streaked off very quickly and vanished as if flying out of view distance wise very quickly or as if turning the light way or off as it accelerated. Neither one flickered or turned off as if it were actually a mechanical light. Neither one ever was heard, thou other small aircraft could be heard and seen around the same time in other parts of the sky. Those events really boggled my mind, because of the situation that was taking place at the moment that they appeared. I was left with pondering a potential spiritual involvement as much as anything else. I can explain later if anyone is interested. Thank you!

My mother got up and walked over to greet me remarking about how clear it was and how beautiful the stars were.  She told me she was going in because it was cold and that I could take her seat.  I sat next to my sister and we both were looking straight up gazing at the stars.   I was about to get up to go inside when I looked straight at the horizon.  Suddenly, I noticed what I can only describe as a v-shaped formation of white lights coming at us from over the horizon.  They looked the way jets flying in a v-formation would.  The white lights were brighter than the stars that filled the background.  I would say that there were 11 lights in all with 5 on each side and one at the tip of the formation. My heart immediately jumped and I yelled for my sister to look as I extended my arm and pointed at the lights.  She quickly looked as the lights continued toward us.  They shot directly overhead at incredible speed.   There was no noise what-so-ever coming from the object(s) before, during, or after the event.  I remember,  distinctly, that as the lights passed directly overhead, they seemed to be distorting the sky as if they were connected to a ""v"" or boomerang shaped object - A black object with white ""headlights"" moving swiftly across a clear, black, star-filled sky.  I assume that the object(s) was flying relatively low because the formation of the lights spread out as it passed over us.  I would estimate the object to be extremely large considering the amount of sky it spanned across- (perhaps 1000 ft. from tip to tip).  My sister and I had no explanation for what we saw.  I am quite positive that it was not a natural event because the lights were spaced evenly apart and did not waiver from their position in the ""v"" at all.

I had been inside my house in a very rural area watching television with my family.  It was after the last show of the night, and I went to my front porch to relieve myself, as many do out in the woods.  As I stepped out of my front door onto the porch, I saw what I can only describe as two car headlights right above the treeline in front of my house, which was about a hundred yards distant.  The trees themselves were about 75 to 100 feet tall, and I estimated the lights were no more than 50 feet above that.  So I was stunned at the sight, which my mind attributed to their being a car hovering in the sky.  Instantly, I realized that this was impossible as the lights revealed themselves to be on the front of a large craft.  It was moving at about 10 miles an hour, at about the rate of a running person.  I ran in the house, screamed to my family to see the sight, then ran back outside.  The craft was now directly over our house, and I ran out in the yard to stand under it, to the great distress of my mother & father who assumed I'd get beamed up by it or something.  I looked up into the bottom of the ship, of which the outline I could barely see due to darkness, (but I could make out a vague saucer shape) but the craft had four really bright lights arrayed as points on a cross directly across from each other.  I'd say they were roughly fifty feet away from each other.  The craft appeared to be about a third larger, maybe a saucer with a diameter of 75 to 100 feet.  As per most ufo sightings, I heard hardly any sound as the massive craft passed overhead.  I strained my ears and heard a very faint hum.  As the craft passed over the trees behind my house in the direction of the rising moon, I could make out more of the thickness of the saucer and the general shape.  It appeared to be about thirty feet or so with a blinking blue strobe light on top.  We were in an intense state of excitement after this occured, and my dad called the police and reported the sighting (with a satisfaction only a life-long science fiction fan could have).  The next day at my high school, I found out that several people I knew had seen the craft as well, and some had even shot at the thing with no effect.  Another friend and her sister had chased the thing in a car only to have it shoot straight upward at a great rate of speed after a lengthy chase.  That's my tale, I found this site and wanted to record my experience for the ages, I guess...even if it happened over ten years ago.  To the life of me I can't figure out how such a thing could propel itself with no air downdrafts or normal means of propulsion/lift.  If it was a military craft, they are working with some EXTREMELY sophisticated technology these days...if I wouldn't have been outside I'd never have seen it.",2005-02-22T00:00:00,,

I was mowing my backyard lawn and went to dump clippings into trash can. As I came up with the grass catcher I was looking due west. There were 3 black christmas tree cookie cutter crafts holding a triangle formation. I went quickly into my house and asked my wife to come outside. She asked me, ""Why?"" With a bit of aggrevation in my voice, I said, ""Come on!"" She came outside with me, I pointed in the direction they were and asked her what she saw. She said, ""Christmas tree cookie cutters"". I asked her if she could hear any noise emitting from the craft. She answered no. We watched them together for a few minutes. They were not rock solid in the sky. It was a windy day (10 to 15 knot winds with slightly higher gusts) and they were being knocked around a bit.  Nevertheless, they held a constant formation. All at once, in formation, they quickly shifted to our left around 3 degrees then 6 degrees to the right (this is an estimate). They did this twice in about 3-4 seconds, stopped, and then accelerated at an unbelievable rate straight up and out of sight in around 2 seconds. My wife and I just looked at each other and I said, ""Do you think they were ours?"" My wife said, ""I hope so.""   On that afternoon we could hear about 3 of the air national guards' C-130 cargo planes. They were on the tarmac warming up their engines in preparation for moving out of Van Nuys Air Port that they had used as a home base for many years. It looked like the UFOs were looking in that direction, toward the airport possibly watching troop movements. At this point the story is over, until. . . Around 6 years later my wife, who is a teacher, and I were at a school function, sitting at the faculty table. The night's function was going fine and the kids wanted to play bingo. So they handed out bingo cards and they started playing. Those of us seated at the faculty table were not too intrested in the game and were just kind of playing along. All at once the gentleman next to me held up his bingo card, showed it to me, and said, ""Look what I have"". The card was a tan color with black plastic slides. With the center free slot filled and two black slides filled on either side of and one row below the center spot, the card's 3 black squares formed a triangle shape. I said ""I have seen that before."" He said ""Around 6 years ago?"" I said ""Yes."" I told him they were due west, he said they were north west of him. He lives 1/2 mile south of me. I don't know the math but such information means that the UFOs were not very far away.  Later on, I asked my friend why he showed me his bingo card with that triangle shape. He said he did not know why. We now say with a smile that we have a ""cosmic connection"". ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was near the end of July in 1996, Myself (20yrs old) and 3 friends (ages 17-19)were driving from Minneapolis to Winona in the middle of the night. We wanted to be in Winona at the scenic overlook by sunrise. I had made this trip one other time before. I was driving an old 2 door Ford Escort, and my friend (who is now my husband) was in the passenger seat, and another couple were in the back seat. It was sometime between 1 am and 3 am, (not sure of exact time) it was a clear night, not very cloudy at all, we were the only car on the road and we hadn't seen another car for about 30 minutes, the other couple with us had fallen asleep in the car. All of a sudden without any warning there were 9 large, bright, flashing lights out my driverside window, now my friend on the passenger side only saw one of the lights out the windshield (in the top corner on the driverside). The lights were in three rows of three, and the rows were staggered (will email drawing)The best way to describe the lights is like a set of stadium lights, like at a baseball field, when they turn on you can here the flash as the electricity runs to the bulbs. Thats how all 9 lights looked, and they all flashed at the same time, but not in a pattern just random. The lights lit up the other lane on the highway and the ditch. There was nothing but open field in this area, and the lights were very bright I was yelling at my friend ""What is that, Do you see that"" and he just staired out the windshield and was absolutely quite through this, and the two people sleeping in the back seat didn't wake up as I was yelling at my friend to answer me. Now, i'm not saying there was something wrong with him he was just shocked at what we were seeing and didn't know how to respond to me. I was driving about 60 mph when these lights appeared, and they kept pace with the car for at least 30-40 seconds, they remained out my driverside window, flashing, they didn't change color but I would say they had some color. I don't know if the lights had color or if it was my eyes messing with me, it was like stairing at the sun, you get some spects of color in your view when you look away. They were very bright white just like stadium lights. I would say the bottom row of lights were 10 feet or so above the ground, just on the other side of the ditch. I had to look up out of the window to see the top row. I asked my friend if I should stop the car, I got no response, I kept yelling what the ---- is that, I was really freaked out. I deceided to keep driving, still a speed of about 60-65 mph, and then the lights drifted just behind my window, and I looked back and they were just out the little side window in the rear for about 2-3 seconds, and then they disapeared just like that. No sound, no trails of light, nothing. It was like someone just flipped off the light switch. Then my friend looked at me and said ""that was crazy"" and then my other two friends woke up and we told them what happened and they didn't believe us of course. I don't know what it was that I saw, all I know is the lights were not there before, I didn't see the road lit up or anything and then WAM there they are, and the fact that they stayed with the car while I was driving! Stationary lights that are on a pole or something don't keep up with a car going 60, and they lit up the road so much I would have seen it on approach. Then to just disapear, it was crazy. The other weird thing was that my two friends in the back could sleep through me yelling. I just don't get it. We told everyone we knew about it when we got back and only a few believed us. Now, we were all older teens at the time but credible people, we weren't drinking or anything the night this happened. I tried for a long time to find a reasonable explination, but I can't. I could say that the lights themselves could have been some kind of stadium lights because they looked just like that, but I can't explain why they would have been in the middle of no where and how they would have turned on all of a sudden and then traveled alongside the car. And then GONE just like that. If someone has a suggestion of what it might have been please share it with me, I am open to hear anything that might explain it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was working as a student manager at Ferris State college when this event took place.  I have looked for reference to it on the internet, but have not found any.  It was reported in the local newspaper and I will relate in this story what the newspaper reported the next day.  A student manager was a quasi-security/manager that were used in the late 60's and 70's as an alternative to armed police.  I was riding shotgun with a patrol officer that evening on the 2nd shift.  We were travelling south on US 131, this was before the expressway went through the area.  As we were approaching the M-20 westbound intersection, I had looked up and saw an object in the sky.  The sky was clear and the sun was in the lower western sky.  The object was south and east of us travelling in a west-northwest direction.  I asked John, the patrolman, what that was.  He looked up and said, ""Damn, I don't know.""  He then turned down M-20 heading west.  The object seemed to be travelling at a pretty good clip.  He sped up and turned on his lights to warn traffic and we started pursuit.  I radioed into to dispatch.  We reached speeds up to 100 mph and the object passed us and then slowly went out of sight.  We radioed our position and told them we couldn't see the object anymore and we were told it had been picked up by the State Police in the next county.  Description of object:  It was oval and size was hard to determine.  If it was high up it would have been very large.  If it was close to the ground, it would have been 40'-50' feet front to back.  Actually, John and I could never figure out the size of the object.  It had an orangish color.  It could have been a reflection of the evening sun or it could have been orangish.  There was no pulsations.  There were no individual lights.  There was no details at all, in fact.  Just an oval shaped, orange glowing object that seemed to be travelling at a high rate of speed.  The local paper in Big Rapids, The Pioneer, the next day reported the incident.  They stated that the object had first been spotted in Big Rapids, then by State Police in Lake county, then by the Coast Guard radar and also Air Force radar located in Frankfurt, MI.  Two jets were scrambled out of Minnesota and they intercepted the object over Wisconsin and chased it into Iowa, where it was reported to have simply just flown away from the jets.  I have not been able to find reference to this event, though I have searched.  Many people saw this object and it was reported by many different government employees.  In fact, two days after the event, John and I were questioned for about a half hour by two individuals from some vague agency, neither of us were able to understand what it was.  When I first watched MIB and Tommy Lee Jones always made up an agence, like Division 6, I thought of these two guys that had questioned us.

Her cottage is about 80 feet from the shoreline.We were just about ready to go to bed when I noticed a very bright round object just sitting above the lake, about 40 feet off shore.At first glance I thought it might just be a full moon, or possibly someone out in a boat shinning a light at the cottage.The longer I watched it the more I realized it was nothing of the sort and I was a witness of something vey special.It was at about this moment that I looked at my father to see what his reaction was.The object was a very bright white light and round, it lit up the inside of the cottage. At this point I was so intrigued that I wanted to go outside to investigate it. I even had the thought that I would take my rifle with me. It was at this point that my dad told me to put my head down and try to go to sleep. Being only 17 years old I did what my father told me to do, I put my head down and I ended up falling asleep.It hasnt been untill recent years that my father and I have talked about the incident.I know this sounds a little strange that we have not spoke alot about it with each other untill now, but my parents are divorced, we did not see alot of each other then or now. When I finally brought the subject up with him at a family gathering I was amazed at what he said.He told me he felt extremely threatened by the object. That is why he told me to put my head down and go to sleep. He said he felt that it was his way of protecting me from what ever was out there. He also was pretending to go to sleep to relax me. He tells me after about 20 minutes he pulled his head out from under the blankets looked out the window and the object was finally gone.This object made no noise what so ever, but it has left a huge imprint on our lives.

It was brown in shape, ovular/circular, seemed to have a ""flower-petal"" equal outer indentation taking up it's entire base.  It seemed like it was spinning but I’m not positive it was.   But at one point it seemed to come to a stop then all of the sudden it shot out in a more prominent south eastern direction.   So, I hang up the phone with my friend and call my mom and grandma to see what I should do.  Ok, so I'm on the phone with my mom and grandma absolutely panicked and all of the suddenly, at a much lower altitude, what seemed to be the EXACT same object jet from the East back to a little North of where it came from before (directly above me at approx. 90 degrees) and almost came to a stop AGAIN.   Then it jetted directly West after about 30 seconds of slow movement.   The thing that freaked me out the most was about a minute or two after that, I got a bloody nose.  I don't know if there has ever been any connection between nosebleeds and confirmed sightings, but it freaked me out.   I called the Searcy Police Department to report it and I never heard anything back from them.   That's pretty much the story.  I know it sounds crazy, but I'm not a loon.  I am an honors student and pretty well grounded...",2005-10-20T00:00:00,35.23417,-91.708

I was driving south-bound on Laurel Canyon Blvd. near where it crosses Moorepark Rd. in Los Angeles, CA.  From this direction, I know it is possible to see aircraft that are departing LAX and making their way into the eastbound airways, but what I saw was nothing like any aircraft I have ever seen.  Anyway, I was driving south on the road mentioned before and I noticed a small, gray egg-shaped aircraft moving very slowly across the sky and to the east.  I paid no mind and dismissed it as a plane leaving LAX.  But the sun caught the side of it and it glimmered very brightly, and this restored my attention in the craft.  I don't know why I decided to keep watching, but as I started to examine the craft, I noticed it had no wings; just a very shiny egg-shaped craft. It then made a quick detour from its' eastbound path and darted up (north?) for a second.  What happened next is the most puzzling part of my sighting; the craft then stopped in mid-air, and it looked as if it moved toward my direction, then it suddenly departed south at a rate so fast that it looked like it just shrunk (though I'm guessing it looked as if it shrunk because it moved AWAY from me so quickly).  That was the end of the sighting.  It lasted maybe 10-20 seconds from the time I noticed it.",2005-10-20T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

AROUND 4:00 IN THE MORNING I NOTICED A BIG BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT IN THE SKY. IT WAS MOVING, BUT SLOWLY. THEN I NOTICED A SMALLER WHITE LIGHT LOOKING TO BE A PLANE OR SOMETHING RIGHT BY IT. THEY SPLIT UP. IT WAS NOT TOO MUCH LONGER THAN THAT WHEN I NOTICED THE BIG BRIGHT LIGHT SEEMED TO BE FOLLOWING ME. WHEN I WOULD STOP MY CAR AND LOOK AT IT, THATS WHEN IT WOULD START MOVING TOWARDS ME. AT ONE POINT WHILE I WAS STOPPED STARING AT IT, I FLASHED MY HEADLIGHTS AT IT TO SEE IF IT WOULD STOP MOVING AGAIN. (I STILL THOUGH MAYBE I WAS SEEING THINGS.) AFTER I FLASHED MY LIGHT IT STARTED COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE GROUND AT FIRST AND THEN STARTED DIRECTLY TOWARD ME AT A HIGH SPEED.. SO I PUT MY PEDAL TO THE METAL, AND TOOK OFF. IT WAS BACK IN THE SKY AT THIS POINT. AND I LOOKED A LITTLE CLOSER, AND I SAW ABOUT 10 OTHER LIGHTS FLYING RIGHT NEXT TO IT, BUT THEY WERE SMALLER AND DIMMER.. AND THEY JUST DISSAPAEARED. I WAS FREAKING OUT BY THIS POINT. I CALLED MY FRIEND TOMMY WHO WAS AT WORK TELLING HIM WHAT I WAS SEEING. HE SAID I WAS CRAZY. WELL, WHILE I WAS TALKING TO HIM, WHAT SEEMED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT OF SOME SORT LOOKED LIKE IT CAME OUT OF THE BALL OF LIGHT. IT WAS FLASHING RED, AND JUST WENT STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR UNTIL I COULDN'T SEE IT ANYMORE. IT WASN'T TOO FAST. AT THAT POINT I STARTED CRYING, I WAS REALLY FREAKED OUT.

WELL, AT THE END OF MY ROUTE WHEN I WAS DELIVERING THE NEWSPAPERS TO MY STORE, THE STORE CLERK WASN'T THERE YET, SO I JUST GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND STARED AT THE LIGHT. IT WAS 7:00 AM THEN, AND IT WAS JUST STARTING TO GET LIGHT OUTSIDE. WELL, ANOTHER CRAFT CAME FROM THE LIGHT. THIS I KNOW WAS AN AIRCRAFT FOR SURE, BECAUSE IT WAS FLTING AT THE LEVEL PLANES DO, MAYBE EVEN A TAD BIT CLOSER. IT WAS A TRIANGLE. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS, JUST A TRIANGLE  SHAPED AIRCRAFT. IT WAS GREY IN COLOR. THE THING THAT REALLY STOOD OUT THE MOST TO ME THOUGH WAS THE LIGHTS AROUND THE TRIANGLE. THEY WERE RED WHITE AND BLUE I BELIEVE, ONLY THEY WERE FLASHING EXTREMELY FAST. JUST LIKE A STROBE LIGHT. I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN AIRPLANE HAVE LIGHTS THAT FLASHED THAT FAST, AND IF THERE IS SUCH A THING, PLEASE TELL ME, BECAUSE I AM FREAKING OUT. THE LIGHTS WERE DIM TOO. IT MADE A REALLY STRANGE SOUND.WELL, MY STORE CLERK PULLED UP FOR WORK, AND THE SHIP WAS STILL IN THE SKY, HE SAW ME LOOKING AT THE SKY, AND GOT OUT TO SEE WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT.

The movement of the ""veil"" was very smooth, flowing, and somewhat ripple-like.  I did not hear any sound, although it was close enough that if it had made any type of noise within human range, I would have heard it clearly.  It also did not seem to be illuminated; the sky was light enough to see it moderately well (there are many streetlights and the moon was out as well). It was difficult to determine how high up it was - I was simply so shocked to see it and also was trying to determine just what I was seeing that I can't even guess.  It ""flew"" over the roof of the middle school that is approximately 20 yards from my backyard (north of my backyard; the yard faces east). As the ""veil"" moved across the sky toward the school, my dog started barking and ran to the north side of the fence with ears and tail up, but she was looking toward the school rather than up at the object.  The neighbor dogs also started barking at that time.  I then went back into the house, out the front door & looked down the street (runs north, past the school) but saw nothing at that time.  Decided I needed to tell someone, so called my sister.  While chatting, about 10 mins later, a ""cop"" car drives slowly down the street in front of the house.  I use italics because by the time I got the front door opened & turned the porch light out so I could see, the car had reached the end of the block (also an intersection for a street that runs east/west.  The school sits at that intersection, as well), and I could only see that the shape and size resembled a police car.  It did have lights across the top, but they were white.  Interestingly, another similar car was waiting at the intersection.  After a short pause, they both continued on the north-running street, shining spotlights on the outside of the school.  They continued north on the street.  I went back into the house (still on the phone, telling my sister the events as they transpired), then again to the backyard.  After another 10 minutes or so, an airplane flew over the school, fairly low and slow.  It did not fly north, but rather toward the east and then south.  Thanks, and would be curious to know if others saw anything like this that night.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,30.308469443732374,-97.76011171494488

It was traveling under a vast grey cloud cover.

Just making sure you're aware of this, more likely you're already informed, but just in case. At least one of our national networks (MTV3) reported (nonchalantly and in passing) in more than one news program a luminescent or highly reflective trail/object sighted over the morning skies of Helsinki.  Two things make this interesting. First, there are apparently quite a number of eyewitnesses, at least one of which had captured very good footage of the phenomenon with his camcorder. A short clip of that was shown on the news program. Though it was impossible to make any definite appraisals based on the few seconds I saw of the anomaly, it moved quite slowly along a trajectory and most likely reflected the rising sun rather than emitted light of its own. But this is just a layman's opinion.  Second, (and get your conspiracy hats out for this one) there was a separate report about a radar malfunction at Helsinki airport starting from 8.55 AM (local time) which lasted for 25 minutes delaying a total of 16 in- or outbound flights. There are two complementary radar systems at HEL, one of which didn't display any traffic during the malfunction. Apparently the system came back online as the GPS synchronizing clock was replaced.  I have no information whether the sightings and the malfunction actually coincided in any manner or form. Apparently neither the Finnish air traffic control or Meteorological office observed anything out of the ordinary during the sighting. An astronomy club pointed out that there is a meteor cloud in the vincinity that might result in ""spectacular"" sightings.  This is my full knowledge on the subject. If you wish to pursue this further investigate the issue through the news services and any local contacts you have. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the object reported and photographed might have been a high-altitude jet airliner, illuminated by the rising Sun.  This type of phenomenon is reported to our Center on a frequent basis.  We have no idea what may have caused the failure of the radar system, but we have no convincing evidence that the failure could have been caused by the presence of a genuine UFO.

During the time I was delivering newspapers at Kirker Creek apartments when in my car I looked up at the sky facing north I saw a bright red orange fireball type object in the darken sky.  You couldn't miss it. It was travelling at a slow rate at a low elevation around and above 500 ft in the air.  I observed the object carefully to see if this was a plane or helicopter but all I could see was a bright red orange glow all around the object.  There were no beacons of light flashing on it like a plane nothing I could spot similar to a plane was on this object.  This object though had this slow strobe blinking on it.  I watched this object fly in the sky for five minutes or more. It was heading south toward a patch of clouds as it entered the clouds I could not see it any more the object did not exit the patch of clouds as I presumed it disappeared in the clouds.  This was not my first sighting, as I witnessed this object 4 times in the past 2 months during the same time at around 5:30 am while delivering newspapers in the same area in Pittsburg on Railroad Ave and Buchanan in the neighborhood where Hillview Jr High is at. My first sighthing was in the middle of Janurary of this year on a Wednesday same time. I was on the street of Redondo Dr. and Railroad when I looked  up and saw a red orange light and had the same slow glowing strobe blinking, it was travelling at a slow rate heading east it was at a low elevation and the object didn't make a sound at all because this object was above and near me I could have heard plane noise from it but I didn't, so I started following it in my car untill I lost it the incoming clouds. I have never seen anything in the sky like what I was. I've seen so many planes in the night sky that this object differed from any other plane.  My second sighting happened two weeks after the first sighting, end of Janurary. This sighting happened on Saturday around 5:30 am again I was in the same area. I was on  El Dorado Dr just a few blocks away from Redondo. I was facing south west when I suddenly saw this time two bright red orange lights come from the south as the two objects where flying parallel to each other at the same rate of speed. The two objects were coming towards my direction at a fast rate of speed like above 100 mph a sec then then the two objects slowed down at the same time and they were on the same low elevation I saw before. I just watched the two objects fly north into a patch of clouds as I lost them.  The third sighting happened in Feburary this time I was on Buchanan and it was wednes day around 5:30 am again. I saw the object fly south at the same rate of speed and elevation and same physical characteristics I've been witnessing. I watched it for two minutes and then looked away from it for a couple of seconds as I kept on driving.  Then I looked back at the direction I saw the object was at and I could not find it anymore I looked all around in the sky and it was a clear morning. At the slow rate it was going I could have seen it pass by me even though I looked away from it I know this for fact because when I see a plane fly by I could still see pass.  The fourth sighting happened on the last week of Feburary on Saturday the 25th two weeks after todays sighting same time around 5:30 am. I was at Kirker Creek apartments when I looked up at the sky facing north I saw the same exact object. I observed it very carefully as it was flying and hovering in the sky at a low elevation. I can see it always flew in an quick stuttering up and down motion as it was doing this the oddest thing happened nothing like I saw in my previous sightings there was this tiny but visable object coming out underneath the main object it had the same color and form and it was coming down very slowly toward the ground like in a hovering and floating movement. As it was coming down the tiny object started to fade away until you could see its color any more. It vanished away. The main object just continued fly ing south into the clouds when I lost it.  Again what I've been seeing is a bright red orange fireball type object in a circular shape flying at a low elevation in the area above Railroad ave and Buchanan Pittsburg CA at a time around 5:30 am. I mainly see this object whenever the clouds start to come in and after rainy weather when there's a mix of patchy clouds and a clear sky.",2006-03-11T00:00:00,38.028,-121.8847

By this time of day, the sun was setting in the West and could no longer be seen, but the light was still bright and coming in on a side angle from out of the West. We were on the East side of the house just a hundred yards from the ocean. My band was about to play that night. I had only drank less then a 1/2 of cup of beer and I do not take drugs. I just happened to glance up towards the top of the house when suddenly and without any sound at all, a triangle shaped object traveling at my estimate, faster then the speed of sound, flew directly over the house conming out of the West and proceded out over the ocean into the East. When it was about 5 miles offshore it divided into 2 seperate objects  and kept flying at the same speed and the same altitude, about 1,500 feet, untill both objects dissapered.

March 12,1997, 9pm(date and time approximate)My son called me outside to see something strange. We lived in South Marysburg, near the community of Black River, in Prince Edward County, Ontario(Canada) on the north shore of Lake Ontario. Our home overlooked Prince Edward Bay to the south and the spectacle witnessed appeared in the eastern sky above Waupoos Island and beyond over Lake Ontario.  Orange/gold lights, brighter and much larger than the brightest, largest object in the sky at the time seemed to priodically wink in and out, each lasting at least five minutes, varying from 9 to 12 at a time. They seemed toform discernable geometric patterns appearing simultaneously as triangles, diamonds, crosses and other shapes. When a shape would emerge they would hold very still for great lengths of time, not moving but seeming to fade in and out to form new patterns. There was absolutely no movement, no sounds, no smoke and through binoculars no method of suspension or delivery as detected. After about 20 minutes, with my entire family outside watching all this we decided to go next door and alert the neighbors, an elderly couple. From the waterfront vantage point of their deck we all watched in amazement for a good houe trying to make sense of it all.  With all the attention poised towards the east, we hadn't noticed until I glanced south towards the bay that an object was clearly hovering close to the surface of the water about halfway across the bay, aprox. 3/4 kilometre. It was too dark and the glare of its lights too bright to make out any shape but it appeared as a red and white flashing light group like the grouping of lights on top of a police car. It remained there until the orange/gold lights stopped appearing and then it simply vanished. The whole event lasted about two and a half hours and when it was over I got into my car and drove to the opposite side of the bay exactly where a police cruiser would have to be parked to provide the red and white flashing lights. There was no indication of a vehicle disturbing the vegetation any where in the area. I returned the next morning and still found nothing. We waited for the news to appear about the sighting by other witnesses but never heard a thing about it until much later when we heard about the phoenix lights which apparently happened about the same time as the ones we witnessed.  I mentioned it to a senior member of the local Ontario Provincial Police and he said no cruiser was out there that night and no reports were made about the event. However someone did confide to me that they had witnessed the very same thing twenty years earlier off the south coast of our county.

It was december and many of us drove together down there. We were going to stay the night but my brothers friend wanted to go to Girdwood the next day. I was driving a motorhome so i Loaded up the boys that wanted to go and headed home. It was a very cold night no clouds with lots of stars in the sky.

This object just hovered it was even with the mountain tops on closer to the left mountain  instead of the right.

In that exact area the summer earlier (late June or early July), My friend and I were getting out of my car after comming back from Saratoga. It was approximatley 11 pm, and we were at his house which is situated on the North side of Eastline only about a half a kilometer west of the Sweet Road, Eastline Road intersection. As we walked towards his house I casually glanced over his back yard (facing north). As I scanned the placid and quiet field that expanced an approximate distance of around 300-400 meters between his back porch and the wood line, I first noticed the light that was situated stationary just below the tops of and behind the trees at the forested area which border the edge of his property. At first I thought it was some kind of tower with an affixed light source, most likely a floodlight I assumed since the intensity of the light comming through the trees seemed like it was something like a helicopter searchlight, or some other kind of spotlight. I did not however hear any type of engine noises that would accompany a conventional aircraft at such a close distance... I swear it was so quiet I dont even think there we any animal noises or even car noises for that matter. Being perplexed, I brought the unusual light to my buddie's attention and inquired if that was a normal occurance, he replied he had never seen it before. We stared at it and became even more curious when it appeared to move and then stop MOTIONLESS, then reverse direction, move and stop motionless again to a location that couldn't have been tens of meters from its original location. During it's transverse I saw what looked like the beam of the afor-mentioned light scan through the tops of the trees, now motionless again and still without sound. Thats when we became incredibly exited, we ran to a picnic table close by and stood on top to get a better look. After another few minutes it silently but quickly moved back to its original location, it then rose from behind the tops of the trees. There we could see other less brillient lights located to the right and in line on what appeared to be the physical structure of the craft with the main light still visible as what I will call the ""nose of the craft. Although we couldnt make out a definate shape it's structure seemed to change while producing other lights sporatically (it could have been just changing its orientation in relation to us) This is when the UFO semmed to dip it's ""nose"" Towards the ground and move very rapidly to the south, it then stoped, more like hovered and decended towards the ground around the vacinity of the Sweets Road, Eastline Road intersection. We imediatley jumped into my car to attempt some sort of persuit, but even at 80mph when we reached the estimated ""landing site"" of whatever this thing was there was absolutley nothing, not even a plane in the sky. We remain clueless.  As an afternote I would like to say there are no airports in the vicinty, or anything capable of supporting aircraft. The area is however, a major conduate for huge powerlines which pass within 100 meters of the sighting location. The region has had other strange sightings in the past especially in and surrounding the saratoga lake area which is also home to a government facility which developed ""Space and Energy"" Technologies during the cold war. A personal inspection of this area reveals a 6-7 story tall, rusted out rocket gantry (complete with a blast pit) no different from the gemeni launch pads a cape canaveral Florida, and other building/hangar-like structures with paddock areas which appeared to be abandoned.

As i continued to drive, i kept looking up at the object, it not only hadn't changed shape or faded as a jet stream would, it on the otherhand became clear that i was looking at a solid cylinder shape. It seamed to be at approx. 30,000 ft. and looked like a cigaret suspended in mid air at about 10 ft. distance. The road turned and i went under an overpass. When i creared the overpass, i looked for the object but it wasn't there. I studied the cloudy sky, when suddenly in the opposite direction, i saw a huge gray, blunt end cylinder hanging part way out of a large dark cloud. The sun was glaring against it and i couldn't see any windows or markings. I continued driving and looking back as it hung there monionless.

Since i was young I have always watched the sky due to the wierd things I have seen as a child.....While driving in my car I was staring at the unlit building.  Right next to it was the exact same plane that was described on the front webpage.  It was a black(almost showdow looking) triangle plane(??) that was hoovering in between the buildings in downtown.  I could not believe that I was seeing this....Since Sept.11 happened I knew that there was NO way a plane was allowed to fly anywhere near or THREW downtown in any city.  I do not know of many planes that can hoover except for the new Boeing plane...but I know that they would not be testing in Downtown Dallas.  The plane(??) did not make a sound.  I looked like a BIG triangle Shadow.  I know that Lockheed made a plane very similar that is black and undetectable to radar...So I decided to pick up my phone and I called someone that I know from Lockheed and explained to them what I was veiwing.  They informed me that they knew that they were not going to test fly the plane threw downtown Dallas and that what I was explaining couldn't be connected to Lockheed.  All I know is that the government keeps certain things hush hush...but they would never let a plane...hoover threw a downtown area.

Walton Beach, FL. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/028/S28061.html)  After the events depicted in that report, I was outside specifically looking for other strange behavior in the skies.  First sighting: ~11pm ---------------------- I was outside my Breakers hotel room watching the low clouds from ""Hannah"" storm roll inland.  In one formation of the changing clouds, they were close to left and right, and significantly further out to see toward the middle. From the left, I saw a faint pinkish glow coming from just inside of the clouds. It travelled along the beach, remaining in the cloud cover, going very fast. The really weird part of this was that it remained just inside of the clouds the entire way - going out to sea in the middle, and back inland as it passed by the right.  It seemed to want to stay inside the clouds, and it also seemed to pick up speed as it passed by to the right.  In my notes, I wrote down that the speed was ""scary!""  Both the surf and wind were very loud, so that was all I heard.  Second sighting: ~11:50pm -------------------------- I was still on the balcony watching the clouds roll in.  At this point, they were more choppy.  2 glowing oval objects flew from behind me out to sea and eventually disappeared into the oncoming clouds.  I saw no structure, only glowing ovals - each about the size of nickel at arm's length.  They were flying together, yet independently.  Their flight paths were eratic as they flew straight out to the sea (directly toward the storm).  I tried to depict this scene in the enclosed rough sketch.  I am an Electrical Engineer and I am fairly familiar with traditional airplane capabilities.  I believe that these ovals were intelligently controlled, were not based on air-foil technology, and that no person could have ridden in a vehicle that moved in such fashions.  - Note to the moderator - Please excuse the lateness of this report, but I was waiting until I had drawn a better picture of it but I got busy with other things (the picture I'm sending is not the quality I wanted to produce, but it gets the job done). I just read a recent report (http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44378.html) that depicted an object very similar to what I described here and my interest was renewed.  In fact, I'd like to share this picture with the person that made that report and see if it matches what they saw. If you could facilitate this, I would appreciate it.

We were in the Little Lagoon area of Gulf Shores (address available upon request)   I noticed a twin-engine aircraft approach parallel to the beach at about several thousand feet above the water and about the same distance from shore. Immediately after the plane flew past us, three white lights appeared in the sky above the horizon and below where we had seen the airplane. They were connected in a horizontal line and were very distinct. They seemed to be about the size of aircraft lights that would be from a distant aircraft, perhaps slightly larger.  They were not moving at all and after about 10 seconds,immediately stopped shining. A few minutes later, they appeared again, and then again once more. There were no clouds in the sky except for some high, thin clouds. So it was not clouds which caused the lights to appear and reappear, etc.  Later, a somewhat full moon rose on the horizon to the left of where we spotted these strange lights. There are also several oil rigs out in the Gulf of Mexico below where were saw these lights, however the lights were NOT at sea level. Three of my family members witnessed the lights.

Planes cannot do these moves. They were flying at a relatively high altitiude. I would guess about 10 - 15,000 feet up. My wife and I are both college grads.

They were headed in a southeasterly direction, towards the rising Moon. I watched them, in total, for at least 7 minutes. When I first noticed them, they were moving at a typical satelight speed, and after returning from grabbing the binoculars from my car, they had slowed to the point where they hung almost stationary in the sky. I was very surprised that they hadn't moved out of my range while getting the binoculars. They slowed so much that there was only minimal movement against the stars. I watched them, with the binoculars until I lost them in the Moon's glow.

I was able to keep sight of the object for about 8 secs on its pass over.

I honestly have never seen anything in the sky quite like this.  I've seen plenty of meteors and a few satellites fall and crash into the atmosphere (a sight to behold if you've never had the priviledge!!!  Quite a light show!) but never anything like this. I was gazing at the stars at 8:00 p.m. while talking to a friend over the phone.  All of a sudden on the left skyline (would be east I suppose) a faint string of lights came flying across the sky in a V-shaped pattern.   The lights were very faint but still obvious to the naked eye.  They didn't blink either, not even flicker, and each light was perfectly intervalled with the next.  It looked like a flock of birds really, except that I haven't found a species YET that can illuminate in flight!   This V-Shaped string of lights ""flapped"" its ""wings"" while in flight and sped across the sky with a speed never duplicated by any of the man made aircraft I've seen (and I live fairly close to the airport, I've seen MANY planes come in, this was NO PLANE!!!)    As the craft was exiting to the western skyline, it ""straightened"" out and did a spiral like move, holding the shape of a circle for a few moments before looping back out into the flying V, and then it disappeared over the horizon.   This entire show took only about 20-30 seconds before it disappeared into the night and I never heard the sound of an engine or anything remotely distinguishable as such.  Again, I've never seen anything move like this, and certainly never this fast.   There were commercial airplanes in the sky at the same time this craft flew through, and they took easily 5 minutes or more to clear the amount of sky that this craft breezed through in 30 seconds!

After seeing the thing in one photo, I started picking apart other photos from the night and found more. The pictures speak for themselves. They might be something logical..if so I would like to know what they are???

Cordially,    Peter Davenport ((END CORRESPONDENCE)) ((RESPONSE #1 FROM WITNESS)) That is what I was thinking maybe, but weird that they all are shaped the same way and so clear. What a strange lense flare!!  I have taken lots of night pictures and never had this happen before. Did the photos come in clearly? I think I may have sent them too small so when u zoom in it breaks up. For some reason when I send photos over outlook they don't send well. If you want I can send one through AOL and see if it is more clear. ((END #1)) ((RESPONSE #2 FROM WITNESS)) The more I study these I see that indeed they all seem to line directly with a light..all pointing away from the light. Weird though how the same light in diff pictures without  moving the camera (was on a tripod), create these flares in different ""outshoots"" of the light beams, as if they ""moved"" since the last photo. Anyway..they had me freaked out for a good part of a day...but I am convinced you are correct. Thanks for your time. ((END RESPONSE))",2005-05-11T00:00:00,44.667500000000004,-124.0155

((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness might have been looking at the star, Sirius.  Just a guess.  PD)) Well as I just finished meditating, I was looking out side at the full moon on this cold crisp clear night at about 11:30pm U.S. Central time.. I went outside and took in the stars above. They are so majestic and I have been always drawn to them. The are just so mesmerizing to me. I am so fond of them.  Well as I look at the sky this one particular object in the distance that seems to be blinking faster than normal and seems to have a distinct color(s) to it. I am like well it could be a plane at first but it was not moving and didnt drift off towards the horizion. It stayed in place. So I ran back inside and got these mini-binoculars. They aren't very strong at all in clarity but I was able to see a little better. I definitely got to see more color and to see what it was blinking. With a faint feeling for what the object may have been. The colors were Green/Red/Yellow/White and Blue. Now unless a star can produce those colors or a helicopter has those feature than I would have to say I was looking at something literally out of this world.  Now it seemed like it has a top and a bottom row of colors. It also seemed to be turning as in rotating from Right to left in a circular motion because the color of the lights seemed to be stronger in one postion while in another position there was a different set of colors. I definitely looked like it was roating just based on the movement of the colors.  I also at one time saw a white light perhaps orbish looking thing that was at the top of object. It was just slightly off to the right side of it and then it shortly disappeared soon after I observed it. I went back at looking at the object its about 11:40Pm U.S Central time. I decide that I want to get a closer look at this and see if I can get a better view so I can get more detail of this object. So I put on my coat and hop in my mini-van and I am off and away. I seem to be making ground on this and I am so excited. I pull off to the side of the road about 2-3 miles from my house which is to the North West. I get out and I don't see much better details, but the colors seem a bit brighter and distinguishable. They are definitely moving from Right to left in a circular motion. Seems to be two set's of lights. I hop back in after several minutes convinced I will get closer. I go about another 8 miles down the road. I get out and I view the object and it looks like its getting farther away. I am like damn. So i am well I better get as much viewing time as I can. The bulk of my observation is about 10-12 miles from my house and I am just looking at this thing for about another 20mins. Still in the same place in the sky and still there.  I am content and I am most satisfied to as what I have seen and experience. It was definitely a ship/craft/object that was not a plane, not a star and not a helicopter. I drive back to my house and get back. The object is still in the sky but just slightly to the right in the sky but not far off from its original position when I first saw it while looking at the moon.  I decide to look again with the binoculars and well looky here I can see it pretty good again. It seemed to be back in its original distance from me from when I first saw it. So while I went back home it must have followed me a little bit back to its original postion in the sky or close enough. Anyways I go inside and come back on the computer to check some message boards. I then go outside 5 mins after I first came in.  Now the craft has moved much further in the sky to the right even more. I was like ok. I got my binoculars again and looked some more. I was just so fascinated with it. I saw the colors once again and it was still rotating. I was like ok going back in. this was about 1:25Am U.S Central Time. I am back in on the computer for about 30 mins and then got back outside again(around 1:55am/2:00am U.S. Central time) and it is no where to be found in the Night time Sky. I was like well that was quite a show and I was most pleased and it was a fitting end. Why you ask? Because it gives further credence that it was A. Not a Star, B. Not a Plane. And C. Not a helicopter(unless helicopters like to hover for long periods of time which they can't due to fuel restrictions).  So in conclusion, what did I see? Well, in my eyes I saw a craft that was exhibiting a circular motion from right to left(Clockwise) and had multiple colors associated with it(Red/Green/Yellow/Blue/White) It seemed to be moving to and fro. Stayed in the realitive same area for up to 2hrs plus. Then it went out of site not to be seen again, anywhere in the sky. This object was bright. Like a star but it had movement upon looking at it through binoculars. It could be very easily mistaken for a star by a mere one glance at it but any more than that then it really starts to catch your eye and you realize this thing is pulsating like a christmas tree. This was an exciting time for me tonight and in the early morning hours. I wish to have further encounters and I would like to think that this was my first upon many ecounters that I will have. That this is just to break me in so to speak and each ensuing encounter will be that much more up close and personal. We shall see.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,41.2541,-87.8912

I was traveling down I-75 last night coming back to Lexington, Kentucky from Richmond, Kentucky where I attend graduate school classes.   It was directly in my line of sight right before the curve towards the Clays Ferry Exit. The sky had a few clouds but it was mostly clear. I saw it straight ahead and I saw a flash of light come from the other side and traveled halfway around the object and stopped.  It did not flash all the way around the object.  It only flashed once.  It was a disk- shaped object that was a dark color like a dark grey or brown, not quite black.   The interstate wound around and the object was no longer in front of me but it was traveling along to my right.  I was straining my eyes to see legs to a water tower, or helicoptor propellers, or wings to an airplane, but there was none of that.  It was not a water tower because for one thing, I found out that it was moving and there was nothing sticking out of the object like wings or propellers.  It was definitely going too slow to be an airplane.   The only other thing I could think of would be a blimp of some kind but it didn't have any kind of writing or basket and I don't know if those have lights.  Also, it was 8:00pm on a Monday night and no events going on that would require a blimp that I know of and it simply did not look like a blimp.  However, I am trying to justify this because it goes against everything I believe in or ever thought possible.   This thing was traveling in my line of sight for about 20 minutes.  When i got off on the Man-o-War  exit I turned the wrong way so that i could follow it and take a clear picture with my camera phone.  By the time I could stop it was too far away to see it in the picture.  My camera phone is not very clear at all, anyway.  It just kept traveling away from me and I gave up and turned back around and went home.   I am just a Nutrition grad school student and I do not have any expertise in the aircraft area.

It appeared to be quite high (like a star) was traveling slowly, in a straight line, from North to South, and passed, from my perspective, just below the tail of the Big Dipper.   It was dim at first, just a dim star-like dot, then suddenly and very briefly (1-3 seconds) became very bright - brighter than the brightest planet in the sky.

This incident probably has nothing to do with a UFO sighting or event, but I include it here because of its utterly unusual nature.  On Friday night, October 29, 2005, at approximately 18:51 hrs. (local/Pacific), I was driving south on Interstate 5, and was just north of Boeing Field, near the Albro/Swift Exit.  I was driving in the right hand lane, which affords the best view of Boeing Field of any of the lanes, given that it allows a person to look down on the airport, located on the west side of the highway.  Despite the fact that my car radio was on (tuned to KING FM 98.1), and despite the fact that my windshield wipers were operating at a ""continuous"" setting, I became aware of the roar of jet engines, set at a high power setting.  Assuming that the aural report was from a jet aircraft taking off from the long runway (34 right), I glanced down at the airport to my right, expecting to see a jet beginning its take-off role.  However, my attention was drawn to a jet aircraft that was streaking across Boeing Field at very high speed, and very low altitude, transverse to prevailing air traffic, i.e. it was streaking across the runway, flying from west to east!  Although I could not see the fuselage of the aircraft, I could see the cones of white hot exhaust, together with the shock cones clearly visible, streaming out the exhaust nozzles of the aircraft, permitting positive identification of the aircraft as a military, twin-engine jet fighter, therefore probably an F-18, an F-15, or an F-14.  As the aircraft passed over Interstate 5, having passed over Boeing field at approximately mid-field, it executed a slight, e.g. 5-10 degree, roll to its right, and it disappeared from my vision, passing over the slight hill to the east of the highway.  I estimate that the aircraft was below 1,000 feet altitude, and perhaps below 500 feet, and it was traveling at between 200 and 400 knots.  The weather was poor, and the (lateral) visibility was not more than one mile, I estimate.  The ceiling, I suspect, was at approximately 1,000 feet, or less, and I was driving in light, though continuous, rain.  In my thirty one years in Seattle, and during the 28 years that I have held a commercial pilot's license, I have never witnessed such a dramatic event in the vicinity of Boeing Field.  Given that the weather was so poor, I presume that conditions were conducive to IFR (instrument flight reference) only.  The incident is being investigated by personnel who work in air traffic control.  They report that at least one other witness reported the peculiar incident.  I have no reason to believe that the incident was, in any way, related to a UFO sighting or incident.  I report it here, only because of its seemingly truly bizarre nature.",2005-11-03T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

Whatever it was, it was not running regulation navigational beacons, and it was entering restricted airspace over Edwards AFB (northeast of my location).  What at first looked like landing lights, started to slowly pulsate.  As the object traveled further east, this pulsating light was still visible, making it impossible to be landing lights.  If you are thinking this possibly was general aviation, I have seen a few general aviation ""off-regulation navigational lights"" in the past, but read-on -- this gets better).  I got a pair of binoculars and was able to follow the object for another minute, as it got further east.  I lost it when the glare from street lights interfered.  My most interesting (and without explanation) observation of this object was when what appeared to be two smaller lights separated from the main object.  The lights were colored (one was red and one green or blue).  They seperated vertically, one departing straight up and one straight down. They were visible just for a second.  At this time, I was viewing the object thru binoculars.  After the sighting, I viewed the area of seperation again, just to see if it was possibly caused by binocular glare/reflections, but could not see anything that would cause the effect.

I spotted a swift, silent, glider-ike object flowing through the air at a very low altitude (less than 2000 feet).  It had 5 'lights' on it, in a zig-zag shape arrangment.  The lights were not spotlights, typical airplane lights, nor were they flashing.  They had a muted glowing quality, almost like a white/yellow glow in the dark look.  The 5 lights, I assumed at first were all on the same craft, but the far two lights wavered and moved closer together and then assumed the original shape again as it glided out of our sight.  It was very low and very large, a fist across when held at arms length.  We walked on, in amazement talking to each other and a voice on the path said, ""Did you guys see that?""--our neighbor Alec had seen it too and he had planted his self down in the middle of the bike path.  He had noticed it when he said the 5 or 6 lights were seperate and only after they had moved apart and then converged did they take on the glider like/chevron shape when we had spotted it. The reason I am reporting this is not only my interest and excitment for UFO's but also that I saw the same thing less than a year ago, I was also in Boulder. I called the Boulder Municipal Airport the following morning askng if their were gliders up in Boulder County that previous nights, the man informed me that all gliders are grounded prior to sunset.

There were 4 adults in the two vehicles. We were travelling together and were in communication by portable radios. My business partner called me on the radio, and asked; ""DID YOU SEE THAT?"" I answered him and said ""YES! and explained to him I thought it was just a reflection in the window from passing cars. The object was seen at the above time and date.  As we were travelling north, and I always carry a GPS handheld, I instantly looked at the time, and turned on the GPS for the exact location. The object came from out of NNE at about 30 degrees off north. I estimated the object at 35 degrees off the horizen, it was travelling at an angle of 25 to 30 degrees heading towards the mountains in front of our direction of travel in which the object disappeared behind after 2-3 seconds of the sighting. The object came in from the east heading in a west direction.  The object was ""cylinder"" shaped, even a ""bullet"" shape as my business partner descibed it. The object made no sound, no other a/c were noted in the area, no other lights were seen after or prior to the sighting. The object did not emit any other objects or lights. What all that saw the object was a ""RED"" aura on the bottem, and a ""BLUE/GREEN"" light half way up the object, this aura light was bright in intensity. Holding out my hand at arms length, the size of the object was 1/4 inch thick and 1/2 inch long. Taking a best educated guess, this was a very large object! Because of the darkness of the mountains and trees in the area, I could not reference a distance and or a true altitude. As we were at about 3-4000 feet in altitude, my best guess the altitude was at least 10,000 to 15,000 feet  (See drawing enclosed, lines are only drawn to show direction and movement)  As my spouse was driving,(she did not see the object) I was in the passenger seat of our VW Jetta. I noticed the object coming out of the right corner of the window coming in from the east towards the mountains in front of us...  The mountains were about 30-40 miles north of our position, as Hwy. 50 crosses Hwy Alt 95 which goes into Silver Springs, Nevada.  My business partner and I compared notes at to what we both saw. The other witness was a 20 year old woman, who was driving my business partners car also at the time of the sighting. (Their statements will be posted or mailed at a later date.) My business partner is 22 years old, works at a casino and owns his own internet business, the woman is 20 and works at a resturant. My background is 12 years in the USAF, several years in financial services and many years self employed. From my military experince, this was no known military or commercial aircraft that I know of. I have witnessed meteors, fireballs, and resently while in Colorado Springs, Colorado the falling of space junk which lit up the sky in a shower of sparkler lights... In all my years I have never seen anything that would remotely compare to what this object was. I would say it was a solid object, with a ""RED"" aura on the bottem and a ""BLUE/GREEN"" upper half and shaped like a cylinder/bullet in design. The estimated speed that the object was moving? Taking a college guess I would estimate the object travelled over 20-30 miles in 2-3 seconds. Estimated location of object; Lat; 39.06826 N    Long; 119.14044W  NOTE: The following day, while in Reno, Nevada, my business partner did experience a severe nosebleed for about 5 min. Again, he is 22 years old, and expressed to me, that he had never had a nosebleed before. His mother even lived in Reno, and he was sorta used to the altitude. I did tell him it could be the altitude and the dryness that may of caused the nosebleed episode.  At the time of our sighting of this ""unknown"" I would estimate there were a half dozen other vehicles going north in front and behind us because the main Hwy 95 was flooded out due to a dam breaking and flooding the highway at Fallon, Nevada. So several vehicles had to be detoured. Hopefully, others will call or send in their reports from that area.  As mentioned, the two other witnesses will submit their reports to me shortly, and I will forward these to NUFORC.",2005-06-20T00:00:00,38.8727,-119.1489

It was moving slow and in a straight line. But the first thing i noticed funny about it was that it was soooo far away. Even a plane traveling at its highest distance from the surface of the earth has some distinctive shape to it. and usually has a few lights on it to where you can make out the wings. Well this object I saw looked as if it was a very distant star. It was faint but definately visible with the naked eye. I just followed its flight until it just faded away very slowly. At first i thought mabye it was a very high plane that just went into some cloudy haze and that was the reason for it fading away, but when you look over a little more i could see every other star in the sky with the naked eye. I waited to see if it was going to come out of this unseen cloud but it never resurfaced . It simply went away. Now I'm not saying it was a UFO but for one its distance, its speed, and it just fading away makes it a little suspicious. It could have been an asteroid or some large rock or ice flying through space having the suns light reflected on it. But unless there is documentation of such an event it will still remain a mystery to me.",2005-06-20T00:00:00,41.7191,-88.3176

I was outside with my telescope at around 10:20pm... a nearby neighbour has a tree to the east and I was just lining up my scope with the Hercules Cluster (low in the north-east) when I glanced a rapidly moving bright light (about the same brightness as the star Arcturus) moving along the top of the tree.  It looked like a bright meteor so I stopped and looked up. It had stopped moving though, it was just sitting there. After a few moments it shot forward again, to the north, then stopped and shot forward again at a dead right angle to the east before vanishing about a second later.  It had a white and red light. I think both were flashing on and off but not like an airplane. It was more like the lights were fading in and out over a few seconds.  Now, Lawton is right next to Fort Sill, which is the US Army's main training ground with field artillery. (I think they test stuff here too, but I'd have to ask Deja) There are numerous air force bases around. On top of this, we've seen a stealth bomber moving silently (and very eerily) overhead so I'm under no illusions - this was the DoD playing with their toys.  What I found equally interesting was that, ten minutes later, as I was packing up, an unmarked helicopter passed fairly low nearby… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was about 20 then. It forever changed my view of things. I can't even listen to skeptics talk, espcially the ones that say as a matter of factly ""there is no such thing as ufos"" If they only could have seen...I'm not saying that there are aliens, but there are ufos for sure. After riding dirt bikes in port all day, my 2 friends (from port elizabeth) and I decided to go to Ocean city that evening. I was taken home by one of them to put my bike away and get cleaned up. We were to meet back up with my other friend at the Dorchester WaWa store. All went fine and we were headed back when we noticed 2 huge bright lights in the sky. we actually joked that it looked like a giant set of (certain)car headlights. At that point we were heading south on rt 670 about 3 miles north of mauricetown. Our conversation went back to the events of the day, until we got to the mauricetown bridge. At that point we realized that the lights were still there at the same spot, we got a good, strait on view of the front(?) of this object. We judged that it was about 500 ft above the treetops, it wasn't moving, it was HUGE, and it looked like it was hovering over the WaWa, exactly where we were going. It gets better, as we decended the bridge it was a clear, strait shot to the WaWa and we kept our eyes glued to the object the whole way.  The closer we got, the more surreal the event became, almost like real life startrek or something. When we pulled in the lot we were practically histerical. The thing was so big and close, it looked like a floating city. We pulled around to the front of the building to a normal flow of WaWa patrons and realized that no one had even noticed yet. Our friend was on the payphone out front with his GF. As soon as we stopped the truck I jumped out, ran up to my friend, shook him and pointed up. He almost dropped the phone and just said OMG. Without stopping I ran into the semi crowded store and yelled ""hey everyone there's a ufo out here"" some just looked at me like I was nuts, but most people came out to look. I remember one woman screaming and jumping into her little white car and speeding off. And for about 5-10 more minutes 10-15 of us just stood there stairing strait up at this massive rectangle shaped craft. It was dark in color, grey or black with an irregular bottom and rounded or slanted corners. It sat silent and motionless, yet afterwards we all agreed that there was a vibration or hum of energy of some sort. The size was the most impressive part. I can't really say how big, but I'm talking mother ship or floating city or whatever. Finally, very, very slowly it started moving west. Toward the original direction of the 2 lights (remember those) As soon the craft made it past the horizon of the stores' roof we jumped back in the truck and took off in it's direction to follow it. (Ocean City was the other direction) When we pulled out it was still moving slow, visible directly out of the drivers side window. But was speeding up fast. After only 10-15 seconds it was pulling away fast and starting to incline about 20 degrees. At that point, in a clear sky, it moved away from us and strait out of sight in less than 5 seconds. You can't buy tickets to an event like this, and it opened my mind forever. My folks claimed to view a disk in Millville in the 50s with a similar type of close encounter. The sightings of that time are well documented the archives here by many others. They told that story to us as kids and I always wondered. I had to believe my parents but I guess seeing is believing. After the dorchester WaWa event, I stopped wondering. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))",2005-01-19T00:00:00,39.3082,-74.9708

It moved to fast for us to see it move but we followed the red glow as it trailed like a small tail of ionized air behind and below the craft. it moved 3 times and the second time it hovered over a cow and it was lifted in air to the crafts middle at which point we started jumping up and down in excitment to what we were seeing, we unwittinglly attacted the attention of the craft and 1 second later it was over us! the beam used on the cow was now on us!  we could not look up at it as we were both paralysized physically in this beam but we could scream and we did. the light beam looked like white laser light. you could see particles of sort in light like thick light.  Inside Craft : then we both blacked out and i awoke in this craft my friend lying beside me, we were on 2 clear tables- 2 foot by 5 foot (no probes - lol) and were paralysed from the neck down. All white round room inside. It had drawers or square rectangles along every part of the walls and un uniform in appearence like a big one then 2 little ones ect. looked like man made like molded plastic. there was a window all around 5 inches or so at the top ceiling was plain and white. I dont remember the floor. we saw two , 4 foot lizzard like beings, big earthlike reptiles.  Clothes : they were collar-less one piece (tight but not skin tight) jump suits. like silver foil clothes metalic and flexible with a diamond cross pattern like a sun sheild for a car or an emergency fire blanket. it stopped at their mid arms just like our shirts and stopped at their upper thigh like shorts and no shit there was a hole for their tail which went through. no shoes, no jewlery the smoother pretty one had a clip board of sorts in his left hand about a half inch thick.     Appearence : One was pretty green like a tree snake,smooth and thin. the other one was rougher ,darker brown ,and bigger in muscle build. both were under 5 feet tall. i saw the eyes of the darker one , they were not slits for pupils as u would think but round like ours and sooo pretty. like a yellow starfish pattern as iris surrounded by redish browns. They did not speak nor any telepathic crap but i could hear it breathe at times. they both had 3 ft tails not dragging. heads like outdoor florida lizzards, pointed snout, tiny teeth , no visable hair.

It was to no avail it swept me with its tail knocking me down i then blacked out of memory till we were back on the ground and they were gone.

Laying on my back, and being quite familiar with the night sky, I observed hazy summer conditions with only the brightest stars showing. My feet were pointed to the east, and I noticed in looking back towards the west what I first thought was a meteorite approaching from the west traveling east. I sat up to watch, and mentioned to my friend that this meteor is just going and going and not burning out. I watched it fall far below the horizon, and thought it might actually make a landing in the Atlantic ocean. I laid back down and began scanning for meteors, satellites, jets, etc. when it approached from the east moving to directly overhead of me at a tremendous rate of speed. Quite abruptly, and with perfect precision and no change in speed, it performed a maneuver and changed course at about a 45 degree angle. I remember feeling ecstatic, and had quite a surge of adrenaline. I told my friend what I'd just seen, he seemed disinterested. Within a minute, the object moving at the same speed began to approach from the west. This time it performed more high speed perfect maneuvers, zig zagging directly overhead and continuing east. It was at this time that I began to percieve that it looked like a very tiny triangle with a red light at each point. It seemed to be at a very high altitude and made no noise like a turbine engine. The maneuvers were impossible for a fixed ""lift"" type wing, and too perfect and quiet for turbine thrusters. If It came back from the east I don't remember because eventually it began doing the same thing but in a North south, south/north flight path. Every time it passed, the maneuvers became more complicated, and I witnessed it at least ten times or more flying back and forth. Again, I stress that the maneuvers were geometrically perfect. My friend is not as familiar with the sky as I am, and it took a few passes for him to actually detect the craft, but what turned out to be it's last pass, he described to me the maneuvers as I had seen them. He doesn't talk about it to this day. As a matter of interest, the last maneuver that it performed actually included a full and abrupt stop, followed by a faint burst of light as it took off again towards the south. It did not accelerate...It went from zero to full speed instantaneously. The whole event left me feeling satisfied but puzzled, a bit frustrated but elated, and I can't just tell anyone, because humans live in darkness. But let those who are wise understand this...A light has shown in the darkness but the darkness has not understood it; I'm not worried about what I saw, just blessed. And someday I'll know the answer when I look not through the darkened mirror, but meet the Perfect face to face.",2005-01-19T00:00:00,,

I noticed about three flashes of light in West Texas and New Mexico, which I ignored until I got to AZ.  I was very tired as I left Tucson. About 25 miles South of South Mountain in Phoenix I had the sighting.  I was driving on I-10, which goes North from Tucson to Phoenix.  I saw a very bright white light on an aircraft to the east of I-10. The craft has a flashing blue light like in a tail area so I assumed a light plane or helicopter.  I heard no noise though. Then the tail light started to whip around in a fashion suggesting it was not attached to the craft.  The craft was also moving erractically and very quickly.  So I though wow, I´m really tired.  Then on the west side of I-10, I saw 4 very bright white lights that lit up very quickly and flew at I-10 at a very high speed and zoomed up in a parabolic way and disappeared. This was very odd.

My girlfriend and I went outside to look at the stars on may 11, 2005 at 21:45. We stood in her driveway only 20 feet from the house and began pointing out the common constalations.  We saw a faint light darting across the sky, it may have moved a half inch or so from our location at a time. We first thought it was a plane. We dismissed this after watching it for one or two minutes. The movements were too irregular to be an airplane.  It made quick, movements moving only a half inch or so at a time. It moved left, right, up, down, and every way inbetween. The object would be stationary at non-fixed interavals.  At this point we went back into the house. We called for my girlfriend's father. He came outside. At this point we all noticed the a brighter, possibly closer object demonstrating the same movements. My girlfriends father went inside.  My girlfriend and I followed him into the house and got her old teloscope and binoqulars. We assembled the teloscope, at this point it was 22:30 roughly, and the object were stationary for longer periods of time. The teloscope and binoqulars didn't help very much. They were old and too dirty. The objects were clearly round in shape. We continued to observes them until 24:10 roughly, and as time passed the objects were stationary for longer and longer periods of time.  We ploted out the points, marking a place of referrence and used a one peak of my girlfriends roof to mark the object to the left and a large pine tree to mark the object to the right.

We checked the GPS heading and the direction was South West which is only hundreds of miles of ocean, thus that ruled out any reflection on any buildings.

At first I thought it might be a jet, since it was moving at about the speed of one roughly at 25,000 feet--but this looked different from a jet or conventional aircraft of any type: I could see no appendages, it appeared to be internally luminous, not like the reflected light off of a plane, and though high up, appeared round.  As it continued rising, about 30 seconds into this, I noticed that there was another pinpoint of light in the sky that was also roughly 2 o-clock east, but reddish in color like that of Mars (except of course this was daytime, and it was a bright blue sky at the time)--and this one was standing perfectly still. I watched as the first orb continued on in its path and by passed by the other reddish orb, fairly close by, and which also seemed to be internally lit, like a soft glow, rather than reflective. I lost track of that second one as I continued focusing on the first orb,which gradually made its way almost directly overhead, though about 1 o'clock northward.  By about the time it reached zenith (or a little bit north of that), which was a few minutes into the sighting, it had slowed down, and now remained completely motionless for about five minutes straight, almost directly overhead of me.  Then, at about 7:00 or 7:05 PM, it began slowly backing up and going *backward* in an easterly direction, roughly along the same pathline from which it came, but somewhat more northeastly in arc this time. It was continuing very, very slowly, and about five or ten minutes into this movement, it stopped once again and remained motionless in the sky at about 2 o'clock NE. It seemed to be getting smaller as if it were ascending higher, and it was hard to keep track of it.  Then, at around 7:20 or 7:25 PM, it began going Westward once again, slowly climbing back as it had the very first time but in a somewhat more southwesterly arc this time, but more or less to where the same general area spot it had reached and reversed direction at earlier. This time, it finally reached the zenith of the sky at roughly 7:30.  At this point I continued watching as it moved very, very slowly further West, but covering only a small arc of sky as it grew smaller and smaller in size, and I lost track of it around 7:40. At last sighting it was located about just a few minutes in westward arc from zenith.  The entire sighting lasted almost exactly 45 minutes, as I looked at my watch both at the beginning and end of the sighting. (The other times cited are more iffy.) In short, the overall trajectory formed a kind of ""Z"" pattern (but more as begun from the bottom right of the Z and up, rather than the upper left and then down, if you know what I mean.) I have no idea as to its size, but I would guess just based on various factors (see below), this object was anywhere from 50 to 100 feet across; if so, then it's safe to say that it was roughly at 30 to 40 thousand feet high--or more--especially towards the end. (By way of reference, at one point a jetliner flew across the sky, heading in a Westerly direction, coming close to crossing the path of the orb, probably at around 25 or 30 thousand feet--and the orb seemed much higher to me, based on its luminosity and the atmospheric haze over each body. Pure guesswork, of course, but worth mentioning. )",2005-09-02T00:00:00,41.85879405940594,-88.11430594059405

Short Version: Thin Wedge shaped flying object (side view) with very bright white light crossed low over Northbound I5 near Coalinga, CA. At first we thought it was an airplane on fire about to crash. After crossing over I5, object hovered over the fields next to Southbound I5. At closer observation object had two round bright white lights. Object separated into 3 objects, each with two bright round white lights. 1 object changed color to yellow lights. One object changed color to red lights. Yellow lights flew back over I5 to fly over the fields next to Northbound I5. Objects were flying over the fields to either side of I5. Observers in car kept driving and eventually lost sight of objects behind them.  Detailed Version: What driver saw: Driving north on I5, having passed the stockyards on the right side of North I5 and maybe 5 minutes further (doing 70-80 mph). Near Exit 33 (Coalinga). Driver saw a very bright white object flying very fast from the right side of the sky. She said she knew it wasn’t natural, because it was a clear dark starry night, and it was too low for an airplane. She said it was a very bright white light. She said as it crossed over all lanes of I5 (from right to left) a half mile in front of the car, she could see in profile that it was a thin wedge shaped object that was so bright she thought it was an airplane on fire, about to crash. But it crossed over all lanes of I5 and hovered over the empty fields to the left of us, next to Southbound I5. Her impression was that it was about the size of a jet.  What I saw (Passenger): The driver had just seen a bright white object fly low across all lanes of I5 and then stabilize, hovering above the fields to the left of us. I missed this because I had my eyes closed, resting. She said, “What was that !” and I opened my eyes to look. I looked across the highway ahead and to our left. What I saw looked like two round bright white lights (bright like halogen lights) at about the height of a medium sized radio tower (Note – I did not see any tower). My friend, on the drivers side, had a better view, and she described it as super bright and was illuminating the field below it - bright and white as a search-light. She said she could see the leaves of the vegetation in the brightness of the light. She asked me again what I thought it was in the field on our left.  The shape of the object appeared to me like two horizontally aligned round lights close together, as if connected or mounted near each other but not touching. I saw the bright lights but did not see that they were attached to anything (I have poor night vision and was wearing old eyeglasses). It was too dark for me to see anything in profile, all I saw was lights. I said, “Its just a radio tower"" (I had NOT been looking ahead and had not seen the object flying across I5 in front of us). She insisted I was wrong, that it had flown there and was hovering, and asked me to look again. So I twisted in my seat to watch it as we passed.  At first as I stared at the bright horizontal dual-lights they were stationary in the air. Then suddenly, they tilted in the air to slant downwards at an angle (30 degrees). As I watched, a second dual-light object slid out from behind the first one (at the same angle), so that now there were two, and then a third slid into view so now there were 3 distinctly separate dual-light objects. They paused, then object3  oriented back to horizontal and flew to the right and up, away from the other two. At the same time, Objects 1 and 2 separated further from each other. It was VERY Dark, I5 has no lights. I kept my eyes on object3 so as not to lose sight of it. Suddenly, with a bright Flash, object3’s lights changed from Bright white to Bright yellow. In the peripheral of my vision I could see that another of the objects changed from white to Red at the same time. I believe the original object 1 stayed white. I confirmed this later with my friend who was driving – she had taken a glance at the object(s) as it separated and changed colors. This all happened very quickly (maybe 10 seconds from separation to color change). Objects moved smoothly (not in jerks) and flew smoothly while I observerd, clearly fast but did not move at jet speeds, more like fast helicopter speeds. The driver said she thought they where a little higher than an overpass, which is consistent with my observation that they were about the height of a medium sized radio tower.  The Yellow object now started to fly across I5 again, passing overhead. I looked up through the glass sunroof as object3 (the Yellow lights) passed overhead. I did not see any “shape” of an aircraft – just the yellow lights (but I was wearing my old eyeglasses). I also did not hear any aircraft engines or noise – and even though the car windows were closed, I think I would have heard jet engines or helicopter blades at the height it passed over us, if it was that sort of craft. The yellow lights (object3) hovered over the empty fields to our right, as our car drew further ahead of it. Object3 must have been also flying parallel to our direction, because it maintained its distance behind us, moving around a bit over the fields, and we were not leaving it behind as quickly as if it had been stationary. This spooked both of us, and we drove faster. It was perhaps a minute before we finally lost sight of it behind us (which is a long time when you’re doing 70-80 mph). I finally lost sight of it when it started to cross over I5 again. I twisted around in my seat to look across I5 to the fields on the left of us, looking for the other objects. I briefly saw a bright white lighted object on the side of I5 south, then lost sight of it in the dark behind us.  I looked at the time, it was 9:18 pm (pst). I estimate the duration of our sighting was from 3 to 5 minutes.  There were no headlights of traffic behind us (there had been at the start). I am assuming other drivers slowed down or stopped to watch. We were too spooked to stop. Traffic on Southbound lanes of I5 was becoming heavy and slowing down – I suspect due to people slowing down as well, to watch this phenomena.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,36.1966,-120.3906

It wasn't a whole object...i mean, it looked like there parts you could just see right through.  It only appeared in my direct line of vision for as long as you can take a deep breath.  it seemed to fade quickly toward the right.  I was shocked as hell and yelped *did you guys see that??*  a bunch of *huhs??* was the response so I shut up because it was an important part of the movie.  Maybe my mind is screwing with me, i thought and kind of let it go.  Well, after the movie i brought it up and before i could say *grey* *see-through*  or  *oval shapped*  my brother pipes up with  ""yeah, i saw something too.  Kind of yada yada yada.

The light flashed once like a bright aircraft light but after the initial flash there were no visible running lights like a conventional aircraft.  About 10 seconds later the light flashed again in an apparent northward movement, and repeated once more about 10 seconds later further north again.  There were no lights or shapes visible inbetween flashes. It was then obstructed from view in the distance by trees and buildings. The light appeared bright and close enough that normal aircraft running lights would have been easily visible inbetween the long delay between flashes.  Also the light first appeared in the NE section of the sky, it was not visible coming from the south. We had been skygazing continuously for approximately the past 20-30 minutes prior to the sighting, were actually looking up when the first flash occurred, and would have seen the light if it had been approaching from the south. The only other events of note were that we did notice 3 or 4 meteor streaks spaced out over the time we were gazing, and the only possible way for me to explain the light conventionally might be a small meteor travelling too slow to create a visible streak but fast enough for some material to have heated during reentry and ignited intermittently.  (Note to NUFORC personnel: I've submitted a number of reports over the past few years and mentioned this to the NUFORC hotline, which I called just before entering this report.  I realize one can go for years or never at all without seeing a ufo, and receiving yet another report from me might create suspicion, but for the record I maintain that all I do is look up, and that these are all legitimate reports that describe events that are just not conventional enough for me to dismiss as such.)",2005-09-02T00:00:00,40.42783368055555,-105.1976295138889

My children were all in bed upstairs in their bedrooms. In our bedroom our bed faced a north window. I got in bed and saw that I must have left a light on as there was a reflection in the window. I couldn't figure out where the light was coming from so I got up to go to the window to see where to locate the light. That was when I discovered the light was in the sky not a reflection of some light in the house. So I watched it. For just a second it was a cluster of lights and then they all spread out into a circle like a ferris wheel. That is what I thought it was, a ferris wheel. If I had stopped to think I would have known there couldn't have been a ferris wheel up that high or that big but I wasn't thinking like that. I was just fascinated with the lights. There was an open field outside the north window I was looking out of and beyond that were tall pines and houses. As I stood there and watched the lights went out and then came on again and it had moved. The lights now rather than seeming to be rounded were inverted and had a bluish tint to them. Now it didn't seem so much like a ferrish wheel but just big lights in a circle like a ferris wheel. Then the lights went out again and it moved to the left again. It didn't roll or anything like that, the lights just dissappeared and then it appeared again. It moved like this until it was out of my sight because of the trees further away from me. I didn't even think of it as a ufo untill the next morning when I was telling my daughter about it. She was 20 at that time. I never heard any other reports of anyone seeing what I saw. Although if you were standing on the ground you might not have noticed since the lights were facing out instead of down.  I was upstairs which gave me some advantage and there was a big farming field next to the window I was looking out of. I do not believe this object came from outer space I think it was something the government was working on. Before the lights ever went out the object was normal and after it went out and then came back on it seemed to me it was like an imprint a computer would leave behind or something like that. It wasn't the same as it was in the beginning. I sure wish someone could tell me what it was that I saw or if anyone else has ever seen anything like this before.

Thinking it odd that the northern lights would be in the east-- during the summer-- I pulled off the road, turned off my headlights and rolled down my car window.  I observed a shimmering light that was behind some low cloud cover. The shimmering was similar to the way sunlight filters through clouds in distinct rays-- or sun rays at sunset when they are distinct and moving. The light shimmered from right to left and another layer from left to right simultaneously. Then, what looked like a search-light moved across the clouds from right to left,hesitated, jerked back, went above the clouds, moved from left to right above, and then repeated the movement under the clouds. I could not discern whether the light was touching the ground or just the clouds. I listened for aircraft but only heard insects. I then continued driving south on 287-- stopping occasionally to attempt to understand what I was seeing. Although I was moving fast, the lights were still on my left as if they had also moved at 80 mph. I stopped, looked, and they came closer. I thought maybe there was a search for a missing person and they might think  my turned off headlights were suspicious. Then there were two searchlights in front of the shimmering background. Then there were three and one came close enough to me that I could see the source of the light better. It was round. (sorry). I became really frightened and confused by it all and sped into town.

I currently live just south of 350 off of 18th street and am aware of the flight patterns of the Purdue students and the airport...and this had NO affiliation with that.  These orange lights were much farther away and too high to be a Purdue training plane.  These orange lights would appear for 3 or 4 seconds and then fade out to nothing.  I first noticed 1 around 8:30pm.  1 quickly turned into 2, then 3 and finally 4.  These lights would appear in a row and fade in and out at different times.  Once they would fade out, it would be around 5 or 10 minutes before they would appear again...usually in the same spots, but sometimes in different spots as well.  It was completely random...as sometimes only 2 would appear, other times just 1 would appear and again 4 would appear.  It was VERY odd and strange to see.  I tried to take pictures of this event...but was unable to capture any good evidence.  I am fully aware how strange this sounds.  I wanted to try to think of a logical explanation....and...I have come to the conclusion that I have no explanation (couldnt be a shooting star or meteor shower because there was no visual movement of these object, etc).  I would like to know if others have reported seeing this event?  Also, is there any other possible explanation related to meterology that I am not thinking of?

Momentarily, another white light appeared to the right of the first one, some distance from it. Sequentially, a third light appeared equidistant from the second light, to the right, and then a fourth. As the fourth light came on, the first light went out. A fifth light came on and then the second light went out. The distance between the lights and the angle the array created would suggest a chevron shape.

PD)) Multiple luminous spheres during thunderstorm Received an email from a Clifton, Virginia man, reporting that his wife witnessed something strange late in the night, during a storm that hit our area the previous day  (Clifton is approximately 12 miles west of Springfield, in which I reside).  Email sighting account in part: ""We had a power outage last night and my wife was awakened by the answering machine clicking on and off as the power tried to recover, and then it went out completely. She went to the front door to see if it was raining or windy and saw a very large object hovering over a nearby house about an 1/8 of a mile from our house. It was larger than the house, seemed to be at an angle to her view with the bottom exposed and had lights all around it evenly spaced. When it began to move away, several lightning flashes were seen and then it was gone. The power returned two hours later"".  A second email was received the next day stating that he had a chance to talk to his wife about this sighting and he added that it would seem that his wife might have actually observed ""balls of lightning"". He also wrote: ""what she describes sounds just like a multiple ball lightning display which she says disappeared as she watched it, and then a bolt of lightning went up into the space above the house from the ground to where the lights had appeared to be"".  A little more details were obtained during a telephone interview that was conducted March 31st. Sighting took place around 12:30 AM, March 23, during a thunderstorm, as she was facing south, towards Manassas. The length of the appearance lasted just a few seconds, from the ""balls of light"" formation to the vertical lightning flash.  It is my belief that this incident may have been a natural, Rare Atmospheric Phenomena (RAP) involving multiple ball lightning, or Mobile Luminous Spheres. To be a witness of one or two of these lightning balls are rare but witnessing a group of ten or more is phenomenal!

There were no clouds in the sky and it was about 35-40 degrees F. The sun had been above the hills for maybe an hour when I looked up from my cup of tea and saw a bright white ""star"" below and a little to the right of the sun (about 1 inch below the sun from my perspective). It must have been very bright indeed because it was  close to the sun and I was wearing sunglasses, and yet, it was still very visible. It was not moving. After 1.5 - 2 seconds the light faded quickly(it didn't just ""Blink"" off, but it still faded very fast). At first I thought it might be a passenger jet that was reflecting the sunlight, but after it disappeared I saw no jet or airplane, there was no white trail, nor was there any sound. About 2 seconds after the first light faded another light appeared (it sort of ""faded in"" instead of out) farther to the right of the first position. From my perspective the two object's positions were roughly 2 inches apart in the sky. The second light was just as bright as the first, at the same distance above the horizon, and it was also motionless. It lasted around 1 second, and then faded just like the first one. Again I looked for any sign of an aircraft but there were none. I've lived in this apartment for almost three years, and I sit on the porch with my tea almost every day (except during the winter) and I have never seen anything like this before.

When I got to the top I saw a man standing in the center of it staring at the stars by himself.  I looked into the direction he was looking at and could see a star or UFO moving westward slowly.  At first I thought it was a plane, but then all of the sudden it stopped right above us.  Then it slowly moved westward then stopped and made a perfect circular path right above us then went back to the center of that circular path and stopped. Then it took off like a shooting star.  I told the tall man did you see that? he said yeah. What the heck was that?  He said, I don't know. He continued to look at the stars, and I again looked up and then to my astonishment we saw another star or UFO do the exact same thing the previous UFO had done.  I say it looked like a star because it looked like a star, but it was so high up it was probably a UFO with a bright underside to camoflauge the appearance to those below.   On a different date I saw a UFO with Red rotating lights move quite fast across the sky and it seemed to travel behind a star or a satellite. On another ocassion I witnessed something that I will never forget that happened this pass summer. I saw a red-orange ball of light approach my car and as it got closer my car stalled and I could feel heat all around me. I remeber staring at the light then falling asleep. When I awoke I found my car behind some building with dark tinted windows. I was in a parking lot and their was a fence with barbwire around it. I was so tired and exausted that I tried to start my car but it would not come on. After about 10 times it finally came on and I knew I had to get out of this place. I turned my car around and found a gate that was open and decided to turn right as I did I noticed in my rearview mirror the gate had closed. I got home at 3:36am where did all the time go? I was at my friends house and it should have taken me 20 minutes to get home. I awoke the next morning to find two moles right next to each other on my right arm perfectly lined up and my cars odomoter reset to a random number. This was smart, cause I could never mathmatically find out where that building was. I also felt as if I had been on vacation too, like I had missed being at my residence.

It made no sound and had no lights and moved very slow from southeast to northwest. It seamed to have heat wave around it like something being hot.

On 03/16/2000, I was taking off from George Bush Intercontinental Airport in a commercial Boeing 737 bound for Cancun, Mexico.  As the plane climbed, I was engaged in my usual habit of looking downward, watching the ground as it gradually grew smaller and smaller.  We then began climbing through random layers of clouds. So my view of the outside would become white-washed with clouds for several seconds at a time, followed by periods of clear to semi-clear visibility.   At one point in our ascent, while continuing to look downward, the visiblity became completely clear.  At this point, my eyes shifted and locked-on what appeared to be a metallic ball- shaped object, positioned at about 2:00 & 100 ft below us.  It seemed to be stationary, sitting just above a lower cloud bed. The object looked like a large, (about 6 feet in diameter) glistening ball bearing with no seams or wings that I could see.  The object didn't appear to be moving, as I remember turning my head to track it as we passed.   I tracked it to about 4:30, when we hit another cloud bank and my window went white.  I quickly looked at those around me, but could tell that they hadn't seen anything.  I don't really think they could have where they were seated and I wasn't about to get up and start asking everyone seated at a window, ""Excuse me sir/maam, Did you happen to see the large chrome ball floating outside the plane just a moment ago.""   At first, I'm thinking that this might just have been some sort of weather related equipment that they use around airports.  Then I start thinking how dangerous this would be to planes landing and taking off, especially concealed in cloud cover as it was.  I thought about talking to the pilots, but just blew it off.   As the years passed, I kept thinking back on what I had seen.  I've called NASA several times over the last few years, just to see if they could maybe identify the object as man-made based on my description.  Every time, I would be prompted to leave a recorded message.  I was about to, but then started getting a little wary.  Wouldn't want any ""wacko files"" opened up on me or anything.  Maybe you can help identify what I saw, man-made or otherwise.  It would seem rather small to be occupied, but who knows. Thanks.",2005-09-15T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

About the time of new term starting at schools daughters said. it was a moonlit night and the clouds were boyant bt plenty of clear sky between them- as if it was fairly windy high up. WE had to take a country road for about 11 or 12 miles through some small hamlets and one or two small villages but very quiet. The raod was welllit by the mon depsite the fast moving clouds which did not except sporadically obscure any significant part of the sky. WE had I think it was when we had the Audi with a sun roof but it might have been a Renault car I am not much good about cars. The point is we had a tinted glass sunroof. My daighter and I had been comenting on the lively night and sky when something caught my attention. WE must have travelled perhaps three miles out of the town. First behind a cloud then unshielded were three green or gey green faded but clearly there, green spheres. They would have been pretty big, I suppose if we estimated them to be er!!! flying below the clouds sometimes I dont really know what height the clouds are at!!! But at that hieght they would seem to measure about I would guess half the size of football pitch!! maybe a third. If I measured them as an artist using my thumb down a pencil- the tip of the pencil being put at the visual edge of one of the spheres and my thumb moving down until my eys sees it as recording the oposite edge and my arm straight ( if you know this methods used to measure distant objects bye artists!!!I would say they would be about three to four inches across at that distance. At first we thought there were some  kind of laser show, (we had seen one which had given us a scare when the images appeared  over our fields,)  But these  interchanged positions altering height slighty as the way a car does on and unneven road. Also of the road tured they altered thier path to follow us blatantly drawing close to one another to take the turn. At first watching them partly throught the sunroof and partly by craning our necks was just interesting then we becaem disconcerted when we saw they were following us and it becamwe more urgent to get home fast. In fact they trailed us for all  but th last mile home when we reached a village and took the sharp turn left they swung around and went into the distance growing smaller as they went. we didnt know what to think we were sure they were some kind of spacecraft. There  were no seperate lights as I have heard described though, just a continuous ring (pale green) each of them had and the middle was obscured somehow. we are used to seeing helicopetors as we lived on thier flight path from a military base some 12 miles in another direction, and also planes and airballoon but none like this and theses were moving fact and had great propulsion faster than a jet plane when they went off but not a sound.  My husband met a neighbour( about a mile away) a week later and when he went to mention it the neighbour said' that is odd we were also followed by those 'exactly the same'. Then in the local paper for Cornwall (and I have a picture someone took) was a report (up near bodmin I think it was) of this Ufo 'one only' but very like the ones we had been followed by, but this was taken in the day at sun set!!!! Around the same time  ( and this may be accountable any other way, I do not know, may be unconnected but those were very real no question) I was awakened in the night by a very bright white light blue white. The road ran next to the house, so I thought at first and so did hubby it must be a car!! I actually had made little shutter fo this side window but they didnt fit very well so they let light in along the edges and it shone straight on my face. I opened up the shutter to see and there was no car and the moon was not visable or at least I could not find it and also the light was much much brighter and very white with a bue eliment to it. I could not see its course, it lasted a while um! maybe twenty minutes half an hour and went. I had often told people about these sightings and they came back with amazing stories but I never found anywhere to report it and find out whatit was, then I was reading the uninvited lately having got it in a pile of books i got at charity shop[ before we left england two years ago. and when I mentioned the light it reminded me and fankly gave me the w*llies. Now I am wondering exactly how far that encounter actually went!!!! at least if you have this information  you can look into it yourselves and it isnt lost forever which I hated because I think anoything lik ethis shou dbe recorded otherwise how can we knwo waht is happening or to what extent?

It resembeled a bright star, at about the same altitude a star would be (or so it seemed), which moved at various speeds and directions for 20-30 minutes.  The light would start in one place, then would zip across the sky to another place.  It continued to do this in different directions, at different speeds, and in different formations.  It zipped back and forth, and would stop sometimes, only to start its erratic movement again.  Sometimes it would even seem to disappear, only for a moment, before reappearing somewhere else in the sky.  It was still light outside, although it took place years ago, so the time of day listed is only an estimate.  I have only talked to people of this, and have never reported it, as I only today found out about this organization.  Coincidentally, my sister (who I had spoken to about the incident years ago), while attending a similar festival in Manchester, Tennessee a year or so ago, witnessed a strikingly similar unidentified flying object in the sky.  It had the same flying patterns as I mentioned above.  My sister was amazed, since she had been skeptical of my sighting years earlier, and since it was so similar, but in a different state and years later in a similar situation.  This object was unlike any aircraft I've ever witnessed in terms of altitude, speed, and the way it could so abruptly stop and change directions.  Also, it remained in the same general area for a long period, which I have never witnessed in a plane before.  Since many people attended both of these events, I can't help but think others witnessed these events, or if any explanations can or have been offered, and I am very curious to know.

It happened after the kids and I were leaving a 4-H meeting in Twelve Mile.  I was traveling South on the country road out of the small town.  About a mile out of town I saw several bright white lights in a row (approx. 12-16) hovering over the tree tops that were along the edge of a field.   I stopped the minivan and asked the kids ""What IS that?""   We all sat and looked at it, trying to make out what the string of lights were connected to.  The lights were all even to each other and didn't bounce, flash, flicker, drop or rise in the air.  Judging from the height and width of the tree line and field, this object was at least as long as a football field, if not bigger.  I turned my van off and opened my window all the way.  There was no audible sound coming from it.  I knew it couldn't have been any type of known aircraft because it was much too large.   As we watched these lights it seemed that the object they were on must have been a disk shape because the lights all began moving slowly and steadily off to the right.  As they moved off to the right, each light to the far right would disappear one by one.  It was as if the object was disk shaped and was only lighted on one side and as it turned the lights disappeared out of our view, blocked by the solid object itself.

How do I know, both of my children were still in school. It happened one night in late September (date is approximate ) after 10:30 pm. The kids had gone to bed and the evening news was over. I can't get this sighting out of my head and since we did not have the internet at that time, I am reporting it now. My husband and I got into the habit of going out after the news to watch the sky. He had studied some astronomy in college and we both liked looking at the stars. The kids had gone to bed so, we went out to the back yard (away from the street lights) to watch the stars. We were looking to the west and about 20 to 25 degrees off the horizon, I noticed a light blue very bright light. It was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length. I pointed it out to him since it was so different from the stars we were observing. We watched it for about 10 to 15 minutes. It just sat there, no movement. I got cold as the night was chilly and decided to go in and get a coat, I wanted to get the binoculars also. I came out with the bincoulars and looked at the object. It was still in the same place. As I watched a red light appeared on the left side (as you are facing it) and watched. About a minute or two later, the red light went over the top of the blue object (kind or like rolling over the top of it) and was now, on the right side. I watched it for about a minute or two when suddenly, the red light shot off the blue object and came toward us.(This would have been to the east ) I trained the binoculars on it and what I saw scared the hell out of me. It was sort of delta wing shaped with an extension to the front. It was bright red and moving at an incredible rate of speed. This thing was fast! I quickly handed the binoculars to my husband who was in shock to say the least. He handed them back in time for me to see it arc toward the north. I swear but, am not sure now that I saw windows under the extension part. I couldn't tell you for sure as it moved so fast and to tell you the truth, I was so scared... I went into the house as soon as it was lost behind the trees. My husband wanted to stay out and see what happened but, I was so affraid that I was crying and begging him to come in. When we got in I asked him to draw what he saw and I would do the same. He did and I did and it came out VERY similar. I am sorry now that I was such a coward, now, and did not stay to see what happened. This was many years ago but, it has stayed in my mind. I just want to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like this or if anyone knows what it was. I am familiar with aircraft and this was nothing like I have ever seen before.",2005-02-22T00:00:00,43.9788,-96.6935

My freind and I drove around the US. At one point I awoke at about 2 am, my freind was driving and we pulled off the hiway to get gas, use restrooms and switch shifts. At some point we noticed a crunching sound on the road and when we pulled in to the fuel station it became apparent that there was a real swarm of crickets. Regular, large, healthy black crickets-everywhere. There were so many they were in the toilets and sinks, unavoidable and hopping everywhere. Strange. We thought. That is until we got back on the hiway. I had taken over driving. It was a pitch black night, in a seemingly unpopulated area. After looking at a map I'm sure it was somewhere between Madera and Manteca. As soon as we re-entered the hiway my peripheral vision noticed movement to the left, right out over a grassy area next to the hiway. As soon as I looked over, my freind noticed as well. I beleive she said with puzzlement something to the effect of 'what the hell is that?' At first glance it appeared as though it was connected to the ground and moving slowly north-the same as us. The reason it looked that way is because I've never seen anything in the air ever move that slow, except birds, helicopters, and maybe a ferris wheel. Plus it was seemingly vertically arranged. The only thing visible was a bright whitish/yellowish light on top and bottom,and three triangularly arranged bluish,reddish, and orangish lights placed equidistant between top and bottom. We estimate the total height to be 15-30 feet, probably closer to 30. Right after we noticed it, it was going the same speed as us, then it accelerated with ease straight down along the west side of the hiway going north. At this point I said,'That is definitely not an airplane' This thing was so, so strange I felt an instant and major upwelling of fear, apprehension, curiosity. As we continued watching it almost reached a hiway overpass and smoothly, quickly and deliberately crossed the hiway and turned 90 degrees to the south.I felt like it was very aware of the fact that we were watching it. It began coming right at us. My freind began sobbing as I pulled over. She just kept saying ""keep going,don't stop, don't stop!"" ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was the summer of 1981. I was on an overnight stay at Lake Travis just outside of Austin, Texas, with 3 other friends. I couldn't sleep for gazing at all the stars. They were beautiful as always. Sometime after midnight, I spotted lights flashing in a circular motion of red and green. They appeared to be about the distance of todays satellite's, in the sky just overhead of me. This was a popular campsite and probably 20 - 30 people were scattered over the entire campsite. I was camping on the East side of Lake Travis. I became fixed on the site immediately. After 1-2 minutes, they completed another circle and shot off out in to space in a straight line formation. As if to follow one another. The speed was incredible. So fast I lost them quickly as they left a short streak of light behind them as they disappeared in the night, some 30-45 seconds more. I woke my 3 friends with a start! Trying quietly and calmly to explain what I'd seen. This took another 2-2.1/2 minutes. Suddenly, 2 Air Force Jets came flying very low and very fast over the campsite and woke up everyone there. They were extremely loud! We all held our ears for they were low. They flew up and towards the direction of the lights I had just seen going S-SW of the Lake. Everyone there witnessed the Jets. I had no interest in UFO's at the time, but I felt I had seen what the Jets were after. It was only years later when television began showing a number of shows about UFO's that I became curious about what I saw that night back in the summer of 81'. Most sightings are near Air Force Bases or so I've heard. Also, that military air vehicles are present at the time of other sightings.

The ball got loose so we all stopped to look for it. I heard a  faint low pitched humming sound from above so I looked up and saw a slow moving large triangular shaped craft with dim lights(red,blue green or yellow) at the corners. We all saw it. It moved too slowly  and quietly to be a airplane . It was a clear starlit night and as it moved across the sky it obscured the stars as it passed by. I think that it was flying at a  fairly low altitude which made it appear to be larger than a jumbojet. This all took place in the fall of 87(approx), around which time there were a number of similar sightings all over the Hudson Valley . I feel that this sighting was  of a man-made  craft , possibly military in nature, the nationality or origin of which is unknown. In other words I do not believe it was extraterrestrial. Also an Eastchester police patrol car drove slowly by on Leewood drive and pulled into the parking lot and stopped to possibly watch it float by.

Man views lighted blimp-like object float over house.

I pulled up into the driveway. (This is a very rural area in Missouri.) I went to the door and knocked. My friend was not at home. I got ready to get back into the car and leave, when I noticed several  lights in the western sky. They were moving toward me at a slow but steady speed. I moved away from the car and into a field adjacent to my friends house. I could not make out what it was. There was no discernible silhouette, just several lights coming my way. The object then got directly over head and seem to take up the entire night sky. I then noticed that the lights (There were either three or five of them I don't really recall) seem to be attached to one large object. The lights seem to be facing towards the object instead of facing outward as you would expect. When I looked at the object I got the impression that this is what a blimp would look like if it had been flying at night with the lights turned towards the blimp. It seem to be just above my head, about two hundred feet or so.  I'm just guessing. There was dead silence. I heard nothing that would explain its propulsion except the wind. Even though the object moved slowly I think it would have moved even slower if governed by the wind alone. I  continued to watch the object until it disappeared in the eastern sky. This may have been a total of five to ten minutes. It never once slowed down or seem to veer from a straight course and seem to stay the same distance from the ground the entire time. I got into the car trying to sort out what I had seen, debating on if  I should tell anyone else. I went to eat a late dinner and then decided I would go and tell another friend of mine about the experience. I got to his house right at ten o'clock. The local news was just coming on. Just before I had the chance to tell him about my experience. The first line of the news cast said  "" If you saw it, you weren't the only one."" They continued to say reports had come in by the hundreds and that it had been seen in at least seven different states that night.  An investigation was under way. The next morning there was a small news segment about  scientists thinking it may have been a gaseous cloud that had ignited in the upper atmosphere but it was still being investigated. On the day following the official report came back. It was a Russian Rocket that was reentering  the earths atmosphere. I have problems with all the above explanations.  For instance, Anything burning I believe would at least flicker. This was not consistent with what I had seen. The lights never blinked or seem to diminish in any way.  It maintained a slow but direct course and stayed the same distance from the ground the entire time. I have never seen a falling star or meteors do anything like that. If they had said it was a low flying blimp. I would have believed this before any of the other explanations, At least, before It had been reported seen in seven different states that night. But after hearing this. I began to wonder if there may have been more than one object roaming the skies that night.",2005-02-08T00:00:00,,

I could see the blinking navigation lights and just hear the engine noise faintly. Just then a golden sphere moved into my field of vision moving west to east, across the normal flight paths and below the altitude of the light plane that was just disappearing. A lot closer in fact. It moved in total silence for a bit, then executed several high speed zig zags across the sky. Hard to tell how far but way beyond the capabilites of any aircraft I know. It then proceeded at the same slow pace as before briefly before accelerating extremely fast up into the sky while dimming to total black. I caught one or two glimpses as it shot up into the sky as it cut off the light of a couple of stars. Then I lost it.

PD)) Four objects with red/orange & green flashing lights sighted near Florence/Killeen area in Texas. My husband observed two sets of red/orange & green lights in the western sky.  He became very curious and watched them very closely, when suddenly they started zig-zagging each other.   He ran into the house and yelled for the rest of us to come out, and by the time we got outside the one object that had been zig-zagging around the object farthest west, had moved due north and was stationary there over the next hour and a half to two hours, while the object in the west stayed there during the same time period.  We live out in the country, and it is very dark.   The sky was very clear, and these objects in no way resembled stars or any other aircraft.   The orange and green lights moved constantly and in varying directions.  At times, it appeared that there were ""bolts of light"" being shot between the orange and green lights.   This was visible to the naked eye, but even more so through binoculars.   This object moved very little, but over the course of the two hours, it eventually became lower in the sky and appeared to be ""landing"" somehwere, for lack of a better word.  We jokingly mused amongst ourselves that they were landing at Fort Hood, which lies in that direction.    About an hour into our observations, our daughter shreiked ""there's another one!""   We turned around and saw an object identical to the others, but this one was in the eastern sky.   At that, my son thought it might be a good idea to check the skies all around, and we heard him shout from the back of the property that he saw another one.   This one was in the southwestern sky, was much closer, and much brighter than the others.  Neither of these objects appeared to be moving at all, but they had the same orange and green lights that appeared to shoot bolts.    We went back to focusing our attention on the first western object because it appeared to be the most ""active"" one.  It was then that we all noticed that it appeared to be ""shooting"" other smaller objects from it, all just appearing to us as bright lights.  These went straight down.

I picked up the binoculars about 5 minutes later in an attempt to relocate it and did indeed find it but the light was not as strong as it had originally been.

The light moved quite rapidly in all directions (would backtrack also) for the duration of the sighting which made it somewhat difficult to track.

Around 12 noon on 6/15/04, I was looking out the side of my parking garage at work (at Thomas Rd & Central Ave, facing North/Northwest in Phoenix) and saw something very strange in the sky. There were about a dozen white/silver small discs flying sporadically in the sky. I tried to count them, but they were constantly in errantic motion & I found it hard. I turned to a girl (who I don't know, but works in my building) who was near me in the parking garage. She was talking on her cellphone & apologized for interrupting her conversation in fear of her thinking I was nuts, but I had to ask if she ""could see what I'm seeing??"" (I was so glad I wasn't the only one out there)She said into the phone, ""Honey, where are you? There are weird things flying around in the sky out here.....yeah, right now!"". We laughed, but didn't take our eyes off of the show. They seemed silverish & turned really bright white (seeming to reflect the sun)  sometimes when they dipped & flew in certain ways. You could definately see that they had a spinning motion also & they were all moving at different speeds, up, down, left, right, looping, diagonally, you name it. They were definately NOT flying in unison, but they were all grouped together, a few were a little North of me, moving behind buildings & back again, but most were NW. An airplane was ascending from Sky Harbor Airport too at that time & flew right past them (plane was flying North/ Northwest). I was wondering if those people were looking out the window & could they see them?? At first I thought maybe they were pieces of paper that got caught in the wind or something, but they were much bigger than that...and SPINNING. They didn't look like balloons, helicopters or planes of any kind as far as I could tell. Neither did they look (or fly) like birds. We stood & watched them for about 10 minutes, when they all started going North at the same time until I couldn't see them anymore. I've never seen anything like it. I am curious to know if anyone else caught the show? Someone here at work suggested I write to the newspaper to see, so I wrote that day, no response (shocker!)

At the first stoplight (the one before the train tracks), I could see a VERY bright light about two miles away, near Reagan National Airport. My first thought was that a plane coming in for landing had turned in a way that created a beam which was brighter than usual. As I drove closer I realized the light was stationary--it was not moving. As I rounded the second entrance to the airport I saw a HUGE silver circle with beams of light directed toward the airport or to Andrews Air Force Base visible just across the Potomac. The ""disc"" was motionless and only about 100 feet off the ground. It was at a slight tilt and the lights were only coming out of the half closest to the ground. I slowed down to a crawl, watching the ""ship"" and all of a sudden it moved to above the 14th Street Bridge. It did this effortlessly, and I remember thinking that I had not really seen it move--it re-appeared above the 14th Street Bridge, and I got the feeling ""it"" knew I would be taking that exit. As I moved into the middle lane going into DC I could see it in my rear view mirror. There were other cars around me--I think I saw two on the Parkway, and maybe two or three behind me on the bridge. All of them should have seen this. Additionally, the ship was near the Boeing comples across from the airport. Certainly someone had caught this on a security tape or a controller had seen it from the airport.  When I got home I tried to call the airport only to find out that all the flights had been cancelled due to Hurricane ? (insert appropriate alphabetical name here). I have sent this in before,the night of the sighting, but I am submitting an electronic rendering that I had made the night of the sighting so I wouldn't forget details. The picture could not show the point that the craft came to--similar to the bottom of a top, but almost flat. There were green blinking lights and the red symbol is not accurate but there were some red symbols in that position. I seriously doubt this was a plane or Boeing experiment, and wish someone could see if there is evidence of it in any number of security cameras that should be in the area.",2005-07-13T00:00:00,38.907575087012276,-77.02499886426087

It was still quite a distance away, but close enough to know that it was blinking and standing still.  I watched it for about five minutes until I went in and brought out the binoculars.  My first thought was lights from a helicopter searching the valley below, but after careful examination of the object I had to rethink this, since there was no searchlight emitting from the object.  Focusing the lenses on the binoculars, I discovered that the blinking lights emitted a read and green hue in color in the center of the object.  The shape of the object appeared to be diamond shape or triangular in dimension; in fact, a faint ray of light came out on three, maybe four areas of the object, which made me think it could be diamond shape.  It was definitely not a plane.  The object made no noise whatsoever.  In fact, a commercial or military passenger jet flew over the house in the same general location as the object, so you could definitely tell the difference in the way the objects moved in the air relative to each other.  Eventually, the object did move very slowly towards the right and up into the night sky.  Sometimes it went back to where it started, but eventually moved away.  Now at the same time this is going on, I saw another non-blinking white light just above the horizon.  It would move upwards and then just as fast as it appeared would disappear.  In addition, there were tiny, faint lights that appeared to be coming from the main object, but would disappear in the night sky.

On June 12th, 2005, at 20:33 hours, while taking an evening stroll with my wife and son, near twilight hours, in the community of Bear Valley Springs, located just outside the city of Tehachapi, CA we the three of us spotted a very unusual aircraft. The evening was dead quite when the craft was spotted. My son was the first to have seen it. Then, my wife and myself. At a first glance it appeared to me as a regular plane in the distance with possibly landing gear down creating twinkling lights that veried from red to white. However, within a split second I realized that it made no noise and it was enormous in size realtive to the mountains that it was slowly moving past. Then, an immense roar seemed to propel it heading East. When it turned it was difficult to conceive the overall size. Also, as it turned it revealed more lights appearing in a cheveron or ""V"" shape. I believe it had to be moving very rapidly, but not as one might perceive when something of normal appearing size moves. I say this because anything of such immense proprtions would have to have a significant speed to propel it out of view in such a short time. We were unable to make out an outline. However, when it turned I ran from the top of the road, down into my house. I grabbed a digital camera and shot some video. I thought the video was worthless. With my naked eye I could faintly see the craft, so I thought the camera was not picking-up anythiong of value. After reviewing the video on my computer, I was embarrassed because I sounded rediculous with excitement. I even phoned the local police that night because I thought for sure we could not have been the only people to have seen it. Recently, after finding this site I saw a picture that had lights that seemed similar. A cheveron or ""V"" type object, so I took another peak at the video. I ran through the video frame by frame. Frames of the craft appear insignificant, bouncy, and have nothing to compare relative size, but two frames one is able to identify a string of lights. What is viewable could be the back of the craft, as it had already turned towards the South/East towards Mojave. I took that picture, using some simple photo tools, I enhanced the brightness of the object to try to see an outline. I will submit the picture to you. I am not a UFO buff, I would say it had to be military. However, due to the immense size of the craft puts a immense question mark inside my brain. Why so damn big! I was USAF for six years. I saw a lot of aircraft. While I was stationed at Edwards AFB it was not uncommon to see the B-2 Bomber flying around as we played golf, but this was no B-2. In size there was no comparison and while the B-2 has deceptive lines in flight it is not silent. I'm still bewildered.",2005-07-13T00:00:00,35.12935471698113,-118.50983018867925

At 11 p.m. on Thursday, June 16, 2005, I was outside looking at the sky in north-east Kentucky (Carter County.) The sky was clear, with stars throughout the sky easily visible.  At approximately the eleven o'clock position in the south, south-east sky, I saw what I thought was a triangle of stars, presumably part of a constellation, when I realized they were moving in unison towards the south, south-east. The three lights were shining steadily and unblinking. Their estimated brightness was between 3rd and 4th magnitude stars(probably closer to 4th magnitude.)  The object or objects made no noise that I could hear.  The lights were rather slow moving as compared to aircraft I have seen in the night sky.  The triangle shape was that of an isosceles triangle. One light in front, the other two at the rear.  I would estimate the distance between the two rear lights as approximately the width of the full moon disc. The distance from the rear lights to the front light was approximately twice the distance as that between the rear lights.  After about 60 to 90 seconds, the lights faded from view(Due to haze in the sky perhaps, as the front light disappeared first; the following two almost immediately thereafter.)

This was just the last time. The area I see them is always by the airport going down the highway.  Now, the first time, I noticed a round bright light in the clear blue sky that would fade out and reappear as I traveled along. It seemed to stay with me.  It didn't move. It seemed to stay fixed in the sky except when it would fade out and reappear almost as if to stay with me.  This lasted about ten minutes and was in September of 2003.  This past year I have noticed it at least two other times.  Except two other times it was not a light but a solid round white object that seemed to hover and then zoom off into the distance.  The last sighting looked like a white rectangle that I was open to the possibility of it being a jet.  So I watched it as it went behind a cloud and never came out.  I watched that cloud for at least ten minutes.  I really felt that it wasn't a plane, but knew for sure when it ""hid"" behind a cloud.  I have had other experiences in my life since I was little, including lights surrounding my bed and not being able to move. My sister was a witness to this and stared in shock.  Also, a couple years ago my son noticed a ""moving star"" when he looked out his window.In that same time period he showed me a rash under his left rib cage that was the shape of a perfect equilateral triangle.  This is just the surface of the things I've seen.  I'm beginning to think that they're following me. By the way, my very first sighting was when I was about nine.

The sky was extremly clear and I could see more stars than usual. As I watched the sky, I noticed what appeared to be a satelite moving North to South. It did not dawn on me at the time that satelites do not normally move North to South. I watched it move across the sky and was following its path. When it reached 12:00, or directly over head, it stopped. I was floored. I have seen many satelites travel across the sky, so I knew this was not normal. It stayed motion less for about 5 seconds, then it move in the same direction quickly in a ""S"" pattern and stopped at approximately 11:00 O clock. Again it stayed motion less for approximately 5 seconds, then streak west to east and out of sight in approximately 1 second.

It was not a weather balloon, laser, plane, cloud, meteor, or satelite. I was awake, not tired, no stress, not intoxicated, or under the influence of any medication. It appeared first like a star, when I realized it was moving I thought it was a satelite. It did not grow in size or get brighter. It stayed constent in appearance and brightness. It defied all logic and Physics.

I stepped outside and noticed aircraft traveling in the sky. From the angle I was sitting it seemed to be quite a few travelling.  My first assumption was that it was a military convoy since there are usually groups of 3-4 choppers that will travel through here during the day on occasion.  I noticed they kept coming.  I walked down the street about 50 yards to get a better angle and noticed that 4 of the aircraft were circling the sky.  They were triangler in shape with flashing lights.  These were probably planes since they had red and blue flashing lights and they seemed to be moving in a standard pattern.  Another one or two were definately choppers because I could hear them as they flew closer and farther away.  One of the objects, however appeared to be brighter than the others.  It also did not follow the same patterns as the other aircrafts in the sky.  It seemed to glow bright white without flashing lights.  It moved awkwardly and faster than the others but interacting with the planes.  It was more sphere like and there were no real flashing lights.  My first thoughts is this is a military training drill or it is an air search since there is an airport a few miles away but I have never seen this amount of aircraft circling the sky repeatedly for this long.  It's been almost an hour and they are still outside.  I've tried to take pictures and digital film but my night-shot mode is poor and the digital film just won't pick up the objects.

On Thursday, June 23rd 2005 at approximately 6:45 pm I noticed a very bright object in the southern sky traveling north to northwest at a very high rate of speed. I normally do not look up at the sky, but a pretty red cardinal caught my attention as it perched on a telephone wire in my backyard. I was wading in the swimming pool at the time and as I watched this bird I noticed a very tiny round or ball shaped object that looked like a typical star in illumination, but not as distinct because it was still daylight. The object was very tiny to the naked eye—no larger than the head of a shirt pin. Owing to its size, I presumed the object to be flying at a very high altitude—much higher than typical passenger jets that fly at 35,000 feet. The speed of the object I judged to be three to four times faster than passenger jets flying at this altitude. Usually when a passenger jet flies overhead at 35,000 feet or more you can watch them for a couple of minutes before they move out of your visual range. In the first twenty seconds I watched this object I believed it would move out of my visual range in less than one minute. At thirty seconds it changed to a westerly still maintaining its velocity and illumination which did not change. I lost sight of the object after 50 seconds as it faded into the brightness of the sun in the western sky.  I experience a similar even in 1965 when I saw a similar object while living in the City of Orange near Santa Ana in southern California. This event was reported in The Register newspaper. At the time my father, a West Point graduate, was a lead aerospace engineer at North American working on Gemini space vehicle projects for NASA.  I cannot say for certain what I saw over Houston, but as an ex military man I trust my instincts and whatever this objects was—it flew at a speed in excess on MACH I perhaps even MACH II.",2005-07-05T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

The sky was mostly clear but the wind was approximately 15MPH.  At exactly 8:00PM (according to the time on the pictures I took) I heard what sounded like a jet, and I looked for a few seconds for it (direction of sound was somewhat difficult to ascertain due to the wind and the waves by the lake shore) before I spotted what I assume was the source of the sound.  The object appeared to my naked eye to be white and cylindrical without wings and flew from south-southeast to north-northwest in a straight line at a speed that didn't seem unusually fast or slow for a jet, and I believe it was lower than most of the jets I see in the area because I could see it fairly well with my eyes and it was clearly visible.  Barksdale AFB and the Shreveport Regional airport are east of my location approximately 60 miles and most jets I see travel from west to east or east to west in this area and I've taken a number of pictures of them as well.  The object did not produce a contrail nor exhibit any unusual behavior other than appearing to fly without wings.  I attempted to take three pictures of the object (zoomed at 6X at 2 megapixels), the first of which turned out very good and clear and verified that no wings were visible.  The second picture was focused on the tree tops and the object was blurry and washed out, and by the time I took the third picture I believe the object had disappeared behind the trees.  From the time I first spotted the object to the time it disappeared was approximately fifteen seconds.

I will state my background first-  I am a computer programmer with a relatively high IQ.  I am an active Private Pilot.  I live almost directly under the Madison, CT VOR navigation station.  Nightly, I watch helicopters, small planes, and airliners fly above my house.  All aircraft are required to have operating navigation lights, and anti-collision lights.  I can generally classify aircraft based on relative velocity, and the type of engine.  In the 40 degree weather we are having, even turbofan engines at 35,000 are clearly audible. The navigation lights are always visible, and at most angles, the anti-collison ""strobe"" can be seen.  There is no weather currently, and all stars and planets are extremely clear.  Tonight, as I stood on my deck, I witnessed an ""aircraft"" with only 1 VERY bright light that was moving quickly enough that the alitude would have to have been VERY low, or the velocity was extremely high.  This caught my attention.  It traced a path above my house in only a few seconds, when an airliner can take a minute.   The light distinguished ((sic--extinguished??)), and I waited for the engine noise, only none came- just total silence.   I could not see the shape, only a bright light.  There was no further sign of it.  It was visible for a few seconds as it appeared to come from over the horizon to about 70 degrees vertical above my house.  I was facing easterly, so the path was roughly south to north.  The light was far, far brighter than the landing lights, anti-collision lights, or navigation lights on any aircraft I have ever seen.  I have witnessed dozens of ""shooting stars"" over my house as recently as the shower this summer, and it did not, in any way resemble the intensity, path, or time that a meteor has.   The light extinguished instantly as if it was turned off, and did not appear to burn out as a meteor does. I don't know what else to say-   I am baffled enough to write this.

I was approximately 10 feet away from the house facing North towards Oklahoma City. The wind was blowing from the West approx. 10-15mph. The weather was nice with clear skies with a temperature of about 75 degrees F. The humidity was around 50%. There was no moon visible. There was a meteor shower later that night. I was sitting in a lawncahir in my backyard enjoying the evening, listening to the wind blow and gazing up at the stars.  So I was listening to the wind and looking at the stars I noticed what sounded like a flag whipping in the wind directly above my head.  I looked up and immediately saw a very large delta or wedge shaped object flying over the house at a high rate of speed. The object was larger than my house (2200 sq. ft. 3 bedroom single floor brick home with an attached 3 bay garage).  The object appeared to be no more than 150 - 200 feet above the ground.  It was travelling North to South at what appeared to be around 200 - 250 mph.   As it passed directly overhead it made no discernable noise except for the sound of ""wind"" rustling by.   It emitted no light and has no distinguishing features on it other than what appeared to be two corrugations in the skin from the front to the rear of each ""wing"" (two on each wing).   The color of the object was difficult to make out, but it appeared to have a grey color to it.  I couldn't make out any sort of ""cockpit"" nor could I see any windows or other points of entry on the object. As the object passed overhead, I exclaimed, ""Holy ((deleted))!"", jumped out of my chair, turned around as it passed over.   I then grabbed a high-intensity flashlight the was hanging around my neck and shined it upon the object.  However, the object cast no reflection, so it was either much higher in altitude than what it appeared or the surface properties of the object were such that it absorbed the light.   As I was shining the light I was running around the corner of the house (West) towards the drive way in order to keep the object in view.  However, by the time I reach the driveway (3 seconds) the object has disappeared from view over the neighbors house and tree line acorss the street to the South. The entire incident lasted no more than 5 - 8 seconds. I rushed in the house to tell the others what I had seen.  I went out to the front lawn (facing South) with my Mother trying to see it the object might come back in view.   As we were looking South I saw a large green meteor shoot dowm at about a 60 degree angle and disappear behind the tree line on the horizon about two miles away.  I don't think this was related to what I had witnessed moments before, as a meteor shower was scheduled for later that night.  I DO however, know that the object that flew over my house was NOT a meteor. As a side note:  There are two large Air Force bases here in Oklahoma.  Tinker AFB is located just Southeast of OKC and is only about 30 minutes from my house.  There is also Altus AFB in Altus, OK, in the Southwest of the state near the Texas border.   I have never witnessed any sort of B2 stealth bomber flying in or out of either these AFB's, especially ones that emitted no sound from the engines.   I an a Navy veteran and my Father is a retired Army Major pilot and we have access to both of these military installations, and have never seen anything like that flying around these installations.",2005-11-08T00:00:00,35.2323,-97.6008

We saw this huge orange light with a tail like a comet coming to hit the earth...then the tail faded away and the orange light grew smaller almost as small as a star in the sky with a even bigger white glow around it.  As this object moves across the sky it all of a sudden divedes into two little star objects. One of the objects continues to move while the other all of a sudden lets of these rings that grow larger around the small object and it seemed as if that object exploded but with no sound. It also seemed like it set of millions of tiny other objects.....or like some type of wave.  we then jump in the car thinking that the world is about to end...this freaked us out..but also excited me...The object that was left then continued to float across the sky....during all this there where several airplains in the sky and I wounder if anyone eles saw this.

WE WERE ABOUT TEN MINUTES DOWN HIGHWAY 375 WHEN MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TOWARD MY PASSSENGER SIDE WINDOW BY THE BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT THAT WAS IN THE WEST NOW.  I HAD THE FEELING THAT IT WANTED US TO OBSERVE IT. SO WE STOPPED THE TRUCK AND GOT OUT TO HAVE A LOOK.  AS WE STOOD THERE WATCHING THIS EXTREMELY BRIGHT STATIONARY ORANGE LIGHT IT CHANGED TO YELLOW!

It also couldn't have been a shooting star because it was too low and it didn't fade out at all it just disappeared.  It was in the matter of counting to ten slowly and then it was gone.

This is where the sightings took place, and apparently have been taking place for several weeks now.   While standing on a large hill overlooking a wide open golf course, we witnessed at least 3 at any given time, orange bright lights that almost looked like planets, that twinkled at times and flickered erratically at other times.  The lights would rise up slowly from the horizon, and then the light would go out and be replaced by a fast blinking red and white light.   At first we thought of an airplane, but then when the lights began moving from side to side up and down and in zig zag patterns, we knew that any aircraft in existance could not perform manuevers like we witnessed.  We also witnessed the 3 lights forming triangular patterns (perfect ones i might add) and this triangle moved in unicen and at times seemed to rotate on an axis.   We also saw an unbelievably bright blue streak that almost looked like a commet streaking through the atmosphere but the width of the two ""tales"" was too wide to be a commet.  Between the tales were blue streaks and it moved very quickly over our heads and disappeared without a sound.   We have been coming to this location almost every night and it seems as if the activity continues, but the lights get farther and farther away each time.  When my brother initially spotted these lights they were the size of a silver dollar in the sky, but have since become slightly bigger than a star and orange in color.   The objects can be seen only in a wide open area that is at a high altitude along route 63 in litchfield ct.  Objects seem to rise and fall below horizon line so its important to view the skyline from as high as possible.",2005-11-03T00:00:00,41.7559,-73.2154

On the night of halloween, October 31st at 6:00 to 7:30 PM in Poughkeepsie NY two college students observed several unidentified flying objects, over a course of an hour and a half.  It could have been one object disappearing and then reappearing, or several different ones.  It was a large, bright, orange light the size of a large planet that was moving erratically for continuous periods of time ranging up to 30 minutes.  It was moving, stopping, hovering, then moving, going up and down, side to side, and in curving arcs with akward angles.  It appeared to move fast and with great agility. In addition there was a sharp, crisp, but slow-moving streak of light across the sky as an outlined object descended consistently in a straight line over a large area of the sky and heading directly to the large orange object described above.  This streaking object disappeared right before reaching the actual object.  This orange object eventually disappeared behind the trees.  It was found later at another point in the sky - on the opposite horizon.  This appeared suddenly - in a point in the sky earlier scanned - it had not been seen there moments before.  This one moved erratically for two minutes as before and then suddenly grew in light, color, and size - to an overwhelming and startling appearance - this flash/flare was 2 seconds in length, after which it disappeared entirely.  Finally another bright orange orb appeared, moved consistenly in one direction across a large portion of the sky before akwardly and suddenly reversing direction, angling downwards towards the horizon.  This object then grew in intensity and brightness and size, with sharp and protruding white light, in such a fashion as to create the distinct impression that it was coming closer to the viewers - approaching the point of observation. This action caused fear for the viewers as well as immense apprehension, to the point where one viewer began running away towards the vehicle out of fear and panic.  The object quickly thereafter diminished and turned to another direction. The final phenomenon was a different bright red light above the horizon to the East that both viewers saw clearly at the same moment. It then disappeared from view - vanishing - while in the periphery of both viewer's vision and was afterwards nowhere to be found. This occurred from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm on Monday, October 31st, 2005, over the Vassar College Farm in Poughkeepsie New York.",2005-11-03T00:00:00,41.69275820895522,-73.89410099502489

What I saw is as follows:  There were approximately 9-12 bright green rectangular objects (lights).  When forst observed, they were approximately 175-180' away and approximately 75-100' in the air and descending rapidly in what appeared to be an undulating movement.  While most of them appeared to be about 9-12"" wide and maybe 14-18"" long, there were 3-4 which were larger; possibly 14-18"" wide and maybe 24-36"" in length.  After descending, they appeared to go into/behind a large pine tree.  At that point, we were only able to observe a greenish glow which lasted for approximately 60-70 seconds.   All of a sudden, they began ascending at a high rate of speed (faster than they had descended) and when they reached a height of approximately 200' above the tree (which is about 60-65' high), they suddenly disappeared from view.   While my wife thought she heard a faint ""whooshing"" sound, I didn't.   It is also interesting to note that there's a large Doberman who resides at the residence next door to where the pine tree is.  Although we have both heard this animal barking numerous times, on this night, the barking was totally different in its tonal quality.  Rather than the usual barks of a large animal, at the time this was happening, it issued only 3-4 barks and they sounded fearful...almost as if the animal was shocked.  Although we usually go out for air several times/week at around the same time and have done so for almost 10 months, this was the first time we've ever seen anything. The following evening, we looked all around the neighborhood for anyone who might be displaying green garden lights; however, there were none observed.  We were unable to locate anyone else who may have witnessed this event.  FYI:  I am a former police officer and have been a professional investigator & trained observer for over 25 years.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,38.693050422535215,-121.29238225352114

For the next 15 minutes I observed them, always stationary.  Two were bright spots, and the other two changed shape periodically.  One took the shape of half an elipse...Like a hang glider shape....pure light though.  This part is strange,...when I walked about twenty feet west, to the boardwalk, I could no longer see them.  I thought they were gone, but I saw them again when I walked back.  It seemed the reflection of the evening sun on the horizon and my location on the ground determined visibility.   I informed other people lying on the lawn of my observation.  I took a picture using a 2 megapixel FugiFilm camera.  We couldn't figure it out.  My wife and I left after 20 minutes...they were still there.

I went outside on the patio about ten minutes to one in the morning because it was hot in the house.  The night was clear.  I was facing almost directly west, perhaps a few degrees south also, looking at the stars.  I picked out the Big Dipper, and a very bright star/planet (Jupiter?) south following the arc of the handle at about 45 degrees or a little more up in azimuth.  (There is another group of stars that is like an inverted triangle at a higher azimuth, and Jupiter(?) was straight under the point star of that. I am in the city so only the brightest stars of most constellations are visible.)  As I was wondering if the bright star was a planet or what star, I noticed an odd flash of a light near it.  The object seemed very, very high up in altitude, higher than a plane would normally be, so at first I thought I was seeing a satellite, then two satellites.  The first object I saw did seem to appear at each flash farther to the right (north) to about four fingers' width, but did not continue on beyond that and disappeared at that position. As I watched I noticed that there was another light, and then two more all surrounding Jupiter(?).  Most appeared less than a finger's width from Jupiter(?), but one was out about two fingers' width.  These flashes of light were distinct and quick, not twinkly like stars, and there were no visible clouds.  Either the object I had first seen was moving to all sides of Jupiter(?), or there were several objects, as these flashes would appear at about 11 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 5 o'clock, and 7 o'clock positions around it with no regularity as to which light went on where.  One light seemed to have an interval of about 45 seconds for a few flashes. They did not seem coordinated with each other. The lights were small and contained, not lighting up the sky, just themselves. They were white, and perhaps a little red. They flashed one at a time very quickly on and off again--if I blinked I missed it, which made it hard to pick up a pattern. They stayed off for varying periods.  There was no sound, and no smoke trails. A jet in another part of the sky looked completely different and could be heard as it went on.  The environment was otherwise very quiet except for an occasional car passing on the street in front and a little rustling of leaves in a light breeze. The objects stayed around Jupiter(?) for about an hour or more altogether but seemed harder to see later as Jupiter(?) sank a little to the west.  I could no longer see four.

I observed a brilliant white circular object moving west that was radiating light, not just reflected sunlight off an object. The altitude was difficult to estimate as it was a bright sunny day with high thin cloud cover and no nearby easy to use reference points. however it was much lower than a commercial jet and higher than a helicopter that we see frequently in this area. The apparent diameter of the white light was about the size of a ""penny"" held at arms length, so if it was say 1000 ft up it must have been quite large. It moved in a dead straight line towards the west, no bobing or weaving, giving the impression of powered flight at a few hundred miles per hour. There was no noise or vapor trail etc associated with the object, and I observed it for around 2 minutes before unfortunately going back to check on a few kids in the swimming pool before resuming my observation to find it had vanished. Two other adults with me also saw the same object after I'd  pointed it out to them, but apart from saying ""What the f@#!'s that!"" they didn't seem to be particularly concerned, perhaps the've seen plenty of UFO's before!

It was just over the treeline of the horizon. It looked to be about three miles away. It definitely had glimmering lights that were flashing and the lights color was white. At the beginning of the sighting, it was still light outside and no stars were visible. We determined for certain that it was NOT a satellite, a meteor, a blimp, a comet, etc. Because they move and this object was stationary for about 15 minutes! I thought it may be the star Sirius cause I know a little about astronomy and it is the brightest star in our constellations over Earth. But when we went outside to investigate further, we saw more signs that this was an unexplaniable phenomenon. We had high-quality binochulars, and we both saw in them that the object was silver colored. Then the most amazing thing happened. We both witnesssed the object very quickly move to the southwest and then several seconds later returned exactly to where it was prior. Then a few minutes elapsed and it suddenly moved very quickly further from our view in a backwards motion. It was no longer visible, which means it cannot be a star. We moved back further about twenty-feet and up a slight hill on the side of our property. We could see the object again. My brother and I think that the object was being operated by intelligent forces because of the way it moved so fast and deliberately. After a couple of more minutes the object retreated a distance into the west and we could no longer see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a celestial body.  PD))",2005-06-20T00:00:00,40.9317,-73.1142

I was driving north through Canada to go to Alaska. It was just after sunset and the after glow of the sunset was almost entirely gone. There were some kind of radio towers out in the hills and I was doing a little game with myself trying to spot the radio tower's support wires. It took a little concentration, but I could make them out still against the slight glow of the horizon. I kept moveing from one set of lights to the next to see how far out there I could see. The radio towers had 2 red lights on the tops of them. Off to the right of the radio towers there was another set of red lights, but this set had three lights and another set of lights right next to it that held the same shape, but different colors (One set was red,red,red and the other set was red,white,green). I thought that it was kind of weird and continued my little game on it. I noticed there was no tower under it and no wires. It wasn't close enough to anything to have been supported by something else. As I kept driving I noticed it was near the road and I would be driving near it, so i kept my eyes on it as much as I could. The trees along side of the road were about 50 feet tall and these lights were about that again over them. Once I got almost right under them I pulled over along side of the road and turned my car off. I got out of the car and stood there looking up at them. First thing I noticed was there was no sound of anykind of engine or exhaust. This really had my attention at this point, I knew this was something seriously new to me. The lights didn't give off any real radiance to speak of, more of a dim luminesense. The trees below the lights didn't show and color of the lights. The glow was almost like the glow emitted by the painted Christmas lights, a real subdued glow. The position and shape of the lights were like a wide V shape with the individual lights them selves being the shapes of large ovals or maybe circles looked at from the side. The angle of the V shape was about 30 degrees angle on each side angled up. Kind of like this with the angles being 30 degrees and the lines being ovals \_/ much like lights on the bottom side of a concave object. I tried really hard to get a look at what the lights were attached to, but the lights didn't illuminate the object in any way, which was really weird. I must have been within a 100 yards from these things with them across the two lane highway over the trees on the edge of the highway's cleared area. I heard no noise from the objects, noticed no movement for about 5 minutes.The red,red,red one started moveing away from me at a 45 degree angle to the highway to my left at probably 10-20 miles an hour.The speed was sudden and totally steady. Then once it got almost out of sight over the trees the red,white,green one matched the red one's speed and trajectory perfectly and in the same fasion.

We were inland about two city blocks from the lakefront, and I estimate the object to have been at the lakes edge, or directly above Lakeshore drive. As we pointed towards it, the object slowly moved behind a very small cloud, the only cloud around, and then appeared to go straight up. This was only about a 5 to 10 second viewing, and once it was behind the cloud, it's upward motion which we detected for only a second, yeilded to a complete absense of the object. Nothing speedy about it, it just appeared to briefly go upward behind this very small cloud, and then disappeared.  We were both sober, and both kind of feeling funny about the viewing. We joked that we had better not tell anyone, but of course we did. It was forgotten about over time as it was really not that much of a sighting. Very bland and very brief. I would have never reported it if I hadn't come across the opportunity to do so here.  In summary, we were 500 feet in the air and observed this metallic colored round ball. When we pointed to it and gazed at it, it moved behind a small cloud as if to hide itself from our view. We stayed on the roof another 10 minutes or so and it never re-appeared.

Curious, I kept my eye on it for several moments to watch its slow southern to southwestern progress.  Finally I went out the back door to get a better look.  When I did, the center of the blur grew in intensity, as if it had been a light shining through clouds but the clouds had now broken apart. At this same moment several other points began to glow brightly within the haze.  Immediately these lights and the glow surrounding them took off in the same direction that the object had been slowly drifting.  It did not take off incredibly fast, but its movement was far more rapid than any plane would seem to have from that distance, and its acceleration from the slow drift was instantaneous.  Its movement was also level with the earth the entire time I witnessed it, causing me to beleive it was not a falling celestial body. I have never told anyone except my friends and family, or ever reported this sort of thing. But after doing some research and listening to other witnesses, I thought this encounter definitely merited some attention. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

We were visiting family at my husbands sisters house, then me and him left in my car to go get food for everyone, it was about 8:30 PM.  We were in a pretty suburban area. Houses on blocks, apartments, a YMCA right near by. We were driving along a straight stretch and my husband said ""oh my goodness that plane is gonna crash"". I thought he was joking told him playfully to shut up and then he said ""no seriously."" I looked in my rear view mirror and saw a large black object coming overtop of a hill behind us. It was sort of wobbling side to side like it was about to lose control, and it was dangerously low and close to the power lines, then it seemed to sort of start getting control again. I stopped my car right in the middle of the street, there was no other traffic around. I turned around and started looking out the back window. It was going very slow and then about not even 200 feet behind my car it stopped and started to just hover. I was like a straight up triangular shape looked almost as if you drew a big letter A, standing straight up in the sky. It was black very sleek and on one side it was completely covered with lights, green, red and yellow. They were all blinking and there had to be 200 hundred of them. We just set there in awe. Then all of a sudden it took off. It left so fast you could almost see lines in the air after it (another strange thing I noticed when it took off it made no sound at all, any other aircraft you would have heard take off noise, it just zipped off with nothing). I just went on impulse through my car into drive and tried to follow. I was going about 90 mph trying to follow it. I saw a ramp unto the highway and by the time I got up on the highway we could only barely see the lights of the UFO way off in the distance. When we got back to his sisters house I couldn't help but try to tell them what we had seen. NO one believed us. So, we haven't really talked about it since. Has anyone else seen a UFO like that?

As we drove south on FM779 about half a mile north of our turn off on Rains County Road 2230, we looked off to our left (toward the east) and saw what looked like a cellphone radio tower.  It was lite up on top.   I remarked to my wife that I wasn't aware they were building another tower so close to the one near our home.  She said that it looked like it was lighted different for the one near us.  It looked like the top of the tower had three horizontal rows of white lights on it.  There were two red, flasing lights just below the white lights and a white strobe light above the horizontal rows of white lights.   It appeared to be taller than the tower near us so I remarked that possibly there were different lighting requirements for taller towers.  I again said to her that I wondered why they would build another tower so close to the one near us. We were looking across an open pasture of a dairy farm.  The lights looked to be, maybe, a quarter mile away. It was hard to judge distance because it was very near dark. My estimate of the distance between us and it is based on how large I would expect the platform on a radio tower to appear.  We were not alarmed and thought no more about it until the next day when we drove down the same road and there was no tower there or anything of any height anywhere near that area.  We drive down that road sometimes five times a day.  If there was a tower being erected anywhere around there we would have seen it.   I don't understand why we weren't alarmed, more observant and at least more curious when we saw the lights.  We don't know what we saw, but whatever it was, was certainly there on Friday night, May 13, 2005.

I am processing newly received reports now, and we will have your report posted to our site very soon. Thanks, again, for sharing the information with NUFORC! Regards,  Peter ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Thanks.  Really, I'm rather puzzeled.  It was all so matter-of-fact on the part of me and my wife.  We were not thinking about anything like a UFO and it did not even occur to us to stop or to question what we saw. I'm working on a map of the location where we saw whatever it was.  I also have a picture or two of the open area where we saw it and I'll try to come up with some kind of drawing of what we saw.  I'm not much of a computer artist but I think I can come up with something. ((name deleted)) ((END CORRESPONDENCE #2)) Hi Peter, Attached are some maps of where the sighting took place, a very rought sketch of what the object looked like to us, and a photo made the following day of the area where the sighting took place.  As you can see, there ain't no tower there!! Peter, please feel free to use the attachments as you see fit.  I apologize for the poor quality of the drawing of the object.  I don't have even a little bit of drawing talent. If you would like, you are free to use our names associated with this sighting.  My wife of 43+ years is named ((name deleted)).

When I began telling my friends of my interest in UFOs, friends that I had had for years and years suddenly began telling me about sightings that they had had.  Some of their stories were VERY interesting and unusual.  They had never said anything to anyone before about their sightings.

I was driving home from work at approx. 12:40 am and I saw a huge extremly bright light up in the sky. I of course thought that it was a jet coming in to land at the airport but as I got closer to my house this craft was still pretty much in the same spot. I thought that this waz very weird because it was going so slow I thought that it was going to fall out of the sky.  As I approached my street I could see that the railroad crossing gates were all down and flashing. These are a triple set of tracks and I thought that was odd because usually not all of them go down at the same time. And the gates go down just a few minutes before the actual train goes by and no train came through.  So I pulled into my driveway and this object was directly behind my house but out over the lake. And for about a minute it stood still and then it started moving again. Still at the speed of a snail. I stood on my back deck watching it creep along ever so slowly.......it was actually painful to stand and watch it it was slow.....like watching paint dry.......anyway, I watched it for 20 minutes before it was out of view and then I went in the house.  This craft/object was sort of helicopter shaped. It was fairly low in the sky and it made a sound like a jet only softer more masssive. I appeared to have three very large, (two story size), windows on the front and the light that came from those windows was the brightest I have ever seen in my life. Also it flew with the front down slightly.  I definatly know it was not a jet and it was not a helicopter. I was close enough to see the windows and the shape of this thing. Also there were no other lights lit up on it. No flashing lights and no tail section like a jet or helicopter.  So that is my sighting as I saw it.  This has not been the first encounter I have had with ""others"". I do have other stories that started when I was a child. I believe that soon we will have actual evidence to take care of the naysayers. But until then it will remain a small group of us that know what is out there.

I was dumbstruck as the craft made barely any noise, and seemed to be defying the laws of gravity and aviation as it was banking North east from my with no audible noise. I strained to hear anything and could not, but sensed great power or energy.  I was amazed at the razor sharp edges of the triangle and was struck by the clarity of the salmon colored lights that ran up one side of the triangle leading edge and up the other side but not on the part of the triangle which was on the back. I saw that the craft was leveling off and as soon as it did it completely disappeared.  My feeling was one of amazement, also a very ominous feeling which turned into excitement and fear.

I am just leaving for Oregon, but will contact you when I return on Sunday or Monday.  We will post your report when I return.  Thanks, again, for the information!  Cordially,   Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Hello, I look forward to talking with you tomorrow or Monday.  I have been thinking a lot about the information that I sent and I am starting to think that maybe I should be WAY less specific.  I have thought a lot about this and would like to discuss it with you.  I don't want anybody to be in harms way from this disclosure, the pilots, the people on the ground, or myself. So for now, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE hold off on putting anything on your  website until we meet or talk. Thank you, ((name deleted)) in Kirkland ((RESPONSE)) Dear Peter, I have had some time to fine tune my initial web submission.  I noticed too many spelling errors, and overall I can say I was pretty excited as I was typing.  So I made corrections and inserted details that I left out and have included them. I also included my impressions. I also did a better photoshop picture of the craft and the location.  The picture I am sending was taken in the predawn so the viewers could see the craft like I did. Please let me know if this is ok! Regards,  ((name deleted)) ((END CORRESPONDENCE))",2005-05-24T00:00:00,47.69328259259259,-122.19664407407407

(Shadowridge) My roommate and I left our apartment and went out to our car when I noticed movement in the sky almost directly above and in front of us as we walked East through the parking lot.  When I looked up, I expected to see the lights of a plane coming in to land at Palomar airport, turning on it's landing lights and making it's banked turn West.  Instead, I spotted a very bright red/gold light with a long streaking tail. The second I saw that, I reacted by jabbing my friend's shoulder to get his attention. I pointed up to it. It reached directly overhead when he spotted it.  It continued streaking across the sky, running North to South, and the tail even started to spark. Then it faded and went out of sight to the South. We both believe that this was a meteorite or a piece of space debris falling back to Earth. It appeared very low, lasted much longer than I've ever seen, and was really bright. If it was just a meteorite, it was a fairly bright one and still a spectacular sight for anyone who may have caught this one.

We live in the flight path of the Airport so I've grown accustome to the sounds and shapes of planes. The object had no sound like the planes that pass over our house with running lights on and landing gear down.  About 45 minutes to an hour after the event a plane did fly over our house and I remarked how we heard it and could distinctly see the red and white blinking plane lights. During our encounter of this odd orange blob, I sent my husband running for our camera. I got one capture that when blown up looked like two curved smiles. The whole event lasted about 10 minutes and then within 1/2 hour we heard this odd tone that neither of us could place.  My husband, is usualy the logical skeptic, said there is no way it was a flare nor weather balloon because it remained in the same position and the way it dimmed and came back so bright was not typical of either.

Two of my brothers and myself were sitting on a ""jetty"" about 50 feet into the water of the lake (Clear Lake) in a rural setting in Beaver county (the third county East of the shared border with New Mexico). The lake is off the paved roads, rather rural, no electricity or water or sanitary facilities. It sets in a depression surrounded by low rolling hills.  We were all fishing, facing three different directions. Suddenly we heard a sound of something traveling at a high rate of speed from the (approximate)ESE. We all looked up when it was at its loudest, apparently directly overhead, and tried to follow the sound as it disappeared in the (approximate) WNW. The entire incident was only about 30-40 seconds.  The sound got louder and higher in pitch as it approached us, being loudest and the highest pitch when seemingly overhead, and then got softer and lower in pitch as it disappeared. There was NO odor, color, turbulance (that we could tell), exhaust trail, engine flame, lights, reflection of sunlight... absolutely NOTHING except the sound... a ""whooshing"" sound of something apparently not extremely large, but moving very rapidly.  The few birds there were did not exhibit any unusual behavior, and as nearly as we could tell we were ""alone"" at the lake.  None of us had any idea as to what caused the sound, or the significance of it, or anything about it, except for agreeing to what is reported above.  I am a retired school teacher/librarian, age 64, my oldest brother is 69 and a semi-retired printer, my younger brother works for a petroleum company and is 59. We come from different locations... two from seperate locations in the Texas panhandle, one from a small town in the Oklahoma panhandle (different county, however).  The weather was fairly calm, sunny to partly cloudy, and warm.  The nearest air bases, to my knowledge, are at Clovis, NM, OKC, Altus, OK -- all at some distance from the incident.  Educationally, I have two batchelor degrees and a masters; my older brother has a bachelors degree; my younger brother a GED and all of us considerable education from ""hard knocks!""

I am going to remain anonymous.  I am currently a U.S. civilian mechanic hired to do work on military craft in Texas. I will not go into any other details right now, but I have very interesting news for all of you.  The sightings of triangular vehicles flying silently and slowly are real. They are not of alien origin, but rather U.S.A. made craft that must have some form of alien technology. These ""planes"" are truely remarkable, and they will be known publicly very soon.  I had to sign a document (non-disclosure agreement) and can be terminated (and in the words of the agreement, ""removed"")  I was shown 7 of the 16 currently in Texas, and was told there were MANY more, some in Northern California, Nevada and some in New Mexico. I witnessed them in flight, and was taught how to remove and replace a part that I had never seen before. I have been working on aircraft since I was 16, (roughly 30 years ago) and know many of the components used in most modern aircraft. This was NOT normal. It contained a blue fluid and must have weighed 600 lbs, yet was only 3 feet X 4 feet and about 16 to 18"" deep. It had a clear window about an inch sqare that you could see blue fluid inside of it, and the part had three progs on both ends. This part went into what was described as the Stellar Ignition Feed, and they called the part a Fuel Rod.  The crafts themselves are BLACK. Not just black, but blacker than black. It's wierd I know, but you have never seen any black like this. Not only were there visible tiling around the craft, much like the space shuttle, but these were not tiles. It appeared to have a SKIN. A lifelike skin.  I know this all sounds crazy, trust me I thought I was going crazy when I witnessed what these aircraft can do, but I will provide more detailed information later. I am currently off dute for three days, and need to contact some friends about this.  I'll be back.  PS: I am so glad I found your site. I searched all over the internet today for a place to report this, and was relieved to find your site. Thank you! More to come.

It began shortly after midnight, we were laying out in the front yard and saw a black, silent aircraft pass over very low.  We thought we saw a Stealth bomber and began trying to see where it went.   We saw another, and after a while we saw several.  I went inside so my son could wake up and see them.  The three of us layed outside watching for over 4 hours.  During this time other types of aircraft appeared, several larger triangular looking aircraft were seen, as well as massive crafts consisting of several smaller crafts joined together.  We watched as they seemed to be moving from one large craft to another.   It seemed as though the smaller ones were launching from the larger ones.  Straight lines of what looked like stars (but were'nt) were appearing, at one point there were at least five consisting of 8 or more moving lights.  During most of the activity in the sky we heard our dogs barking at nothing, cat (not ours) howling, and wild burros schreeching nearby.   Shortly before daylight it appeared as though they began to prepare to depart.  At times it seemed as though they were engaged in combat with each other.  Many falling star type beams observed, they were red and gold in color.  Larger crafts appeared to break down into several smaller ones and depart.  Some of the larger crafts had a blue craft that seemed to be guiding them away.  One large craft in particular split into two separate pieces one of which departed upward and the other downward in the distance.  The one that appeared to land here looked as though it turned over, changing its position as it was descending, towards 29 Palms.  During the entire event, they made no noise. After most of the crafts had departed 4 gold colored, square objects began to ascend after them, they seemed to have been some kind of guide.  It was at this point that my husband called the 29 Palms Marine Corps base.  He was transferred to the correct person who basically told him ""he hadn't seen anything.""  This statement was made after he was asked who he was, where he was, what was seen and how many others had seen it. Then, my husband placed another call to the local Sheriff's Department and was told an Officer would be sent down.  As he walked outside after this call, he proceeded to call his father and noticed that the 4 gold square objects were landing in a square formation around our house.  At this point we ran into our home and locked the doors and turned off the lights.  It appeared that some sort of door or hatch opened and a male human figure get out and began walking toward our home.   We called the Sheriff's department back to see what was taking so long and were told the deputy would not be responding.  Husband went back outside and noticed one of the four objects was rising up from the ground again, it hovered at approximately 40-50 feet.  He quickly came back inside.  This was approximately 20 minutes before daylight.   At daylight he went outside and observed them all departing, he called us out so we could see it too.  They were already several hundred feet off the ground.  A little later  we drove down to where they had landed and saw circular imprints in the soil as well as laid over weeds.

But it didn't conform to anything I could recognize. It had no windows, stripes or any features on the body except for the shadow shape. I realized it didn't taper at the tail as jetliners do. The long shape was perfectly even, and it seemed to be stationary in the sky. A few buildings blocked my view for a moment, and when I looked for it again it was gone. I looked very carefully but it just wasn't there. It was too high to have gone behind anything on the horizon. A mile or two later, still traveling east I saw it again, at the same altitude but a half mile or so south. It appeared to be stationary , as before. I see blimps flying around here and this was definitely not a blimp. Again my view was blocked by some trees and buildings, and a moment later when I got a clear view of the sky it was gone. I parked by Lake Union, with a wide open view of the sky, and tried to see it, but it was just gone. I did see a smaller plane in the distance flying from north to south, and it was easy to see it moving, compared to what I had just observed.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

I saw an object in the sky.  It looked like a circle of green light.  Much like a star would but with a more green hue.  It was much much larger then a star, and apeared to be an extremely high altitude plane height or higher (I would say on the higher side).  I saw it, and I had a split second to notice that it was weird, then it shot off.  It went from left to right.  I only had a split second to see it before it flew off.  It covered 25-35 degrees it about 3/4 to 1/2 a second.  For comparision, it would take a plane about minute or more to just get to where I lost sight of it.  There may have been a small redish orangish center to the light, but I saw it only briefly, and the green stood out far more.  I flew off not as fast as a meteor or comet, but so much faster then any plane I have ever seen.  It flew behind a tree.  I had been walking my dog, right outside my large apartment complex, so it took me a second to think, then I knew that was pretty weird, so I went to see, around the tree that it had shot around (the tree blocked my vision as to where it went, but this object was very high, not near the tree at all, we are talking plane height or far above.)  And it was gone.  This was in nearly due west.  Past a freeway in california called 280.  The SF airport is due east.  But this was miles away from that.  I saw it at 10:38 (I check the time) give or take a minute, or less.  I have never seen anything like it.  I grew up in the country, in a spot off the coast of california where planes fly all the time.  So I have seen allot of planes night and day.  I now live near the SF airport, so I know of course what flying planes look like.  This was nothing a plane could have done.  It could have been a meteor or something like that.  Or a space shuttle.  But that would not explain why it moved so fast.  It is a UFO to me, but there deffinately could be a logical explination (that is really what I am looking for)  I have never seen anything I would call a UFO before.  I am pretty skeptical about anything like this.  I really just want to know what it was, or if someone else saw it (the bay area has allot of people, and anyone looking into the western sky would have seen this.)

Just last nite coming back from the airport (driving north on I 280 approaching SF ) my friend and I witnessed a possible  meteor spectacle.    I say 'apparent' because it wasn't anything to compare with a normal shooting star.    It was about 30 to 40 times as large and bright as a typical shooting star. I'd estimate it would have been the size of a dime at arms length approximately.   Put another way, appx. 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a full moon.  Appx. teardrop shaped.  It was glowing/burning extremely bright white similar to a shooting star but didn't seem to flash out, but more specifically kept going and going until it went out of view below the horizon. But it appeared as if it was a near object.     So, if it was at the upper area of the atmosphere, stratosphere, or whatever, it might have been a rather huge object.   It was not however, bright enough to have brightened the nite sky as lightning would have for instance, but unlike a normal shooting star it would have gotten anyone's attention who was even generally looking in that direction at that time.  (10:28 PM wednesday nite)  There was no fracturing or breaking apart of the object.   It appeared to maintian its approximate shape for the 4 seconds or so duration of its visibility.   It did however, seem to have the characteristic incendiary burning brightness similar to a meteor's in that the intensity of its brightness did tend to be focused in its center and emanating outwardly towards its edges.   No smoke trail or smear effect tail was noticed.  My friend, who had never seen anything this profound was quite amazed by its size and brightness as was I as well.   I called it in to the local news radio station and 3 TV stations, none of them suggesting they'd heard any similar reports at the time.    These calls that I made to the media were appx. a half hour after having witnessed the sighting.",2005-04-16T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

There was a big white constant light at each bottom corner of the forward leading edge and one constant white light located on the lower center trailing edge.

I'm an American living in Brazil with my girlfriend of 5 years. About three months ago I was driving back with her from the town where she grew up in Brazil. We were conversing, passing time, and she happened to tell me this story about how she and her sister used to expell metal pieces out of their mouths when they were kids. I was nodding my head and acknowledging her, but inside my head my thoughts could frankly be described as, 'mmhmm, oky doky', like 'yeah, sure, I'll just forget my girlfriend ever mentioned this crazy story'. She continued to say that her mother had the last piece extracted analyzed in a lab and the results were that the object was not ""from this world"". I naturally probed with a few questions, but I wasn't convinced so I honestly let the story in one ear and out the other because the mother or sister wasn't there to back the story and I need proof to believe something like this.  Friday August 4th, 2005 - The Proof  My girlfriend decides to come home for lunch, a rare occasion. I made her a sandwhich, she ate, then had to rush back to the hospital (she's a doctor). She went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and I remained on the couch with our dog. All of the sudden she came out holding her finger out at me with a gold piece on it and said, ""Remember when I told you me and my sister were getting these metal pieces out of our mouths? Well, here's one"" (very calmly and confidently). She came out and showed me this thing like this wasn't the first time she's shown someone else these objects and she handed it to me and told me to keep it. She also had this air about her like, ""You believe me now?"".  So I inspected it. I was really curious. I asked her if it had come off her necklace and she said, ""C'mon (my name), no"". Then I made her swear on my grandmother's soul that she wasn't lying and she did. My grandparents who are diseased mean the world to me and she knows it. Then I started thinking, was it in the bread, egg, salt, onion, tomato, cheese, ketchup, or lettuce that I made her? Was it in the grape juice she drank? How about the toothpaste? So I went into the bathroom and pointed out the toothpaste tube we'd been using and asked her if this was the toothpaste she'd used and she confirmed it was the one. So I squeazed the remains out on the bathroom counter and mushed it around with my finger to see if there were any more chips, no chips.  Then she left, she had to get back. I got curious having this thing in my possession and wanted to check online to see if anyone else has had this same strange phenomenon happening to them. I wasn't having any luck. I started putting in on Yahoo, ""coughing up metal"", etc. I was clicking around with no luck until I happened upon this website, reading this story.  http://www.ufoinfo.com/filer/2000/ff_0003.shtml  ""STRANGE GOLD IMPLANT FOUND Bill Bean writes that, ""In July of 1997, I became mysteriously ill and couldn't swallow, because there was a pressure on my throat."" I felt I was choking, just drinking water. It was the most horrible experience of my life, and I wish it on no one. I saw eight different doctors and many tests were done and nobody gave me an answers. I was rushed by ambulance to the hospital, three times in three weeks. I truly thought I was dying. I noticed a pattern of red circular marks on my back that I felt was a reaction to the medication. My wife photographed them. I could not eat and my weight went from a muscular 240 lbs. to 198 lbs. On December 16, 1997, I was in the bathroom with my wife, brushing my teeth when felt a bristle came off my toothbrush causing me to cough. I reached in my mouth to get the object with my right index finger and found a gold - square - flat - chip. Our first thoughts were that it had to come out of the toothbrush. Something told me to save it and I did. The next night, while brushing my teeth, I started coughing again and expelled two more of these things in the sink. After expelling the first piece, I felt like some pressure had come off of my throat and the next night a lot of pressure had come off. I began eating normally and felt much better. Last year, I sent one piece to Derrel Sims who had the object analyzed. Bill says, ""My piece matches a piece that was surgically removed from a person four years ago in Brazil. An isotopic test to determine if the piece is alien is being accomplished."" Thanks to Bill Bean bllin@erols.com. Editors Note: Derrel Sims and I feel this may be the most significant implant case thus far. derrel@holman.net""   When I read that line, ""On December 16, 1997, I was in the bathroom with my wife, brushing my teeth when felt a bristle came off my toothbrush causing me to cough. I reached in my mouth to get the object with my right index finger and found a gold - square - flat - chip."", a surge of fear shot right through me. I felt like I was in a movie suddenly or a bad dream. How could this all be some weird coincidence? It's possible sure, but I have a hard time formulating a hypothesis. Is some company having a food processing flaw allowing 20 some odd chips to fall into vats over the years and these three people in different countries happen to consume?   There are so many possibilities! Could it be the government somehow tracking people? Why the two sisters? Why the man, if he's telling the truth? Could extraterrestrials be abducting and experimenting on us? My girlfriend, seems to think they are coming from her nasal passage, not travelling up her esophagous and surfacing in the throat. Or perhaps if it is a food consumption flaw perhaps it's getting caught in the back of the throat in the tonsuls or skin. In 2002 after she extracted a chip, she moved with me shortly after to the US in 2003. Coincidently, she had a bad nasal infection and smell emminating from her nose.   Another oddity related to this: both sisters have a benign cyst in the same location in the cerebellum in their brains. My girlfriend two months ago was feeling immense migraines and motor skill loss, so we went a diagnostics center here in Brazil to have an MRI done. I saw her holding up the large X-Ray looking sheets into the light and she said, ""Weird, I have the same cyst as my sister and in the same spot"".   Immediately after I read that similar story online, what did I rashly do in a panic? I called SETI. I got their secretary in California and she couldn't help me, all she said was that she was sorry, but she didn't know where to guide me in this appologetic voice. Then she advised me that my girlfriend should see a doctor. I told her, ""the person who is expelling these is a doctor"". And she didn't have anything to say, but that she didn't know how to help me.   That's when I started emailing as many UFO researchers as I could. Everyone seemed to refer me to A.J. Gaevard here in Brazil. So I contacted Mr. Gaevard and he was very nice and helpful and directed me to someone here close to home.  What I do know is that when the mother of the two sisters had the piece in 2002 analyzed, from what I gather, they basically took it, said it was not from this planet, and didn't give it back and the family didn't hear anything back. So the girls weren't extracting anymore chips and the issue subsided and nobody talked about it, until now. I had my girlfriend call her mother in front of me and ask what happened exactly to the last chip. So her mother called her contact and this is what her mother explained to my girlfriend, who explained to me: The first lab didn't know what it was or what it was made of, so they sent it to another lab where they said it was somehow composed of quartz. That's it. And it took three years later for the mother to find this out in 2005.  Update: We have since remained in contact with A.J. Gevaerd and his close friend and colleague who is an esteemed doctor and publisher, which we met in person last Monday (8/29/05) to drop the chip off for analysis. They are conducting research on the piece now. Results will be posted in Gevaerd's magazine sometime in the near future. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness, and have seen photos of the tiny, gold-colored object.  At this time, we have no specific reason to suspect that the object may be of extra-terrestrial origin.  It is being analyzed, under the direction of Mr. A. J.

For the past week, the weather has been sunny with big white pre-storm clouds, up until around 2 or 3pm, then the monsoon (storm) clouds roll in.  We were floating on our backs in the pool, my husband had on his sunglasses and he said, ""What's that shiny spot?"".   I looked up and to the south and saw, in the blue sky, between the clouds, a shiny object, not moving, and if you closed one eye, it was about the size of the head of a pin.  Right then, a jet airliner flew out at an upper left angle, from behind the cloud, which was below the object.  The jet had contrails and at this point there was no doubt about it, that the object was stationary.   Before, my husband first saw the object, he commented on the beautiful cloud formations around the sun and that I should go get my camera.  I said, nah, I already have similar pictures.  Then right after he said that, is when he and I noticed the object. I jumped out of the pool to get my camera and right as I got into the house, he said the object started moving to the right (west), still viewable against the blue sky but at times crossing in front of the clouds.  When it was stationary, it was almost like a ""little sun"", I'm sure the sun was reflecting off of it, but once it started to move it was white, then when it was in front of the clouds it was dark or gray.  It was almost like we were being watched and once it knew we were aware of it's presence, and that I was going for my camera, it took off.   I have a Sony DSC-W7 7.2 pixel camera, I zoomed in and was able to get 5 shots. (Too bad I haven't figured out how to work the video feature yet!) I was disappointed that I didn't listen to my husband and get my camera sooner; as I would have gotten quite a crisp shot of the object while it wasn't moving.  I uploaded the pictures on my computer and zoomed in, the shape then appeared horizontal/rectangular/cylindrical and considering enlarged pixels, each time I zoomed in, it also may have been saucer shaped.   Observing the object crossing the sky, I actually got a ""feeling"" that this was definitely not a aircraft.  To me, the best way I can describe it, is the feeling you get when you see a helium filled latex balloon released and then caught in an air current.  Which you are only able to view from the ground for about 1000 feet, then it gets to tiny to see.   I have to say, this object was no balloon, it was higher in the sky than the jet aircraft that crossed the sky below it and we watched it cross the sky in a westerly direction for a good 30 seconds before it went behind a cloud and out of our line of vision.   The jet aircraft was not coming in for a landing at McCarran Airport, it was enroute elsewhere.  So if the jet was at cruising altitude, this object had to be at least twice as high in the sky.  Maybe I should listen to my husband more often!",2005-09-15T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

At about 9:00 PM Central Time on the night of 8/14/2004, I was at a concert with my wife and some friends. (Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, IL.)  As I was looking up at the stars, I saw a red hazy sphere of light travel across the sky, from the NE to the SW.  This object travelled at a speed approximately twice that of an airplane, but about half the speed of a satellite.  I use these two as a judge, because I had also observed a passenger jet fly over (the place was on a flight plan for O'Hare airport) and a satellite pass over (polar orbit) earlier that evening.  I was watching objects across the sky, such as balloons, planes, and satellites, and it matched none of these objects, because a balloon travelled much much slower, a plane had flashing lights in addition to the red and green wing lights, and a satellite would appear as a point of light travelling faster than this object across the night sky.  In addition, this object was clearly not an asteroid, as an asteroid would appear as a bright green flash.  I watched this object cross the sky - when it had gone behind trees, I checked my watch and it read as a minute or two before 9:00 PM. The object travelled across my field of view (about 140 degrees, I was laying flat on the ground, with my head looking straight up) in about 5 minutes.  Again, the object in my estimation went twice as fast as a passenger jet at cruising altitude, and about half as fast as a satellite.

To the naked eye the effect was as good as a cloud blocking a star but somewhat more pronounced - the light scattering was more. It was like the moon was blocked by clouds. Through the telescope however we saw asymmetrical gradation of white light. At this point we were sure that it was a cloud so we stopped following it. After sometime this so called cloud disappeared.  03:35 am The cloud became visible again and this time was more bright. At this point it was about 20° - 25° above the southern horizon. We got curious. One of our members pointed the telescope at it and was surprised to see a fast rotating spiral. At 50X magnification in a 25mm plossl, the spiral structured covered about 3/4 the field and showed about 5 loops. Check out image 1. We calculated the velocity - drift of the object using the eyepiece field & found it to be 0.64°/min. It was very fast. The rotation period of the loop was about 13 seconds. We boosted the magnification to 125X. The object showed another small bright point light source to the top right of its centre.  04:05 am The object was appearing to slow down. The loops had increased to 9. We again calculated the drift speed & found it to be 0.2°/min. The secondary small source of light had gradually increased in size and separation w.r.t. the spiral center, now it was very bright & easily visible at 50X than it was visible half hour back at 125X.  04:10 am We pointed out our SLR cameras in the direction of the object which was now faint, hoping we would at-least record the trail.  04:15 am The object was loosing naked eye visibility. It was now difficult to the naked eye. However we were tracking it in the telescope.  04:35 am We just took off the telescope to continue our hunt for the remaining galaxies in Virgo (we had seen 23 galaxies already that day) After sometime when we tried to spot the object again, we never found it.

Have you determined what the object was that you observed that night??  We share your suspicion that the object was a most peculiar phenomenon.  We rarely leave URL's in reports submitted to our Center, but we are going to make an exception in this case, given the apparent high quality of your photos, and of your erudite comments about the event.  If you have any further comments about the object, please feel free to submit them to our Center.  We will include them with your original report.

I was playing a gig at the Rockpile in Saugus, Mass... I had alerady loaded my equipment in, and I was outside by the entrance smoking a cigarette. It was overcast, but still daylight out. I looked up and out of the clouds, coming directly towards me was a small, round disc. No lights. It appeared to be black, or at least very dark. It descended out of the clouds, and couldn;t have been very high, as it was underneath the clouds and in plain sight. I was struck by how straight it was traveling. It made no sound, and it went DIRECTLY over my head, and continued on a straight path, and as it flew away, it ascended very slightly, until it was back in the clouds and that was it. It was small. It couldn't have been any bigger than a Yugo. That was one of the weird things about it... it was very small, but it moved on an obviously deliberate path. I could almost feel a vibration, but there was no sound. That's the best way that I can explain it. I felt it, but couldn't hear it. There were at least 7 other people outside at the time, and not one other person looked up or said anything. I didn't dare say anthing... not sure that i could've even if I'd wanted to. But let me repeat this. It was very very clear. I saw it with absolutely NO obstructions to my view... none. No lights on it. Black or very very dark. Round. Small. I kept thinking that it was like some sort of probe that you would see in the movies. I actually thought that as I was seeing it. I reported this to MUFON, and heard nothing from them. Very disappointing, because I saw it so very clearly.  But anyway, that's it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Please let us know, if you would, and we will enter that data with your original report.  Thanks, again, for sharing the information with our Center!  Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((END)) ((RESPONSE)) Peter, I've talked to the other guys from ((name deleted)) (the band I was in at the time of the incident) and no one can remember the exact date of that show. We'd played the Rockpile numerous times for WAAF, and there were never any fliers for the show. I even tried searching through WAAF's website but came up empty. It was definitely sometime in Sept. of 2003.    As crazy as it sounds, I've seen far more than my share of UFO's in my lifetime... several were in broad daylight, all of them different, and totally inexplicable, including one that was followed by - I kid you not - a black helicopter sighting in broad daylight about 3 years ago in New Haven Connecticut.  My ex-wife was with me for both the UFO sighting and the subsequent black helicopter incident... very strange, to say the least. I'm no nut job, and although I am extremely interested in the subject, I am plenty skeptical,and even assess my own experiences with a touch of cynicism. Thanks for the acknowledgement, and I'd be happy to furnish you with any other reports, past or future…  It would be great if someone would just admit that someone is here. IN my own experience alone, there is far too much evidence to substantiate that assertion. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END RESPONSE))",2005-02-22T00:00:00,42.4675,-71.0131

I then began to look at he clouds above as there were not many that day as i remember so my eyes began to wander from cloud to cloud until i thought that i had seen some object darting around a one of the smaller clouds. I had to re-focus and take another look to register what i was seeing. The UFO was definitely a sphere and as to my best guess it would seem to be at an altitude that commuter jet aircraft would fly. All I really remember is that the sphere was dancing around this cloud and making incredible turns as if playing around it. I watched in amazement as it would appear in front of the cloud and travel the lenth of what i can compare to three or four football lengths then stop and make almost a 90 turn then go around the back until i would see it appear in front of the cloud again. The color was a silver or gray in nature. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)),2005-02-22T00:00:00,35.36705779816514,-77.96448532110091

My coworker and I went out in front of our county office for a cigarette and when we were about to go back in something caught my eye.  There was a black object above the residential area across the parking lot and across the street.  It was very large, it seemed as big as a house.  ""What is that?"" I said.  ((name deleted)) looked, but couldn't identify it either.  It made no sound, had no lights, and was turning in it's orientation very slowly and changing shape as it hovered about 500 feet above the residential area at a distance of about a half a mile.  It was impossible to make out any features, it just looked like a black lump with a flat underside.  Sacramento is littered with aircraft and I've flown myself.  There were no lift planes, no engines, nothing that could be identified with any type of aircraft, and it was completely silent.  I told ((name deleted)) to go inside and get the sheriff, but he had already left and another coworker came out to see what she was talking about.  Two men who had also been watching the object from our parking lot came drove up to us adsking, ""what is that thing?""  At the same time on of our clients and her children came out and saw us looking up and also saw it.  It seemed to be getting closer, moving silently and slowly.  Everyone else began to leave but ((name deleted)) and I stood and watched as it slowly started to drift hight and higher.  As it did the bottom showed a distinct triangular shape.  ((name deleted)) went back inside but I continued to watch as it just rose ingto the stratosphere and disappeared.  I felt very strange afterward.  Very confused, but very tranquil.  I think it's because it wasn't some flashy sci fi UFO thing.  I had seen it, and others with me.  On my way home I called a local news station on my cell to see if anyone had reported seeing anything at that location.  They said no but wanted to know what I saw.  I told them briefly but neither they or I pursued it further.  The tranquil, huanting feeling followed me for days, despite being teased by our coworkers.

Me, my wife and my two daughters, then 8 and 14, where in our car (I'm driving) head NORTH down Hertel Avnue.  It was nearing dusk and the sky was remarkably clear, not a cloud for as far as the eye could see in any directon and the moon was full and very clear to the west of the sky though the sun was still shining (but nearing sunset).  We were on our way to Pay Less Shoes at Delaware and Hertel (near K-Mart); traffic was thick and moving slow.  I was going to purchase shoes for my two daughters for 'back to school'.  Then we were going to take a family drive to the Tuscaruora Indian Reservation for ice cream, cigarettes and gas.  As we approached Parkside - heading North down Hertel, the light turned red and we were the second car from the light.  My younger daughter startled me as she shouted ""Daddy, look up! look up!""  We all looked up to the distanct sky directly in front of us, staring about 25 degrees up in the direction of travel and there was an extremely bright round orb of light, brighter than the North Star, BRIGHTER THAN ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN IN THE SKY.  By distance, it looked like it was over Lake Erie.  The orb of light just stayed in one spot and flickered for the entire time we sat at the red light. When the light turned green, the car in front did not move and neither did we and the people behind us started to blow there horns. I noticed the driver in the front car was staring and pointing at the sphere of light and talking to a female passenger in the seat next to him. We all got caught at the red light again!!  Then the sphere split into two orbs of light!!  Then about 2 seconds after the split, the second sphere or orb just JUMPED TO THE LEFT AND STARTED TO THE EDGE OF THE FULL MOON.  IT SAT THERE FOR ABOUT 1 SECOND; THEN IT STARTED TO JUMP BACK AND FORTH FROM ONE SIDE OF THE MOON TO THE OTHER!!! (traveling the diameter of the moon!!) It did this for about 2 seconds and in that time It moved from the left to the right exactly 10 times before disappering!!  Then the first orb moved towards the moon form it's place in the horizon over Lake Erie and it traveled next to the moon and did it in less than a half a second!!  (I took my watch off my wrist and held it near my view to time what the orbs were doing)  The light truned green and the second orb was still siting at the edge of the outer diameter of the moon (left side).  Traffic started to jam really bad, it took us over 15 minutes to proceed from Parkside and Hertel to Delaware & Hertel.  When we parked in the plaza in front of Pay Less Shoes and got out of the car, There was a couple (guy and a lady) standing in front of Pay Less and pointing up at the moon and the orb; they too were observing its strange behavior and my wife and I spoke to them breifly about it.  By this time, the orb or sphere shaped light was flicking in and out and each time it flickered out, it would reappear in a different spot near the moon in various places!!  I still get goose bumps thinking and talking about this!!  eeww!!  When we left Pay Less it was still there and we got spooked and did not go to the reservation as it was now dark - we went home and told no one.  during our drive back down Hertel to Main street (head to Dartmouth Ave where we then lived) we observed many people on Hertel in cars and on foot pointing at it and talking about it!!  I'm surprised this sighting never made the news!!  TOO MANY PEOPLE HAD NOTICED IT AND IT WAS CAUSING TRAFFIC JAMS BECAUSE PEOPLE DRIVING AND ON FOOT WHERE NOT FOCUSED AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN!!!!

The light on the left was higher than the one on the right and there wasn't any noise coming from them. It became apparent to me shortly thereafter that these ""things"" were not helicopters. As I observed them, the light on the left began to dim and I noticed a shallow beam of light emenating from it. The faint beam of light broadened and narrowed as it swept slowly from left to right. This went on for maybe 10 seconds as the light to the right began to do the same thing. The dimming light on the left (towards the north) began to close in on itself slowly, sort of like the shutter on a camera, wrapping itself in a shroud of fog as it vanished.

The surface was not completely smooth, it had smooth vulcano shaped object on the bottom that a white light came out of.  Like a spot light.  I saw no markings on the object but I did see a clear amount of detail that I haven't written here.  I stopped when it was above me, I didn't know what else to do because I had no camera so I waved at it.  It hoovered about another minute and blurred away again.  I felt no wind and I didn't hear any noise from it at any time.  I did however find a picture on the internet that looks very close to it.

First off im now in the US Navy. Anyway, I was 12 years old and me and my old best friend were camping in my backyard. At around 2:00AM the sprinklers came on and woke us up. We rushed outside the tent tp put a cover over us and we had some trouble trying ro get back to sleep. Bored took control and we looked for something to do. I had a few books and we read a few of them outload for some entertainment. It was my friends turn to read and as he was reading I looked outside then tent window. I gazed into the sky it was extremely clear out. One star caught my attention. It wasnt the movement thought that caught me at first. It was how bright it was. Slightly brighter then most of the stars. It was Northeast of us and I couldnt take my eyes off it. Then I noticed movement. Extremely slow movement. If you werent staring at the star and concentrating you wouldnt of noticed it. I told my friend to take a look and he used the binocculars he brang when we went hiking earlier that night. After focusing for about 15minutes we began to hear weird noises from the back side of the wall behind my house. More than likely it was animals. So we shrugged it off and looked at the star again. After another 5minutes I lost interest and picked up the book again. Like 30 seconds later my friend kept saying ""Oh shoot, oh shoot, look!"" before I even looked all the hairs on my body were standing on end. I looked out the window and froze. A triangular like craft was hovering 20 feet from me right over my backyard wall. The lights were bring but seemed to be pointed and concentrated on a few parts of the yard. It had exactly four lights. One on each corner of the craft and one dead center.     Each angle one the craft was equivalent. You couldnt tell which angle was the from of the ship. It made no noise whatsoever it was almost like it sucked the sound out of world around us. I knew it wasnt a plain because it was PERFECTLY still and the shape was too perfect to be anytype of plane. I live on the front of the San Bernardino MTS so it was also too low to be a plane. The only available thing left to assume is a helicopter but again it was silent no noise whatsoever. This is my only explaination. Anyway, it sat there for about 3 to 4 miutes and I never spoke or took my eyes off it. In an instant it left to the distance still visible. When I mean distance i mean like half a second or less. And we watched it fly accross the sky at extreme speeds. It was one hell of an experiance. Afterwords we sat still for another 2minutes unable to speak or move. We ran to my mothers room and told her and that was about it.  My old best friend isnt my fiend anymore. He did some stuff with my sister and that drove me away and last I saw him he was really really into drugs. I dont kno where or how he is now.

The light was coming down from the clouds as if the source of the light was just a few feet above the bottom of the clouds.  They hovered in the same spot for at least 30 seconds, rotating the whole time.  There were three other people in the car with me that saw it.  It was absolutely amazing!!  The only that that bothers me about it and makes other people critical about it when I tell them, is the fact that for about 2 months after I had strange dreams.  In the dreams, I was lying on a metal table in a dark room.  The walls were grey, and there was one lamp shining down at my body from behind my head.  I saw at least five humanoid silhouettes standing around me, and I could hear them talking, and I could tell that they were talking about me, but it sounded like mumbling, so I couldn't tell what they were saying.  One of them on my left side leaned over to get a closer look at me, and his face went into the light a little, so I could see him pretty good.  I could tell it was a male because of his presentation, and he had some male human characteristics.  Immediately after his face went into the light, he was scolded by the person standing next to him, then I seemed to be able to understand their language by telepathy, and I could hear them telling him that they would have to send me back because now I know what they look like.

You could see it fly that way because the lights from the city behind the mountains helped to sort of give an outline to the shape of whatever was flying overhead.  At first i thought it was just a helicopter flying over the house, heading back towards the city, but afterwards i asked myself why in the world would it be so low. It seemed like it was only 100-200 feet above the house as it flew past, and when it went over the mountains, it just barely flew over the edge of them.

It was only a couple of minutes (if that long) before it passed beyond the top of my windshield & I couldn't see it.

I saw, several miles east of Lincoln, a flashing egg shaped, or circle shaped, object in the sky above a ridgeline directly in front of a bend on Hwy 200.  I'm not familiar with the area's backroads so I couldn't tell you exactly what mountain range or roads you would have to take to reach that summit.  Now at home, I can look at the map and say that it was north of Nevada Lake, west of Great Divide Ski Area.  My depth perception probably wasn't that great, so the object was probably farther west than that - probably at a distance near I-90 - as I later figured once I headed further west (but I'll get to that in a minute).  I just remember rounding the bend and immediately having a gut feeling, after looking at the extremely large light in the sky, that I needed to pull over to make sure I knew what I was looking at.  I wanted to make sure it wasn't a mountainside flashing beacon for planes or an airplane itself.  It hovered above the ridgeline.  So I thought, perhaps, that it was a star.  However, the flashing red and yellow or white lights were really curious looking.  Aircraft have rhythms, straight flight pathes (pretty much, unless they bank and even then it's a wide turn) and consistent light patterns, but this one did not.  It was sporadic and the red was flashing in uneven, non-patterns.  It stayed in the same position and did not move for approx. 7 minutes.  Then it moved right and then straight down beyond the ridgeline out of sight.  I pulled back onto the road and headed west again on Hwy 200 hoping to catch another glimpse of it just to be sure - I like to play devil's advocate, even to myself.  I did see it again and took a left turn at the Avon/Helmville cut-off road.  I drove down about a mile and parked to see it better.  It eventually disappeared out of sight, down over what seemed to be a ridgeline of some sort way in the distance (looking towards the Garnet Range (now that I'm looking at a map).  There must have been some kind of ridgeline in the distance maybe covered by fog because of the way it disappeared.  But you couldn't see it with the naked eye either.  Once I head back that way during the daylight hours (and no fog) I'll try and see if there is indeed a mountain range there.  To the right of me (during this occurance, as I was traveling to my second location to stop and look) there was one aircraft flying which eventually flew so far north I couldn't see it through the clouds anymore.  Then about the time that one was too distant for the naked eye, another one appeared and went parellel to Hwy 200, then out of sight.  I stopped even further down the road, approx right past the North Fork of the Blackfoot River, just before Ovando and looked back into the sky to make sure I didn't see anything else.  Once stopped, I saw another three jets total in the time that I sat there.  I marked the time that I started watching from my first stop, but then lost track of the clock at this point while looking.  One of the jets was traveling quite fast and you could see the mist tail emitting from it.  Whether or not these jets were military or commercial aircraft, I cannot say.  I thought it extremely peculiar that so many aircraft would be in that vacinity at the same time buzzing around.  I kept looking at the sky all the way back to Missoula and never saw any more aircraft.  And why not?  I was nearing Missoula, which has an airport!  Am I just a dork?  Or did anyone else see this and think the light looked peculiar?  I'll be curious to find out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I asked my husband which airport it was and he said that there was no airport there. He said he has been seeing those lighted things flying around the fields for a while. He thought that they were lighted windmills.  When I looked carefully, I realized that they were free flying aircrafts. They all had amber lights underneath and very bright white search light like head lights turned on / off frequently. We assumed that someone was practicing night flying.  But it didn't fly like regular planes or helicopters. 3 of them were V shaped and flying one behind another with perfect sync. The most peculiar thing was that it appeared to be landing but taking off almost immediately with great speed.  We never stopped as we were still thinking that the night sky and the distant lights were playing a trick on our eyes. After 5 minutes or so, we saw them again. My husband said that they are all over the fields, flying round and round for a while. This time I asked him to stop and he just refused because he thought I was overreacting to something that could be ordinary.

Within about ten minutes my wife noticed what she thought were three jets coming from the sw, again, just points of light, but they were moving extremely slow towards the south, they were too far apart to be jets in formation.  As she went to get the video camera (and found that all four batteries were dead, even though we just charged them not long ago), I watched the lights ""rotate"" on a central axis and then could make out a dimmer fourth light, at this point I realized that the pattern formed a perfect triangle shape, similar to the ""Star Destroyers"" from the Star Wars movies.  I could make out one bright light at the point and three across the back, one in the center and one at either ""point"".  The triangle rotated towards the south and continued straight until out of sight behind haze.  It always moved at the same slow rate and there were no sounds associated with either of these events.  The first elapsed in maybe 20-30 seconds, the second probably 2-3 minutes.  Of course this piqued our curiosity, so we stayed out a while longer, and I saw a ""shooting star"" like I have never seen before, it was large, and I could actually see the comet shape and particles falling off the back, it looked like bright orange fire, I've never seen one this large or colored before, I'm sure it's probably just coincidence but I thought I'd mention it anyway.

I saw no strobe lights and the three lights were all of about the same brightness . They were moving from south to north very slowly and seemed to be at a great altitude . They were somewhat reddish in color. The lights had not moved far when they began to get much much brighter like some one was turning up a dimmer switch to its brightest setting and then back down slowly . They kinda of flared up and the lightwas a very bright bluish white like a star going nova  . This brightness lasted only a couple of seconds and then they dimmed to their original magnitude and then within a couple seconds of that the disapeared entirely. This happened 4 times in sucession with 4 different sets of lights . The 4th was much closer to the horizon than the other three and it lasted the longest maybe 20 seconds. It to flared brightly and then very quickly dimmed and was gone. I then went into the house and told my son about it and went back outside . A few minutes later he came out and I was describing what it was that I had seen and was pointing out the location in the sky when I noticed another one in the same area but this time going northwest to southeast. He saw it immediately and as he watched with me the lights flared and faded as before . We continued to watch this for about an hour and it happened repeatedly in exactly the same manner . the amount of time any one of these small triangles were visible ranged from 20seconds to LESS THAN 5 SECONDS .

I stay up late on most friday nights watching a movie or reading while my family sleeps. Last Friday night at about 2AM my dog bogee got my attention by wanting to go out. So i got off the couch and walked to the back door to let him out. As soon as he hit the ground, he bolted towards the far backyard as if after something.(Our backyard is completely fenced in except on one corner of the house) I looked out ahead of him to maybe spot our cat, a stray cat, or some other kind of night animal. There is an old storage shed in the back yard about 25 feet from our back door. Behind it on the next street over is a streetlight. For a split second my eyes focused on something running along the inside of the fence towards the back of the shed. As it vanished behind the shed, bogee turned the corner to the shed RIGHT after the animal, and began to bark violently as if he has cornered something (he has done this countless times with the local cats)At this point I figure it's a racoon, at the MOST a stray dog. Bogee is a shitz-zeu? Anyway you get my point. He's small. so I go running out to make sure what ever it is, it doesn't begin attacking him. After about 15 feet I begin to hear the sound of something REALLY wanting to get through a chain-link fence by slamming into it over and over. As a round the corner bogee is standing at this end of the lane, (The back of the shed sits inside the fence about 2 1/2 feet so there is a small lane about 15 feet long that ends with blackberry bushes then the turn of the connecting fence.) and the animal was at the other end. It seemed to be tangled in the blackberry bush pretty good because it had stopped trying to go through the fence and became still. The streetlight from the other street helped me make out something. I could see what my mind told me was I guess skin. The animal was ""breathing"" with quick rasping gasps. And this ""skin"" rose and fell with these sounds. It was very reflective, as if wet, so I cant say what color it was. SO at this point I'm kinda getting freaked out,so I squat down to lay my hand on bogee's back to quiet him down. At that moment the thing decides to bolt. But it doesn't come towards me (which in turn would make me scream like a woman) but takes a run at the back fence and slams into it. Now listen to this. It uses the recoil of the fence to jump up to the roof of the shed and scramble onto the shingles. YES, I was taking a few steps back. About 20. When, I started to dry heave. Alot. NOW I'm scared.Bogee begins to howl as I run back towards the house. My eyes are watering so my vision is blured, but I dont smell or hear anything odd. (Well, except for me unexplainable puking my guts out in my backyard.) In between heaving i raise up and catch a glimps of it jumping from my shed's roof to my neighbor's shed roof. Not a long jump, about 6 feet wide, except his shed is a two story! It landed on the ROOF! It scurried over the top and was gone. I continued to gag for about 4 or 5 mins. As I made my way to the door I heard, felt? I low thooming, like thunder underground, that lasted maybe 2 seconds? then I was inside and closing the door. (yes I made sure bogee was with me) If I had to guess on the size and weight of the animal in question I would say anywhere from 50 to 65 lbs. As the size I can't actually say. I never really got a good like at it. But if I had to guess a size or shape I would say it was pretty close to a large chimp. Actually I think to this day that is what I saw. What else could it be? Yeah I know, the puking. I can't explain that. Probably never will. I never tell people about it, this is South Carolina. But I though maybe you UFO people would be interested in hearing about it.

I said, I don't know but it stayed there for a while so I wanted someone else to see it.

I would say approximately a mile off the ground.   The object moved slowly... guided.  There was no noise.  It headed from my north toward the Point Mugu base.  I got excited and ran into the house and called my brother (44 years old).  He came out and I pointed the object in the sky to him.  Once he spotted it I ran back in and called my father.  He came out with me and I asked my brother where the object was.  It was no longer visible for the house was in the way.  We all waked toward the front but were unable to locate the object.   We lost sight of the object roughly at where the Point Mugu base is located.  After calming down I went upstairs and looked out the window.   I saw another object and ran downstairs.  I called my brother again and we walked out, along with my nephew (10 years old).  I showed him the object in the sky but this was strange.

The jet sounds heard were comming from the Florida Power and Lighting Power Plant located on Shun Pike in Johnston RI.  On both nights posted the power plant experienced a large build up of steam pressure that had to be vented off. As steam passes through the relief valves it creates a loud jet engine like sound that can be heard many miles away. ((END))",2005-11-08T00:00:00,41.771192385786804,-71.46207461928934

We stood there in wonder and I said I was going home to look on the internet for info.

I wish I could draw it for you, but it was like there was an energy being generated and cut, symmetrically both above and below the object that was similar to an angel fish.  Then there was a flash that was literally like an explosion.  I thought, ""well, there's the 'fireworks' part.""  It did look very much like a small, now GREEN AND PURPLE firework that sent another circular emission of semi-lit air.  I cried out, ""What?!  WHAT?!!?""

The two lights move along a line northward, more or less parallel to the horizon, through the eastern sky. The rightmost (trailing) light is ""fuzzier"" that than the front (leftmost) one. Over the span of about 90 seconds they move about 25-30 degrees to the northeast, before they seem to fade out behind the clouds. During this time the leading light increased its distance from the trailing one to about 5 moon diameters. The trailing light grew less fuzzy over the period of time that I followed it.

This evening I was again walking with my dog but this time my little sister was also with me.  Planet Mars was very visible well above the eastern horizon.  At about 21:25 me and my sister observed an extremely bright Iridium satellite flash above the constellation of Ursa Major.  Five minutes after that I noticed a bright satellite moving just outside the left side of what the astronomers of the Northern hemisphere would call the Pegasi Square and told also my sister to take a look at it.  At the time of noticing it was almost straight above my head and was heading SE.  What made this satellite peculiar was that it was closely (< 2 degrees) followed by a less visible satellite just as when I observed it about a week earlier (I have no doubt that the objects I saw tonight were the very same ones witnessed in earlier report).  The satellites continued into same direction maintaining their less-than-2-degree distance and slowly fainted away about 90 seconds later well below the Pegasi Square.  Also my little sister saw 2 satellites.   We both paid attention to the slow visible speed od these satellites.  The facts that these satellites behaved normally, that I observed this phenomenon twice within a short time, almost exactly in the same direction and almost on the same hour both evenings made clear to me that this phenomenon has little to do with UFOs, Aliens or Extraterrestial life.  What I´ve most probably been witnessing on both evenings is a formation of NOSS satellites. No investigation is needed. Thank you.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,,

I own a nice telescope and have been observing Jupiter and Saturn within the last week.  As I looked up to see Jupiter I was very surprised. There were two of them! This really threw me and confused me. The reason I say there were two Jupiters is that both objects looked identical in magnitude, size and even color. Jupiter is a yellowish-white to the eye. I knew one of these objects could not be Jupiter, so I watched carefully for movement. I did not see any movement or seperation whatsoever. Both objects were completely still in the sky.

For approximately four days two military jets loitered in the area,several of my friends heard and watched them on several occasions that week. They stayed in the same exact area going about five to ten minutes out( west and over the gulf)and then returning almost overhead,I live and work very close to were they were doing this so I could hear them almost continuously. They did this All day and well into each night,could have been all night but I didnt stay up to find out. On the last evening that they loitered something strange happened, at 8:30 PM I arrived at my shop to drop off some equipment I had just purchased, I heard the jets as usuall and watched them as they headed away from me towards the gulf, I turned around and started to unload my truck,A bright light pulse( Only way I can describe it) cought my eye and I looked up, it didnt flash again for about 10 seconds(approx) then it pulsed again, a few seconds later it pulsed again but it looked like it was aimed away from the ground and towards the sky, then a few seconds later another pulse towards the ground. There were no other lights on IT and I couldnt hear IT, it was very dark out so I couldnt see a silouhette of any kind. So Im watching this thing and the next thing I hear are those jets heading back towards were I am but this time the engines are alot louder,I see one more pulse of light slightly west of the last pulse and away from were the jets are coming from and into an area that is cloudy so I couldnt see alot more. The jets arrived over head heading directly towards were the last light pulse occured, I saw a streek of light through a small opening in the cloud bank, Im not sure whether it was the jets or the object.My exact feeling at that time with the aggresiveness exerted by the jets was that there going to shoot this thing down, I watched for a few minutes in almost horror and fear and listened to the jets as they raced away. I didnt see the light ever again, the jets returned approx one hour later stayed approx one more hour and I never heard them again after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

Arizona numerous sightings of up to six objects at a time and low altitude chase The area around Arivaca, Ariz. is well know by locals for wierd activity in the air. We commonly see objects from low to high level and witnessed one chased by two F-16 fighters. The object played with them out turning and out accelerating then slowing and letting them catch up then off he would go again. This went on for about 10 min. The fighters had to break off as they were under afterburner for most of the chase and had to be running low on fuel. Then the object shot straight up out of sight. We watched part of the show with Owl night vision glasses with magnification of 4X. The object, when watched by eye turned red-white-green repeatedly and was disc shaped.  What I am also reporting here are other sightings at higher altitude. When in the Arivaca area we have sat out at night and watched objects entering and exiting the atmosphere in  E.- W. N.-S. and S.-N. directions. Possibly going in and out of to Area 51? One night we watched six of them come in about 5 min apart on a S.-N. approach, except the last one was about 10 min later than #5. He skipped twice on the atmosphere we could see the flash and what appeared to be a short trail from the heat before he entered successfully and we watched as he followed the same route as the first five while slowly loosing altitude. We joked that he must have stopped at another party and had a bit of a problem with his drinking and driving. This is not the first time we have watched the high altitude objects that were clearly not planes or satallites. We have observed them changing directions 3 and 4 times in a period of 1-2 min. and then fly out in space until we couldn't see them any more with binoculars or have watched them come down to lower altitudes, you can tell when thay are dropping as they lose the suns reflection and are not as bright. I don't particularly want any type of chance contact. We have enough Illegal Aliens coming in from Mexico and causing problems without these. If anyone wants to take notice just get up in the mountains or out on the desert around Arivaca and keep your eyes open at night for high flying objects that emit no sound. Seldom have I gone a week without observing at least one of them-especially in the summer, of course thats when I normally sit out most of the time. Nights when the moon is down are the best but there seems to be more traffic when the moon is half or fuller making the objects more difficult to see. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report, but it seems curious that NUFORC has received no other reports of this apparently dramatic event.  We would welcome other reports from anyone in the area who might have been witness to the event.  PD))",2005-01-19T00:00:00,,

At approximately 21:00 during the last week in February of this year (I just now found out I could report this here) I was on my back porch talking on the phone with a friend and my 2 labrador retrievers were in the back yard.  Suddenly I noticed an oval shaped set of reddish, ethereal lights approaching from the southwest just above the treeline about 100 yards from me. There was no sound associated with this low, slow moving multiple red light object.  The woods behind my house are my property in all directions for at least a mile and there are no buildings on the property except my home. Both dogs began to bark like mad and started running toward where the light was descending. My nearest neighbor lives 3/4 of a mile away and I have almost no light intereference because Stone Ridge is rural.  In fact, I live only 8 miles from where Whitley Streiber used to have his upstate cabin (Accord, NY).  In fact, I spoke on the phone with Mr. Streiber several years ago and after talking for about an hour he confirmed that I was witnessing multiple viewings of UFO's.  Anyway, the dogs gave some chase towards the reddish object which consisted of 6 or 7 lights which I could not determine if they were separate from each other because of the strange ""ethereal"" glow the emitted They did move in complete unison though.  The glow was confusing.  The lights lowered all the into the woods (definitely on my property) and then I couldn't see them.  Meanwhile I was describing to my friend on the phone exactly what I was seeing because I couldn't believe it. I lost sight of the lights once they dipped into the woods and the dogs relaxed their barking and I wasn't about to go into the woods to go see for myself what it was because it was too weird.  I kept talking to my friend about it and I described it to her and kept talking about  it when about 6 or 7 minutes later (maybe less time went by but not too much) the exact same silent 6 or 7 weird glowing reddish hazy orbs all lifted up again to just above the tree level and floated off the way it came.  When it lifted up the dogs started going berserk again but they stopped short of chasing into the woods too.  When I went back into the house my husband wanted to know what on earth had made the dogs make so much noise barking and I told him what had happened and he told me that I had just imagine the lights.  Well, I didn't imagine them.  It's the 3rd time I've seen similar lights while walking my dogs in our back field but this was the only time they descended and then ascended again.  I went into the woods the next day when it was light out (obviously) and checked around to see if I could see anything unusual on the ground but I found nothing and my woods are pretty remote and I was kind of freaked out, even in the daytime with the dogs (who didn't seem to sniff at anything overly either).  So, I got out of there fairly fast because I've heard that some people have seen ""greys"" in broad daylight in Stone Ridge and I think I'd be scared to death if I saw something in daylight that I couldn't expain.   In closing I just wish to say that if I have ever been abducted I have no memory of it but I believe that my younger son may have been.  He's too young to talk to about it.  It scares me though.

I was in a convertible riding passenger heading East on Mayfair Ave towards the Forks at Main and the new bridge when I noticed a bright object in the North East part of the sky.  It looked similar in brightness to Regulus in the Constellation Leo if it were in the night sky with the exception this was daylight. After observing it for several minutes trying to determine whether it was perhaps a mylar balloon we noticed that it remained stationary and appeared to be getting larger (as if it were descending). We took turns viewing it so we would not succumb to an optical illusion.  We pulled over on Main towards the turnoff into the Forks at Earl's on Main just past the CN Station. Using the moon as a reference point, it was about  6 inches off the 8 o'clock position and now moving towards the SW. It had become larger in appearance and looked almost like 2 balls turning clockwise slowly around each other and was now emanating a  bright reddish light. The reddish light went from a single distinct light to 3 lights then back to a single light then into 2 lights and back into 3 lights.  We continued to observe it as it once again seemed to stop moving and hovered in a stationary position emanating these same lights. I also notice that it seemed to now be rising in height becoming once again smaller.

IT was 7pm, clear blue sky and i was in garden getting washing in.I looked up at the sky,as i always do,and i saw a bright white dot,and then another one.Then as i carried on looking i realised there were lots of bright white dots in the sky,or bright white lights,they are the closest description i can give.I counted 15 of them at this time,they were very high up in the sky but clearly visible to the naked eye. As i continued watching,more and more of these bright lights travelled into sight until my highest count was 26. I called my daughter to bring my binoculars and witness the sight.Through my binoculars,the objects appeared triangular in shape.They moved around slowly,forming patterns in the sky.Although not visible through my camera lens I took 2 photos,yet to be developed. As time passed by they gradually moved further up into the sky, becoming smaller to the eye and fewer until eventually they were all out of sight. Immediately afterwards,a black object appeared, which i first thought was  a helicopter, but that too eventually went so high up it went out of sight.There was no sound emitting from any of these objects.Also,at least 2 civilian aeroplanes flew right past these objects, they must surely have been seen by the pilots and even the passengers, it was a clear sky. Logically i thought there must be something of astronomical significance happening in space, and i tried ,unsuccesfully, to obtain a phone number of an astronomy society in the UK.Had no joy on the internet either so keyed in UFOs and decided i would report it as just that. I have never seen anything like it in my life before and i can think of logical explanations but i wish there could have been someone who i could have contacted who could have looked into the sky and seen what i had seen and given me an explanation,astronomically OR extra-terrestrially! I will be out same time tomorrow night to see if they appear again. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,,

The closest analogy I can think of is a tadpole or a sperm.  *  *  .  * .  Red=* Light green = . The red lights were about the size and brightness of Venus as it appears to the naked eye.  The trailing lights were smaller. An airplane was in the sky concurrently, and though the mysterious lights looked further away than those of the plane, they were moving much, much faster. Also, their motion didn't seem like anything we'd ever seen before.  Rather than moving as though propelled by a motive force coming from a fixed place ( ie a jet or prop ) , these lights seemed to change direction instantaneously.  They were also capable of hovering in place, then jumping to an incredible rate of speed, and always in formation.  I still remember it clearly because I've never really seen anything move like that in my life -- particularly an aircraft.  It reminded me of how a hummingbird hovers, then darts. When the lights flew over us, they again picked up speed in their jerky-but-fluid way, startling my companion and causing him to fall in a hedge beside the house. Anyway, that's it.  It was weird.

I noticed in the sky a fast moving aircraft flying fairly low maybe 700-1000 metres up in a NE direction about a couple of kilometres away. At first I thought it to be a Lear jet but whilst looking at it intently realised it had no wings and was the shape of an egg, gleaming white in colour and no protuberances, of any sort with it's pointed end facing the rearward direction to which it was travelling. I remarked on it to two girls who were behind me to verify what my eyes were seeing and asked 'does that thing have any wings?' they both couldn't see any wings and then I said 'what the hell is it then?' upon which one of them remarked 'it;s probably just a blimp' at which they continued with their teenage girly talk thinking nothing more of this odd craft travelling at what appeared to be a supersonic speed in the sky, there was no trail or exhaust emmisions. I lived for a long time near Wigram airport in Christchurch and had seen jet fighters on maneouvres travelling through the sky at supersonic velocities, domestic passenger jets, helicopters etc. It certainly to my mind was not a blimp for it contained no undercarriage and was travelling extremely fast, at a guess around Mach 1 or slightly more? I watched it for the next minute disappear into the distance travelling in a perfectly straight line towards and beyond Blenheim's Woodbourne airport, it did seem to accelerate a little. It was a perfectly clear day and I had good reference points of the hills south of the main road. It appeared to be about the size of a Cessna aeroplane in length or perhaps a little longer.

I took my dog outside as I do every night and the object caught my attention right away. I was looking east/southeast.  It was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon and not moving.  The object was an extremely bright cluster of flashing red, white and blue lights in the shape of a cone or diamond (at times it was each).  The first thing to come to my mind was a helicopter in a search pattern. As I watched it there was no movement or sound, it was way too bright and I have yet to see an aircraft with lights in this formation, brightness or colors.  I was not able estimate the size or distance of the object because of not reference points.  There was a white light on top with red, white and blue lights flashing (not blinking) randomly around and on the bottom of the object.  All of the lights had the intensity of strobes.  The lights would diminish in intensity and then get extremely bright.  I watched it for approximately fifteen minutes and went back into my house to get my binoculars and my wife.  She watched it for about 10 minutes. It still showed no movement or sound.  Through the binoculars I was able to better see the individual lights but not a structure.  I watched it until approximately 9:40 pm. During that time it again diminished in brightness and moved a few degrees to the south and a few in altitude.  I finally got too cold and went back inside.  The next night I went back out during the same time period to see if this may have been a star that had fooled me due light refraction with the combination of a recent cold front and closness to the horizon.  I check three times during the same time period and the sky was empty of any lights or stars.  Just blackness. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

While up late working on a graphic design project, I looked out of my studio window to see a large orange ball of light sitting motionless above a stand of trees a few hundred yards away due east of my home.  The light was approximately the size of the full moon.  The moment I thought ""what the hell is that"" the light quickly flashed an intense white and became a tight cluster of arhythmically blinking red and white lights.  The object began to zig zag and bob up and down slowly to the southeast.  With tree branches as references I could tell that the object was bobbing up and down and moving erratically much like a hummingbird or like a boat on choppy waters.  The object then made a turn to the north until it was due east of my position, approximately where the Michigan International Speedway is located.  The object was still blinking very erratically and quickly and its motion was still 'jumpy'.  At this point the object meandered toward the east over the Irish Hills/US-12 area of south central Lower Michigan as I lost sight of it.

Two of my co-workers who I was carpooling with at the time were also in the car. Behind the jet I noticed a flashing light which I took to be another jet close behind the other or in the same area. Noticing the difference that the first jet I saw had a condensation trail and the second did not.  I let it go for a couple minutes unwatched and when we puled off the 401 at Communication road I scanned the skies again. The reason being that for the past few days I have been watching the skies for anything out fo the ordinary. Now I know why.  At apx. 5:00 pm while heading north on Creek Road I noticed what I assumed to be the jet I had seen earlier. This time it was much closer and appeared to have an unusually short condensation trail. My eyes were drawn to what I saw in the sky behind the ""jet"". The same type of flickering I saw near the jet onthe horizon and in almost the same relative position to the jet with the con trail. I figured that this was just another jet that was catching the suns rays. Until the flickering ceased and the lagging object appeared more brilliant, even solid.  At this point I knew somethign was not normal about this so I asked the driver to pull over. Both of the other passengers had seen what I was looking at before I asked to pull over. We stopped at the corner of Creek road and Indian Creek road, got out of the car and watched as the two objects traveled in a South Southeastern direction. The distance between the two objects was apx. the distance from the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb while held at arms length.  My friend suggested that it was an airplane that had another object or craft in tow but that turned out not to be the case. As we were facing south and both objects passed in front of us, the condensation trail behind the red dot dissapeared. Both objects proceeded along their paths and then apx. three seconds later the red dot had started traveling backwards. It did not stop, or turn. it REVERSED.  Up until this point I was awaiting the moment when I could say ""Ahh, that's just a couple airplanes"" I do not know of any modern aircraft that could mimick the movement I saw.  When the red dot reversed its path, there was apx. 3 seconds where it appeared as though the trailing object and the red dot were going to collide.  The two objects passed very close to each other and both travelled out of sight at a constant speed. The white luminous object heading South Southeast and the red dot, on its reversed path, and without condensation trail, progressed North Northwest.  All three of us that witnessed this event can not come up with any rational explanation for what happened.

At around 2:00 am this morning (August 11th) I was laying on the ground outside watching the annual meteor shower that goes on this time of year.  Then I noticed a moving orange mass that looked like a cloud at first.  When I looked closer I noticed it was it was five or six orange circles that were in the shape of a dividing rod (one straight end with two ends diagonally coming out of it.  It was being led by the two diagonal ends.  Here is an illustration. The blue arrow indicates which direction it was heading in.   I was facing East and the object was heading West, right in my direction. http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO1.jpg  It got out of my line of vision, so I got up and ran until I could see it again.  I saw it for another couple of seconds until it disappeard over the horizon of my house.   I scanned the sky everywhere trying to look for it again.  Then, from a completely different direction (North),  I saw another moving mass of about six circular orange lights.  This time they were in the shape of an arc, as illustrated here: http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO2.jpg Once again, it was moving in the direction of the blue arrow from the angle I saw it (Me facing North, the object heading West - Northwest.)  As it moved more to the left,  the lights got closer together like this: http://s88311880.onlinehome.us/pics/UFO3.jpg  This mass of lights stayed in my line of vision for a good twenty seconds before disappearing over the horizon.  Both objects didn't make any noise from what I could tell.  Before the sighting I was quite relaxed just laying back watching for the occasional shooting star to send a white streak across the sky.  (By the way, I am 100% sure this was not a shooting star or anything like it.)  When I saw the first one shaped like the dividing rod,  I was confused.  I knew it wasn't a star or any type of airplane that I've ever seen. It also didn't appear to be a ""light show"" produced by a machine or anything.   After I realized that it wasn't a normal object in the sky, I was shocked.  That's why I ran around looking to see if I could find it again.  When I saw the second arc-shaped one I was even more shocked because it was completely different than the first one, so I figured it was a completely different entity than the first one.  The lights were the same reddish-orange color as the first one.  In both instances, the orbs were moving faster than an airplane or jet.  They weren't moving extraordinarily fast,  but definetly faster than any airplane I have ever seen.  Now, I don't really believe in aliens or extraterrestrials.  Normally when I see someone talking about a UFO sighting,  I figure they were either intoxicated or saw an ordinary object (like a plane or light show) and misconstrued it as being foreign.  So for me to actually see something that *I* couldn't identify as something you'd normally see in the sky,  I'm just in shock and disbelief.   I keep thinking ""I'm not one of those crackpots.""  But I know I saw *something* up there.  Something strange.  I'm sure there is some logical, ""Earthly"" explanation for it.  But I can't for the life of me figure out what it is.  My best bet is that maybe they were some military planes that aren't really known to the public.  But if they were, they sure had a strange flight pattern.  I hope I was thorough enough in my explanation.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,38.76717395833333,-121.3107662202381

At the top of a hill I seen two lights in the sky. There was a red light an a green light. I said to my son look at those lights. They looked like they were about 300 to 500 yards in the sky. The lights were not flashing. I drove a few hundred yards, then pulled my truck off the road onto the gravel. We both got out of the truck. As we got out of our truck, My son said ""look it's a triangle"" I said ""yes it is."" When I first looked up, it was right over our heads around 300 to 500 yards off the ground. I could see the triangle shape by seeing the outline of the UFO, and not by just connecting the lights to see the UFO, the bottom of the object was a dark color, maybe black, and There were 3 lights on each end of the triangle. The wild thing about this UFO was the broad side of the triangle was going in front. There was a yellow light in the back. The UFO moved west away from us, with the broad side of the triangle moving forward. I tried to listen for noise from the object, but the cars that went by us interfered. My son said for a few seconds when the cars past he couldn't hear anything from the UFO. I didn't hear any noise from the UFO during this whole event. When I got home. I drew a picture of what I seen. I didn't show my son, who is ten years old. The next day after school. I had my son to draw what he saw. Both pictures were the same, except for the color of one light. I had the green, and red light in front on the broad side, with the yellow in the back. My son had the red, and yellow in front on the broad side with the green in the back. Everything else was the same, including the color, shape, and the broad side of the triangle moving forward.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,36.9965,-85.5985

I finally saw the ""dancing"" lights I have alway's heard about. It was awsome! Tonight, I went out side about 9PM to see if the meteor shower was visible yet. I looked straight up and noticed something moving. I live out in the country, under a fly path, and almost alway's see something moving in the sky's above me. Most flights are at maximum altitude above me (30 K feet, I believe it is). Anyway's, looking at this movement in the sky, which seemed to be much higher than normal flights...... much higher, and not the normal path I usually see,heading more south than southeast, when all the sudden I saw it zig-zag. I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. I kept looking and it happened again. It zig zagged to both sides, several times. So, I ran inside to get my binoculars. When I got back outside I pointed my binoculars towards the area in the sky, where I believed the object should have been by this time and somehow, almost instantly had this object in view. At the same time I saw another object, coming from the opposite direction , in the same view. The paths of both did not look very straight, but definately on the same paths. Their paths looked so close that I thought they were going to hit. As soon as they passed each other, the northbound object immediately turned around and followed the other object, like it was nothing.......kind of like playing a game of chase. The turn radius had to take less than two seconds...... kind of like a kid turning his bike around in the street and heading back in the opposite direction, in one smooth motion. I was awstruck! I have never seen a plane make movements like that, includine jet fighters I have watched on tv. The turn radius was way more severe than anything I have ever seen on tv. I don't see how someone could withstand G-forces like that, the way the one turned. The objects looked like solid white lights (not blinking like planes usually do), kind of how planets look through a telescope, and they may have even been a little oblong.... not a perfect circle. I watched these until they went beyond the tree lines to the south. I have probably seen thousands of planes in the sky's, above my house , but have never seen anything like this. This was amazing!!!! I wanted to tell someone, but didn't know who I should contact. So, I at least wanted to find a web site and get out my enthusiasm of what I had just witnessed. So, here I am. I do believe in UFO's, and do analyze everything I see in the sky that looks suspicious. I alway's conclude that what I see is a plane, helecopter, weather balloon, or a satelite. I ruled out everything on this list. This definately was odd. These things looked like they were moving faster than the jet's I watch. I have no idea what I just witnessed. I have to call them unidentified! Not the normal sightnings I usually see in the sky. I just hope someone else saw them. I am so excited!! I almost forgot..... I didn't hear any sounds coming from these objects.... they may have been too high to hear.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

I went inside the house and got a low power telescope to get a closer look, but never could locate the object due to the sunlight.

Observing the night sky I noticed a light about the intensity of an average star moving from north to south at about one inch per second at arms lenght.  Then the object made an eliptical loop that would approximate the outline of my thumb at arms lenght.  At the end of the loop the object stopped, increased in intensity and size to about 4 times the size of venus with a brilliant white light forming a beam towards earth. The object did not move for 5 seconds.   Then the object decreased it's intensity incrementatlly until it vanished.  I watched the same spot in the sky for 15 minutes and it did not appear.  There were no aircraft strobes visible and the weird flight pattern, sudden stop, no noise and disappearnce rules out aircraft or ballon etc.  The objects illumination would be about like that of a airliner's landing light at about 3000 feet which I see frequently.

May have been a shooting star, but I don't know.  I haven't seen a shooting star since I was really young and my memory was them appearing much smaller and obvious that they were far away.  Anyway, I was smoking a cigarette leaning against the trunk of my car in the parking lot of my apartment complex about 10 miles south of downtown Nashville, TN at about 4am.  I was sort of looking up and relaxing (getting my mind off my work, as I work from home on my computer.)  I noticed the normal few stars you can see here with the naked eye (nothing like you can in rural areas, like Vermont where I'm from.)  So I noticed the couple brighter ones, but not knowing much about them I can't tell you if the particularly bright one is Mars or the North Star or whatever.  Anyway, I glanced down as I flicked ashes but at that moment a flash in my peripheral or something caused me to look up to my left...  But it was sort of in a way that you might look at a lower flying plane (we see them all the time because the airport is kind of close.  They aren't low enough to be really loud, just enough to spot their lights if you're out driving in the area, etc.)  Anyway, I sort of casually looked over.  And focused on a light which may or may not have been stationary when I first saw it (hard to remember this all happend in a matter of less than 5 seconds.)   Anyway, I realized in like a milisecond that it wasn't a plane because it was to far off, but at the same time didn't see to be ""in space.""  It was sort of like a star's light, only softer if that makes sense.  Anyway, by the time I focused on it it shot acrossed a good percentage of the sky ridiculously fast parallel to the ground (from my vantage point.)  It's still hard to picture it moving that fast again, but I do recall somewhat of a ""streak.""   Then all in those same couple seconds it disappeard.  But didn't fissle out, it looked as if it dissappeard behind a wall.  I also don't know if it was my imagination but the light seemd to be almost a soft white/blue color.  Not where you'd be like ""wow that's flourescent blue"", but I think you know what I mean.  Anyway, my thought was, for it to have moved acrossed that much sky, as far out as space, it would have to have been moving ridiculously fast.  Obviously the closer an object would be, it move acrossed a ""chunk"" of sky more quickly.  Not sure which scientific law that is, but it's common sense anyway.",2005-04-16T00:00:00,36.13170004240882,-86.7768134860051

Because it was so small and seemed shiny, it looked just like the stars around it. Because I didn't know exactly how high up it was, I couldn't guage the distance very well. However, it moved from star to star in the clear night sky very quickly. Every couple of minutes it would come to a dead stop and change direction completely. It seemed to be indirectly heading from east to west. After several minutes, another object of the same sort but a little larger joined it. It must have stood still the whole time because we had thought it was a star in the night sky and it startled us to see it move. It moved a bit faster in the same direction, only following one path. It passed from one star to the next in only one or two seconds. As soon as the second ship moved, the first and smaller ship began acting as if it were running away from it. The ships moved from east to west for several more minutes in the same manner and we went inside, still a bit startled and confused. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My brother, cousin and I were aboard my fishing boat. It was late in the evening and we were returning to port after spending the entire day fishing. I was steering the boat and the other two were out on deck when I suddenly heard them screaming exciting. At first I thought they spotted a whale shark but my brother came running up to the captains house screaming ‘look at that thing off of the portside. I quickly exited and noticed a cylinder shaped object about ½ mile from us protruding from the water. It was sticking straight out of the water about 45-50 feet and looked to be about 4 feet wide. The object quickly disappeared under the water and reappeared a few seconds later closer to my vessel. It elevated to the height of 60-70 feet within 5-6 seconds and stayed stationary for a few seconds and submerged again. It reappeared again moving further away but the height of the object rose to a great elevation, It begin moving in the direction the bow of my vessel submerging as it was moving.  It was completely under water when it was near my boat. We looked in vain to see what this object was attached to be nothing ever broke the surface of the water. I reported this incident to a friend that works for the coast guard. He said he knew of nothing that would that be capable of supporting such a cylinder and elevating itself above the water and submerging in a few seconds. I’m hoping someone else has reported seeing a similar object here. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

We are awaiting a response from the individual, and will add any further comments we receive back from him.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT)) Mr. Davenport  I just received your last email regarding your request. I’m inclined to say no to any attention this may bring to family and me. I think the size of the object rules out a periscope.  This object was the size of a support pylon you would see under an overpass. It was huge.  My estimation is that object was at least 4 feet wide, circler and appeared smooth and black. I really have no way of knowing the distance of the object except for dead reckoning. Without embellishing the size I still think it broke water and rose to a height of 45-65 feet. The ascent took several second and it remained stationary before it slipped below the water. The lapse of time between submersion and resurfacing was 30-40 seconds and within that time frame it moved 300-500 yards while it was underwater. It did indeed change directions. As the object surfaced and submerged it did cause a wake and disturbance in its area.   Its velocity I guess was approx 20-25 knots when it made its final descent as it moved. At no time did we see what the object was attached to if anything at all.  I did not make an official report to the U.S. Navy for obvious reasons. Mainly I didn’t want to suffer any ridicule and I do not want nor am I seeking publicity. I just want a logical explanation as to want we saw. Quite possibly it was something in military in nature. I do know that it moved in a conscious nature. Something controlled the manner in which it moved. I hope my email sheds some further light and answers some of your questions. Thank you for your time.

Dear Sir,  I've decided to write regarding your investigation of the UFO incident over O'Fallon and Shiloh etc.  I grew up in O'Fallon from 1976-1981 and graduated from ((deleted)). I am intimately familiar with the area that the O'Fallon police officer sighted the UFO as I used to ride my dirt bike as a small boy behind the Jack Schmitt Dealership before it was built. Years ago there used to be an abandoned train track that ran from the O'Fallon Lumber yard over to the old coalmine (as I knew it) towards Hartman Lane. This was before Interstate 64 was open and during it's construction.( 1977 I believe) My parents still live in O'Fallon and I visit about every 3 or 4 years. I found your investigative report amazing and would like to thank you for such an informative and detailed article regarding the sightings.  I currently work for the Federal Government as a ((deleted)) and have recently retired (June 2004) from the US Air Force in Colorado Springs. I spent 23 years as an aircraft mechanic on C-141, C-5 and C-130 cargo planes and the last 14 of those years as a C-130 Instructor Flight Engineer with almost 3,500 total flight hours. I would like to recount an experience I had in the summer of 2001 (estimate) while flying a Tactical Training Mission over the Colorado Mountains near Salida, Colorado. The reason why I mention Salida, Colorado is because of the somewhat famous video taken in 1999 by a restaurant owner who lives in Salida. I have not related this incident to any UFO organizations as of yet and only mention it occasionally to close friends and relatives. I'll try to be short and hope you find this account as interesting and perplexing as I do.  As you may well know the C-130 aircraft is used for intra-theater operations at forward operating bases. We continuously practice low level routes simulating ingress into a drop zone in order to airdrop personnel or cargo. The C-130 unit located at Peterson AFB CO is currently the largest Air Force Reserve unit in the United States with 16 aircraft assigned.  We were flying a low level mountain route in a three ship formation west of Salida and north-west of Monarch Ski Area. When accomplishing tactical maneuvers we would typically fly no lower than 500 feet and use the terrain and mountains in order to enhance our survivability. During these low level mountain routes the other aircraft in the formation would normally fly what is called fluid trail. This means that they are able to maneuver as they see fit and it is not until we approach the drop zone within 5 miles do we form back up into an airdrop configuration with each aircraft behind each other approximately 2000 feet. The reason I mention this is because I do not believe any other aircrew members on the other aircraft witnessed what I did.  As we were approaching a ridge line crossing at approximately 500 feet above ground level I glanced out of the co-pilots lower right side window near his right leg. If you are familiar with the C-130 you know that it has 23 windows surrounding the flight deck area and has an excellent view not only in front of the aircraft but also down and below the front of the aircraft. I witnessed 2 Silver Orbs or Balls, side by side, moving in the opposite direction approximately 100-200 feet below and to the right of our aircraft. I  have since recounted these Orbs as being in formation.(C-130 Talk) My view of these orbs was only for 2 or 3 seconds as we were traveling between 230-250 knots indicated airspeed. My first thought was that of the orange balls located on power lines for aircraft identification. But these were not orange and there were no power lines in our vicinity given the altitude and mountainous terrain involved. As I look back on it now I can still see these 2 Silver Objects as they moved below and past our aircraft.  I do not recall if I mentioned this to the Co-pilot or not. He would most likely have been the only other person to have seen these 2 silver objects unless the Loadmaster in the back was standing in the right rear troop door and looking out. And since this was a mountain route with the possibility of severe turbulence he would have been sitting down and strapped in since we have had injuries in the past. I could not tell the size of the 2 objects but I would estimate them to be 10-15 feet in circumference maybe bigger. Again I only witnessed them for 2 or 3 seconds and then they were gone. I could not exactly determine their size.  The funny thing is I know what I saw. And will never forget. I'm sorry if I rambled on but I wanted to thank you again for the article about the Illinois UFO. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I do plan on reporting this to a UFO organization soon. Do you recommend one over the other?? I was thinking MUFON although it probably really doesn't matter.  If you have time I would be interested in any thoughts you have about this incident. Thank You    Msgt.

MILAB? Strange visit from the health department? Hello  An incident occured on the night before Easter in 2003, and its been nagging at me and my family since.  That night, my mother, who had a nasty respitory illness, woke up in what she described was like a drug induced haze (she was once a nurse in Emergency rooms, and has herself had a few surgeries, and thus knows very well what medical anesthesia feels like, and she said this was very similar). She saw fuzzy images of what appeared to her as best she could tell, were people in full surgical garb. One of the ""doctors"" called her by name, told her everything would be ok. She remebers a needle being inserted in her arm, and blood taken. She couldnt speak, other than grunt, and was very confused before she blacked out again.  The next morning she woke up. She saw a needle pincture in her arm and was very concerned. My stepfather, who was also in the bed with her, woke. He also had one, which scared him. To understand better, my stepfather has a serious phobia of needles. When he sees the doctor, he must be sedated before they can poke any sort of needle into him, because he literally vomits and passes out on seeing needles. he often must leave the room when they doctors take blood from my mother. He remebered nothing, but was feeling very drowsy and run down, and felt confused. They both came in and asked me if I had let paramedics in the night before, and I told them no.  That night, I myself was playing on my computer. Since I was working a grave yard shift at the time, I had only woken up at about 8 P.M. Yet after 2 hours of being awake, I suddenly was overcome with such drowsiness and exhaustion, I simply crawled onto the cot I slept on, and fell asleep within minutes, which was VERY strange. I woke up feeling sore all over, which was weird, but no puncture or needle marks on my arms at all, and no recollection of anything the night before.  When they both showed me these strange needle marks, i was indeed very interested. They told me they themselves fell asleep suddenly, probably around the same time i did, judging by what was on TV when they fell asleep.  What was even weirder is that my cats, all of them were very spooked the next day. This was very interesting, as my largest cat never gets spooked. Vacuum cleaners, dogs, loud sounds, nothing phases him, yet I found him hiding under a bunch of boxes, and he hissed at me everytime i tried to reach in and get him. The other cats were terrified and hiding in other places.  My stepfather also told me the door was unlocked. I remeber him locking the door every night, and remembered him doing that. We lived in a bad area (White Center) and always made sure it was locked, but the door seemed locked, and the cats would go no where near it.  Anyway, this whole thing was very strange. We have been puzzling over it for these past two years, and Ive done a bit of research, and cannot seem to find any possible explainations. Although I have always been interested in the UFO phenomenon, and have done alot of personal research and study, and even had a sighting years ago, at that time, it seemed that the alien abduction theory was not a serious question.  However, as I do more looking into it, I have become a bit more confused. I feel that perhaps submitting a report to NUFORC would be the best option. If you folks dont do abduction reports, feel free to send it on to whoever you feel would be best for this subject, if it is indeed typical of abductions. If there is a mundane explaination, like a bizarre midnight visit from the health department (the SARS epidemic was big news at the time, and my mother did have a bad lung infection), Id like to know as well. Im really interested in getting to the bottom of this ""high strangeness"" and am looking for an answer, mundane or otherwise.  Feel Free to contaqct me for any further information by phone or email or other, and Ill be happy to answer any questions.  Thank you.

I said my mom has introduced me to the life of watching for them and how they watch us back. She thought I was insane. So we went out side and the one I seen frist. I pointed out and she watched as it swayed down slowly. When we got in the car to drive up her mile and ahalf drive way so the sky would be clear of any trees. The space ship came down fast and followed us up the drive way. When we got out agian. The ship flew up and all kinds of them apeared all around us like they were watching us as we were them. They kept swaying around us and they were are differnt shapes differnt colors that flashed and when they would sway closer it was like the lights would dim and when they would just sit in one spot it was like they were bright then dim. When some one would drive close to the area they would dim down so much that they looked like another star in the sky. My mother has always told me they have been watching down at her since she was 15years old. They are there. You believe they will allow you to see. When you are hurt and lonely. You talk to the skies and they will appear. Wheather you are alone or not you show no harm they show no harm. Neberska is a really good place to watch for them. The best places I have found to watch them is the contry on Holstein Road in Kensaw NE., The country of the organ trail area which is located by the little blue rive by Deweese NE., and of course way out in the country of Franklin NE..

I slowed to a stop along side the road and watched it. It was a bright yellow ball with a comet tail that was bright red. It was close enough that I could see individual ""sparks"" coming off the tail. I immediately called 911 on my cell phone. It was heading from the north to the south at about a 15 degree downward angle and appeared to be on an approach path to Sarasota / Bradenton Airport. My work is immediatly behind the airport. I thought it was an aircraft coming in on fire. As I watched and spoke to the officer the tail got shorter and shorter until it was only the bright yellow ball. By this time it was directly in front of me on Tallevast Rd. At this point it appeared to stop moving. The yellow ball the split into 3 white lights in the shape of a perfect triangle. At this point I told the officer that he would think I was crazy and described to him what I saw. He told me that he had several other calls coming in reporting lights. The 3 lights then headed slowly away from me directly infront of me going east on Tallevast Rd. I followed Them for about 1.5 miles. The road was under construction and I could go no farther. I sat and watched the lights for 1 to 2 minutes until they gadually got too far away to see. I have seen the explanation that this was a Titan 4 launch but there is no way this is possible.

It was dark enough I could see a slight reflection from my dashboard console but still light enough my headlights were ineffectual.  I was about 15 to 20 minutes outside of Socorro, NM on southbound I-25 which is essentially in the middle of the desert.  I suddenly noticed something in the air off to my upper left.  It was close enough I could see the outlines of windows.  It was shaped like a rectangle with rounded corners and I saw no wings, props, etc.  It was proportioned like a candy bar.  It looked like it may have been indented around the middle, but I was unable to really focus on it as I was travelling at 80 mph.  The windows were rounded squares and the light coming out looked to be from an incandescent source (i.e. - it looked like the light that comes from residential homes' windows after dark.   slightly warm-looking or yellowish).  When I saw it, I realised I was able to see the windows clearly, but I could not hear it, nor did I hear it approach.  It seemed to be on a slighlty disconverging path with the interstate, travelling in a south east direction.  I kept glancing back to the road to make sure I wasn't going to hit anyone, but that stretch of highway is pretty deserted, so I was able to look at it several more times as it slowly pulled ahead and farther to my left.   There are several small road cuts which blocked my view of it's location in the sky for a few seconds (somewhere between 5-10) and when I could see that portion again, it was gone.   Absolutely gone.  For the rest of the drive, I kept an eye to it's presumed trajectory in the sky.  Suddenly I saw it again MILES from where it had been.  When I relocated it, it was a tiny speck, but I'm sure that was it.  It was in empty sky space (no towns, airplanes, etc.) and then it was gone again.  I'm not sure if it flew out of my line of sight, if I just couldn't see the lights anymore or if it just disappeared like it did behind the road cut.  I do know it was flying in the direction of White Sands.  A bit about me:  I'm a graphic designer and I am going back to school to get my geology degree, I have no history of hallucinations,  my husband is an engineer.  Every day for 18 months my commute to and from work took me directly under the flight path into and out of Kirtland Airforce Base, so I am famliliar with what jets that can move that fast sound like and look like in flight, in both day, night and dusk conditions.  One more thing I know, for 18 months, I cannot recall seeing aircraft flying the same flight path except for about a week or so after I saw ""it"".   My final thought:  I don't know if what I saw was alien or not, but it did seem to stay close to the road longer than it need to, almost as if it wanted me to see it and get a pretty good look at it.

I did not see their craft but at approximately 9PM on the date above ( this is approximate as I am going back in time but could probably find a more specific date- as I have a very clear recollection of events that took place around the time it occurred) I was visited by a number of entities. There was a beam of light that surrounded me, a glowing white light.Several entities appeared. at the time I could not see them but could hear them.This was experienced consciously in my place of  work. ( I work for a private wealth management firm in downtown Toronto) From that point on til the present day they have performed various types of experiements and performed surgery on me. For a great of time I believed this was some sort of negative spiritual experience as I could not see any entities. There was an entity that seemed to attach itself to my head on the right side. He continued to communicate with me. He made various claims about his purpose but the main one was that I was to have a baby. I asked the entity to leave and tried various techniques to get rid of it, white light techniques, prayer. At this point the entity seemed to have the ability to constict blood flow and/or ability to breathe in some way. I was in a great deal of pain as a result of their various experiments. At this point, there were several other entities that arrived, they came into my apartment. They had the appearance of reptilians. They performed various experiments on me and would not leave. Later other groups arrived, the had the appearance of the praying mantis type aliens and there appeared to be Zeta Reticuli involved as well. The following claims have been made, they are here to crack the binary code, they are here to create ""free energy"" they are spies here to control the group mind of North America. They are here to cross bred with humans and my ovum were being used for this purpose. I need help from someone who knows how to stop them and/ protect oneself. I have a great deal of information on how to protect oneself but would like to have as many UFO researchers/ asrophysicists help and/or novice researchers help as possible. I have physical proof of my experience and have been completely MRI'd and x-rayed as recommended by Dr Roger Leir> An annomely was found on both ""pinkies"" it has not yet been removed. I believe there may be other implants metal and/or electromagnetic in nature. I was guven the information that they were moving me at the ""speed of light"" or in some way moving/vibrating my cells at a different speed/frequency than that of the Earth. 2 things are important here. They apparently arrive on Earth through ""wormholes"" some sort of manipulation of space/ molecular structure of space. There is information about this on the website, ET medical.com. Apparently this is also the way they are able to make themselves invisible to us. Also, my understanding is that they are able to perform surgery on us by again manipulating space/time and velocity. Again good information on this is in Adrian Dvirs book- see Et medical medical.com. After the MRIs I decided to head as far to magnetic North as I could to see what would happen. Agian I was given the information that this might disrupt the magnet, if there was one, in my body. As I approached North Bay/ Ontario on my way to Moosonee, Ontario, by train, I felt a thud and my  body seemed to increase in mass. Quite literally various parts of my body got bigger closer to the weight I had been prior to the experience. The information I have been given is that the electromagnetic energy they were using to move me at an increased velocity would not completely function in areas of ""rare earth"". Apparently these rare earth minerals are minerals that do not exist on other planets. Many of them are radioactive. I have also been given the information that the secret to protecting the earth and/or myself lies in being able to control the electromagnetic energy they use to arrive here and in somehow using these rare earth minerals. Not completley sure how but again, the aliens were not able to move me at the speed of light in areas of apparent rare eart. I have been given the information that creating a controlled explosion and/ or using these rare earth minerals in that explosion would in some way disrupt their force field. It seems the entities were able to create some sort of energetic field arounf me at various times referred to as a parabola or an ellipsis. There are apparently several implants in body that I believe would be detected by an MRI and / or X-ray in these ""rare earth"" areas. I need help from an Astrophysicist and/ or someone who knows how to create a controlled explosion. Also, if anyone knows a way electromagnetic and/ or radiactive devices may be detectable, particularly in Toronto Canada. Also a physicist/ dr etc. this would be most helpful. I have various physical anomalies as a result of this experience. My colon is no longer in the same place as it was previously, and is no longer functioning in the same way that it had been prior to this experience. I have also been given the information that there is a spaceship above my place of work- Canada Trust Tower 161 Bay St and have seen an entity- grey about 31/2 feet tall, I did not see its face but believe it may be the commander of the mission. I have also seen entities that appear to be Zetas and Reptilians. I would welcome communication and or help from anyone",2005-02-08T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

We are in our 50's and are both professionals and do not drink nor do any type of drugs.   This past Saturday night in Houston I was awakened at exactly 4:32 AM (clock stopped) by a vibration that was making our house vibrate and a single laser beam type of light that was inadvertently flashing into the living room windows of our residence. The house next door to our residence is empty due to a fire in the house and the owners are renovating the house but do not live there now.  I woke up and stepped over to the sliding glass doors that open onto the second level balcony of our home and peered out the sliding glass doors. What I saw was such a shock that when my Wife asked me what was going on, I could not really speak, I could only wave her over to the sliding glass doors. An oval shaped object, approximately 50 to 60 feet long was hovering over our swimming pool and backyard.  It was approximately 25 to 30 feet high and was putting out a golden glow from the bottom of it.  The craft had a very low golden sheen about it and looked almost transparent, you couldnt see thru the object but unless you were really looking for it, you could easily miss it. There was a type of shuddering vibration eminating from it that came in waves.  We both were in shock and were afraid to make any sound or really move.   We have several outdoor cats that are our pets and a dog.  Our cats ran underneath the wooden deck that surrounds our swimming pool and our dog, ((dog's name deleted)), laid down with his head between his paws and would not move nor lookup.  ((dog''s name deleted)) after approximately 1 or 2 minutes raised up and ran into his make shift den area under a picnic table that we have in the backyard. The craft was within 50 to 75 feet of where my wife and I were standing inside our bedroom looking out the 2nd floor balcony of our bedroom. I told my Wife that I was going to run downstairs and take a picture of the craft but she became very upset and almost broke my hand holding onto me, not really making any sounds but let me know she was afraid that whatever was in the craft might come out to recover any type of documentation and come into our home. We watched it hover for about 5 minutes, noticed there was a dull light on the swimming pool and then it slowly rose and moved away slowly and in a trajectory that was almost straight up, the rate of climb would be at an estimated angle of 60 degrees at about 20 to 25 feet per second. We were up all night. The next morning we went outside and the water level of the swimming pool had dropped almost 6 inches from the time of the incident.  That is really the only significant and viable impact the craft left besides the clocks all losing about 5 minutes. We sat up all night last night to see if it would return.  It did NOT return. This was an extremely intense and emotionally draining experience. ((names deleted))  in Houston Texas",2005-10-20T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

This year only one object was present, and it appeared in apx the same location, and disappeared within a couple of miles, and was viewable for apx 45 minutes or less.  A semi solid looking fuzzy red light (to the human eye), moving along an extremely slow pace that no know man made aircraft could maintain. No running or flashing lights, no noises made either.

For the most part it maintained a consitant light source, but would on ocassion alter in intensity, and also seemed to vibrate or move strangely for a moment from time to time.  This happened again just before all the scheduled fireworks were to go off, so there should be hundreds or thousands of people seeing what my girlfriend and I saw. I stayed until the object vanished, it basically started to ascend to a higher altitude, and disappeared. I headed back home (we had gone out for a walk with our dog), my girlfriend had already went home, upon me arriving home, she pointed out in another location south of El Cajon, CA, another strange unidentified object in the sky.

Then we realized, with it being that far away, it was REALLY moving fast.  It was coming from the North traveling toward the South.  We talked about it being a rocket of some sort because it was moving too fast for a satellite.  A few times we thought it zig-zagged a little, but, basically went in a straight line.  It was fairly close to a bright blinking star, and we noticed another one coming straight toward it from the south, we thought they were going to collide. Then, the first one we saw immediately stopped, the one moving from the south darted around the first one, that seemed to be when all of us went into shock.  At that point, NONE of us were sure about what we were really watching. None of us had ever seen anything stop so fast.  We watched the one that was traveling from the south move in approximately the same path to the north the first one from the north had traveled going south. When it got just about directly overhead, we noticed another tiny star/light moving in about the same speed coming from the west.  One of the neighbors started shooting fireworks, and we lost sight of the 3rd one, but, watched the one that was still traveling north until we couldn't see it anymore.

Just before approaching a sharp turn of the road the car lights started blinking and then the car just shut off, I coasted in to the curve of the road and pulled the cars parking break.  I am in a 1991 Volvo wagon that runs like a dream.  I thought the battery cable had come loose.  I am female so I got frighten and grabbed my cell phone because I didn’t want to get out of the car with out letting someone know what had just happened, I didn’t want to be alone out in the pitch black and my cell phone has a bright light on it.  Before I could open my cell phone a bluish glow started shining through the trees across from the road where I was parked it would be to my left if you were sitting in my car.  At first I thought it was a car coming up behind me and I panicked because my car is read and black and I was frighten that the vehicle behind me would take the curve to fast and run into the back of me but the light wasn’t coming from behind me it was coming from across the street.  I watched as this bluish light rose up from behind a thick patch of trees in front of me.  The object was a blue ball of translucent light, with the middle of the ball slightly darker then the outer part.  It made no sound and it just rose up from out of the wooded area across from the highway where my car stopped.  I couldn’t move, and that was mostly because I was astonished.  The ball rose up sort of slowly but as it got higher it speeded up it didn’t deviate from the direction it was going, which was straight up.  The higher it got the fast it went until it just disappeared after that all I could see was stars.  I sat in my car for a few seconds and I noticed that there wasn’t a sound to be heard at all.  Then I turned the car key which was still in the ignition and the car started right up.  I broke a lot of speed restrictions last night getting home all I wanted to see was my 59 north exit sign heading home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I had not long turned off of FM 457 on to FM 2611 which becomes FM 2004 N.  I am not sure how long I had been driving, when all of a sudden the lights in my car blinked twice and then the car went dead.  I coasted to a stop at the top of a slight hill that was a curve.   I was frightened, for one I am female and was traveling alone and I was out in the middle of no where.  I thought that the reason for my power going out in the car was because my brother had been using my car battery early that day and may not have tightened the battery cables properly and the cables had slipped lose.  I didn’t have a flash light on me so I grabbed my cell phone to call home and let someone know what had happened,  then I decided to get out of the car knowing that my cell phone had a  bright light on it and I was going to check the battery cables.  Before I could open my cell phone to turn it on a bright bluish glow started to light up a thick wooded area across the highway from me.  At first I thought it was another vehicle coming up behind me and I panicked for a moment because my car had stopped at the top of this hill in a curve and if the vehicle coming up took the curve to fast it would hit me.  But I quickly realized that it wasn’t another vehicle I sat still watching the light in the woods get slightly brighter.  The light wasn’t bright like a blue white light bulb, it was more like the light from a giant blue flood light or helicopter flood light and I mean giant and the light didn’t hurt your eyes it wasn’t that sort of light.  I watched it slowly start moving upwards through the trees.  I sat in complete silence and watched it rise up out of the trees until it was above the trees and clearly in the sky with the stars for its back ground.   It was a huge bluish translucent ball of light with the center of the ball much darker then the outer edges.  It made no sound.  The outer edges of the ball seem to vibrate or tremble slightly.  It continuously rose up into the sky at first slowly, but the higher it got the faster it went.  Which was straight up into the sky until it disappeared.

Ten others followed with bright lights. June 25, 2005 -- At around 10:50 pm, we were driving down Division St. and at the intersection with 164th, the driver looked up in the sky and saw a light. She thought that it was a star, but it was too big and bright to be one and the other two people in the car looked as well, and the object seemed to move on its side. When it turned to the side, we saw a disk shape, which had a haze of light around it. The object was wider than the moon but length seemed a lot smaller. The passenger even put on her glasses in disbelief, but she still saw the object. After we all started screaming, we went down until 174th, and right when we took a right, two more objects moved near from the right. One of the incoming objects was bigger than the other, but they were moving towards the big one that was first sighted. Quickly, we went to our house and looked out the window. In the same direction we saw two or three of the same object moving back and forth and also stopping for a few seconds. The objects looked like bright lights (bigger than stars, and brighter) and they were not flashing. They all seemed to be coming from the same direction and going in the same direction (east to west). We figured they could not be planes because they were not flashing, and they were moving so quickly, yet stopping every now and then.  Also, two of them came very close in contact, almost touching each other. After about nine of those objects moved towards the right, we could not see them because of the trees. Later on, after they were gone, we looked towards the sky, and we saw two planes pass by in a 45 min span. We could differentiate between the object and the plane. The plane had a constant shape, was slanted and had the flashing tail lights. We also called the non-emergency line to check for helicopters in the area, and we were told that there was nothing going on. They also gave us the number for the UFO center. If anyone saw something, please speak up. We didn’t believe in UFOs until tonight. Can someone explain whether so many objects, whether they are planes, helicopters, blimps or anything else can do such motions in the sky without colliding.

The flight characteristics appeared jerky or out of focus all along the perimeter. When the object passed between me and some of the stars, the star light was blocked out.

I traded the camera for my binoculars to get a better look. At first the object look like a scientific weather balloon with what appeared to be rigging hanging down from bottom to where a payload would be attached. It was at this point I justified my conclusion when I remembered strange news report earlier in the week of reports of weather balloons over the WTC site in Manhattan. As I continued observation of object with my binoculars, I could see that the rigging and payload at the bottom of object was swinging back and forth at a very violent rate. This seemed odd to me because the sphere did not oscillate nor did the rigging whip, while this was happening. Then just as my site of the object was to be blocked from trees, the bottom of the object turned bright orange that engulf three quarters of the sphere. At this point my view was blocked.

It was a perfectly clear morning, although a little hazy.  While still driving on 166th Street heading east, and approaching the intersection with Indiana Avenue, I saw in the eastern sky, right above the treeline (actually between two bunches of trees in the distance), a dark grey or black rectangular object hanging in the sky, which seemed to be tapered on its lower end.  It was about the size of a dime, if held at arms-length.  Its shape was like a rectangle with its longer measure pointing up and down, but its lower end was more tapered than its top end, as if maybe the lower end was pointed away from me and the top end was pointed towards me, so that the top end appeared bigger and the lower end smaller.  I don't know how far away it was, or how big it was, but I'd estimate, just by the way it looked through the haze, and the fact that it was low on the horizon, that it was only a few miles away.  It most definitely was not a plane.  I suppose it could have been the rectangular underside of a dark green Huey-type army helicopter, but it sure didn't look like that, and I can't think of any reason why a military helicopter would be in that area (there aren't any military bases nearby), and hovering with its nose pointed up at such an angle, so that I could see its entire undercarriage from several miles away.  I think that such an extreme manuever would have put any helicopter at risk of crashing.  Also, Huey-type military helicopters make a very loud ""whump-whump-whump"" sound with their rotor blades that can be heard (and sometimes even felt) from miles away, but I didn't hear any sound.  My first thought was that it might be some kind of strange rectangular advertising balloon, or a cluster of balloons in a rectangular formation, even though I'd never seen a rectangular configuration of balloons before.  And, it just didn't didn't look like any balloons I'd ever seen.  It looked like a solid object.  I actually said aloud to myself, ""What the hell is that?""  I'd never seen anything like that before.  It was very low on the horizon, and I was able to catch only a few glimpses of it between the many trees in that area, as I drove.  When I first saw it on 166th Street, it seemed to be stationary, but after I got onto Indiana Avenue going north, I realized that it must have moved, because I couldn't find it again in the location where I first saw it.  About 3 minutes later (11:03 AM), I got another glimpse of it as I drove east on 154th Street, near the intersection of 154th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue (I drive fast).  At that time, it had definitely moved quite a distance to the northwest, because now it was almost due north of me, behind St. Jude Church, but still several miles away, and low on the horizon.  I then drove further east on 154th Street, trying to find it again.  About 3 minutes later (11:06 AM), I saw it one last time as I drove east on 154th Street (also called Pulaski Road) in Calumet City, near the intersection of 154th Street and Michigan City Road.  It was now directly north of me, way off in the distance behind Dirksen Junior High School, and it now looked like an elongated dark grey or black teardrop, with the larger bulbous end facing down.  It was also obviously much farther away, because it was more obscured by haze at that point, and smaller.  After seeing it in the distance behind Dirksen Junior High School, I turned left onto Calhoun street, going north, attempting to get past all the trees in that area and find it again.  But when I got to a relatively clear area near Calhoun street and Sibley Blvd. a few seconds later, it was gone.  This was definitely the strangest thing I've ever seen in the sky.  I'm still trying to find a logical explanation for what it was.  I thought maybe there was an air show downtown, and that this object might have been some weird aircraft that was part of the show.  But as far as I know, there was no air show going in downtown Chicago on 6/26/2005.  Then I thought, maybe it was some type of large advertising display being pulled by a small plane.  But it was just too big and bulky-looking to be that.  Usually, such aerial advertising displays are of the long, thin banner variety.  Any advertising display which was so big and bulky would have interfered with the aerodynamics of the plane pulling it, and caused the plane to crash.  Then I thought, maybe it was just a strange rectangular balloon.  But it was just going too damned fast to be any type of balloon.  I've seen Goodyear-type balloons in this area before, so I know what they look like, and how slow they travel.  If it was a balloon, it could not have covered such a distance and disppeared from view so quickly.  And, as I mentioned, it definitely was not a plane, and I don't believe that it was a helicopter, either.  I would like to know what the hell this thing was.  It's really bugging me now.  I actually called the non-emergency numbers for both the South Holland and Calumet City police, and asked them if anyone had reported anything strange in the sky at around 11:00 AM, but they both said that nothing had been reported.  That doesn't really surprise me, due to the short length of time it was visible.  But I would like to know if anyone else saw anything strange in the sky that morning, or whether it was just a big, dark colored helicopter or something.",2005-07-05T00:00:00,41.6003,-87.5975

At approximately 9 p.m on 4/29/05 4 friends and I were together, when I spotted a brilliant orange light in the western sky. My first reaction was that it was on fire. It did not appear to be a plane since we could see planes in the vicinity and the features on this seemed very different to airplane lights. This supposedly flaming light kept moving towards us for about a minute when suddenly it split into two. Both of the lights were as large and brilliant as the first one had been but now we could see smoke trails coming from them. This lasted for about 10 or 20 seconds when suddenly a third light appeared, this one was very dim and we only saw it because it seemed to be illuminated by the two other lights. At this point we began thinking it was only one object since with the appearance of the 3rd light, it formed a triangular pattern. This triangle suddenly stopped moving towards us and seemed to take a 45-degree path upwards. The Triangle was clearly visible for about 30 seconds when the two bright lights at the bottom disappeared. The smoke that had been emitted from these two bottom lights also stopped. The smaller dimmer one didn’t seem affected by this and kept rising for maybe a minute or 2 minutes longer. It was passing next to a star when suddenly it exploded. This explosion was not as an airplane’s is supposed to be, there was no fire visible but debris seemed to go in every direction and maybe a second after the original explosion a shockwave appeared. The shockwave was bright blue and it moved very quickly, shortly after this we were able to see debris from the explosion falling, very slowly. We were left speechless and wondering what it was. We checked the news outlets but there seemed to be nothing on this. Surely someone else had to see it.

Then all of the sudden, the ""star"" blew up into two pieces and it looked like a nuclear explosion in the sky. I was thinking ""Oh my god, a meteor is going to hit the earth.""

They did'nt dissapear at all and kept on going in one straight path. It was the freakiest thing that I have ever seen in my life.

I see a light cutting through some fog or something. It looked like a helicopter. It swung the back around but it stayed keeping the light focused. It was light in fog not solid beam or anything.

It was round red with a yellow smaller circle inside of it I mean perfectly round. It looked like is stretched out fast not appeared. It stretched from nowhere. It stayed for like 20 seconds or so and I stared at it. And it was almost behing a big tree in my neighbor across the streets yard. But i could see it well.

Moments later I looked back up and noticed one star acting funny. It seemed to be moving very slowly, and had a glow about it. The glow was very slight, and only appeared behind it in a trianglular shape, as it appears behind meteors and such. I told my friend to look at this point. Seconds later there appeared to be an explosion of some sort, with a funnel shaped cloud resulting. The object still resembled a star at this point, just a small white circle, but moving. A second after this explosion and resulting cloud, the object slowly split into 2 objects. The objects no longer had any smoke trail or halos around it, but kept moving across the sky, very slowly. As the 2 objects moved, they traveled in the same trajectory, while the trailing object moved steadily slower than the first. After what seemed 2 to 3 minutes, the second object became noticeably more distant than the first, and also less bright. As the 2 objects made their way to the other side of the sky, the first object lost its brightness, becoming a fuzzy blur, while the second object faded then reappeared to its previous brightness.

I had just arrived at my home in Plant City, Florida after visiting a friend of mine in Tampa earlier that evening.  I had travelled with the t-tops of my Pontiac TransAm off and was admiring the night sky as I parked the vehicle in my back yard.As I looked toward the constellation Gemini, I did a double take. Two stars appeared to be moving. They were moving slowly from west to east. One was following directly behind the other and and was to the mind's eye a distance of between two fingers making a ""victory"" sign.  In order to rationalize what I was seeing, I wondered if these were two satellites in a linear orbit. I have seen single satellites in orbit both at night and near dusk, but I have never seen one follow the other.  As I continued to watch, the second light moved southward and caught up with the front light. The two lights then continued to proceed eastward directly in formation (seperated by now the distance between the index and little finger) just above Ursa Major and literally faded from view. A northbound commercial airliner at approximately 25,000-35,000 feet agl on a nortwesterly heading was visible in the lower eastern sky. By comparison, these two objects appeared to be much, much higher than the commercial aircraft.  What was the most fascinating thing about this sighting was the almost scary ability of the two craft to blend in with the stars. Unless you spotted them and followed their movement, you wouldn't even think that anything out of the ordinary was occuring in the night sky.  I can still not rationalize what these two objects were, nor how to explain their movements. Did any satelite or space station activity occur over central Florida at that time?

Thinking it was a plane since the Greater Peoria Airport is a mile or so due west of it thought it was a plane.  Just jokeing around with myself I said ""O look a space-ship"" and started laughing.   But then I thought that every plane I had ever seen in that area (and having been on a plane in that area)  They dont fly out of the airport in that direction but fly into the airport in that direction.  As I was coming up to the bridge to cross the Illinois River IT was just there in the sky about a few hundered feet off the ground.  IT wasn't moving at all.  IT had 3 very bright lights on the front that looked straight accross when viewed from the front but at a side ways glance it was a triangle shape with very bright lights that covered the whole back underbelly.  IT also had a red blinking light not as bright as the white lights though under the left side of IT.   The last thing that was very strange was on the back left side there was a huge yellow bag hanging off if IT.   Almost like a hot air ballon but smaller.  U could see no flame in it and it was very defined.   Once I drove across the bridge I turn it the gas station and u can see across the river towards Bartonville IL, and nothing.  I then drove back over the bridge and if was a plane I would of still been able to see it going towards the airport and still nothing.  What was also out of place was that there was alot of traffic in the air from the west and I believe the southwest.

I looked up to see a craft that at first I felt was an airplane. It was quite shiny but I felt that to be reflection from the sun as it was a nice clear afternoon. After watching it for about 30 secs, I was distracted by my dog for a couple seconds and when I looked back, it was gone. It was flying a very straight and rather slow path going E, NE  out over Lake Michigan. First thing that struck me as odd was that it disapeared before it should have judging by the speed. I should have been able to see it still, I only turned away for a matter of a couple seconds. Then I realized that I heard absolutely no engine sound. As I was looking up yet hoping to spot it, a plane did come my way. I heard the engine sound before I ever saw it. And I felt the plane was way higher than the craft I just saw, judging by size anyway. We also have alot of seagulls in our area, but as I watched a few of them fly around, it was obvious there was no wing activity from the craft I saw. It happened very quickly, and I'm not at all sure what I saw, but I figured if someone else saw this then maybe they would post it here.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,43.740465697674416,-87.75469651162791

They were at the same altitude as an aircraft on final approach into Chicago Midway.  The two lights/aircraft came from seperate parts of the sky (one from the west, and the other approached from the southwest).  They met in the air for a brief second before beginning to perform almost perfect barrel roll manuevers (picture the shape of a corkscrew noodle.)   After about 2 full turns, one proceeded to fly away from the other very slowly to the northeast.  While one flew off to the northeast, the other remained in the same location, moving so slowly that you would have to concentrate on it to not mistake it as a star.   Whatever these were, they appeared mainly white in color, with a faint reddish flicker.  These objects made no sound whatsoever.  Even though we were approximately 3 miles from the lights, and not hearing them would make sense, there was an odd silence in the sky, I mean come on, there is ALWAYS a jet flying over this area going to/from the airport producing a sound from the jet, but during this, there was nothing at all.   Also, the intensity level of their lights varied thoughout the sighting, going from extremely dim/nearly blacked out, back to the brightness of say, Saturn.   Given our towns proximity to Midway airport, and being under several flight paths, from 11:30PM to approx. 12:15AM, there were absolutely NO commercial planes in the sky.  We were on fairly high ground, with an excellent view of all horizons, and not a single strobe or red/green beacon in sight for MILES around.   This was an extremely erie event, almost identical to the skies the morning of 9/11 when all commercial planes were grounded by the FAA.

Although you are not allowed to be in the park after hours a few friends of mine liked to play childish games in the dark with flashlights, usually in the fog.

The time was about 11 PM and the night was foggy. A blue blob moved from avove me from the north side of the water to the south in a quick swift motion. It went pretty fast. Becasue it was foggy i didnt see any shape to it just an odd blue color, like looking into a CD or something. But this was not the report I was looking to submit. Two nights ago I was awake and feeling bored, I went out for a walk down the waterfront here in Halifax and sitting on the boardwalk near the Metropolis building, or what I refer to it as, I seen an odd dark spot move across the sky from the dartmouth area to the harbour entrance.

On July 4th, 2004, my girlfriend and I took our dog out for a wake at apx. 8:15 pm, to witness the fireworks that would be going off at apx. 9pm. We did not know where any of the fireworks would actually be, but we just set out for a stroll and catch a glimpse of any festivities around our neighborhood. At apx. 8:30 pm, my girlfriend noticed in the Northeastern sky, 2 giant red oval/circle lights in the sky. It was apx. 2 miles from our location, and maybe a mile or more up altitude wise. Considering the distance and altitude, I guessed that they were apx size wise to be maybe a few hundred yards long and maybe 250 yards wide, they probally were a lot bigger. To describe them I will say they seemed to be fuzzy or had an aura, no solid edges, and it  seemed they might have been somewhat flat, definetely red. They appeared to be somewhat oval/circle like. There were no blinking lights noticable on either objects. They moved very slowly, and traveled side by side, but were independent of each other. One would move a little away from the other, but not far, then seem to come closer back to what would be a formation or safe distance from the other object. The speed as said, was very slow. As they moved towards the south, we would notice on ocassion they would wobble or vibrate, then go back to there normal slow direction heading south. Of course there were many other people out in front of their homes to witness the fireworks set for 9pm. I noticed apx. 10 or more people outside close by to us. I yelled over to the people close by us, and asked ""do you see those lights""?, and they replied that the lights had been up there before we both had arrived, maybe 15 minutes or a half hour (I'm not 100% sure). Of course I did not have my digital camera to record the incident, and asked if any of the neighbors had something to get images of the objects. I asked if someone could call the TV stations or police, etc, but only got the silent treatment. We stayed in our position for apx 30 minutes until they were now overhead us. So that means these objects took almost a half hour to go apx 2 to 3 miles from the original position till they were directly overhead. They exhibited the same manuevers, moving away from each other, but never very far, then to come closier to each other. It looked like when they were overhead us, that at one time they looked like they were going to merge together, but did not. They did vibrate or wobble at intervals, maybe every 5 or 10 minutes, then to return to there slow smooth approach to the south. I could not stand still any longer and we returned home, so I could call the police. Both lights were still up in the sky when we did enter our home. I spoke to an police officier, and he said I was not the only one to call about the lights. That done, I went back outside to see if they were still there. I was planning on bringing my camera to photo, but was not sure if they were still there (I was in a hurry, and also figured they were moving so slow, I would have plenty of time to photo them). One was gone, and directly over our home was the last remaining light/object. And of course, it was going straight up at a much faster speed that they had ever exhibited prior. It continued to go straight up and then out of eyesight range, and was gone for good. I was surprised to not hear of any news or information concerning this sighting on any local news or television stations, etc. This sighting has bothered me since that time, and I just  now (1/15/05) deceided to see if any one else has seen this same event. So I typed in UFO Red Lights over El Cajon CA, on July 4th 2004, in the search engine ""Ask Jeeves"", and came to this website. And so I find now (6 months later) that  there were indeed other wittnesses to this event. I to, like others that have voiced their opinions, think that on New Years Eve, and 4th of July celebrations, is the perfect time to have a cover story for objects or UFO's to occur. Most people would say that it was only fireworks, etc. But it is quite obvious that no know aircraft exhibits such manuevers, shapes or discription.",2005-01-19T00:00:00,32.80505052631579,-116.91756842105264

Never did see exactly what they were looking for. All I know is that the rumble from the b2's engine made the air in my lungs vibrate. Deep and throaty powerful roar. WTAM am radio station even did a special segment on all the frequent sightings in approx. 7/6 to 9/25. And don't even mention contrails. I really think they are trying to obscure our view of what really is going on up there. The most dramatic sighting was on 8/20/04 when I was out catching a smoke. I saw at about 1030 pm est a yellow cloud with a very bright white light in the center of it travelling at about the speed of ISS or just a little faster heading ESE and making about a 15 degree tilt to the South. This thing was big. The size of a basketball with fist outstretched. I really wanted to start screaming but my neighbors were asleep. All that came out was repeated 'oh my God' in a whisper. I cannot even give a good description because it was so anomalous to anything I have ever seen before. It looked like a shape shifter like a yellow aurora with a friggin bright white light right in the center. Between all the heavy contrails and numerous sightings leaves me a little disturbed.

One was a small, steady (not pulsing) pinpoint of light about the size and brightness of a mid- sized star and reddish- orange in color. The other was an extremely bright white light that was about five or six times larger than the orange light and it was very slowly pulsing on and off, but, not in the manner that a strobe light does and it was much more brilliant than any aircraft strobe I have ever seen.  The white light object was not directly behind the orange light, but, was off to the side and rear and obviously on track and/or seeming to be in pursuit of it. They were not close enough together to be mistaken as being a single object (unless it was an immense thing, thousands of feet long) and neither had conventional aircraft style multi- colored lights as are typically seen. They were both only single points of light as described.  After a few seconds, I got my senses and ran to the bedroom window and yelled for my wife to hurry and come see this and I continued to watch and did not lose sight of them. When she made it outside and I showed her, she said, ""What is that?"" and I told her that I didn't know, but, they were definitely not any kind of airplanes or jets. By that time the objects were in the west/southwest sky at about 40 degrees.  Then, just as quickly as it appeared, the white light completely vanished and the orange light continued trekking west until it went out of our sight. Neither seemed to make any manuevers to turn or change altitude. There were no audible sounds and I did not notice any other aircraft in the sky during that time, at least, not in the same viewing area.  Total time I would estimate at 18- 20 seconds.  A side note: About eight or ten minutes later, two large planes at moderate altitude, one in front of the other and with identical lighting flew directly overhead from the east on a due west heading. The lighting on them was not like commercial aircraft, but, they were assuredly conventional aircraft.  I thought the event was definitely spectacular and out of the ordinary.

It came out of the southwest and moved in a northeast direction. It appeared to maintain level flight and constant speed throughout the sighting which lasted approximately 8-10 seconds. It appeared to be the size of a BB at arm's length.  It was first viewed at 90 degrees elevation (overhead) then moved across the sky to the northeast to approximately 15-20 degrees elevation before disappearing behind a treeline. As I observed this sphere, I noticed it was below the clouds which were at 25,000 feet altitude (checked with The Weather Channel immediately after sighting).  I estimate it was not far below the clouds, but can't be certain. There was no noise and no vapor trail.  The object was comparable in apparent speed and flight as that of a satellite when seen at night. The speed seemed very fast, though.  At first, I thought it might be a bird or aircraft.  However, the unwavering direction of flight and rate of speed ruled out these possibilities.  In addition, after the sighting, I was able to observe birds at high elevation and planes below and above the clouds.  All of these were clearly distinguishable for what they were.  I also suspected a balloon, since I determined the wind was SSW at 12 mph (also from the Weather Channel).  However, the speed was simply too fast for a balloon.  If I wasn't looking at that specific portion of the sky at that exact time, I wouldn't have even noticed it.

I just figured it was a plane, however I stood there and watched these lights which appeared low on the horizon. After a couple of minutes they didn't seem to be getting closer, but neither did they appear to be getting further away. Then all of a sudden a single light (about half way between where I was located and where the other lights were)appeared and SHOT DOWN at an angle and then SHOT UP...IN A CHECKMARK FASHION. This particular light lasted only a few seconds. The clustered lights beyond this were still there. I was in shock...I have never seen this happen before! If it was a 'falling star' it certainly wouldn't have shot up again!! I was in awe and shock of what I just witnessed. After a couple moments I got in my truck and headed for work. Within less than 1 minute after leaving (I was heading east), a plane was approaching from behind me and to my north and this plane was flying east. I couldn't see how this could be the same ""clustered lights"" I had seen previously because of the distance it had been during the sighting and it didn't seem possible it could have approaced me that quick.

I opened the balcony window and looked into the clear night's sky.  Within seconds I noticed an amber glowing flying formation floating across the sky heading north west, towards the Direction of the Stanford University Dish.  I immediately called for my wife who watched with me as this formations shape changed ever so slightly from a v-shaped into a straight line, and back into a v shaped formation.  The formation was made of several ""dots"", they could have all been part of 1 craft or perhaps they were each an individual craft.  I immediately ran for my Sony Digital Night Shot video camera and ran outside in the freezing night and attempted to catch the craft on video.  My wife followed as we watched several more formations ""float"" across the sky.  Each formation was made up several ""dots"" and all had a white/amber glow and resemble flocks of flying geese.  There was no noise, and each formation was visible for aproximately 10-15 seconds before going out of view.    Each formation seemed to be followed by a smaller formation right behind it.  I attempted to film and am reviewing the footage now to see if the camera picked up the faint images.  My wife and I have had several sightings of these ""formations"" since November 18, 2001 when we witnessed dozens of the same types of craft fly overhead.  Our most recent sighting was this past september of a pulsating Triangle which changed shape and size 3 times.  Moffett Field / NASA Aames Research Center is aproximately 10 Miles south of our location, and we are only a few miles away from the Stanford University Dish.  They always seem to fly in the same direction.  This wave lasted till aproximately 5:30AM.  FYI: We noticed a couple of shooting stars, most likely from the meteor shower. We also find it interesting that these formations appear during Meteor Showers.  I would like to encourage investigators to look into the November 18, 2001 Mass ""Boomerang Shaped"" Sightings that occured during the Leonid Meteor Showers, and which my wife and I continue to see fly directly over our house.

In reality, looking at least 10 miles to the west, I don't think what I heard (the low-pitch) was what I saw.  However, this thing flew like an insect on speed.  It bobbed and weaved about, extremely rapidly, within a small radius, while travelling wherever it was headed.  I am a logical person, and the fact that the flashes were extremely bright for how far it seemed away and totally random (not timed like a commercial plane light), plus the fact that it was rapidly darting about (again constantly darting within a small area of space- the movement was part of this thing's flight pattern) leads me to believe it was not from this world, at least to my knowledge.  I've heard of hovering, and rapid speeds, but this things was rapid within a short space of area, not darting expansive distances.  It was beyond weird, and I would've woken my family had it not been 4:30 in the morning.  Also, in a big city like Philadelphia (I live in the suburbs 10 miles away), you'd have to expect these things would not want to be seen, hence, they would probably only show themselves at very stategically planned times- such as 4:30 when most people are asleep, or not yet awoken.  I know what I saw, I may've been tired, but I know what I saw.  And what I saw cannot be defined as a space craft from this world, at least to the layperson's knowledge.

On the peak night of the perseid meteor showers, my husband and I were out back shortly before midnight watching the celestial event.   About 30 minutes into our stargazing, I noticed what I thought to be a satellite heading due east.  I then noticed a second point of light, traveling in unison with the first point of light.  As I began to think this was unusual, I noticed the third point of light, forming a triangle.   They were all moving perfectly in unison together.  The area between the points of light was black, but it was definitely a solid mass of some sort as it was covering up clusters of stars.   I saw it turn--it appeared to be entering our galaxy from another dimension given how it turned.  As it banked to head SE, the perception of the triangle shaped craft changed.  We watched it as it headed over our house, disappearing behind a large tree.  We ran out into the street but due to the street lights (or perhaps it just disappeared), we lost it.   According to my husband, the back end appeared to be square.  An amazing AWESOME experience!  It was obviously very large given how far up it was.  It was absolutely silent.  If you were to measure it holding your hand up against the sky, using your fingers, it was a good 6 inches by 3.5"".   What is even more amazing is that we saw the very same shaped craft at the Oregon Coast (Yachats) in the early spring of 2001 (approximation), only this time the craft was much lower and we could see a flash of light in the center of it as a red ball of light flew out.    And as it flew overhead, the streetlights flickered and briefly went out until the craft literally just vanished as it headed due east over the coast range.  You could feel a strange sensation as it went overhead--it was like massive amounts of electricity crawling over your skin--like we were in a giant electrical field.   So to be blessed not just once but twice is totally cool!

It seemed almost to be shiny or have a haze or glow to the sides, but I can't be sure.  It could have been a trick of the lights on the object.  It did not look like any aircraft I had seen before, and I heard no noise at all.

I have worked in the dental field for 18 years as office manager. My husband is a general contractor/mostly new homes. I currently work at home doing his bookkeeping etc. We are both 40 years old. I went out to my deck shortly afer midnight to watch a meteor-shower which had been predicted by our local news weather man. I was interested because he said as many 60 per hr. could be viewed. As I watched I would also see an occasional plane go by, at usual speed,with flashing lights, etc. But then,around 1:00 a white light came flying by which I noticed was going much faster than a plane.  I thought it must be a faster military craft or something that I'm not familiar with.  It continued to fly up into the sky and I noticed it seemed to slow down,and hover, but I thought, ""No, that would be weired"".  It then stopped and looked like it blended into the sky as one of the stars.  I continued to watch it since I had just seen it fly by, I knew it wasn't a star. For the next 3 hours I watched it as the bright,white, light would move in random directions.  It was similar to a search light, but it would move suddently to the left, or right, or up or down, diagnal, and even zig-zag at times. It also seemed to bounce around. I was very intrigued at first but became frightened. My husband was asleep on the couch and I was reluctant to tell him, thinking he would not believe me if he did not see it move,(since it looked like a star). I woke him after watching it about an hour and being certain that this was nothing I could identify.  He came to the window and watched it until he too saw it moving in random directions. We agreed that we didn't know what it was, & that I would look into it in the morning to see if there was some explanation. I continued to watch it through my window until a little after 4:00 a.m. I was afraid to go back outside.  It continued to do the same things but it came in closer at one point, as I focused on the movement of the light I could then see that it was not just ""a light"", it was attached to something much larger. It was shaped like a tubular light bulb and the light was on the end of it. There was a dim light on the other end. What was happening, was that the bright light part would scope out from the larger part and sort of look around in all directions as though it was searching or surveying. Then it would scope back in. (coming out to the left and back in, to the right).  The light would become brighter as it moved around then dimmer when it was stationary. I could clearly see that the ""bouncing"" would happen when it moved a certains ways, then stopped. It reminded me of the way a turtle's head moves around. I don't know what it was, or what it was doing, but I'll never forget it, and would love to know. I will never look at a star the same way again.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,38.4238,-91.0063

I was outside in the early morning watching the end of the meteor shower when I noticed two very unusually bright lights near the mountain behind my house that I at first dismissed as stars.  One was located to the West, the other toward the Northeast.  As the sky grew lighter,  I noticed that the lights had not moved from their positions, but the rest of the stars had.  Upon closer observation, I saw that the light in the Northeast was rising into the sky very very slowly, and was also darting slightly from side to side.  I then noticed a dimmer light a little below it also start to rise in the same manner, but almost immediately moved in an Easterly direction, disappearing shortly afterward.  Then the brighter light seemed to stop rising and just hovered, still making small darts from side to side.  I then started watching the other light to the West and noticed it was moving side to side as well.  This one, however stayed closer to the ground, only rising a bit, then sinking down again and again.  The movements were subtle, but it was undoubtedly moving. I have never heard of or seen any kind of vehilcle that moves like these lights did.  Both the lights I saw made no noise, and flickered at an irregular rate.  Each time they flickered, the color seemed to change slightly, from white to blue, to yellow, and I think red, too, but each color was so bright and blended together it was hard to tell.  I'm also pretty sure they changed shape slightly as they flickered.  The lights stayed like this for a while and all I could do was stare and try to process what I was seeing.  Eventually, the Northeast light seemed to move away East across the valley and I lost sight of it, so I kept watching the one to the West.  Almost as soon as the other light left, this light's movements became more pronounced, rising higher, then sinking, and moving back and forth along the hill.  Each time it sank lower and lower until I lost it behind the hill.  I immediately ran into my house, put on some shoes, and raced out into the desert to find it.  I ran around the hill I saw it disappear behind and saw the light again, still moving in the same manner, but it was moving away over the mountain at a steady pace.  All I could do was watch it zig zag farther and farther away.  It appeared to stop a few times as it did so, but it eventually rounded the side of the mountain and I could no longer see it.  I have always believed in UFOs but never actually thought I would see one.  I was raised in a good family, I get along well with my parents and sisters, and have never been known to lie about something like this.  I am not on drugs and do not have any mental disorders that would cause me to see this.  I still cannot believe what I've seen.  I have no rational explanation.  I feel like I must sound completely crazy since I'm the only person who saw this, especially on the night of a meteor shower.  I am absolutely positive, though, that these lights were not stars or meteors or airplanes or anything I've seen before.  I am absolutely dumbfounded.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

They described perfect distance between each other, flying in a straight path then once they passed right above us seemed to converge into just one light. I realize now that they did not converge but that the craft were leaving the area and moving straight out toward the northern pole-star area. As if they moved away in perspective. It was an awesome sight indeed.  Birds usually don't converge on each other like that, satellites are not visible by reflected light at that hour either.  Were were in awe by what we saw.

I spotted the plane heading south to north at about 3000 feet above ground level. We are about 4100 feet above sea level. As the aircraft passed overhead, I noticed another object moving north to south. I called my wife's attention to the object as well. The object looked metalic (silver and reflective)and resembled the shape of the early flying wings. My best estimation is that the object was 30 - 40 ft across and traveling at an altitude of 15,000 - 20,000 feet. There were no visible lights or strobes. It was higher than the aircraft we spotted, But lower than a jet that left a contrail a few moments before. The object was moving much faster than the jet and made no sound. It continued in a staight line until out of sight (about 30 seconds). We continued looking up while discussing what the object may have been. After about one and a half minutes we noticed two more objects of the same shape and configuration flying in the same direction as the first. They were at about the same altitude and speed. They flew parallel to each other about 800 ft apart. Again no sound and were visible for the same duration. We continued to look in the direction that the objects came from. After about another minute or so another object was spotted. It continued overhead as the others had done. However, at about 30 degrees past directly overhead the object appeared to perform a single roll or steep bank which showed a distict reflective property. The object continued on for a short distance then veered off to the left then veered back to it's original path until out of sight. The prevailing wind at the surface was from the south west.

The first one was around 10.20PM and it was a pattern like a large swept-back wing, without a fuselage. The pattern was symetrical and I thought it looked like an advertising plane with lights on the wing. Only problem was that it was too large and silent. Only the single points of light in formation were visible.  Then around 10.30-10.35 there was a skalene triangle formation of 3 lights flying across the sky in a southward direction. They looked like fighter jets in formation from the apparent speed and distance. The span of the formation was about 1 inch at arms lenth.  There was some other normal air traffic, but on the aircraft you could make out multiple lights as well as the body of the plane. The light formations observed were white and single points.  I then saw a linear formation of 3 lights head north. A little while later a single light head south. That was the last one I saw.  All the lights were too far apart to be a single airplane, although they kept perfect formation. Straight line travel,  no turns that I saw. From the way they faded when heading toward the horizon I would guess they were quite high. Too fast for a satelite, plus this was downtown and a satelite would be too dim. I estimate they were traveling 30 degrees of arc in 5 second when overhead. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD))",2005-04-16T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

I stepped out on my porch to put a mop into the storage area on my balcony,  facing roughly west (I live on the second floor in my apt complex on the south side of Reno)and I happened to look towards the right (which would have been roughly northwest (towards Northern NV/Northern CA).  To my amazement, I saw what appeared to be dozens of very small dots of light flying extremely rapidly around each other, left to right, horizontally and vertically and moving at a high rate of speed.  In front, and at about the same height as me, was the rental office roof, so I approximated the objects to be flying anywhere from 10 to 20 degrees above the horizon.  They were so low, in fact, that if you weren't at least on a second story with a clear view in that direction, you would have missed them altogether. Because they were only pinpoints of light it was very difficult for me to judge their distance... I even jumped in my jeep, camera in hand, and drove to the north end of town to see if I could get a better vantage point to view them, but with no success.   With the conditions, they could have been larger but farther away or smaller and closer, it was difficult for me to tell.  When I arrived back home, I stepped out on my porch and sure enough, they were still there! By this time, it was around 10:45pm.   These objects were seemingly just west of incoming air traffic to Reno/Tahoe airport (the commercial air traffic pattern brings them on the runway most of the time in a north to south direction).  It seems that Reno/Tahoe Intl. should have picked these objects up on radar or possibly sighting(s) by commercial airline pilots.   I sat there and exhausted myself for a rational explanation... they dove horizontally and vertically and almost seemed to be ""playing"", heading toward each other and then dodging at the last minute, like playing chicken or something, if that makes any sense.  I thought they were perhaps birds, but these objects were self luminous and moving extremely fast (depending on the distance it would have been in the hundreds of miles an hour+ range and besides that it was night time!).   I thought of bugs or moths flying around a light source, but there was absolutely no light source that close to me, I even took a short walk to check.  Maybe an atmospheric phenomenon, although there isn't any type of atmospheric anomaly I could think of... it was partly cloudy out, no rain and a slight breeze but no electrical/lightning activity in the area.  I literally stayed up until these objects finally disappeared, which happened not all at once but over the course over an hour.   By 12:45am, there were only a couple left that I could see and then they also disappeared from view.  There were literally dozens of these objects and reminded me of fireflies buzzing around each other when I lived back east.  I checked the local online paper this morning for any unusual reports but nothing at all... which I was slightly disppointed in finding out.   Is there ANYONE else out there that saw this??  I'd really be interested in knowing.  I'm borrowing some binoculars today in case they reappear this evening.  PS... a couple of days ago I submitted another report about a sighting that I had along with my ex-wife about 10 yrs ago back by Angels Camp, CA.  I also submitted a report from August 23rd of 2003 about objects that myself and a girlfriend had spotted over Reno.  Last night included, this is cumulatively the fourth sighting in my life of something that I could not explain away.  I don't mind questions via the phone, I'm intrueged but wary about all of this, so if interested, I'd appreciate it if you could contact me through my email first.

I saw something move in the sky at an extreme speed which caught my attention. It did not travel far. I am unsure of the distance at which I saw it but, it over an hours time did travel farther away. It was to the best of my judgement circular but its possible it may of been of other shape due to the distance. I did notice that it was equipped with lights. Some green or blue, some red, and some white. This led me to believe it was an fighter jet on test or practice mission. It moved slowly in virticle and horizontal directions... Then it would instantly accelerate.... Un realistically, completely intantly travel at sureal speeds. only in a horizontal or close to horizontal direction. It did not travel across the entire sky only short distances before it would stop as fast as it accelerated. It  would slowly return to its gerneral place of origin. It also made manouvers of irratic direction only at slow speeds. I watched it for over an hour before I returned inside. I had wanted to watch it untill it disappeared but I didnt think it was leaving so went in for the night. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Never. I have lived close to airforce bases and to my knowledge there is not a craft on earth that could move as fast as this one did.

I was looking up at the stars because the sky was so clear.  As I was looking a large craft appeared over my head.  It was the shape of an equilateral triangle and was heading NNW.  About 20 degrees to my left of where I was standing.  It made no sound as it traveled.  The craft's bottom was all I could see.  The base color was black with a hint of grey.  In each of the three corners, not the tips, were three circles that gave off a very dim blue-white light.  It was just the outlines of the circles that gave off the light.  The centers of each circle were the same color as the rest of the bottom.  I remember thinking that craft was so geometrical.  The inner circles were also in an equilateral triangle configuration.  That is if the center of each circle were the points of a triangle.  It felt as if the craft was very close, 200-300 feet over my head.  But as there were no clouds to judge distance with I really don't know.  My view to the North of my house is blocked by the town-homes that are directly to the north of my house.  I estimate that I can only see the sky above 50 degrees from the ground.  The craft traveled over my head till I couldn't see it for what I estimate to be 9 seconds.  I never took my eyes off of it, I felt stunned to be watching it.  If I were to held my hand out as far as I can open palmed it would have not have fully covered my view of the triangle.  After it had passed I went inside and told my roommates what I had seen.  I grabbed a pen and paper and noted the time on my microwave:  9:32 PM.  I then grabbed my video camera and went outside to see if it would return and I could capture it on film.  This time I went out the front of my house and into a field that borders my neighborhood to the South.  I did not see the object again.

I was traveling south on I-75 south of gainesville when I noticed a silver object hovering in the distance.  It first looked like a plane with its landing lights on but it wasnt moving at all.  I watched it for about 5 mins while driving and I looked down at my speed and it was gone.  I traveled about 30 miles farther and exited on S.R.40 at silver springs Flordia and went west.  As I approched 80th street I saw it again. I was going to a friends house and when I got out of the car I showed the object to him.  We watched it for about a  few moments and it vanished into thin air.,2005-02-22T00:00:00,29.646086792452827,-82.38107610062893

This was puzzeling to me because the Sun was brightly shining.  I continued to watch and after a few moments it began slowing moving westward very slowly, at this point, I became bewildered and went to the pool attendent, an aquaintance, and asked him to confirm the sighting which he did.  Then others at the pool became engaged as we observed the object moving at varialble speeds but always slowly as it made a lazy arc to the north east.  We watched it maybe for 7-10 minutes.   We were in the midst of high rises and a cloud passed by and afterward it was gone.  We all were perplexed and I am a strong sceptic but I have no rational explanation for this and neither did any of the others who saw it.  I was somewhat entralled but others were somewhat nonchalant about it which astonished me almost as much as the sighting.    The next night I had dreams of UFOs so I guess it had an impact on my mind.  I had to share this with others.  I am so amazed and in a way grateful for this experience, to witness the unknown.",2005-02-22T00:00:00,,

My father was also vacationing with us.  It was during the last week of August, right before Labor Day weekend.  One night, after putting our son to bed, about 10:00pm, I walked out onto the balcony and looked out over the gulf waters.  In the sky, there were two round lights.  They were white & amber colored, kind of like far away headlights.  As a matter of fact, that's exactly what I thought they were...plane headlights, really close ones.  But they weren't getting any closer.  They weren't moving at all.  I called my dad and husband out to the balcony to take a look, but then they were gone.  They just disappeared in the exact same spot they had appeared in.  All the while, there were no sounds except the tiny waves that make it into the gulf. All of this transpired in 45-60 seconds.  About 60 seconds went by, and  right after my dad & husband made it onto the balcony, the lights re-appeared in the exact same spot.  At first just the two of them came back.  Then, as my dad, husband and I stood looking at these two lights, another one appeared to the right and just slightly above the others.  Then another one to the right and slightly above that one.  And then another.  So, now, there were five lights with the first two being side-by-side and the other three extending up & out to the right in a diagonal line.  Still, I could hear no sound except the calm ocean.  After watching these lights appear and stay lit for about 40 seconds, I turned to run inside and get my camera.  As I went through the sliding glass door, I looked behind me, afraid that the lights would be gone.  Just as I turned and looked at them, they faded to black and I could no longer see them.  I did not get a picture.  We sat on the balcony for a few more hours, until about 12:00 midnight.  We sat out there talking about what we had seen and looking out over the gulf, waiting for the lights to come back, but they never did.  Now, I'm not sure what we really saw out there.  I know that Eglin AFB is really close to this area.  Maybe the lights had to do with that.  Also, maybe there was a ship way out there in the gulf that we couldn't see, with air craft taking off from it.  I guess maybe, we'll never know.  However, if anyone out there knows what it could have been, or has seen something similar, any information would be greatly appreciated.",2005-02-08T00:00:00,30.3979835443038,-86.4573

I then looked through my moonroof and there was one directly above me.  It appeared to follow along right above my car as I drove down the hwy.  The 10 in teh circle then began to quickly dart about and then began to all quickly move outwards and then disappeared over the horizon.  I looked up at the one above me and it moved straight up into the air slowly and eventually disappeared into the clouds above. The spheres themselves were perfect in shape and did not blink of flash or pulsate.  Their light was solid and very bright.  They stayed perfectly still while they were at rest and darted around around like no plane or helicopter I have ever seen.  I rolled down my window to listen for the sound of a helicopter or plane, but there was only silence.  My wife is witness to this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
