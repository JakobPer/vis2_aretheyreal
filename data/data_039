We spotted them to the North and they moved South, SouthEast. They moved a bit faster than a satellite would. We saw them for about 20 seconds.  Some personal observations:  They certainly could have been satellites, but I know of no satellites that fly in formation (again, both my wife and I notice specifically that they moved together without the slightest separation, at least that can be seen with the nake eye.)  Though its hard to explain, you could see that the objects were a great distance just by the look of the lights.

More than anything, I would like to know if there is a reasonable explanation. If there is someone who knows what this might be, or if this a common occurance.

Since I have seen real UFO sphere clusters before, this cluster was suspicious and I pulled over to watch them. There  was also  a single engine plane circling the city at about the same altitude as the spheres  and orbiting around the spheres path. I don't know if the pilot saw the spheres and intended to circle them or was some kind of  ground  traffic  news  plane? I could not identify the plane since I was more interested in the spheres. It circled several times. They were coming from  the  south  just  over the 'West Hills' area at an altitude  of about  1000' to 1500'  and traveling at a constant speed and holding a constant altitude.  There was a large cumulus cloud directly over them with a base of about 3000' that should have had enough thermal power to pull them straight up --if balloons. There were 2 to 3 of each color of  red,yellow, black and I think blue.They appeared to be 1foot to no more than 2feet in diameter?  There was some movement  of the spheres in the cluster. Now comes the best part. As they  were at  their closest point to me (I had a strong feeling at this point that they were not balloons) one of the black spheres separated and came straight down at a speed  almost  like a rock falling and came down somewhere close to the Clay Towers appartment building -- one block down from me. At this point they went out of view and I moved  to another location to watch as they continued over the city out of view. I went over to where the black sphere came down but could not see it anywhere. Balloons cannot do this. I am an experienced  sky watcher and pilot. I have seen this phen- omena many times in other locations but I was quite surprised to see it over busy downtown buildings very low. This event proves to me that it is now almost impossible for most viewers to tell the difference  between balloons and real (possibly alien) UFOs.  If seen, you must watch them constantly to be able to catch the impossible--  as we know it.

Pictures taken... I crested a highway hill on a trip b/w Austin and Houston.  As I crested the hill, I noticed 4 cars stopped on the side of the highway, people out of their cars, staring into a field to the left of the highway.   I noticed two lights in this field moving quickly, sporadically.  I stopped my car and got out.  I recorded the following events on my CELL PHONE CAMERA.  I have 8 pictures of the event.   There were two lights/crafts.  They would ""float"" above the ground about 10 feet, and just kind of jerk back and forth, as if ""hound dogging"" above the ground.  Then, one craft shot directly up and became bright pink.  The other craft turned bright white and shot to the right and behind a hill.  They both came back together to the original area, and their light was dimmed.   Then one of the craft started to glow orange. and shot up about 50 feet, then back to the ground, and the two just circled a bit.   Then one turned a bright green and started this zig zag movement, and the other one turned blue and shot to the right.  They traded places in the sky, and one of the pictures I recorded shows a distinct blue saucer shape.   They then came together, turned a bright pale yellow, and shot up straight in the air.  They were gone.   All of the witnesses shared their experiences before departing, changed forever.  We believe we witnessed a true encounter.   When we went to leave, we had no idea that we had spent 21 minutes observing this phenom.  It was as if time had not passed in outselves.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

Looking with binoculars, it appeared as a bright light, changing colors routinely from red, blue, white and occasionally all white, and then back to red, blue and white.  My husband came out to view it at my request at this point.  He noticed that it also appeared to be changing shape and size.  When it changed size to smaller, the lights tended to converge.  The object at first appeared to remain stationary in the sky (while still changing size).

I thought the light was a glare at first, allowing it to move past my vision, but quickly followed it some 3/4 mile North and parallel with the hill and road I was on (Route 403 between Davisville and Tire Hill.   The light appeared to follow the elevation of the ground uniformly, some 30 feet of so off the ground.  What proved to me that it wasn't a glare or something explainable, is that it made a ""U"" turn slightly disappearing into a valley area, so it was very distinct in it's travel pattern.   The light ""flew"" back past me now heading back South (again about 2/3 the distance to the hill), and traveled up over another hill into Davidsville, but at that point seemed to fly a higher trajectory, because I could see it partially in sight and then out of sight as it undulated South and from its original trajectory.   It then appeared to turn West towards Thomas Mills, where I then lost sight of it.   I then kept walking South on Route 403, and about 200 feet from where I first say the sighting, staring off towards Thomas Mills way, I noticed over Thomas Mills area, what appeared to be a plume of circular smoke or vapor that went ""upward"".  This ""upward"" plume of smoke or vapor appeared strange to me.  I would have expected it to go ""downward"".   That was the extent of my sighting.   And the amazing timing of this sighting from first sight to last sight, over some 4 miles was an amazing 7 or 8 ""seconds"".  Why this timing sticks in my mind is that it was traveling so fast and so precise, that I actually counted the seconds.  I don't know of anything that can go that fast.  And it made no sound.   There was a body that was somewhat visable, but I was fixed on the light.  The body of this UFO was not clear in my mind.  As much as I wanted to form a shape, I couldn't.

Since then I have had various sightings through the years in which I observed something moving at appartently thousands of miles an hour.  They would leave a light trail behind them and seemed jerky in their movements.  Sometimes they would make a sharp 90 degree turn without any arc at all.  One very clear sighting was a object bright green in color and at first looke like a meteor coming down. This happened here in Coolidge AZ in the late 80's.  Something wasnt right so I called my wife to come outside.  Before she arrived the craft seemed to flip sharply then the end flared bright red and it shot straight up into the sky.  Another and this time documented sighting was in Spring Arbor MI  There were two witnesses but they spoofed me.   The next day it was on the news in which a UFO had been tracked by police for over 200 miles. This happened in the summer of I believe 1973 or 1974.   I also have vivid memories of a wing shaped object hovering over a house in Michigan in the later 60's.  I have also observed the mysterious lights here in Arizona and late saw where someone was shooting flares.  These lights were nothing like flares and had their own qualities that set them apart.  They had a clarity about them like no lights I had seen.  They did not flicker or seem to float.  A flare with flicker from near to black to bright and then eventually burn out.

Since it was dusk what we were watching was actually the black silhouette outlined in the brighter evening sky, rather than seeing the clear surface of the object.   The object spun slowly and moved back and forth in a straight line while traversing in a searching manner away from us.  It had already passed over our house and was moving away westward.   As we watched it became apparent there were round port holes all around it every 4-5 feet or so.  They appeared to be about 12-14 inches in diameter.  It seemed like every other one was red or yellowish-white.  The object was about 60 feet in diameter and about 6 feet thick and rotating slowly as it slowly came back east toward our back yard. Its height was no more than 120-140 feet off the ground (perhaps as low as 100 feet).  I remember thinking I could hit it with a rock.  It did not wobble on its axis as a balloon might but was perfectly controlled like a wheel spinning on an axle.  It moved very slowly (perhaps 5 mph) and came right up to the SW corner of our yard where it paused (about 60 feet away and 100 feet high) before it slowly started reversing direction to head back across the golf course toward the south side of Green Acres Terrace Circle which was directly west across the golf course from our house.   When it got over to the circle on Green Acres Terrace it reversed again and came back toward us but only came back until it was about 100 yards away this time.  When it reversed this time it went farther away and then came back toward us again but did not get as close as the previous time.  I asked my father, ""Dad, what is that?"" He said, ""I don't know."" I knew what it was; a UFO.   I told my brother to go inside and get my Polaroid camera. He said, ""YOU go get it!""  The object seemed to be almost swinging back and forth as it moved in a kind of searching pattern back and forth across the golf course moving further away with each pass until it was gone within 15-20 minutes.  It was rotating slowly the whole time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2005-10-20T00:00:00,,

I was a student at Kent State University and on my way to a late class, but it was still quite light outside since it was summer, so our view was clear.  I was walking across an open field on a well traveled path between buildings.  There were between 5-7 other people on the path.   Someone pointed to the sky and we all saw a large metalic disc.  I knew we were all seeing the same thing because we were verifying what we were seeing at the time.  It was very slow moving, clearing the treetops but not extremely high in the sky and easy to view.  It had a row of what could be decribed as ""windows"" or a variation across the middle.  I doubt they were windows, but I describe it this way to try to explain a different looking type of material around the middle area.  It moved silently and finally out of sight in about a 3 - 4 minutes period of time. We all just stood there transfixed, but verifying the details for eath other.  I remember looking at my watch to verify the time.  After it was out of sight, I continued toward my class and I remember saying to another person walking beside me...""You know, no one will ever believe us when we talk about this... and no one ever has.""    I remember these details well, as I wrote them all down at the time later that evening and drew a picture of the craft in a journal which I had for many years but have since lost. I only regret I did not get anyone else's address or name.  At the time I thought, well this will all be clear to everyone soon... now it is almost 30 years later.  I guess I miscalculated...

I`ve tried to tell my story and all i got was my letters returned to me or LAUGHS!  Here we go !  The year was 1973 or 1974 in the fall.  I live in Cotton Country and was a (ginner) for about 10 years.  A co-worker asked me to pick him up because he had no way to work that morning (we worked from 7am to 7pm). So the time was between 6am and 6:30am, as close to dawn as you can get at that time of the year.  When i pulled up to his house, I killed my engine and got out.  That's when it appeared, just behind the fencerow, maybe 300 to 400 yards behind his house!!!!!   I yelled for him to come outside and look---he , his mother and a brother came outside and we watched.  The craft was huge and had lights around the  outside edge of it that was different colors  and the colors rotated.  IT MADE NO SOUND as it lifted off but it did zig-zag as it ascended.   We were so close to it that it didnt take long to be directly under it and  when we lost contact with the outside windows all we could see was the bottom of the craft, which changed colors with the altitude----it changed several times and the last was a (lime green) and then it was gone.  The mother told me that she had a full camera in the house but could not think of it.  We went to work and when i got off my shift and started home.  I  saw the lime green light again just south of the gin.  Turned around and went back to show my dad.  By the time i got him to the south door, it was gone and never have seen it again.  I tried to tell people of what i had seen and all it caused was trouble so i gave it up---BUT---i have 4 witnesses and WE all believe and always will.   The next cotton year , the man that farmed the land behind the house, said that there was a large place in the field that would not grow cotton (???????)  PS: MY grandmother, who is dead now, saw a strange silver cloud that zig-zaged straight up from the right direction and I had told her nothing___she said that it was there for several hours and has never seen nothing like it before!

I saw something hovering over the swamp, it was tremendous and had bight lights all over and around the top of a hugh disc, rotating around and around.   I don't remembe a lot after that but I think I stopped the car and got out to go and look at the object.  I must have been there about 2 or 3 hours.  I think the object was glass or opaque in color and I remember that I was not afraid as many people say they are.  I don't remember a lot more and then I was back in my car and it was really dark about 6 or 7pm.  I had lost about two or three hours.   I did not think much of it at that time and went home.  I did not feel drained, tired confused or anything.  I did not feel threatened either. We had our daughter and called her laughingly our little alien child.   I was alone so there were no witnesses that I know of concerning this object.  I think the object had an ability of letting us see it and then some sort of way of not being seen.  This was the only time I ever saw this thing.   Thirty years later we took some photos of the little house we owned out on the island and walmart developed them.   A disc like object was seen in the left corner of the house.   I questioned Walmart and they said it was not any of their equipment, and they asked if my car window was down, and yes it was.  I still have the photograph.   I am a retired nurse and also have a background in sociology.   This was a strange event and I rarely talk about it, and I do not laugh at those saying they have had encounters.  ((name deleted))",2005-10-20T00:00:00,,

It was not there.  We then went to a lake to go parking.  While we were parked, in complete darkness, I noticed that it was light in the truck.  We looked out the back window and saw two small craft, I would say the size of 3 cadillacs.  They were oval and dark except for amber lights around the base.  The lights were very soft but iluminated the area well.  They were about 30 feet in the air hoovering.  This went on for about 10 minutes. Then both of them slowly went over the truck to the road.  At that time one appeared to land in a field and the other went down the road and it just speed up and disappeared.  Although speed up is not a correct description.  It zipped, zoomed or what ever out of sightand left a trail of light.  It was there one moment and we were watching it, then in a second it was gone.  We went back to the field where the other landed and shined our lights in the direction where it should have been.  It was not there.

I did't think much of this initially because I was about a mile and a-half from the power plant and they release steam from time to time and it sounded like that. But, unusually, this time it was getting louder then louder until I realized something was very wrong, it seemed to be coming from all around me out of the darkness. I looked all around me but could only see a few trees dimly lit by the small fire, then I looked up. All the leaves were off of the trees and I could clearly see a circular craft drifting right above me over the tree tops in a Northerly direction. It appeared to be about a hundred feet above the tree tops. It had a dome structure on the bottom with a  cross structure as if for support with four green lights around the dome's edge.  There were alternating white and red lights around the outer edge of the craft. It may have had a slight glow to it. The tree tops did'nt move and it glided along then started to curve around to the West and went over a nearby gravel pit. I ran through the woods trying not to run into trees or trip in the dark.  I crossed a couple fields and fence lines until I came to the edge of the gravel pit where I could look down over it. I did'nt see the craft and don't know where it went.

Then one of them proceeded to make movement towards the other ones, until they were all perfectly lined up.

On Sunday evening, Jan. 29, 2006, I and two other members of the volunteer fire dept. left our station at approximately 1835, enroute to the funeral home in Clifton Forge, VA. for visitation for a past member of the fire dept. We were in the dept's six passenger pick-up truck, I was riding in the front passenger seat, another member was driving, and the third member was in the right rear passenger seat.  The fire station fronts onto Third St.(Norhtwest), and as we left, we turned right onto Third St.(Northeast), and proceeded approximately 100 feet to the corner of Third St. and Railroad Av. At the corner, we turned right onto Railroad Av. (Southeast). As we got on Railroad Av., I noticed two aircraft with lights, travelling East at high altitude. It is common to see aircraft overhead here, most at high altitude. Military training flights are also common, at all altitudes.  As I watched the planes get farther away, I noticed a third light, approaching from the Southeast, and much lower in altitude. I at first thought that this was a military plane, with a light on or under the nose, there were no running lights or other lights visible. As we continued on Railroad Av.(Southeast) I could see lights from the Parker-Hannifin plant buildings on Tannery Road, as well as the lights on the plant's elevated water tank. I could also see the outlines of the mountins nearby.  I continued to watch the approaching light, it did not cast a beam like a spot light or head lights on a vehicle.  It appeared to be round, and did not change in color or intensity.  The light continued in a straight line toward the Parker-Hannifin plant, and because the elevated water tank was plainly visible, I estimate it to have been at an altitude of 1000 feet or less.  We were travelling on Railroad Av. at about 5 MPH, we had passed the corner of Fourth St. and were about halfway to the corner at Fifth St. where we would make a right turn.  At this point, I said out loud, ""What the Hell is that?""  The driver asked what I was talking about, and put his foot on the brake, I pointed into the windshield and said ""That light"".  As we got to the corner of Railroad Av. and Fourth St. the driver stopped, and I jumped out to see if I could hear plane engines.  Just as I got out of the truck, the light appeared to grow in diameter and intensity.  Before the driver and rear passenger could get out of the truck, the light just vanished, just like you flip off a light switch, it just was not there anymore.  We continued to stand in the street by the truck for acouple of minutes, looking for the light, a car came up Railroad Av. stopped and asked what we were looking at, when I told him that I did not know, both him and his passenger got out to look, but whatever it was, was gone.  There were aircraft seen at this time, headed West, and East, all at high altitudes   I am convinced that this was not a plane or helicopter.  As I said earlier, you can see aircraft over the town, day and night when the skies are clear, and hear them when it is overcast.  That evening, the sky was clear, with very few high, thin clouds, the stars were bright.  The temperature was in the mid thirties and there was no noticible wind.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,,

Once we both were outside, we looked up and noticed they were no moving to the right of the little dipper, at an unreal rate of speed, I mean like 10x faster than an airplane would, so he called up his friend Nate C. who then went outside to see what was going on. The objects then stopped moving and sort of hovered there for awhile, a few minutes pasted and all the sudden both started to drop, what looked like sparks, out of the bottom. Then a few more appeared out of no where and also started to drop out the mysterious sparks.  There were now 6 of the objects flying around in every direction, up, down, diagonal. I then called up my friend Adam B. and told him to go outside, He saw it also, we were tripping out, we couldn't believe what was going on, after awhile they each, one by one, slowly disappeared.

We managed to get one or two close ups on video, but the quality was not the best. The ridge above the house, about 1 1/2 miles to the north began to emit a daylike glow. Most of the objects were no longer visible but the humming sound had become almost deafening. Suddenly the wind began to rip at the house, out of the north. the lights pulsated on the horizen and clouds of smoke appeared to rise up slowly from each light, there were about 6 lit up areas. I picked up the phone to call someone, but the line wasnt working , it was buzzing like it does when the tv has no channel on it. We leaned out the window to see better, and listen. We heard the most erie howl, not like any coyote we had ever heard, almost a siren, but not as perfect. They came from each lit up hilltop. They were followed by a loud bloodcurdling deep scream, definatly not human. It filled the entire valley, and what followed was odd for mid winter in canada, a warm strong breeze came from the north, almost hot, and it smelled like burning plastic, or somthing close to that. The sensor light outside kept coming on, and we heard crashing and banging against the house, scratching through the walls on every side. Neither one of us saw anything for sure but we both thought we saw a tall very pale figure, that had a humanlike shape, and glowing eyes, running across the driveway. Petrified, we shut ourselves in and listened intently. We looked out the window for a bit longer to see the smoke puff up from the lit up hilltops again. and than tiny blue lights like we had seen earlier, shot up qickly from them to an instant hover, and than began getting smaller as the flew higher into the sky, they remained visible for a long time.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,50.9513,-114.5603

A couple years ago (April 2002?), I reported strange sightings in Lake Havasu City, AZ.  I wrote about a bright amber light that ""pulsed"" and released flare-like objects.  Ever since I saw these objects (on several occasions) I was obsessed with finding out what they were.  Today, I was looking through old NUFORC reports. There were several similiar reports coming out of Burbank, CA.  NUFORC stated the police officers in that area reported that the objects people were seeing were not UFOs, but mini home-made hot air balloons with some sort of pyrotechnic devices.  After doing some online searching, I learned about ""Fire Balloons"" & found these two sites:  http://php.indiana.edu/%7Elrobins/candbal.htm (explains how a fire-balloon can let off sparks or bright flashes of light among other things)  http://www.overflite.com/index.html   This could very well be what I saw on in Lake Havasu City, AZ.  However, during the very last sighting of these objects I had, the objects faded to a pin-point of light and flew over the mountains. I know this could have been an illusion and it could have been me looking at the light burning out and it just *appeared* to be flying away from me.  Anyway, as dissapointed as I am,  I just thought I would pass this along. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

She saw blue flashes outside and heard muffled booms. She said she saw three separate blue lights, one after another, about the size of two basketballs.

After 20 years of airshows and constantly watching every plane flying overhead, and watching too much of Discovery Wings on the tv I have immense understanding of what type of craft are in our skies, and this wasn't one of them.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,,

I live very near to the ocean and have a clean view of the night sky. I was just leaving my house and out over the ocean, I saw a very bright ""star"" like object in the sky. It was enormous compared to the other visible stars in the sky. At that monment, I noticed other aircraft in the sky around this object. I thought it may be military planes given the fact that they seemed small and flew very quickly. One of these aircraft flew up to the object and shined what looked like a spotlight at it. Then it flew away from the object still shining the light as it headed south. This aircraft, I noted, had ONLY 3 red lights and may be a hint as to what type of plane it was. There were about 4 other planes flying to and away from this object that I could see. I took some photographs with a film camera and have yet to see what comes out. There was also what looked like a lunar eclipse (although I've never actually seen one before) It was just very eerie. My husband and one of my children also witnessed this. As far as altitude, I would guess that it was about 20,000 feet in the air. And would have been over the atlantic in the bayshore area between NJ and staten Island.

The building is placed on high ground so you get a great view of Long Island, from the airports to hospitals to the beach were I had my sighting.  I always go up there to smoke my cigarettes, I looked toward Robert Moses Beach too look at the lighthouse you can see it well at night.  Just a little to the right, right above the horizon i notice these 5 bright redish orange colored lights staying still in the sky but they all would fade away and re appear in a new location but all in the same general area never moving far from each other.  When the lights were visible they never moved they stood still and only faded away and faded back in a new location.   At this point I called my girl friends father to tell him what I was seeing becuase he has had sightings himself.  For about 5 mintues the lights just kept doing the fading thing then i noticed only 4 lights were visible the 5th never came back from fading out.  The 4 lights stopped fading away and stood still but in 2 groups of 2.  Two of them sat still right next to each other and the other 2 did too but farther from the other two.  They stayed like this for about 2-3 mintues then started the random fade thing once more.  As they did this the 4th didnt come back then the 3rd and so on till there was 1 light left fading away and coming back then it was gone.  It faded and never came back.  I kept looking at the sky but none came back.   I went back down to the lobby and wrote it all down as I saw it.  I went back up 15 minutes later to see if I would see anything again, they were still gone but instead there were many airplanes patroling the same exact area of the sky about 8-9 planes.  I've been up there countless times and have never once seen anything like that up there or in my life.  I've see airplanes take off from the airport at the same spot many times and these were no airplanes.  I've also never seen airplanes in a group like that in that area which also makes me think they weren't commerical passenger planes but perhaps military, investigating what I had just seen.  These lights were bigger then the flashing lights of an airplane.  You can also make out each individual light, these lights were mixed together an orange red color and they never blinked like an airplane but they twinkled like stars do.

Davidson At around 6:45 PM on December 3, 2005, a friend and I were outside on our back deck looking to the crystal clear night sky facing west when we saw two large black triangle shaped objects move slowly and at a low altitude (500-1000 feet) directly over our house from the north west Mt. Davidson area to the south east.  We live in San Francisco on the south east side of Mt. Davidson at the cross street of Terasita and Los Palmos in Miraloma Park.  The two distinct objects that we observed were flying in side by side formation and appeared to moving as one.  Both craft were perfect equilateral triangles with pulsating dim star like lights on each tip of the two triangles, six lights in total.  These were most definitely two solid black large triangle shaped objects which from underneath appeared to be much darker than the night sky as they passed in front other stars in the night sky and were darker than they night sky with no moon.  The objects were very well cloaked (best way to describe it) against the background of the night sky and could have easily been mistaken as constellations but they were moving slowly which is what caught our attention.  The entire sighting lasted for approximately 30-45 seconds.  The objects did not appear to change speed, direction or altitude and moved slowly together overhead until they dimmed out of sight near the south side San Francisco crossing over 280 onto the north west of the San Bruno mountain range.   I have been an amateur astronomer for over twenty five years now and I can say with conviction that these were definitely Not planes, satellites, blimps, helicopters, the International Space Station, meteorites or fire balls.  They were two solid triangle shaped objects that move in perfect formation together and made absolutely no noise as traveled directly over head.  The two craft were identical in size and were significantly larger than a 747.  The weather conditions in San Francisco last night crystal clear and ideal for sky watching.  The crescent moon had also just dropped below the south western horizon about 15 minutes prior before we witnessed this once in a life time sighting.  We were both truly shocked by what we had just seen to the extent that we felt it necessary to call into two local TV stations (CBS 5 & KGO 7) to report what we witnessed.  I am in my late thirties and the other person in their earlyy 40s.  We both have always been rather skeptical of alien spacecraft visiting Earth simply given the vast distances between stars and the time required to travel such a distance without bending space/time.  But having just what we say with our own two eyes list night, we can now say with absolute conviction that they were highly advanced craft that ones gut feeling tells them to be 'other worldly'.  Nither of us had been drinking nor were we in any other altered mental state of consciousness at the time of the sighting.  If anyone else saw any strange objects lights in the Bay Area night sky last night please feel free to contact me.  I consider this experience one of the most amazing events of my lifetime that I cannot refute.  Weather the objects were deeply classified military X-Project space craft or Alien cannot be proven (yet) but the objects had an eerie feeling to them in the way that they moved together and at the angle the triangles were positioned in flight.  The profound impact of this event will forever change how I look at humanity and that such highly advanced technology does exists regardless of its origin.  I have not heard anyone else reporting what we saw last night in the media or on the internet but hopefully other people in the Bay Area witnessed the same event.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

When I said this is no plane, a red light flashed in my face. It disorientated me for a few seconds. It seemed like a sign telling me they saw me. As It continue westward, it turned now heading southbound. It seemed it picked up speed and I didn't see it anymore.  I was 5 mintues away from home. When I got home my mom was making something to eat. I went right to the mirror to see if there was anything on my face because I felt a burning sensation. I even asked my mom if she noticed anything on my face. She said no. I went to my parents bedroom where my dad was and told him, dad you are not going to believe what I saw. He said to me that he heard it pass by. Before telling him anything. My dad said he heard a hover/murmur noise. My dad said he even look out his bedroom window to see what it was, but he didn't see anything just the noise.  Well, this is my story. It is a bit lenghtly, but this is my experience what happened.",2006-03-11T00:00:00,41.8799124159215,-87.66801795521089

I looked out at the beautiful day as we always did from this beach front property, not a cloud in the sky. As I was taking in our surroundings I looked almost straight up following a hawk that lived in the tree next to our deck, as I did I saw this dot in the sky I stopped for about 30 to 40 seconds which made my co-worker ask what I was looking at and I said to him ""can you see that up there""? He replied yeah that little spot and I said something to the affect that ""wow it isn't moving at all"" and he agreed. We kept an eye on it as time went by and told others as they came into our area everyone noticed it and that's when things began to get strange because we all agreed it was something big but it was so far up that we could not make it out. Not one of us wanted to blurt out the dreaded UFO phrase but I had to because this thing was bugging me now. We would go back to work for a while and stop to look up and it stayed there. Finally luch time arrived and we all took a look as we made the lunch list and at almost noon time to the second this thing just began to drop straight down and it looked round and silver before we noticed that it headed east at a clip unreconisable to me, it moved so fast as we all watched it leave. The five of us just amazed at this point agreed we had just witnessed a UFO and knowing there wasn't a thing we could do about it we continued our work and told everyone on the island what we had seen.

Me and my friend were really bored on a dark summer night in RVC, NY.  We were waiting for some other people to show up, and we started pulling stuff to do out of his garage.  We found a hoolahoop, and being the teenagers that were were (and still are) we really didn't use it for it's purpose.  We stood in the middle of the dead-end in front of his house and threw the hoolahoop as high as we could.  We were alternating turns, and eventually it was his turn.  He threw the hoolahoop up into the dark sky, and it came dropping back to the ground.  The thing was, my friend didn't watch the hoolahoop drop...in fact, he was still looking in the sky as the hoolahoop came a couple yards away from landing on him.  He asked, ""What is that?""  I didn't know what he was talking about, so I looked DIRECTLY above where we were standing.  At first, I thought I saw what appeared to be white toilet paper flying high in the sky.  I'm not too sure if I saw this correctly or not, but I THINK it may have changed shape/form.  Maybe my eyes were still adjusting, but when I looked harder it became apparent that I was seeing a big white ""V"".  As I looked harder, I saw the rest of the craft...and it was a large black triangle with a white ""V""-shaped stripe on the front of it.  It looked almost like a GIANT hang-glider.  The only problem with that solution is that Long Island is flat.  There is no hang-gliding here and there is no possible way to jump off any mountain or cliffs simply because there are none of that size.  It appeared to be roughly the length of a professional hockey rink, and it made absolutely no noise.  It was traveling from somewhere above my friend's house towards the other side of the street in a slow straight line.  My friend was like ""It's a UFO, It's a UFO!""  He ran inside to get his mother to come out and see it and he told me to make sure to watch where it goes.  It continued to cross for about two minutes before I eventually lost sight of it in the street light.  The object had no lights, and made no sound what-so-ever.

The ""place"" is really just a highway scenic overlook on a high ridgeline.  It is very dark, and overlooks the city lights of Wimberly about 15 miles distant.  My friend and myself were completely sober, and were looking for a ""romantic"" experience subsequent to a night of talking. I am a huge aviation enthusiast, and ex military. I was hoping to see the usual things one might see at 4 AM such as satelites, the space station, meteors, venus, etc.  We noticed moving from West to East at an altitude appearing equal to satalites a formation of what appeared to be 3 ""satalites"" in a loose, but not equilateral triangle formation. Stars were visible between the formation, so it was not one craft, but three. The objects were visible as unblinking, dim lights and moved in a constant direction at a constant speed. The speed was consistent with other satalites I've seen. The formation was spaced about 1.5 inches apart at arms length. (Assuming low earth orbit) the triangle formation would have covered an area of at least one square mile. The ojects passed directly overhead, and dissapeared off to the East, as they grew too dim to see against the stars. The girl had an extreme reaction to this sighting and ran back to the car, crying. I told her it was probably just three satalites in formation, to calm here down. There was no sound with this sighting. I am color blinde, so the there was no color to report. Everything was consistent with three satalites flying in a loose triangle formation, however satalites do not fly in formation. The entire sighting lasted about 3 minutes, but has stuck with me to this day. I was prompted to post it when reading another identical sighting in Texas on your sight which I have included for a reference. Just a side note... I recently met a Sr. Officer with the Air Force Space Warfare Command and he assured me that there were ""OTHER THINGS"" in our inventory in addition to spy satalites. Perhaps these were Air Force Craft of some sort.

I am an amateur astronomer, but I usually view the sky in the early evening to about midnight. The milky way is just to the west of my house at this time of the morning. As soon as I stepped onto my upper deck I began to gaze at the sky. A flash of light is what originally got my attention. When I focused on the spot just to the west of me, I noticed three star like lights with the magnitude of about 5 1/2. They were moving in perfect formation like a large 100 degree triangle pointing in the north to about 5 degrees maybe to the east. They seemed to be following the milky ways direction or they were atleast in that portion of the sky. They did not twinkle or vary from their formation. They continued in their direction, northwardly, until they were lost in the distance. It took about 1 to 2 minutes for them to pass from almost directly above me to the horizon. I am not usually up at this time, but I know this is a popular time to view satellites and I have never seen one to know the difference between ufos and normal celestial objects that would be moving that way. Another thing. I could see stars inside the triangle so it was not one solid object. It was like watching a small constellation move across the sky. There was no sound of jets, but I live along side a noisy highway so there was some highway noise. What made this seem so special was the way they moved with such precision together across the sky. I think there is a logical explination for this, but would like to know if what I saw was a ufo. I don't know why I saw a flash of light first, or if that has anything to do with the formation. It could have been a shooting star, but what a coincidence. I live about 60 miles north of Houston so there is alot of air traffic and they go in that direction the most. I think I have included everything to the best of my knowledge. I hope it is relevent. I am a christian who believes that if God included everything about our universe, the Bible would never end. He lets us figure some things out for ourselves. I believe we are the only humans with the ability to have the holy spirit in our hearts, but nature is an awesome thing. God bless all the scientist and curious people reading this and happy researching. P.S. On the 15th, two days ago we had a major black out over 10 counties lasting from 7pm to 1am. I'm sure if there is anything intellegant flying out in space above our atmospere this looked like some kind of signal. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of U. S. Navy ""NOSS"" satellites??

We kept watching it as we also looked at the sunrise.  The sunrise was just begining and Jupiter was to the west.  I looked back at it in a minute and saw a moving star next to it.  I showed that to my wife who observed that the star was moving erractally northwest.   We observed this for a minute and continued to watch the sunrise.  I then took my binoculars and looked at it.  It was circular and had a faint line that zigzaged through the middle and down to the left.

The three smaller sparkling objects slowly faded out.  And that was it.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,,

It was late at night perhaps in the morning around 3 am, when all of a sudden I started to feel a little light headed and distracted. I woke up from a deep sleep and saw that my sister was still sleeping pretty comfortably besides me. Like always my window blades were open and I remember that I could see the townhouses that were across my street very clearly. Then all of a sudden a flash of light, as big as my window, maybe a little smaller was right outside of it. It was so bright and I started to try to tell my older sister but she was still in a deep sleep. The lights were so bright and white and yellow. I went running up to my big window, not knowing wether my eyes played a trick on me or it was for real. By the time I was up to my window, the flash of lights or the oval or disk or whatever it was, was gone. I think it was in a disk or oval formation. The scary part of this event was that the next morning when I was heading to my bustop for school, my nieghbor, who usually walks with me to the bustop, said that when she was getting a glass of water in the middle of the night, she noticed wierd lights through her skylight window, and then she went and opened her front door and she saw a disk shaped object or something, then it dissapeared. She claimed that to me without me even mentioning the story to her before she told me. So the question is, is this a coincidence of both of us having a dream,but then how do you describe my nieghbor telling the same story I witnessed or did we both witness it for real???

The object was sighted in the southern direction against the sky and some sharp hills (or mountains).  It was dusk so the light was dissapating. At first we noticed a black spec in the sky miles away that seemed to be moving.  The object would seem to hover, then accelerate at abnormal speed, slow down and would rapidly change direction at high speed. At times it would dissapear, then we would see it again in a different spot, at a different height.   The object then appeared to be silver and more football shaped. The object was literally shape shifting as we watched. We saw tear drop shape, diamond shape, flat shape.   At one point the object faded from view and near its previous location we saw small white orbs dashing away from where it was hovering. I saw approx 3 to 4 orbs shoot out.  They kind of fish-tailed around really fast and then faded.  Then the object re-appeared, silver again and blimp shaped.  It was on one side of these sharp hills in the distance and seemed to be dancing around in all directions, like it was teasing us.   For a while it seemed really close to the hills almost like it was teathered. The hills had to be miles away.  We travelled far enough that we could no longer see the side of the hills that it could have been teathered to and it appeared at the opposite side of these hills.  If this were some sort of blimp teathered to the ground somewhere, it would have been impossible for us to see it from both angles. We video taped the object but because of the color of the sky mixed with us being in a moving car it is almost impossible to see.   We did pull over at a truck stop and I got a picture of it with my digital camera.  At that point the object was fish shaped and did not move. If it were something floating or teathered that high up, surely the wind would have been blowing it around, but it was still, as if posing for us but too far away to see it clearly.

The sky was clear; wind calm and the sun had just set. The sky was growing darker and darker blue straight above and stars were beginning to show. The sky was becoming black in the east.

White lights in front, blinking red lights on tail. I was home on the night of April 11, 2005 watching a PBS tv special about the laying of the trans-atlantic telegraph cable. I was sitting in a chair next to a large picture window that faces directly south.  The only lights on inside the house were a small night light in the bathroom and the light from the television set. From the corner of my eye I saw a bright light outside which emerged slowly from behind some trees on the east side of my house.  The time was 9:54pm.  The light appeared to be a cluster of bright (prismatic) white lights which was immediately trailed by a long, very dark space and then there was a small cluster of blinking reddish lights.  My first impression was that the cluster of reddish lights was an airplane chasing the white lights. I ran outside to my porch and watched this object move slowly, perhaps 100-150mph, from east to west.  The sighting was at least a full minute.  It very soon became apparent that this was not two objects  but one.  The white lights in the front were trailed by a long, dark, unlighted structure that blotted out the stars as it passed.  It was a bright, starry night with a crescent moon low on the northwestern horizon; the moon was below the treeline behind the house. The trailing cluster of blinking, reddish lights followed in perfect, attached unison to the white lights and the unlighted structure, never moving closer or further away.  My best estimate of the size of this object (seen from the side) is about 300ft.  The object passed about 1000-1500ft from me and passed over the hill behind my house with about 200ft of clearance.  The hill's elevation is 1900 ft, my house is about 200ft below that. The object passed directly east to west over the southern portion of my 11 acre, heavily wooded, hillside lot.  The area I live in is sparsely populated with few paved roads and no streetlights.  The lights of the local village are visible in the valley below my home, about four miles away to the northeast.  Only half of the village is visible due to intervening hills. As the object passed my home I heard what I took to be a freight train passing through the village, this is a frequent and familiar sound.  I did not equate this sound with the presence of the object which did not seem to make any sound at all. For the record:  I have ten years of military experience with the US Air Force and US Air Force Reserves.  My service was spent working on and flying in military aircraft (not as a pilot).  I am familiar with military aircraft and helicopters",2005-05-11T00:00:00,,

I have been a regular to your site for some time now and this is my first time posting a report.  However,  what I saw and confirmed on April 12th, 2005 forced me to share this with the center in the hopes it will added to the database as a footnote.   Currently the database has 2 reports of a flying triangle over the Los Angeles and Santa Monica area on April 12th at approx. 13:00  (1 o'clock p.m.)  What our 2 witnesses were observing was the B-2 Stealth Bomber performing a low altitude fly-by of Dodger Stadium for the opening day ceremonies.  I observed the B-2 at approx. 13:07 from my backyard as it headed west towards Santa Monica at very low altitude approx. 700 to 900 ft. , roughly the same altitude as LAPD helicopters, and bank towards the north Santa Monica Mountains.  I tried to get a shot of this amazing airplane with my cell phone camera but I was too slow. What caught my attention was the engine noise.  Nothing like I've ever heard before.   My next door neighbor also witnessed the fly-by.  I live in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles, roughly half way between the witness in downtown and the witness to my west  in Santa Monica.   Quote from the Los Angeles Times 4/13/05 ""The largest crowd ever at Dodger Stadium - 55,892 - barely had time to settle after watching the obligatory B-2 stealth bomber roar past when low-flying projectiles began doing damage. Starter Jeff Weaver gave up 11 hits and eight runs before being pulled after a Pedro Feliz homer."" An airshow  message board also noted the B-2 fly-by for the Dodgers opener, and noted there will be another on Memorial Day May 30th, 2005.  Let's see how many reports come in that day.

PD)) CASE BACKGROUND   On 15April05 the Georgia UFO Group received a call on the 'Hotline'. The caller identified himself by name and address i.e. a middle-age disabled resident of McDonough Georgia (McDonough is about 26 miles SE of Atlanta). He stated that the previous night he, along with his wife and a neighboring couple, had observed a highly unusual object in the sky. He went on to describe the event (duration about one hour), indicating that he was pretty amazed by what they observed. After getting the basic details, this investigator instructed the Primary Witness (PW) to prepare a detailed account, plus a sketch, both to be forwarded to this writer. PW also provided the phone number of the second witness (W2).   This investigator phoned W2 and found him to be a retired firefighter, and afterwards a hospital security officer by profession. He provided basic details of the event and also agreed to forward an account and a sketch to GUFOG.   After receiving all of the above described documents on 18April05, this writer again spoke with the PW and W2 within a few days. The final detailed account summary contains more information than the preliminary recap sent to GUFOG members in the group's bulletin.   WITNESS ACCOUNTs- SUMMARY   PW stated that at about 10:00PM on 14April05 (and continuing until about 11:00PM) he observed what he thought was a ""falling star"" out of his bay window. When it did not briefly extinguish as expected, he went outside to observe more closely. Looking to the NW, he continued to watch a brilliant light which began to dart back and forth, up and down, zig-zagging at about 1/2 of the way off of the horizon. PW retrieved his binoculars (10X50) and continued to watch. Under magnification, he at first observed a ""pancake-like"" object which seemed to have red, blue, and silver lights on the bottom. During subsequent observation, it seemed to get closer and MOVE to give a view of DIFFERENT SHAPES......a triangle, later a shallow ""C"" shape almost like a boomerang, then a classic lens shape with a protuberance similar to a cupola, each profile displaying the aforementioned lights. PW indicated that the rapid movement reminded him of the electronic indicator on a heart monitor in a hospital, but after he thought on it some more, perhaps looking through the binoculars had caused some of that due to his natural hand and arm tremor.   After steady observation, the PW called his neighbor, W2, who also came out to take a look.   W2 told this investigator that he watched the object both with the naked eye and the binoculars. He estimated that it was about the size of a LARGE MARBLE held out AAL, at about 45 degrees off of the horizon, shaped like a TRIANGLE with blinking blue, green and silver lights. During his observations, he too noticed very rapid movements. PW added that it seemed to him that the object had a SHINY METALLIC-LIKE COLOR ON THE BOTTOM ALONG WITH THE CHANGING LIGHTS. During his observation using the binoculars he also noticed a GRATE-LIKE SURFACE at one point, which resembled ""criss-cross"" like openings. W2 added that he got the impression that this object was beyond our atmosphere and would be HUGE in order to allow for what they observed.   Local conditions during the observation was a typical mild, clear, Southern spring night, tending to the cool 50's and 60's, with little or no wind noticed.   INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS   This writer is intrigued by the many shapes attribute to one object over the course of an hour's observation. However there is a similar recent report on file from the same general area, to wit;   On 3Aug04 at about 5:15AM, a Stockbridge Georgia resident (Stockbridge is about 8.7 miles NW of McDonough) reported to GUFOG via 'Hotline' that he was watching an UNUSUAL LIGHT back in the direction of MCDONOUGH. Said light darting up and down, back and forth, and then as the two of us spoke, he stated that it began to change into a BOOMERANG or V SHAPE. (See NUFORC entry: Stockbridge Georgia; Occurred 8/3/2004; Reported 8/10/2004; Posted 8/11/2004; Shape: Changing; Duration: Appx. 30 minutes)   OTHER FACTORS   In considering prosaic causes for this described event, celestial bodies were reviewed as should always be done for most night reports.  The planet Jupiter is brighter than normal during early April05, estimated about -2.5 magnitude, but BY MID-APRIL is actually FARTHER away from the Sun and Earth than normal.  Venus, due to it's current close proximity to the Sun, is not a factor herein.   GUFOG Special Advisor Mark Ausmus of Atlanta reviewed the sky for 14April05 between 10:00PM and 11:00PM via his ""Starry Night"" software.  Mark found no dazzling bodies that might be brilliant enough, even if viewed through unusual atmospheric conditions, to produce anything remotely resembling what has been described.  Jupiter is off to the SE.....Saturn to the west, but less than dazzling.....Sirius to the west, up about 30 degrees, but again not a suspect.....Capella to the NW, another non-suspect in this particular circumstance.   Witness descriptions obviously do not fit with any artificial satellites, nor meteors.  Both the PW and W2 were found to easily recognize local commercial air traffic for exactly what it is.   Any citizens of Henry County or the south Metro Atlanta area counties with similar observations during the mid-April time frame can contact Investigator Tom Sheets at the Georgia UFO Group office in Fayetteville at 678-817-4555 or email at <<<georgiaUFOgroup@hotmail.com>>>>   GUFOG protects the identity of ALL witnesses.

It began moving to the right subtly and I called my bother to come and look at it.  It took him a few seconds to find it and then he said he saw it take off and move out of view.  I began looking at the opposite side of the sky and saw another moving straight across the sky. However this object was clearly a classic disc shape like two plates put together.  The color of the craft was seemingly black. A few minutes later I viewed another of the same type speeding in the same direction as the second craft mentioned.  There were planes in the sky as I live near the airport.   I've seen some pretty interesting things lately but never have I seen the discs in real life and so clearly.

He described the alleged event in a quite objective, factual, level-headed manner, and expressed surprise at the bizarre and dramatic nature of the event.   The fact that the objects seem to have moved in different directions, while apparently at the same altitude (above ground level) seems to us to militate against the possibility that the objects could have been helium-filled balloons, drifting with the prevailing wind.   We have encouraged the witness to attempt to locate and identify other witnesses to the event, although he reported that the objects almost certainly would not have been visible, without the aid of binoculars, or other forms of magnification.

I was out in the front of my house on Saturday afternoon, 10/22/05, when I heard a jet go over and I looked up to see where it was.   I live on two private acres on the outskirts of Silver City, NM.   The jet had broken the sound barrier and was way out of sight, it was long gone - I never did see it.   However, the more I looked at the sky I began to see something else come into focus.  Straight up, and directly above my head, I saw what appeared to be no more than just a white object - just a white point of light.  It hung motionless.  The object looked kind of like what a very bright star might look like during the middle of the day, and it appeared to be very, very high up, but I had nothing to relate size to, so I can't exactly gauge altitude.   The sky was clear and bright blue, and it was between 3:30 and 4:00 (MST)in the afternoon.   The more my eyes became accustomed to the sky I realized another identical object to the right of the one I had been looking at.  It also appeared motionless.  On further observation I soon located a third identical white object above the two I was looking at, and the three of them together formed a triangle.   They remained completely suspended for several minutes and did not move.  They were all, in fact, stationary when I first located them.   Suddenly the two objects which flanked the middle one fanned out to form what was now an arc.  This was the first movement I witnessed.  Their movements were sudden for having been suspended for so long.   Once they had formed an arc formation they once again quit movement and suspended themselves again.  They were all equally spaced in this formation.   After a couple more minutes I noticed a fourth identical object coming out of the southeast at a very high rate of speed.  It approached the middle object in the arc formation and suddenly came to a very quick stop next to it.  It looked as if it was going to bump the middle object.  In fact, I have described the fourth object as racing in and ""flirting or dancing"" with the other object.  It would approach it as if it was going to bump it and then it would back off and repeat the motion.   Suddenly the two other white objects, which had remained stationary all this time in their formation, fanned out again, but this time to line up in a perfectly straight line with the middle object which was still being ""taunted"" by the fourth object.  Once the three lined up they suddenly started moving northwest at a consistant speed and evenly spaced.  During the duration none of these objects ever changed shape or color.   Soon the original three were gone over the horizon.  The fourth white point (object) remained suspended where it had been when the others left it.  After a few minutes it began to slowly move in the same northwest direction as the others.  I watched it move quite a distance, much more and it would have disappeared over the horizon like the others, and then it suddenly stopped and suspended itself again.   Coming out of the southeast was a fifth identical white object also traveling at a very fast speed.  It was headed directly for the ""straggler,"" the fourth object, which remained motionless.  Again, this object seemed to ""dance"" with the other object once it got close to it.  It went through the same taunting motions, and would make passes at the other object, looking almost like it was going to hit it.   After a minute or so of this ""activity"" the fifth and newest object proceeded alone on the same northwest course as the others.  The ""straggler"" remained suspended for a few more minutes before it too resumed the same northwest direction.    The full experience of what I have just described took place over about a 20 minute time period. I have checked our local news and have talked to a few people around town and no one has made mention of seeing anything like this.  I would be more than interested in knowing if there is anyone in my vicinity who may have witnessed the same thing I did.   I have never seen anything like it, nor can I think of anything that ""we"" know of that would act in such a manner in space.   This is my first sighting.",2005-11-03T00:00:00,32.685832500000004,-108.4894425

He was also amazed and so we brought my sister outside to make sure we weren't just seeing things.  We were all amazed by these red lights.  It looked just like two red stars.   At first we thought they might be airplane lights but then we used reference points to see if they were moving and neither one of them moved.   Also, airplane lights blink rythmically and these lights had absolutely no blinking pattern.  They were fading in and out and almost twinkling at the same time.   Another thing that was very odd was that the color was not stark red; rather, it was an orangish-red.  Then after about five to seven minutes they just vanished.

On September 30th at aproximately eleven o'clock I was delivering pizzas for my work when I had sighted a strange red light in the sky. I saw the previous red lights reported to nuforc on october 31st 2004, so I am always looking in the sky now for things like this.  I was driving south bound on 80th avenue and 167th street when I noticed the red light in the sky moving north east. I was driving my automobile so I could not sit and stare at it as much as I would ahve liekd to. Allthough as I was sitting at the stop light of 80th avenue and 167th street the red light movered directly over me and my automobile. It was over my head for about ten seconds, steadily moving, and making no sounds. i continued to deliver my pizza to the hotel I was driving to. I continued to stare every 1 seconds from the red light in the sky back to driving, because I wanted to see it, but had to hurry. I entered the hotel, delivered my pizza, and exited the hotel in a hurry to continue to watch it as I was then done with work.  When I came out of the hotel, a second red light apeared. the were moving at differant speeds, or differant directions because when I first saw the second red light it was about a 12 inches apart when looking in the sky. After a few minutes they lined up over each other, about 8 inches apart from each other. I raced home to show my girlfriend. She was home and we looked at them together from our home in tinley park.  By the time I got home the red lights were far east of tinley park, but still very visable. We watched them move farther and fartehr away from us for about ten minutes before they ultimately burnt out in the night sky.  the whole insident was about 30 minutes I would say. I would like to add again that me, my mother, my brother saw the last 3 red lights on october 31st of 2004 reported by many others to nuforc as well.  My mother is a working class 9 - 5 tax paying citizen, my brother is a college graduate working in the news business, I am a attending college student, and my Girlfriend is an attending college student. We are all very normal poeple, no history of any psychotic behavior or any visits with phsyciatrist. none of us have ever seen any thing like these red lights before in our lifes.  The only differances with these red lights and the ones from october 31st last year, is there was only 2 this time, and these seemed smaller to me in my memory, and last these didnt move around as much as last years did. last years seemed like they formed flight patterns, as these kinda just floated over our heads.  If I ever see these again i'm going to use my video camera on them.

My Son who arrived at the same time also saw these lights. There movement was extremely slow. Thought they might be Hot air balloons, but heard no Noise that might be produced by a propane burner. My son called a meterological friend in Dekalb, Ill. some 45 miles away and he reported to us seeing only one red light to the eastnortheast (approx 45degrees)from his viewing area.  The two lights from first observation were seperated by 15 degrees from my vantage point and did not see any other lights to the north, although I did not scan the complete sky because of buildings and trees. As we observed for 5 minutes, these lights appeared to be dropping down. Not knowing what they were, I alerted other family members to get out of the house in case of a crash. As the rest of the family came out, we all observed for another ten minutes as these lights seem to be gaining altitude. At this point the lights were seperated by 5 degrees. My older Son went into the house and got his digital camcorder and started to video this event. As we continued to watch, I observerd a commercial aircraft fly East(90degrees) exactly between and above these lights. Estimate height of aircraft about 3500 feet. I did hear the faint jet noise from this plane and can only assume it was preparing for final approach to O'Hara using the Lake Michigan corridor. The surface wind was 5 mph from the southwest. We continued to observe the Red Lights for another 15-20 minutes and then disappeard to the east. Last sighting the two Red Lights were about 30 degrees apart before they disappeared. About 1:15 AM, my son alerted me and said that he now sees three Red Lights coming from the Southwest heading toward our house again. This observation was from his bedroom window and they were seperated by 10 - 15 degrees apart. We again went outside and watched from our backyard (west side of the house). My son again videotaped these lights. They were NOT in a triangle as some later reported. They seemed to be in a straight line. After about 7 minutes or so, the Red lights changed course and proceeded onto the east (90 degrees). They did not come over our house as the earlier sighting. AS we watched, the middle Red light overtook the first one and as it was doing that, both Red lights were woobling. It was only a few moments were we obsevered both lights coming together as one. Then seperated. We watched all three lights proceed east and were moving a little faster than the earlier sighting. I moved to the front of the house and watch the three red lights seperate heading east  rapidly until I lost interest and went inside. Last seen, they were somewhat in staggered line and following US 6 easterly direction.

The lights would flicker, but not is any sort of routine.  The two lights were on an appx 45 degree angle from each other.  The third light that a few of us saw was on an opposite 45 degree angle, thus causing the 3 lights to form a triangle.  After seeing the pictures from the Halloween incident last year, I would say these are the same lights.  After about 5 minutes, 1 light seemd to just disappear then about 30 seconds later, the second light took off to the east in a rather high rate of speed.  To us, it appeared that the lights were too high to be helicopters and we are certain the were not airplanes because they were stationary for most of the time.  We did not hear any sound, but we were not able to tell exactly how far away the lights were. The conditions that evening were a little chilly but the sky was free of clouds.

Duration of observation approximately 1 min. I was out Friday evening May 27, 2005 looking at the night sky here in Tacoma, Washington with my 12 inch Dobsonian telescope. It was a beautiful evening, full of stars, with no clouds or haze at all. I am situated here in a great location because even though I live in the city Tacoma, it is approximately 8 miles west of downtown and located at Point Defiance which is surrounded on three sides by Puget Sound. The sky is pretty dark here except for looking eastward towards downtown. I looked at Jupiter and notice to pairs of moons grouped tightly together on the left side of the planet. It was very interesting. CAVEAT: Because this is a Dobsonian telescope, everything is upside down and backwards, so the moons were really to the right of Jupiter if you could see them with your naked eyes. I went inside to look at my planetarium program to see which moons these were. I stepped back outside and walked up to my telescope to start viewing these moons. I looked up at Jupiter at 23:59 when I noticed a very bright deep red light ramping up and down in luminosity at a rate of approximately 1 cycle/second 5 degrees higher in elevation than Jupiter heading S-SW toward the horizon. My mind instantly searched for familiar clues to this object. It does not appear “right”. I then quickly looked for the familiar green FAA markings. None exhibited. OK, what? All this transpired in less than 5 seconds. I immediately grabbed my telescope and was determined to not this possible once-in-a-lifetime event get away from me. I spotted it with my finder scope and somehow kept it in the main field of view of the 2 inch wide angle 32mm eyepiece that I had in the telescope at the time. It was the show of a lifetime for me!  Now for my observation; First of all, what I want to state here is that it was “tough enough” to keep this object centered to the best of my ability by hand in the center of my field of view during the 30-45 second period of observation, especially in the beginning, because at the closest point to me it was at a minimum of 10 diameters of Jupiter. Because of this, I concentrated only on what “I” thought was extremely unique to this craft. These were in two areas. 1)  The main deep red overpowering light in the center of the triangle. 2)  The apparent surprising (to me), non-flat bottom to this craft.   Let me now expound on the ""light""; Size and Intensity; This light was extremely wide. It appeared to me to be approximately 1/20th to as much as 1/10th the diameter of the bottom of the triangle. It was extremely bright when it would ramp up in 1second duration cycles. The intensity was extremely bright but soft, (diffuse). The intensity at maximum was as bright as on-coming passenger jet headlights when they are heading directly towards you, (but this light WAS NOT pointed in my direction, but was straight down 29 degrees in elevation S-SW of me). Also, there was one other small red light at the right triangle tip blinking in unison with the main one. I did not notice one on the left side, but this may be due to the angle of the craft. Now for the Hue; Almost, but not quite, as deep red as a street blinking stop light with a “true” glass lens and “filament” type bulb. The reason I stress here a “Filament” type bulb is because it is the closest analogy that I can come up with that describes the ramping up and down of the main light at 1 cycle intervals. If you can picture one of these lights as described above blinking on and off at a 1cycle/second intervals, but never going completely out before it starts increasing in intensity again. This most accurately explains what I saw. All this is happening on a non-wavering linear repetitious cadence.   Now for the “bottom shape” of the craft; 	If you notice on any kind of modern jet aircraft, the main wing has a dihedral, (note; Dihedral is an angle raising the centerline of the wing tip above the centerline of the wing root). This angle appeared to me about a similar 3 degree angle starting at it lowest point from the front tip of the craft, running straight to the rear, dissecting the rear flat edge of the triangle in half. This angle then moved upwards both to the left and right tips of the triangle. Hypothetically; I would suspect if you saw this thing on the ground in the daytime from the rear the bottom would have a chevron shape to it, (if this helps). Now for the bottom’s “reflective property”; One thing that was quite evident in the telescope was how reflective it was. I could plainly see that the glow from ground illumination was casting a whitish soft glow to the bottom. Now for the “interesting” part of this observation that may make this light different from any normal light that “we” may know about. As bright as this center light did ramp up to, it never cast ANY portion of this to the bottom whatsoever. The light would be intensely bright but you could see right adjacent to it the glow effect from ground lighting without ANY hue change. It was quite amazing to see.   	Other Observations;  Apparent observed height; From the elevation above horizon (29 degrees), and it’s width of 10 Jupiters minimum, the best guess I can come up with is 1-3K feet. Very close to the ground. An explanation of this is warranted here; I am an amateur astronomer and avid aircraft enthusiast. I know a lot of different aircraft from the WWII era to modern day. I have been a multi-year Boeing Museum of Flight member, gone to air shows for years, etc. This craft appeared to be in altitude of about in between the height of C-17’s landing a few miles south of here at McChord Air Force Base & passenger jet aircraft heading north to Sea-Tac.  Speed; I would estimate that it must have been slower than passenger jet. The reason I say this is because I have tried following passenger jets at this angle of elevation above the horizon in the past and they are too fast to track. Even with this 2 inch wide angle 32mm eyepiece that I have.  Sound; None apparent. Could be that it was too far away to hear though.  Flying Characteristics; Smooth, gliding, graceful, effortless. No yawing, pitching, front point always staying straight ahead in the line of travel.   	Personal Observations; 		I spend every moment that I can outside for quite a few years now and never have seen anything “out of the ordinary”. Nothing, since I had when I was a child, very many years ago. I have been listening to Jeff Rense now for quite a few years and have been hearing the “I went out for a cigarette” routine. Well isn’t it ironic that I have been patiently waiting for years for this chance and just the night before this sighting, I then finally said to myself; “Gee, for heavens sake, am I ever going to see anything myself? Then 24hours later, Wham! 		It almost makes you think; “Is someone reading my thoughts?”. What a coincidence, that’s all I can say. What are the odds on that? 		One other small thing, If only I had come out 10 seconds earlier it would have been right over my head. I kick myself over that one. The only good part of this is that I would have never been able to track the craft with my telescope. At this angle it would be too fast to track.  		 	“Ours” vs. “Theirs”  		In some respects, I would think “Ours”. 		Examples; 		Speed. Non-wavering flying. Dihedral “type” angle making you think, lift.  		In other respect “Theirs” 		Examples; 		The intensity of the light. None of this light reflects on the bottom, but the glow of the street lights below, do. No FAA markings. The sheer beauty of this thing.   	“Ours”? Doesn’t make sense to me; 		If it IS a Black Project, why fly it low over Tacoma? Ok, so you aren’t worried about someone taking a “pot shot” at the thing. Then why put the biggest, brightest, red-light in the world and stick it on the bottom, adverstising; “Look at me!” “Look at me!”",2005-06-20T00:00:00,47.21257223776224,-122.4597204895105

We were curious what they were so we turned South on the next rode and preceded to follow the lights that were southwest of us.  We were pretty close to the lights and they began to look like a circular object and the red lights appeared to have little bars across them.  When it was close to us at this point and you could see it was very big.   Then, for about ten seconds I looked down inside the pickup and looked back up and it wasn't there anymore, so I asked my friend where it went and he pointed to the other side of the rode, so I looked over and it was way on the other side of the rode towards the east.   So, we turned on the next gravel road going east towards the object, but we decided we would stop it see if it was moving.  We watched it go right over my friends farm and it was hovering over it for at least a minute and then there appeared a smaller saucer right below the big one.  As we watched them hovering over his farm it began moving very fast at an angle into the sky and it just disapeared into a little ball of light and it was gone.   We followed it for at least 5 minutes before it disappeared, the whole time it seemed like it was running away from us when we would move towards it and when we would stop, it would stop with us.

My wife and children were already asleep in the cabin and my friend and his wife were asleep in the travel trailer.  I noticed an odd light in the sky, flashing blue, red and green. I got my 10X binoculars from the truck and steadied my view of the lights by leaning against the cabin. Under magnification, I could see a disk shaped object in the western sky. It reminded me of watching the tail lights of a distant car, because I was able to see an object amidst the lights.  As I watched, it seemed that the lights weren't just flashing, but where actually rotating around the exterior of the object. There also seemed to be a haze or gas around it.  After 10 miniutes of awe, I realized that no one would believe me without a witness, so I woke up my wife and asked her to come look at something interesting in the sky. She saw it immediately even without the help of binoculars and told me it was a flying saucer. She also noticed what appeared to be occaisional lightning like effects coming out from it.  We watched it for another 5 minutes together before remembering that we had other adults who could witness it.  I ran over and woke up my friend, telling him there was a phenomenone that I needed his opinion of.  It took him a couple of minutes to get his shoes and pants on, and followed a few steps behind me over to the shadow spot behind the cabin where my wife was still focused on the object.  As I got to the spot where it was visible through the trees, at that moment, the bright object 'winked out'. Both my wife and I gasped because it was just gone.  My friend rounded the cabin, looked up and asked what the fuss was about because he did not see anything at all. 30 seconds later, the object and light pattern re-appeared, only this time, it looked like it had moved straight out into space and was now very tiny. My wife and I were a bit shaken up at this sight. My friend was just unhappy I had woken him up to look at a wierd star. What I saw was no star.  The next weekend, it was not there and I've never seen it again, either. I do not drink or smoke pot. I cannot explain what it was other than to say I saw something interesting that night. As far as I'm concerned, I saw a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Unfortunately, the oil refineries like to burn off  or ""flare"" various gases (some very noxious) at night when there is less chance of them being reported for doing so.  Many of the flares run steady all day/night long but can increase or decrease in volume of flame emitted.  Under certain atmospheric conditions, i.e., low lying clouds on somewhat still and foggy nights, MANY people report seeing orange pillar shaped UFOs. Our local news stations have run these stories several times in the past to try to educate people, especially those who live to the southeast side of the city.  The orange flame colored light from the flare is seen to be projected in pillar like fashion vertically and can even look as though it is going up and through the low lying clouds that hang along this coastal region.  Many times people will report seeing this some distance away from the refineries.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

UFO witness report Wednesday, July 27th 2005 Norfolk, Virginia  USA 9:00 PM	     Oh how I love storm watching.  The rumbling thunder and spectacular lightshows, to the pouring rain and endless candlelit games of charades during power outages.  On the evening of July 27th, 2005 at approximately 9:00pm, my girlfriend and I witnessed an object flying that was, and remains, unidentified.  Was its purpose to view the storm, or for the storm to help view it. 	The anticipation of an ending record breaking “heat wave” had been felt all day. Finally these 100+ degree daytime highs were going to be crushed by a cold front, resulting in large, severe thunderstorms.  In fact, weather reports earlier in the day were claiming that the huge ban of thunderstorms (from Texas to New England)  were producing wind gusts up to 60mph, and large hail stones.  As soon as I heard the emergency broadcast alerts by means of television, I knew it was coming. 	After a few rumbles of thunder were heard, I decided to head outside to spectate. It was about 8:45pm and the sun was set, yet there was still a shimmer of light in western sky coming through the clouds of the oncoming storm.  I sat in my usual spot on the deck steps.  Our deck is roofed which provides excellent storm watching without getting wet.  My eyes were wondering back and forth between my 11mo old puppy playing in the yard and the inconsistent flashes of lightning reflecting off neighboring houses. As I looked to my right, I noticed a bright star in between two parallel power lines from my vantage point.  It flickered violently between white and amber colors, just as a star rapidly twinkles in the distance…the object didn’t appear to be moving at all and I thought to myself, maybe this is a planet because it seems much larger than even the largest, brightest star. So there I was trying to decipher the object and realized that whatever it was seemed to be under the veil of storm clouds.  There was no clear patch in the clouds to peek at the humbling vastness of space.  So as I watched this mysterious light in the sky, it became clear that it was moving.  I performed many visual tests with stationary objects (power lines) to make sure the object was moving.  This went on for about two minutes before I decided to ask my girlfriends opinion and grab my video camera. I began recording for a total of 6 minutes.  The glowing object ever so slowly hovers to my east and descends. There was approximately 4 more min of viewing before the object descends below the treeline and out of view. That are not in this footage.  As far as the objects actual size and distance I have no idea. At approximately 9:45 pm I decided to call the non-emergency line of one of the Norfolk police depts. I asked the officer (or whomever answered my call) if there had been any reports of unidentified flying objects in the area within the past hour or so.  He said not at that particular station, but inquired about my sighting.  I explained and his response was that a logical explanation was that there is always a high amount of helicopter traffic from local tv stations etc in the area.  I thanked the man for his time and hung up.  This object was NOT an airplane (although Norfolk International Airport is within about 7 miles from my location).  The object was definitely NOT a helicopter (my sister flies CH-46 helicopters for the navy and my father is a retired commander). There were no signs of any flashing beacons. The object was NOT a star or planet due to its movement and location under the clouds.  I am not 100% sure on the following topic of balls of light appearing in storms due to the electrically charged atmosphere so I cant rule it out.  More personal research will tell.  Here is a video capture in mpeg format from the original, non duplicated hi-8 sony video camera tape.  The transfer appears darker than the original tape, but I didn’t want to edit the picture quality in any way.  The only editing done is a layer of text with date time location and my name.  The most exhilarating image however appears when I took a still photo of the image during the illumination of a lightning flash. I challenge all of you to dissect this footage with my full cooperation to help in ANY WAY NECESSARY.

When I first looked up there seemed to be a gaping distance between the two blinking lights-  it should be noted that the lights were red in color.  Without a moments comprehension, the tailing light blinked off and reappeared right next to 1.  Then 2 blinked off again only to reappear where it was before.

It wasn't above the trees or right below the clouds, it was about halfway.  It had been a full moon about a week before, and a quarter moon the day after I saw the craft, so it was pretty bright out.  It was also clear, no clouds in the sky at all.  After I heard the noise I ran outside as fast as I could to see what it was.  I about ran over my dad, so he wondered what was going on and came after me.  He was in the Navy for about 20 years, and said it sounded just like a helicopter, but it sure didn't look like one.  The craft seemed really big, bigger than a helicopter would be on the ground..maybe about the size of a rectangle-shaped airplane.  There was a big white light in the front middle of the craft, and a big red light on the back left corner, and a big green light on the back right corner.  None of these lights were flashing or doing anything, but they were really big and seemed too far apart and too big, even if it was a helicopter.  Like stated in my last UFO post, I'm an avid believer of UFOs, but I'm 100% open to explanation.  My town has a population of around 25-30k, and the only airport we have is municipal so airplanes aren't widely seen around here.  The craft was flying south, and was out of my sight fairly quickly.

I stayed up and watched for awhile but the clouds were rolling in and lights werent doing much of anything, I wonder if the other boats saw them, or if maybe the camera/binoculars made the light look like that and it was just a shrimp boat or something?

I tried to take a pic with my camera phone, but the photos didnt come out well (damn sony ericsson phone). Tonight, same object, about 30 min from where I originally saw it last week, this time I pulled over to try to snap a pic with the camera phone, but could not even get it to show up on my camera for some reason (even with night mode on). It was just stationary in the sky. I sit there and attempted to take two pics (which neither picked it up) and then it just whizzed away, not blink of an eye fast, but faster than most planes I've seen.  Freaked me out both times, enough where my back was sweating this last time. I almost wanted to run up to somebody and tell them to look at it (was pulled out by a gas station) but in Arkansas, I figured I would be attacked for being a nut or something (my wife even thinks im going crazy).

Looking to my left towards town, lots of airplanes in the flight path, one right after another~probably 3 heading towards Sea-Tac International Airport. I look to the right after hearing someone talking kind of loud and excited.  I see 2 lights in the sky very low and bright. As I lean out my window to get a better look, suddenly I see 3 more, they're spaced as if in a circle around 1 different looking thing. I figured the 5 positioned around the center light must be those low flying 'planes' (that hardly make any noise at all). All of them seemed to hover including the center one. They weren't very high in the sky either, lower than planes fly (by the way, they weren't in or near the flight paths) and I'm not hearing anything other than cars going by and loud voices.  My binoculars are old and they don’t get real clear images but the center light especially should’ve been easy to see if I had good binoculars! Anyway, they all sit there for about 3 or 4 minutes and then the center one starts heading to the left. At this point the lights on it looked as though it could be a saucer shape 2 big white lights with a thin blue light behind them with 2 other smaller lights next to the big ones but spread out a little. When it leaned to its right to leave, it got very, very bright. Once accelerating in that direction, it looked like 2 round sections-one on top of the other - one light white and the other a pinkish purple but very soft. I believe they were flashing as it came by pretty close, maybe a couple of blocks away heading towards Edgewood sort of diagonally. Half way there it began jerking back and forth very quickly maybe 3 times and then continued on. After it got by the Yeast Plant it then looked like it was made up of 4 sections that were staggered and they were all a goldish-white almost amber. Turned to look at the other 5 lights and one was already moving in the same direction but was closer to me. It too got very bright as it banked to follow the other one. As it went by, it looked to me like a Thunderbird design. Can't really explain it that well but could draw it. I didn't think about watching the others, not sure if they were still there but wanted to call someone to see if other people had called it in. I figured there were a lot of calls, it being early evening and all the cars I heard go by and the voices I heard must've been watching them too but the officer sounded surprised when I asked him if anyone had called in about them. He said nobody else had called other than me! That really surprises me - I don't know what they were but I really got the feeling at first when I seen this, was that they're actually letting themselves be known. There has been so many things happening around here for months that we can't explain. I don't know if this really covers everything I watched because I am so excited and needed to get this written quickly for future reference. One more thing that has been happening around here for maybe 3 or 4 months, we hear loud popping noises kind of like it sounds if you live close to a military base practicing, sounds like artilliary. But we're too far away to be hearing that, never heard it before and it's at all different times of day and sometimes night, like right now (21:05). They stopped for about 2 weeks recently but started again on Sunday. ((NUFORC Note:  One of five reports from same witness.  PD))",2005-04-16T00:00:00,47.17250000000001,-122.1845

The following experience happened to me in my youth and I am not sure to the exact date.  I believe it happened between 1980 and 1982.  I would have been between 10 and 12 years old.  One night before going to bed around 10:00 p.m., I was looking out the window of my bedroom in my family's 11th story apartment in Jersey City, NJ, when I noticed a large blimp shaped object hovering slowly toward our apartment complex.  I had often seen the Good Year Blimp passing by are apartment building, and being a child I always found them somewhat interesting and worth watching.  Back then, I liked to read the advertisements that scrolled along the side of the blimp in the array of lights that Good Year Blimps had for advertisements.  This time however, something was different. As the object approached closer, I realized that the lights on the side of the object were not reading any messages or advertisements.  The lights were just flashing randomly.  My first impression was ""wow, it must be broken"".  Then as the object approached even closer I realized that the lights were extremely bright, far brighter than I had ever seen on a Good Year Blimp. As for the color, I only remember the lights being white. They were all over the craft in no discernable pattern and they pulsed slowly and seemingly randomly. The intensity of the lights were very similar to magnesium burning.  It was a very intense, pure white light. The object moved slowly and steadily toward our apartment complex and eventually got very close. There was no sound.  In my best estimation it was probably only 250 feet in the air and 300 yards away from my vantage point.  It was very large and looked very similar to a blimp in shape and size.  I remember being absolutely mesmerized by the bright flashing lights, but not afraid.  Then, all of a sudden, it went from casually hovering along, to an insanely fast dash into the night sky. In a matter of 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand, it went from being this large bright object to a speck of light that looked like a star, and then completely gone.  The rate of acceleration was unbelievable.  There was no sound.  The next thing I recall, is that I was in a state of delirium after this incident, and I didn’t even mention what had happened to anyone.  I just went to bed.   The next day I hadn’t remembered a thing.  This memory actually came back to me slowly but positively over the next 2-3 years.  In my estimation the lights that had so mesmerized me, probably had something to do with this memory loss. Anyways, that is my experience. It is actually quite hard to put into written words, and hopefully I’ve conveyed myself well enough.  I am a believer 100%, that this experience was real and UFO’s do exist.

My car was following another car and an unmarked white delivery-style truck was approaching us from the west.   We were a few blocks from the trailer park that I lived in, when a large lightening bolt appeared to come horizontally out of the back-side of the white truck and struck a power pole.  The car in front of me kept going and I could not tell if they noticed this extremely unusual event.  The white truck continued on, giving no indication of anything else unusual.  I was scared to meet the truck on the highway, but did not have any other choice and passed the truck without further incident.  I drove into the trailer park as the neighbors were coming out of their homes, wondering why their electricity had just shut off.  I remember someone asking me what I had done, as it seemed that the power went off just as I drove in the neighborhood. I would sincerely like to know what this could have been, as I have puzzled over this for over 20 years.  The date is approximate.  I remember the approximate time of day and that it must have been the middle of summer as the sun had not set.  There were no clouds that I remember- and definately no thunderstorms!  It was a clear, calm evening. I'm not sure that this qualifies as a UFO sighting, but I remember at the time that people were saying that the government was moving secret objects in unmarked trucks.

She yelled for me to come quick.   As I got there, I saw her looking out of the window and she said that there was a ufo in the sky.  I thought she was mistaken, that perhaps it was a kite or she was kidding around until I reached the window which is on the 6th story bldg and saw a brass colored V shaped object floating in the southeastern sky.  The thing was slowing rotating around w/o a sound.   I was shocked, not scared but intrigued.  I ran to get a small telescope to see it closer.  The object had a circle-like large porthole in the end part of the V.  It did not look like a window and it was the same color as the brass metal.  The UFO turned and rotated over and over.  As it did, the V would become an L and then cigar and back again to an L and a V over and over.  It was a clear sky with a few clouds and the object was just around cloud level or roughly 2,000 ft. My mum said that they were communicating to her, saying that they were friendly.  I just looked at her and disbelieved her.  She said that she asked when are they coming and that they replied soon, very soon.  She also said that it had a haze around it which I didnt see.   My mum actually liked the episode, I felt a little creepy but not frightened.  My dad arrived and we told him to go look.  He did and was fascinated also, almost amused.  He kind of looked happy and he was not the type of person to smile easily.   This UFO was affecting my parents moods into being jovial I thought.  We all looked silently until the craft flew out of our line of sight towards the Northeast which I didnt want it leave.

It had gone well.  On the Monday morning we had a group session with local psychic, Isabelle Kingston. This went well too, I was getting encouraging messages and ideas from all manner of people and places. My confidence was good.  After Issy's session, I thought on my way back to Somerset I would call in at Warminster, a place well-known for UFO sightings, and check out whether 'ET' and UFOs really exist.  I drove through Warminster, up towards the start of the fenced-off, huge army training area of Salisbury Plain. I sat and just relaxed my mind. After a while I had the impression ET really did exist, so in my mind I said, ""Don't bother coming out of your way to appear for me, you probably have far more important things to do"". Then I switched on my engine and started driving back west towards Somerset.  After about ten minutes, I noticed a red light over to the north keeping pace with me, it was followed by a second red light, then a third red light. The next thing was they were veering towards me, then they went over my car at about 50 feet. I was excited. I swerved the car onto the grass verge, and got quickly out of the car. Three, disc craft, of approximately 23 feet in diameter were hovering close to me. They were at an elevation angle of approx 45 degrees, and were only about 60 feet away, i.e. they were VERY close! Around the mid section of each craft was a continuous line of windows. I did not see anyone at the windows, but I felt a communication coming from the ship; the communication did not come to my head and mind, but seemed to connect to the middle of my chest. This was undoubtedly a most wonderful experience.  The three craft started to move off, back to the south-east. I quickly got back into my car and accelerated off in the direction they had gone. A minute or two later I had caught up with them; looking up through the windscreen, the 3 craft were moving gently side-to-side as they progressed on their way. The road started going uphill, to the entrance to Longleat House. Looking across and downhill a little, I saw the 3 craft going past the foot of Cley Hill, at this time a little, white light came up behind the group of three, and entered the trailing disc craft.  We parted company as I drove through Warminster. I felt I had to go to where I had been parked in my car half an hour before. True enough. The three disc craft were there; they were 100 yards from where I had been parked when I sent them my telepathic message.

On a sailing trip in the Sea of Cortez in a wilderness anchorage island called Sal si Puedes (leave if you can)  I was on topsides and looked Westwards to see an emerging intense white light lifting up over the Baja peninsula. It got to a certain height and stopped above the desert and was soon accompanied by two small circular objects moving around it.   I called my companions and they came up to see the imposible movements the two smaller spheres around the great white sphereical object that was growing brighter and brighter.In contrast to the larger object the two smaller ones were multicolored and changing colors and doing fantastic maneauvers around the bigger one.  It looked animated like a computer graphic. At last the larger one became intensly white and began to lift away trailed by the smaller ones to the S.W. and traveled out of our sight.  We went below and looked on the chart where the object was on land and it seemed that it had been due West of the island in an area that was a roadless desert area.,2005-10-20T00:00:00,,

It slowly turned and made no noise at all and started moving towards and the right hand side of our house.   I ran in to get my mom and brother who then came out to watch the rest of the event.

Oddly enough, I know this sounds stupid, it was shaped like a sperm!  I swear on everything! The craft was smooth, no bolts, screws, or seams.  I know for a fact that the US military routinely tests new aircraft in the Mojave because of the ideal flying conditions.  This was just unlike anything I've ever seen.

My father is the ultimate skeptic and ill never forget the look on his face whe he knew that what he saw was unexplainable. He spent many moments in deep though no doubt trying to explain to himself but after several days i asked him and he said it must have been a weather baloon or something.

The plane was heading in an easterly direction.  I waited to hear sounds or see lights of impact, but none came. There were no sounds during flight, and the light was not hazy or changing, nor did it flicker. I do not know if it landed or impacted the ground.

This was a rapidally forming cloud that seemed to dissapate within about a sixty second time frame and than basically reform in a basic triangulation (or saucer type shape) in a two to seven minute context.  I witnessed two appearqnces before I notified my friends,  seeing as the experience the past evening was a little out of the ordinary for us.

I will elaborate further, however I have lived in Puerto Vallarta for almost NINE years and I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING like this before.  This ""cloud""continued to dissapate and reform multiple times before my eyes as wells many others all within the same approximate location.  When it had disaperred from this location for the second time, I began to look around and noticed that the same type of formations ""clouds"" were forming and dissapating in other locations  in the north bay (Bucerias, La Cruz de Huanaxcatle, Sayulita).

The sky was exactly the same and the description of the four lights is exactly the same. The pattern of the four circular lights dancing in a consistent pattern, returning to the middle and repeating in a circular motion is just as I saw it. My sons thought this was cool and my wife thinks I am crazy, although she saw the same thing and says they were advertising spotlights. This could be true, however, the lights you normally would see shooting up to the sky were not ever present. The farther you moved away, the larger the distance of the lights would become. The really cool part is when I went outisde about two hours later to take my dog out, the lights were there doing the same exact thing but then a loud sonic boom blasted through the air as if a space shuttle was taking off, and would you believe that the lights disappeared as the very loud sound diminished? I can almost say with certainty that this sound seemed to be moving up and away from the surface of the earth and up into the sky, just like the space shuttle.

However, as we continued driving, about 10 seconds later the object was right above and to the right of our car, giving me a perfect view.  It seemed huge. To be honest, I've never seen anything like that before. It was triangular-shaped, with 3 dim blue lights at each tip, with a steady-glowing red one in the center.   It slowly howered over the car at about 1,000 feet and gave me the strangest feeling.  ""Awe"" is a good word to describe it, I think.

My friend, who saw it but couldn't observe it well enough due to the fact he was driving, suggested it was an airplane.  When we stopped not even 10 seconds later to get out of the car and have a better look at it, it has already vanished.

Around october time of 2003 i happened to have a sighting. It was probably around 9pm -9:30. I was walking back from the shops to the block of flats where i lived with my mother at the time, when an egg shaped object flew above me. It moved without sound, point forwards, with a tail of light (maybe as long as the craft itself), south-east-south over the road and disapeared above the flats where i lived. There are a number of variables that make this sighting hard to describe. Its speed, i suppose, could be comparable to the speed of a jet plane when viewed from the ground, namely very slow but if this thing was flying at the same height as a plane then it was about the size of a football feild. You see the problem. If i make a guess at size, speed, or altitude then all other factors have to change accordingly. Added to this is the fact that it happened two years ago and it was a clear night (no clouds = no frame of referance). If i had to guess though i would say it was moving at around ten miles an hour and was the size of a school bus, maybe 75ft high. My second problem is in actualy describing the object itself. As i have already said it was egg shapped flying silently point forwards with a tail of light following behind it. It was the way it was lit that is hard to describe. It was seemingly lit from with, white/orange and white/yellow but it was not transparent. Maybe a better description would be than it seemed to be superheated. Its my opinion that most of us, even those who want to believe are completely grounded in reality and not realy well equiped to deal with events dubbed paranormal. I dont mean to say that we panic but that we have a hard time with acceptance. maybe thats just me. As a result i have spent the last two years half doubting what i saw. You have to wonder how many people experience such things yet dont report them out of just such scepticism or fear of ridicule. Luckily i have faced no ridicule but i have faced incredulity from the people i have told. I cant blame them for this, i doubted myself after all. This morning came like a wakeupcall. What i saw was no conventional aircraft, it was not swampgass, venus, or streetlight reflecting of duck buts and pardon the expression but if that was a comet or meteor then we would all be fucked right now. What i saw was something else. In the spirit of exploration i have spent this morning surfing the net trying to find similar accounts. Incidently my mother is going to go nuts. I can see another phone bill coming in with £90 internet charges this quarter. Still im the one that has to pay them. Anyway. Back to the story. I came across this report: Occurred : 4/9/2004 21:37 (Entered as : 04/09/2004 21:37) Reported: 4/11/2004 11:17:44 PM 23:17 Posted: 4/27/2004 Location: Not Given (Canada), ON Shape: Egg Duration:Approx: 20 seconds Egg shaped (dark orange on inside, light orange/yellow on outside). Shape of objects: egg shaped (dark orange on inside, light orange/yellow on outside) Full Description of event/sighting: (name deleted - second witness) and I were sitting outside talking. I looked up into the sky towards the Big Dipper and noticed around 10-15 glowing objects moving at a fluent pace in a unorganized 'V' shape. Once I noticed the objects, I had enough time to tell (name deleted) after stuttering. (Name deleted) looked in the direction that I was pointing to and jumped up and walked over to the fence, where we both watched the objects disappear moving North. These egg shaped objects in an orange/yellow glow were moving too fast and were too close together to be regular aircrafts. There was no sound at all and no flashing lights to indicate it was man-made. We were hesitant to contact you, but after viewing pictures in the ""Newbury, Ontario Egg Shaped Objects- photos"" link placed on your website after sketching our own drawings we were stunned that the photos taken were similar to our own interpretations. The sighting took place around 9:37 p.m. Friday, April 9, 2004. We both came in and did our own rough sketches that are signed and dated. My many thanks to the witnesses for their report.

If you should decide to post this report i would be gratefull if you could leave my contact details as they are. If anyone has had a similar experience or witnessed the same event and would like to get in touch with me i would be very gratefull to you.  I wrote this report yesterday for a seperate site but am tring to get it posted on as many sites as possible. Since then i have figured out by reading other peoples reports thatthis type of ship changes color according to the speed it is flying. At high speeds it appears to be a dark red. This fades to orange and then yellow as it slows down. (my sighting was mostly yellow which fits in with the slow speed)",2005-07-05T00:00:00,,

As they traveled, they formed a straight line. Their flight trajectory was from the NNE to the SSW. This formation appeared to be flying at high altitude, but as it was a clear day, thus difficult to distinguish the relationship between size and altitude. (I estimate they were at above 9000m and appeared to be 2-3mm in diameter when seen from the ground). They made no contrails. They were visible until I got into my house, and when I went to find them a few seconds later in the sky again in the location I would presume they would be in (off to the SSW) they had disappeared.  I am a high school student with honours in all my courses, and have been an aviation enthusiast since I was 5. I know both civilian and military aircraft, and have never seen any craft perform or look like these. They were distinctly spherical and white-silver in colour, making no noise as they flew.

It was after work, I usually would work from 1pm to 10pm at that time but I was doing a training and was out by 430-530pm. My friend came to pick me up from work because she was coming out to orange county to stay with me for a while so we left her car at my work parking lot, we got into my car and preceded to head south bound on azusa ave in the covina/azusa area. We were driving in the left lane on azusa heading toward the 10 freeway maybe about 1-2 miles from the freeway. I looked up and saw a silver, perfect orb in the sky. I could tell it was metallic and not plastic such as a balloon because of the reflection of the sun on its right side. The orb or sphere did not move and i cannot tell if it was spinning because it was pretty much a perfect looking circle in my vision. I look down at the road and my spedometer, I looked up at the spehre again, i would say it must have been between 200-300 feet above the surface and maybe 10-15 feet in diameter. I asked my friend if she saw the spehere i was looking at and she kind of non caringly said yeah i see it. She acknowledged it being there so I knew my eyes were not playing tricks on me. I continued down azusa ave and moved into the left lane as i approached the freeway, I pass by a couple of trees on the sidewalk and as i past 1 tree I saw the object inbetween the gap before the second tree. After I passed the second tree it disapeared. I have not thought much about it since, and have had no other UFO experiences. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

What attracted our attention was the loud noise from a Blackhawk helicopter beating as it was flying as top speed with white lights pointing forward and about a half mile ahead of the helicopter was a very low flying disk.  It was very large (larger than 747)and made no noise, it was as if it was floating in the air and the flying so low that I could have shined a flashlight on it.  I could not tell if the helicopter was just following the craft or chasing the craft.  I believe the blackhawk was trying its best to keep up with the craft and because the lightes were pointing forward, I am sure the craft was just following the craft.  The craft may have had troops on board in case it crashed and would be able to secure the area if it crashed.  We were very frightened as the craft flew over our heads and condinued flying south and we lost sight of the craft and helicopter over the city of Victorville.  There were absolutely no lights on the craft.  Iam retired military and well aware of what blackhawk helicopter looks like, the helicpoter was completely black and no markings visible. It is very strange that an object that large should have made a tremendous nois, but not a sound could be heard,,only the helicopter following it.  Both craft and helicopter flew very low over our heads and I am sure they saw us looking up and watching it fly over our heads.  The craft we saw could not have been man made...our technology is not that advanced. We both have been very reluctant to say anything to anyone.  My friend still does not like to talk about it.  Afraid of what may happen if the word gets out what we saw.  Since that date, we both have witnessed another UFO over the town of Norco, California.  I really need some time to be able to talk about it.  Well, I felt someone should know what happened that night and I am sure the government has full knowledge and access to such craft from other worlds.

I went down to the kiychen to get a glass of water. As I drank it I glanced through the window at the lake. It was breath-taking as the moon light was reflected on the surface. Then I notied something moving. It looked like a number of bright objects were racing all over the water surface. Then it hit me, the images I was watching were reflections! I glanced upat the night sky and what I saw I will never forget, six to nine blurry lights were dancing through the night sky. At first I thought they were just spot lights or northern lights. But I soon realized that neitherof them could be going as fast or as bright as the objects I was watching. I dashed inside to wake my family. We watched the lights, fascinated for 5 minutes while my uncle went to grab a telescope.This was a very nice telescope and on clear nights could see mars as a reddish light. So he came running back with this telescope and peered through it. We all in turn looked at the dancing lights and I can only describe them as roundish balls emiting a bright pale green colour. We did not seem them in huge detail but enough that I could be sure that they were nothing man-made. The lights pranced across the sky for a while longer until they receded up into the black oblivion of space. The very next morning, crop circles had appeared right under the lights. I do not know to believe weither it was a very elaborate prank or, it was actually real ufo's.

One night I saw a slender ovular-shaped, bright white light, which seemed to emanate or radiate out from below.  So I figured if I could be underneath it, it would probably look like a saucer (circular) shaped craft.  I also estimate it was really long, because the Uptown are of my Hometown is probably a couple miles from where we lived back then. I walked up the steps to the new deck to get a better view.  It was just moving across the sky horizontally (over or behind the Uptown hills of my hometown, maybe one hundred feet off the gorun ((sic--ground??)) or more).  Then it stopped, then ascended, until it looked liked it left our atmosphere.  I can't remember now whether it was moving away or going towards Concord Naval Weapons Station. I still feel bad because to this day I wish I could have waken my Mother and Step-Father, because I could have knocked on their sliding-glass door.  But I was so in awe of this craft, all I could do was stare at this object moving across the sky.

It was completely round and solid black, and it seemed like it was not moving at all.   I realized at once that this was no cloud because it stood out so well between them.  The whole thing was just a basketball sized round black object sitting stationary in the sky.  It looked just like a solid round black circular ball object of some sort.  This told me that whatever the thing was is was definately far away and very high up in the sky.  If this was a balloon of some sort then why was it black I asked myself, and it appeared to be not moving at all.   I had to keep my attention on the moving traffic and I finally lost sight of the object.

I came out an saw what looked like a bright star, but which clearly included pulsing blue and then red lights.  The blue and red lights were clearly visible.  At first I assumed that it was an aircraft of some type, but the light source seemed not to be moving across the sky like a jet would.  It was holding it's position.   After observing the light for several minutes, I called my brother who lives approximately 10 miles away and asked him if he was able to see the light as well.  Both he, his wife, and my sister, who lives in the same neighborhood clearly saw the light, and agreed that the light was very clearly pulsing red, blue and white.  We both continued to watch the light for approximately an hour, until it slowly slipped below the tree line, where I was no longer able to watch it.  My brother was able to see the light for approximately another 1/2 hour because his home is not surrounded by trees, as mine is.  Relative to Mendon MA, which is south west of Boston MA, the light appeared to be around 10 degrees south of due west, and started off  at approximately 15 degrees above the horizon.  My brother also thought that he saw another similar light source due west at a higher altitude.  I looked there as well to confirm his sighting of a second similar light source, and saw it as well, but it was not nearly as bright, and to be honest, while it looked similar, I could not make it out well enough to say with 100% certainly that it was also pulsing blue and red.  My daughter told me that the light was pointed out to her by a friend of hers prior to telling me about it, and her friend stated that she had first noticed it in the same approximate location the night before.  We will be looking for the light again tonight.  I can't help but assume that this light was perhaps either a satellite or maybe even the space station.  I understand that early this morning there was a docking, so perhaps what we were watching was the docking lights of the space station.  I tried to look on the net for a description of space station docking lights, but could not find any.  Also I'm not sure if the space station would stay in on location in the night sky.  Also, unless they were testing the docking lights the night before, docking lights would not explain why my daughter's friend saw the same  lights the night before.  I was quite embarrassed to do this, but after observing the light for approximately 55 minutes, I called a local TV station in the hopes that perhaps they could get a better look at the lights in the sky.  I never hear any mention of the reported lights on the news, I can only assume they thought it was a hoax.  I have no idea what I saw, and unfortunately all I really saw were pulsing lights, and I could not make out any form other than the lights themselves.  However I can say with 100% certainty, that the lights were indeed pulsing red, blue and white.  I am a 43 year old engineer, as is my brother, and neither of us are the type of people to cry wolf, but this was most definitely the strangest thing I have ever seen in the sky, and I hope to see it again tonight.  I hope others see it as well so that I can get an explanation of what I saw.

At about 8:35 p.m.,  in the east/southeast sky, about 35 degrees above the horizon, several of us parents noticed a bright light that we assumed was a airplane moving toward our location many miles off.  The light did not fly in a straight line and we all took notice of this.  The motion of the light was very fluid back and forth as it flew toward our location from the east.  As the light approached closer, still miles away, the light became larger and red in color and the light from it appeared to have  rays or spikes  radiating from the center (like a stereotypical depiction of a bright star/star of Bethlehem).   The light began to dramatically fall some distance.  It grew much brighter and glowed orange-red, and we all assumed this must be a giant meteor coming down. It did not fall too far though, and again gained some altitude, started flying again and proceeded extremely fast mainly south-southwest.  It was never flying in a straight line and always wandering from side-to-side or up-and-down.  It then appeared to explode, but the light did not disappear, it again looked more white and flew very fast far to the south.  We lost sight of it as it went over the tree line.  The light never got very close to our campsite and at the highest was about 50-55 degrees up from the horizon.  There were about 200 people present, most of whom were paying attention to scout activities around a very large campfire.

The light was an orangish color in eastern sky, due south from Mars which was visible in the sky that night as well.  I estimate the object to be somewhere over the Cherry Valley/Beaumont area.  Light was at first a single, clearly visable light and was easily seen with the naked eye and seemed to be hoovering in one general area with some slight but quick movements. Small flashes of light appeared to drop from underneath the object, appear brilliantly and then fade out (not a flare).  After a few of these lights were seen the single light turned into three lights, possibly four, but the three lights formed what could be described as a triangle shape (clearly seen on the video in still frame).  We counted 6 of these objects being dropped on video before it disappeared.  In reviewing the video there appears to be some form of movement above the light which I thought could make it a helicopter (not sure why a helicopter would be dropping something over a populated area though)?  Side note: I and my family (wife and two sons have witnessed this same type of light on 6 seperate occasions beginning last May.

Time:  Sunday Evening, 10-23-05, about 11:00 PM  Place: Somewhere along Hwy. 30, Northern Utah, west of Hwy. 84 around Park Valley  Event: UFO Sighting   My two sons, 24 & 30 yrs. old, one of their friends (asleep at the time) and I were traveling back home to California from Preston, Idaho.  I was driving at the time along a very dark roadway (clear skies with a waning partial moon) looking for the correct turn toward Wells, Nevada, when the 3 of us that were awake saw an object above the truck. I was wide-awake, for we mandated that a ‘co-pilot’ always stay awake to keep the driver alert and it was still the early part of the trip.  ((name #1 deleted)) was the co-pilot while ((name #3 deleted)) and sleeping ((name #2 deleted)  were in the back seat.  ((name #3 deleted)) was helping us navigate correctly (extremely minimal highway signage in that part of the country).  ((name #3 deleted)) could also see the object while sitting in the back seat of the 4-door pick-up truck.   The truck we were in is a 2005 Chevy with a lift-kit, thus the headlights (on high beam at the time) shine higher than a normal truck and are very, very bright covering a good distance and a wide, high area.  I don’t believe that we would have seen the object if the headlights operated as manufactured.  The surrounding countryside was devoid of anything except relatively flat land with low brush and the roadway.  All three of us saw the unidentifiable object in the lower sky, traversing relatively fast from left to right.  I’m surmising South to North or SE’ly to NW’ly.  It was sometime between 10 PM and midnight.  My rendition of the sighting: I recall the object traversed a visible distance of maybe 1000 feet and was seen for about 4- 5 seconds.  It appeared to be about 300-500 feet in front of us (about 1/2 the distance of the traverse or less) and at 200-300 feet in altitude (about 3 times the visible length).  For some reason at the time it reminded me of a ‘flying boxcar with windows’, I don’t know why but that’s what I sensed it looked like.  The definitely-visible portion of the object was roughly rectangular in shape and hazy around the edges (long-ways parallel with the ground) with several (4 - 6) dimly lit ‘windows’ along that length.  The ‘windows’ seemed more square-like in shape as I recall, rather than round-like.  At each end of the object was a roughly-visible indistinct area that was darker-than-the-sky and about 1/2 the definitely-visible length, or more.    A distinct outline of the entire object wasn’t evident and it seemed there was no distinct bottom.  Again, as previously stated it appeared to look like a ""flying boxcar with windows"" or to a lot lesser degree a passenger train car, while sensing at the time the feeling that a massive, heavy object was traveling in the wrong place, the sky.  The light intensity reflecting off the object was similar to watching a car maybe 20-30 feet away drive through the beam of a fixed flashlight held horizontal.  The visual clarity was slightly dull with no sort of glowing or trailing evident.  I definitely recall the object was absolutely silent and colorless. I believe that I can judge distances fairly well because I like to hunt upland game & waterfowl and am also a licensed land surveyor.",2005-11-03T00:00:00,41.7419,-113.4433

I went outside to call a friend and noticed the three red lights.  They were definatley way to high to be a helo, and too quiet and too still to be an aircraft (a jet turbine requires far too much inlet pressure, and these objects were moving relatively slow, too slow to power a jet turbine).  While I first started watching the lights, I noticed an airplane flying through the area, I first thought the lights would react to the plane, but they just kept moving very slowly.  The airplane flew over me in about thirty seconds, the 3 lights remained.  I got my friends outside of the bar to see them.  They slowly circled each other, 3 red glowing balls, slowly getting brighter, then dimming themselves out.  They had moved from a staggered line formation (when I first saw them) to a broken triangle formation.  After my friends were watching for about fifteen minutes, the top one on the triangle did its normal, bright then dim out routine, but after it dimmed it never returned.  The remaining two lights moved very slowly around each other.  After I had seen them we were deductively going through possibilities of why they were getting dim and brighter.  My one friend suggested cloud cover, but the sky was completely clear.  My parents had contacted me via my cell phone, and informed me they we watching the lights as well.  Now from where I was standing, they looked very far in the distance and to the north.  My father had informed me that they were very close over the golf course next to our house (george w dunne. forest preserve course/yankee woods) and insisted that they were withing the atmosphere, therefore ruling out a possibility of satellites.

My boyfriend came back in and told me that the lights were real.  I then went outside myself to see them. They were there and it was the strangest thing I have ever seen.  They looked like stars because they were diffinetly far enough away that they could have been stars but they were flashing.  There was three at first and then one red light disappeared.  They were at first in the shape of a triangle and then the lined up in a straight line.  The next thing I know the one on the far right disappeared.  The almost looked like beacons of some sort.  Like a plane has except they were further than a plane would ever be and they moved very very slowly across the sky.  They were bright enough where anyone could notice them.  Whatever it was it had no problem flying over a populated area.  It also made it easier to see them considering it was a clear night out.  If it was cloudy it would have been more difficult to see them.  Eventually I just got tired of watching them and went into the house around 1:30am. They were still out there though when I went in.

For as long as I can remember, my neighbour and I have noticed a large light in the sky North East of our town.  It did not twinkle like a star or planet, just stayed in the same spot.  My husband was sick, and I came out to the living room to see how he was feeling at 3:00-3:05AM .  He was asleep.  I sat down to have a cigarette.  I looked out the window and saw two small lights (white), with a flashing white light behind them.  At first I thought it was a plane.  It came up to the light (spot) in the N.E. sky and stopped. I went outside at that time.  I could hear a slow and distant whump....whump....whump.  What amazed me was, it took the light that had been in the sky for as long as I could remember away.  I came back in and woke my husband, he came outside with me but could not see enough ot it to discount it as anything but a plane or helicopter.  It had come in from the West and continued in the same straight line. Last night, May 29th 2005, I stayed up until 3:00am.  There is no longer any light in the North East sky.  For me it was a UFO.  I like to believe that there is life on other planets but this was a little much for me to wrap my brain around. The object formed an irregular triangle, a total of three lights.  I could not see any solid substance within those lights, it was too far away.  Until I hear from someone else, I am telling myself that NASA sent something up to retrieve a dead satellite.  I hope that the NASA idea is correct because if it's not my other guess is a little to creepy for me to entertain.  Were we being observed?

Went out to the backyard to check on the pool. (Sometimes, the Polaris sweeper gets stuck or tangled, which requires regular babysitting when it is in operation.)  While doing so, I heard a plane flying nearby.  I like airplanes so I try to catch a glimpse of them when I hear them. I could tell it was close by the sound but couldn't see it anywhere.  A few seconds later, I saw it pop up from behind some trees that were blocking my view to the northwest. It was a small single-propeller airplane, probably a Cessna. As I watched it for a second or so, I noticed a dark object roughly in the same line of sight as the plane but approximately twice as far and about twice the altitude.  At first, the object seemed to be changing shapes and I thought it was a bird or perhaps a garbage bag that the wind had gotten hold of. As I kept watching, I noticed that the object was stationary. By then I was fixated and I realized that the object was not changing shapes but rather was changing its orientation, which made it appear to change shapes.  The way the object's profile was changing was consistent with a disk shape that seemed to be wobbling, much like the way a spinning coin wobbles just before it rests on the table... only much slower. While I watched, I saw it start to move slowly and steadily towards the east. When I first saw it, it was directly north of me in my backyard.  There was a layer of scattered clouds at the time and they made for a good background to provide contrast for the object. Once, the sun peaked out for a few seconds and I caught a glimpse of a shine that made the object appear metallic.  As the object moved away, I mustered up the will to peel my eyes from it and ran into the house to get the new camcorder I bought a little over a month ago. My wife was napping at the time so I didn't have to explain my odd behavior.  By the time I returned to the backyard, the object had gotten very far. To further exacerbate the situation, I'm not very proficient with the video camera and had to use ""Easycam"" mode and hope for the best while I tried to control my excitement. I captured approximately two minutes of footage showing the object moving away from me in an eastward direction.  I zoomed in on the object a couple of times to highlight it but most of the footage is unzoomed to keep surrounding trees and structures within the frame for reference. The camera that was used is a Sony DCR-DVD403. I have sent a copy of the DVD that it produced to your address in Seattle. The third clip on the disk has the most useful footage.

Around 2315hrs, my wife observed an object flying in a strange manner and in a flight path that is not ever used. Southpoint Road leads to the Duke Power Allen steam plant and the main portion(s) of Lake Wylie. CLT International Airport is very close by but we were nowhere close to the flight path or paths that the airplanes ascend and descend.  When my wife observed this, she literally  snatched my arm and pointed the object to me (she was driving). When I viewed the object, I was in total awe. The object was a half mile from us and was flying over the lake. I figure that the object was 1000 feet (probably less) from the ground. The object from flying west as we were heading east. We slowed down and were moving at a snails pace on the road to observe this phenomena. The object stopped, appeared to hover and then performed a swift 90 degree turn and was heading in our direction (towards the steam plant). We kept driving (slowly) and then noticed the object had changed course (back to the west). We then turned our vehicle around and went back to the original spot of where we viewed the object. When we arrived, the object was back in it's original position. We pulled into the high school parking lot and sat there viewing the object. Then the craft took a southerly course and flew over Gaither Road (towards the other side of Lake Wylie). The craft had NO SOUND and a dull yellow glow on the bottom. The three lights were dull also but a tad brighter. When the craft pulled away, it kept at a very slow pace and was very close to us. Unfortunately, there were a lot of trees/angle to where we could not track it after that. I am a 4 year veteran honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy.

It was a clear day as far as I can recall--little or no cloud cover.  Something caught my eye which I first assumed was an airplane. It was slightly (5 degrees maybe?) to the right of straight ahead of the car and maybe a few degrees above horizontal, meaning that I could easily look at it with only a tiny eye movement from where my eyes would be normally while driving. I dont know how to estimate the distance because I dont know the size of the object but if it had been a commercial jet I would have guessed that it was several miles away. If I held my arm straight out this object would have looked the size of, or smaller than my thumbnail.  It was silver in color. The shape was indeterminate and I could not make out wings, a tail section or any features for that matter. What first caused me to be particularly curious about it was that it didnt seem to be moving. Everytime I glanced up at it it appeared to be in the same place. Had it been a plane it would have been slowly making its way across the sky but it didnt seem to be doing that.  So I continued to look at it for another minute or two while driving. Then, it began to change color, to darken to a grey and then a dark grey. This took about 3 seconds. Then, right as I was looking at it, I could no longer see it at all. It had kind of faded away quickly.  I pulled my car over and got out so that I could see clearly and there was nothing there but blue sky. I looked carefully around the area of the sky where I had seen it thinking that perhaps it had moved and I'd lost track of it but I could never re-aquire it.  Peter, I dont know why I didnt report this nearer the time it happened. Maybe it was just too vague an experience. Anyway, there it is. I hope it can add to your data.

I watched it for about 15 seconds, during which it moved from being fairly high in the sky to being fairly low, when it was hidden behind some clouds.  I had seen several meteors before I saw this star move.   The star moved too slowly to be a meteor and there was no trail behind it.  The only oddity about the star, other than the movement, was that it appeared to flicker or twinkle less than the others.   After it caught my attention, it appeared to be more solid than the other stars.  I could not see how far away it was or how quickly it was moving, except that it was on the other side of the clouds.

I was at a festival on a farm, with several hundred people in attendance.   The sky was cloudless and no city lights interfered with the view.   I was standing on a hillside and looking out over a small valley with another small hill dotted with trees about 200 to 300 yards away.  Above the trees I could see a sky full of stars, some bright, others dimmer, and many others that faint speckled color you get on such clear and crisp evenings in the autumn and in rural areas.   As I looked up into the sky, I noticed that an object the size of a dimmer star was moving, but in an up and down, back and forth, and ""s"" like fashion.  And, it was moving as if it was like a laser pointer in that it was not the speed of an airplane but simply too swift and too unorthodox.   After it caught my attention, I watched some more and tried to fix on it so get to an approximate distance.  What was really curious was that it seems to be ""among"" the stars but if that were true, it was moving at 100's of light years a second, which was simply both impossible and most likely to be measured by every astronomer on the planet.   It clearly had to be within earth's atmosphere, or just on the edge of space.  On the other hand, if that was the case, and using either the speed of high altitude plants or satellites as a gauge, it was moving over a few 100,000 miles per hour, which was impossible both because of lack of technology and its maneuverability.  It seemed ""playful.""  When I concluded this, I noticed a second light that it seemed to be playing with.  They would chase, do the loop-the-loop, squiggle, zig-zag (but not with sharp angled cuts), and move otherwise chaotic or seemingly randomly.   After about 10 minutes I was convinced I was seeing something, but still wanted to confirm what I was seeing was real, or at least could call on one witness later on to confirm it.   I called a friend over and pointed it out to him.  He too saw them, stood for a minute, remarked on how curious they were, but then left to chat up a female near a bonfire.  I stayed and watched some more.   I guess that they had to be about 20-30 miles away but this guess still played havoc with the idea that they seemed equal size or visual appearance to a somewhat faint star.   Whatever they were, they were there, they were not airplanes, helicopters, satelites, or weather balloons.  They did not hover.  If they moved slowly like an airplane one would not have noticed them.   But, from the place I was at, they also were faint enough not to draw attention from the crowd.  No other details could be made expect that they were lights moving in incredibly unorthodox fashion and did so for about 20 to 30 minutes...maybe longer, but then I remember the women over by the bonfire and went to join them.

He said he didn’t, so we both stood there watching it.  After we had both acknowledged  that it was there, the object floated upwards, then was zig-zagging left and right.

Then it crossed east onto the street that ran right next to the park we were standing in. at this time my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to go back inside his house, and feeling uncomfortable and frightened by the light, which seemed very headlight like.  We ran towards his house, and the light unmistakably followed us. Now the light was three lights, one a headlight that shone outwards towards us, and the other two pointed towards the ground.  My boyfriend looked back up at it, now above us, and said it was a black triangle shape. It made no noise and emitted no trail, and it also blacked out the stars behind it. It was approximately 70 feet in width and only about 50 feet above the ground.  we ran in the house and were too afraid to venture outside to see if it had left.

As it approached the downtown city lights it vanished and simultaneously a meteor appeared, following the same trajectory as the object had.  I have one witness with me who saw me pointing to this object, but he couldn’t see it himself. He instead followed my eyes as I was following the object and he saw the subsequent meteor. I said to him as I watched this object ""look at that, there are no lights, yes, there are three lights"". I said “no lights” first because there were no red or white blinking lights that you would see normally see on a plane. I knew there were no wings in other words. I don't understand how he could not have seen the object, it was large enough, close enough and there were no other objects visible in the cloudless, starry sky. He was absolutely convinced I was seeing and watching and following this object with my eyes, and the meteor happening at the same time I said to him ""it's vanished"" was quite a coincidence. No alcohol or other substances involved.  The object was about the size of a large airplane and was caterpillar or ameba-like with three ""dome"" type lights beneath it that did not radiate any sort of light downward. The lights took up at least 80% of the underside of the object. There were no other lights on the side or top or around it at all.  It made no sound at all, yet was flying low enough (maybe 10,000 ft) that if it were a regular airplane, you would have heard sound. It was too late for a normal airplane to fly over my house. It moved very ""smoothly"" across the night skyline. It appeared completely in synch with the sky, as if it was traveling on water. When I say caterpillar-like it was because of the fluidity of its movement – like it wasn’t a completely solid structure, it seemed to move and bend in a way a plane never would.

While walking my dog before going to bed, I noticed a bright light that was rapidly approaching from the east heading in a north-westerly direction. The elevation at that point was about 30 degree. The light was a bright yellowish-white that was brighter and larger than the ISS when it is directly overhead. There was a small strobe light to the lower right of the larger light slightly detached, that was flashing in about 1 second intervals. The motion of the light was smooth like the ISS but it was going more than twice as fast as the typical speed of the ISS.  The light moved along a left-handed long sweeping turn. When it passed to the north of my position, it was at an elevation of about 70 degrees. It continued to a point at about 50 degree elevation in the north-west. At that point, the craft must have made a course correction by making a smooth but easily noticeable turn to the south-west. As it came out of this turn, the light increased in brightness by a factor of three or four for about 2 to 3 seconds. It was by far the brightest light in the sky at that moment. It then went briefly very dim for about 2 seconds as if something structural was obscuring the light source but I could still see the glow of the light behind it. It then brightened again for about 2 seconds to the intensity it had been when it passed to the north of me. The light and even the glow then totally disappeared and all I could see the was the strobe plus a fainter strobe nearby that was about 1/2 second out of synch with the first strobe. When they receded, the strobes has a reddish hue. I was able to follow them until the object disappeared over the roof of a house heading due south. The elevation was then about 30 degrees.  The entire affair from first seeing it and then losing sight of it lasted no more than one minute. There was absolutely no sound, even when it made the turn south and it seemed fairly close at that point. There may have been other, fainter lights but I could not clearly see them because I was in an area where there were several bright street lights.  When I got home, I checked ""Heavens Above"" and found that the ISS will not be visible in my area until August 7th.

It then veered off to the north and revealed a fourth light, and when the fourth light became visible it looked like a kite the size of a B-52, possibly a little larger. When it was in this kite shape it appeared to be stationary.  We took the exit on Grand to get closer to it and get a better look. We went north and it then revealed a fifth light and we lost track of it very quickly as it headed east over a group of houses. We caught up with it again about a mile further east and it was in the triangular pattern again. We followed it going north for a while but took an eastbound road again to follow it more.  It was at this point that the object flew directly over our heads (the object was heading south), and when it did that it seemed to be 5 lights in a boomerang shape, the three leading lights were dim and the tail lights were extremely bright. while it flew overhead we stopped the car and rolled the windows down to see if it made any noise, and it did make a very odd sound.  The object then did an about face and started heading north again. We began moving further east as it did this, and  when it had gotten a couple miles north of us, it went back into the line pattern and landed, very shortly, and then took off again. We lost track of it for a short time after it took off again.  We caught up with it again going southbound on Lakeside, and it was in the boomerang configuration at this point, and we saw it going at an amazing speed in a southern direction. We were going about 70 miles an hour south, but it was almost overhead to nonvisible in a matter of seconds.",2005-04-16T00:00:00,35.1857520123839,-101.86299179566564

The time was 5:20am,(I had just looked at the clock when I changed the radio station).  The object was moving across my vision from left to right so it should have been from west to east at that point.  I couldn't tell much about the shape so I will describe it as more of a spherical point of light.  It was a white light that strobed in and out fairly quickly.  Every few seconds it would change color to red or green.  Sometimes I could see the two colors at the same time.  I was able to watch the object on and off from the 95th st. exit to almost I55.  I lost it around there. As I merged onto I55 a similiar object appeared in front of me again.  This time a little bit closer but I still could not make out the shape.  It moved in the same general direction as the object I had previously seen but headed a little bit more south east than directly east.  It didn't change colors as often and it seemed to flash faster as the object picked up more speed.  I glanced back at the road and when I looked at the sky again the object was gone. The sky was clear and the moon was bright this morning.  I could see some stars through the city lights.

Satellite has since has disappeared. About 3:00AM I couldn’t sleep and was looking out the window.  I noticed a distant bright star in the sky I assumed was a satellite.  Suddenly I could see about a dozen small red globes of light appear to leave the satellite and head toward the earth.  It looked like something from a video game.  This startled me so my attention was fixed on the object.  As I watched I observed multiple red globes of light going to and from the satellite toward the earth and back.  Watching this phenomenon for period of a couple of hours I confirmed this was indeed a stationary object and therefore a satellite.  In spite of the red globes I was tired and dismissed the object and went to sleep. The next night it appeared again and the same red globes went to and from the object as before.  I woke my wife up to make sure I wasn’t crazy and she watched the red globes going to and from the object toward the earth.  We were both amazed. On the third night I watched this object again and the red globes traveling to and fro.  On the forth night the object was gone and never reappeared.  That’s when I wasn’t so sure what I observed was ordinary because stationary satellites always remain in the same place. The direction was in the North Eastern sky.  It could be a military experiment or some other perfectly explainable occurrence.  I don’t know what I observed so I felt it was worth reporting to your database. I did roll video but nothing appeared likely because my camera was a very old model and had no night capability.  I still have the 8mm tape of the attempt somewhere in my drawer.   I am an extremely skeptical person but this experience certainly has provoked some second thoughts. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Suddenly, a huge black horizontal bar emerged fom behind the mountain which separates the Caracas valley from the sea.  Then, probably as a result of a change of axis became a sort of black oval shaped ring which went on moving, very slowly and silently, across the Caracas Valley towards the observers (4) situated 600 meters above the town level (1OOO meters).   The ring never reflected the sun rays and remained strikingly black but its edges were a little hazy and seemed to be undulating sligly.   This flying object could have been about 10 times as big as a standard passenger aircraft, frequently seen from the place of the sighting.   After 20mn, it changed direction and aimed towards a cloud where it stayed put as if it tried to hide.  As the cloud was translucent, the object could still be seen but as minutes went by the cloud became darker, grew a kind of tail looking like a sea medusa and it became more and more difficult to distinguish its host.  Nevertheless one could see that the ""ring"" was taking the cloud along with to reach a mass of clouds on the horizon and finally disappeared for good.

It sounded like a Kawasaki motor cycle reved to about 15,000+ RPM's!   I jumped up to see if I could spot it but saw nothing. The sound lasted only about 15 sec then was gone. The next day one of the farm hands came by and told me some local kids were riding their dirt bikes in the gravel pit when they saw a craft take off out of there. I asked him if it was at about 8:30 last night and he said yes it was.  I told him I heard the thing take off. He asked me if it would be alright if the kids came back there to talk to me about it because they thought they were nuts.  I told him it was. The kids stopped by and told me what it looked like.  They said it looked like a barbell or two vertically positioned disks with a tube between connecting the disks.  I guess it looked like Darth Vader's fighter craft (!) which seems very odd indeed. The next day I took a walk down to the gravel pit to see if there were any marks on he ground.  I found an odd looking depression in the gravel.  It was conical like you would expect as if someone had removed some ground in gravel and the sides caved in to form a cone shape but, there was no sign of the removed dirt nearby!  It was as if something was extracted from underneath and the gravel settled back down into to the space below. There are some strange goings ons at this gravel pit during years of near Earth/Mars approaches as during my report of 1977. I would like to note that this year 2003 was a near pass year between Earth and Mars. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My girlfriend was driving, and I was slouched in the front passanger seat, looking out the windshield.  I saw a large, intensely white (at least it appeared white compared to the dark surroundings) ball of light fly through the sky, parallel to the road, traveling in the same direction as the car.  The light was travelling incredibly fast and appeared to be rather low to the ground, as it was out of sight within one second (however, my range of vision was limited, as I could only see it once it became visible through the windshield, rather than directly overhead).  By the time I could react it had vanished into the trees. My immediate thought was that it was some very large comet that had passed through the earth's atmosphere and was waiting to hear some deafening boom.  But I never heard a thing over the car radio.  My girlfriend claims that she did not notice it, which does not surprise me, as she was a bit tired and concentrating on driving, as well as the fact that the light disappeared almost instantly from view.

It then went behind the mountain, where it disappeard.  I stopped at a road near my home and saw all of it.

I tried taking video and a picture with my cell phone, but the object was too far away to get a good capture.

I told her, ""those two things in the sky."" She goes, ""Well there's three."" There was another one where the two first came together.  So I am freaked a little because things don't really move at right angles but figure it is pretty far away so could have made an actual turn and me not notice. An hour later I go back outside for another cigarette and there is another one. This time it is lower and bigger and now obviously spherical. It hovered there for a while and moved a bit. I thought maybe they were all balloons until a plane flew underneath it and it was still that big!  Then I had a revelation when I saw it go into the clouds. I could find out how big it was before I would decide if it was something odd. I noted the size and found out the cloud ceiling today was at 25000 feet.

I found myself outside my house in Towson Maryland in my underware at around 4am wondering why Im out here..I never have had a problem with sleep walking...nothing strang seemed like it had happened. Many years later 35 now I was living at a friends house in Mt washington Maryland ...my room in the basement I may have been abducted I cant tell if it was a dream or did it really happen? Im not sure but for some reason I keep recalling a very brite light like if head lights were shining in the sliding glass door in the room I was sleeping in. I think I came to in the backyard at the same time as seeing 2 dark saucers darting away over the tree tops.I went right back in and went to sleep but I felt like I had been through some trauma.It didnt seem like a big deal at that time but that dream or whatever it was keeps coming back to me.Sometime after that I developed an anal fissure which doctors thought were hemroids for the longest time...could this fissure be from a alien exam? Other strange things are the humming in my  right ear or right side of my head which started around 2/2000 that no doctor seems to have a anwser or solution for..it comes and goes and I havent had the humming for around a year now..maybe a few brief times since.Its more like an electrical hum from a large transformer.Lastly I have an obsession for ufo's and anwsers,I found out Im really good at algebra and math in general..I didnt even carry a notebook my last year of high school ..they wanted me gone..lol I was in the cop out program my last 2 yrs of high school.I did finish college with a degree in computer networking though 2002.I always have thoughts like I may have been programed or Im being monitored.If anyone else has simular experiences or you have some possible anwsers let me know.

I began to think maby it was a bad dream and left it at that, but that was until I did a search on flying triangles and saw all the reports and some videos with the exact same craft I realized that it must have been real.

Around 11 PM, I let my dogs out for a final time for the night; I looked up into the sky, as I do every night, and saw odd white circles of light in the SW sky. I live in the NW area of Ocala FL and the lights were clearly west and south of my house. Honestly, I feel a little silly telling this, but it was quite amazing to witness: The four white circles flew in bizarre, clearly geometric patterns, seeming to ""smack"" together and become one larger ball of light and immediately disperse into four separat balls of light. It was like a dance--a square dance, one might say--where the four couples turn and return.  I couldn't believe my eyes and looked for a ground source of light, but there was none. The sky was clear, and it was easy to see them.  They flew in ways no normal craft can fly, faster than I can describe, stopping cold and turning back over and over again. Another metaphor I might use to describe this is to picture them as large white billiard balls smacking together and breaking into varied patterns, stopping, turning back and smacking together again.  There was absolutely no sound at all, just light. I watched them for about half an hour.  I realized I should perhaps be frightened of this odd sighting, but curiously, I felt elated; they seemed joyful somehow. I'm sure it's ridiculous, but I sensed they were flying this dancing pattern just for fun. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of advertising lights?

It's this white oval shaped object hovering in the sky. It was not a cloud, as it was moving too rapidly to be a cloud, and it was not a plane. I am certain of this. It was not a balloon or anything like that. I don't think it was from around here. Anyway, I look up to see it heading towards a range of mountains we call ""The Pinnacles"". I watched it for a few seconds and all of a sudden, it was gone! I was astonished. No flash of light. No sound. Nothing. It was just gone. And the weird thing is, it was just this spooky object that made no sound. I got the chills, and I'm not sure if it was because I was really scared or if it was because I was pumped that I saw this. But then I thought, 'Probably just my mind playing tricks on me.' And that was that. Until a month or so ago. I went outside on the porch and I see that same white oval shaped object in the sky. It made no sound or anything, and it certainly didn't look like a plane. But the weird thing was, it was kind of near The Pinnacles where I saw the first white oval object. I rushed inside to grab the binoculars to see whether or not I could discern what the object was, and I couldn't find them so I rushed back outside. It was gone. I had only been inside for a few seconds, so I was puzzled. There were no traces of it whatsoever. It was totally weird. Then I look up to see another object, but it wasn't otherworldly or anything.

During the summer of 1967, I was about 5 years of age but have been having recurring memories of a 3 day event that happened.  My mother and sister are still alive and have validated my memories of the event.  I went back home to Roseburg Oregon and interviewed the neighbor lady and her husband who still lived there who also remembered the event.  In August of 1967, approx 7:00pm in the evening, 3 saucer aircraft appeared from the west traveling toward the east, and hovered above our neighborhood (we lived in a valley), approx 500 feet off the ground.  I rememeber my sister ran in the house telling us her car was enveleoped in a blue light as she was heading to work in a local movie theater.  I recall being scared as my mother turned all the lights off in the house.  We watched them from inside our home for about 5 minutes,  then slowly went outside to look. There was no sound.  Silent. In the air above our home approx 500 feet up were 3 disc shaped objects, with red-blue-green swirling lights rotating around the craft in a clockwise circular pattern.  They were about the size of a house, quite large.   I remember the colors being very striking, almost a neon glow only more intense.  On top was a large orange glowing dome, which reminded me of a lantern.   After 10 minutes, sprarks began to fall from beneath the crafts, at the same time.  Long showers of sparks falling with NO SOUND at all.   Suddenly, they accelereated so fast in a northly direction that it almost looked as if they disappeared. There was NO WIND either, as the sparks were all that remained falling in the air where the craft were. The sparks did not blow around as the craft left. It was as if the craft ""disappeared"".  This event ocuured precisely at 7:00pm for the next 2 evenings.  Exactly the same things happened, with the sparks falling after 5 minutes of them approaching from the west.  On the 3rd day, my sister went to her wealthy friends house on top of a nearby hilltop.  They had a telescope for star viewing.  My sister said when they appeared, she plainly saw what appeared to be round black windows where the orange glow dome was.  The craft was metalic.  The lights swirling around the craft were something she said she has never seen before. Beautiful colors just swirling around the outside edge of the saucer shaped craft. There were flames and sparks emitting from the bottom/center of the craft.  The airport was called during the 3 day event. They said they saw it, as the airport was only 5 miles away.  They said there was nothing on the radar screen, yet there they were.  The local news station had a report on the objects on the evening news the next day.  But right after that, no one spoke about it.  There were military officers I remember in the news, but not a word about any craft.  My mother, sister, friends all talked about it amongst ourselves, but never to anyone else as people would think we were were crazy, so we never talked about it.  I began recalling this whole thing about 15 years ago, and it has been getting more vivid, as if it just occured yesterday.  If I could take a photo of them from my mind, you would also agree this was not a helicopter or airplane that we know of.  I am sure there were pictures taken by townsfolk. There were FAR too many people who witnessed this. But what was weird was that it was NEVER talked about by the media again.  At any rate, I felt I needed to report this.

It was full and bright and very red, then blue, then green, then yellow and red again.  I saw 3-4 flying saucers and they hovered just outside in my back yard.  I walked outside in my pj's and looked up at them.  They streamed acrossed the sky and danced with colored lights.  I watched one land on the hill just behind my house and I remember walking up the hill and into the space craft.  I don't remember too much after entering the ship but I do remember not feeling afraid.  I walked back inside my house and got my glass of water and went straight to bed.  I woke the next morning and in my tiny little hand was a flower.  It was colored a brightly blue soft color with a red center and the sem was a greenish yellow tint.  I put it away inside a book so my mom or dad wouldn't find it.

One of the people ran the station and some friends would often come by at night to pass the time.  This station was on Woodbridge Avenue and led up to a town about two and a half miles away.   At that time the Raritan Arsenal was on the east side of the road and there was a strip of woods about a half a mile wide owned by the arsenal running up to the  the town on the other side of the road.  They saw a light go down in the woods and he closed the station down.  They drove up there and told everyone for about a week that they saw a flying saucer on the side of a service road.  Then, very oddly, if anyone asked about it, they would deny knowing anything about it.  They had spoken to the FBI, and maybe this had something to do with it. I was sriving down this road some time after this, and the traffic was stalled.  At some point I saw an MP directing traffic in the  road and thought to myself that this was the place were those people saw that thing.  The army had the woods there roped off and a tracter trailer on the side of the road.  Some time after this I was shooting my shotgun back there and walked into a field and thought for a moment that I was standing where there had been a fire, probabley in the summer, fires being common from people sitting back there and throwing cigarettes out the window.  But I then saw that there was a smooth edge to the area and the grass was not burnt but scortched, and I was standing on the edge of a circular area about a hundred feet across, with all the bushes, mostly blueberry and about six or eight feet tall and everything else crushed down.  There was no construction going on there, and this would be a hard hoax, since it would require heavy machinery and controlled burning near fire towers.   I can't find anything about this.

This happened when i was a kid-(im almost 35 now.)  I know i was around 13 or 14, and my little brother and his friend,who was spending the nite, (both around 10 at that time)-were outside after dark, probably around 8ish or so one nite during the summer.  We lived in rural Suffolk, and on a long dirt road.  Our house was surrounded by some open fields, and after those were lots of woods.  So, we were out there goofing off, and one of us notices this bright, orangey colored ball of light rising off in the distance.  I cant say for certain, but im certain this light was at least several miles away from us.  But this 'ball' still looked huge.  It just rose slowly, straight upwards--not sideways, not at an angle, but straight up in the sky.  This color was orangy, but could be described as an orangy-yellowish color too.  It was very bright, and VERY noticeable.  It was like watching the sun rise, except you could look at it, or like how a basketball might look big in the sky if you could float it at a distance in the air of around 2 or 3 storys high--That's how large it looked, even though it was obviously at a distance of several miles away from us. I do not recall if it pulsated or anything like that--im pretty certain that it did not, but i know that the color never changed, nor did the shape change at all.  The boys ran inside to get my folks.  My mom came out figuring it was probably an airplane or something.  However, she was just as puzzled, excited, and scared of this as we were.  She had no clue what it could be. We realized that the object was not rising any longer.  It was moving horizontally now, and towards us somewhat.  It was moving at a VERY slow, non-hurried speed.  When we realized it was moving towards us, my mom sent my brother in to get our dad.  The object was travelling more sideways than towards us.  It got closer, but not much.  We just stood there, watching it as it slooooowly made it way across the nite sky in front of us.  We could hear nothing at all!  After a minute or so of trying to convince our dad no one was pullin his leg, he came out like mom did at first--expecting to see an airplane or helicopter.  Instead, he caught a quick site of it as it finally disappeared over the tops of trees in the distance and we could no longer see it.  He TOO was mystifyied as to what it was.  I have never to this day seen anything that even remotely resembles it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Driving in somewhat desolate area on White Rock Rd near Aerojet.  Noticed stationary lights in sky at a distance.  Drove past and for some reason decided to turn around.  I turned my vehicle around and approached the area where the lights were located - again at a distance.  They were above an area that had a chain linked fence and was actually Aerojet property.   As I approached I noticed the outline of what appeared to be the outline of a bowl shaped figure.  As I brought my vehicle to a complete stop in the middle of the roadway, I noticed that the ""bowl shaped figure"" had begun to turn.   I focused upon the figure itself as it turned.  While my eyes were fixated on the figure at a distance, I suddenly and instantaneously sensed a very close presence.  Within the blink of an eye - the object that began it's turn at a distance completed it's turn two feet from the driver's side of my vehicle.   The object appeared to defy known physics and made absolutely no sound.   As it completed it's turn, several very bright lights came on.  I did not feel heat but the lights themselves were somewhat blinding.  Due to the closeness of the object to my vehicle and the lights - I could not see the object in it's entirety.   The portion of the object that I could see at that point, however, was not particularly bowl shaped but, rather, appeared somewhat rectangular and similiar to the front grill of a car (but much larger).  There were approximately a total of six lights- three on each side - that, again, were large and very bright.  When they went on - it was similiar to a ""lights, camera, action"" scenario where you see movie lights on a camera set turned on.   The object remained in the air and at it's lowest seemed suspended approximately one foot off the ground on the driver's side and at an angle.  The rear - that I could not see clearly - appeared  to be, perhaps, higher.  There was a window of sorts - somewhat similiar to the front window on a vehicle but smaller.   I detected movement from within but could not see anything clearly (and did not want to).  Initially I froze and then absolutely floored my vehicle in an attempt to get away.  As I swerved down the darkened two lane road, the object that was facing the driver's side of my vehicle turned with the lights remaining on and faced the back of my vehicle.   I watched it in my rearview mirror - fearing that it would follow.  It did not but, rather, turned once again, in the opposite direction.  I drove to Hwy 50 (nearby) and took some comfort in the fact that I was surrounded by other (known) vehicles.  To my left, however, as I drove a stretch of 50 heading home - I looked to my left and could see the lights of a very, very low flying object - flying parallel to me and at a distance.

There is a gas station right on the corner there and after we had passed it a little ways, we noticed something above us and looked up.  It wasn't very far up at all, it was close enough to appear bigger around than our heads (I don't know much about altitudes), and it was totally silent.  All I really remember was looking up at a circle which was just hovering over us, and I saw three round lights in the shape of a wide triangle (they were all closer to the outside than in, leaving the middle black) on the bottom. We, being 13-14 years old (and neither one of us had seen anything like it before) were pretty spooked and didn't stare for more a couple seconds before we started running.  We ran about half a block to a block and then turned around to take a second look (in curiosity, and also to proove to ourselves that we had actually seen what we did).  When we looked back it was no longer hovering in that spot. In the couple seconds it took us to run away, it had flown off and was way up in the sky. It didn't change shape or anything, we saw the side of it which looked like a thin oval (as most of the pictures you see of sightings look like), and could still see the three lights on the bottom spaced out to form a triangle.

Though I cannot remember the exact d/t, based upon where our lives were at the time, I do know that it had to be fall of the academic year 2002-2003.  I had just picked up my daughter at around 5:15 or so, and we were heading home to Blue Lake via Jane's Road/Guintoli Road in the northern reaches of Arcata, CA. (in a development area called Valley West).  The sun had set, the sky  was darkening to a deep purple, but there was still enough sky light that the hills to the northeast were clearly silhouetted, with some slope details still visible.  There were a very few stars starting to show the skylight combined with a hazy sky allowed only the very brightest to emerge at that time.  It was this paucity of stars that brought my attention to the lights.  We were heading north, approaching the point where Jane's Rd curves east to become Guintoli, when I noticed a formation of 4 very bright stars over the hills just northeast of us.  As we began climbing the overpass that Guintoli takes over US 101, I could see these stars more clearly and thought that there was something odd.  I interpreted them as a familiar constellation made peculiar by the selective manner in which the atmospheric conditions permitted its bright stars to appear earlier than the rest.  Honestly, I thought I was looking at the Big Dipper, but only its brightest components.  Still, they were preternaturally bright and they didn't seem high enough in the sky to be the Dipper.  I grew very puzzled and unsure of what I was looking at.  I called my daughter's attention to the ""stars."" Apparently she had already noticed them and was also trying to figure out what they were.  Unfortunately, there was no place to pull over and observe.  However, we got the definite impression that these ""stars,"" these lights, were moving.  What other real stars we could see were not near enough to confirm this.  Our direction was toward the lights, with those northeast hills between us and them, so there was not much in the way of lateral relative motion, making absolute motion easier to detect.  Since I was driving, I couldn't watch steadily, but my daughter could.  She was able to tell, after a little while, that they were  moving as a solid group as if in formation.  There was a stop sign along our route, and we were able to briefy watch them, and yes, they were definately moving in a northerly direction, perhaps somewhat east of north since they seem to be moving inland slightly.  There is an airport in a town not far to the north (McKinleyville), and I thought maybe we were seeing some kind of commercial aircraft or maybe something being flown by the Coast Guard which has its Air Station next door to the airport.  We dismissed these possibilities after watching while paused at the stop.  These lights did not flash nor pulse, and they were large, opaque, globular, almost solid looking, if light can be said to look solid.  Their color was a brilliant white, no other colors, no prismatic effects, no bluish or reddish hue, just white like wedding cake frosting.  They were not phosphorescent or neon-like, not fluorescent, but more like incandescent, though that's not quite right either.  They did not twinkle, nor dance, nor do any of the things that starlight does under atmospheric influence, they were dead steady.  In size, they appeared to be slightly larger than a large bright planet, Jupiter, on one its closer approaches, maybe, but clearer, with more well-defined edges. Since we were travelling in a car, we don't know if they emitted a sound. We proceeded on through the interesection, and I began looking for a place I could pull over to watch the lights.  We turned off Guintoli onto State 299 (the hwy we would take home), trying to keep the lights in view.  The lights' altitude was low enough and our relative positions and vectors were such that those hills rapidly got in the way.  As we were passing the lights (yes, rapid paralax changes also clued us in to just how close and low the lights really were), seeking a way off the road, one light suddenly disengaged itself from the formation and arced over its neighbor in a smooth curve.  Before we could see the final shape of the maneuver and the resulting formation, the crest of the hills and its trees obscured our view completely. I swung off onto a side road that would take us back the way we came, got back onto 101, and headed north toward the neighboring town, McKinleyville.  I had hoped that since the lights were heading more or less north and didn't seem to be in a big hurry, that we could pick them up again and watch them some more.  Unfortunately, by the time I had gotten back to 101, the lights were gone, either too far to the east to see past the hills, or they simply disappeared like these things have a tendency to do.  I was so excited that I phoned by son as soon as we got home.  He sees odd lights and objects all the time, so I knew he'd be interested in this.  As it turned out, he and his girlfriend had seen two simliar lights over Eureka just minutes before we first spotted our lights over north Arcata/Valley West.  This is why I put 4 witnesses in parentheses, if they were the same lights, then four of us saw them, not just two.  According to him and his girlfriend, they were in my mom's back yard watching the sunset.  The house is in west-central Eureka.  Not long after the sun had disappeared, his girlfriend noticed an odd bright light approaching from, if I remember right, the west, and my son saw one coming in from the south. The sky was still fairly bright for them, and these lights were quite brilliant despite the light sky. Note: At this latitude, at that time of the year, there are no long lingering sunsets, the sun would have fallen to the horizon as if gut-shot and the sky darken within 15 minutes or less.  That means their sighting could not have preceded ours by more than a quarter hour.  The two lights approached each other, one fell in behind the other, and both continued on in a northerly direction, heading toward Humboldt Bay, which lies between Eureka and Arcata.  These sounded like two of the very same lights that my daughter and I observed.  We surmised that they picked up two other companions somewhere between Eureka and north Arcata, and continued on north/northeast where we saw them disappear into the hills which skirt the eastern frontage of our coastal towns.  If you look on a map of northern Califormia, you will see that Eureka, Humboldt Bay, Arcata, and McKinleyville line the coast only a few miles from each other.  I will try to create a map of our sighting and mail it to you.  Our family has had a lot of weird sightings and other ""paranormal"" events.  I've often thought of writing them all down and sending them to someone doing research into these things who is looking for raw data, but I wouldn't know who to send them to.   I found your sight while looking for information on anomalous sky flashes such as the one our area experienced last Sunday.  (That has been explained, apparently, there were distant witnesses who saw a bolide).  If you would be interested in any other reports for your stats or whatever, let me know.   One thing I would like to know is if you received any reports of these same lights from this general area, or points north of here.  There was nothing in our local paper and I've not heard of anyone else who saw them.  My son is wondering if this isn't an example of the ""Pearl Necklace"" that has been seen in times past. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2005-11-08T00:00:00,40.853795454545455,-124.05069393939394

My brother also observed them.  He did not know what to make of it either. The line or lines of spheres were moving up and down and back up again like a roller coaster movement. They happened to move around a larger tree.  We estimated the sizes to be that of very large beach balls maybe 3 feet or larger in diameter, because of the distance we were from them. As we drove closer they moved out and around the tree then disappeared into the tall bushes and grass area. The terrain and the position of our vehicle made it difficult to visually track them once we caught up to the tree we first saw them at. We still dont know what they were.The terrain is very open and vegetation is sprawling. In some areas it is dense and some not. That is also strange to us.

The Sun was low in the western sky and blocked by high rise building.   The jet reflected the silver off the body of the aircraft.  I just happened to look off to the side and I noticed a small rice grain shaped object that was a reddish brown color, very subdued.   I watched it and at first I thought I was watching a very high flying bird or weather balloon.   I now saw another object that appeared to be about the same size.  I looked at my clock on the wall and it was 17:25 (5:25 PM MST).   I continued to watch for about 5 minutes as the two faint objects went around each other.  If I held out a silver dollar at arms length the two things would have circles that item.  At about 17:31 (5:31 PM MST) I noticed a very bright object appear.   Now that looked like a weather balloon, very bright, silver colored and the other two objects circled it.   One of the smaller object started to move southeast and a slow rate, about the speed of a satellite crossing the night sky.    The larger object and a smaller one stayed in the area of the northern sky, high angle to me.   I was under the impression that the objects were reflective and the light was reflected from the Sun and they were very high in altitude.  At this time a friend, lady was leaving the building and I showed her the two small objects and the larger one.   The objects were as follows.   The small one was traveling south east and I showed her.   The larger one was in the northern sky with one of the smaller one.   At this time another small object just appeared.  We both saw it and the lady stayed for a few minutes and watched but left to get a bus to go home.  It was 17:36 (5:36 PM MST.

The first small one was moving slow and almost east of us and the larger one was moving in that direction.   I lost sight of  the two and as my friend and I watched, two more appeared, we looked at each other and I said, “God they look like weather balloons but they move as if powered.

At this time the two lost objects came from the north and passed by the larger one with in 30 seconds and were gone out of sight.    The large bright object appeared to have stopped and I I would not have seen what took place I would have thought that I was looking at Venus or Sirius at this time.  Several other people came by and we showed them the object, they saw it and thought it was a star or weather balloon.

I have lived around many military bases and am familiar with air craft and such.  I have never seen anything that could do the things that this flashing light did!    Who knows!  I just never understood why U.F.O's would feel the need to have lights on their craft anyway-Think about that one!",2005-11-03T00:00:00,37.17415093167702,-121.65183229813664

The Air Force bases also said there were no test missile launches Wednesday. Such tests have, in the past, resulted in light patterns that can be seen across the California coast.  The bases did not send aircraft to check on the reports of lights.  The Federal Aviation Administration's West Coast office had no reports of the lights and no aircraft were unaccounted for.  San Francisco resident Tim Sinclair said the lights appeared to be near the cross at the top of Mount Davidson Park.

I am an experienced aviator with more than 12 years of flying experience.  Over my flying career, I've seen several things most people would believe to be UFOs, but my experienced eye can immediately ""debunk"" (e.g. bright planet on the horizon, aircraft landing lights in clouds, etc.)  What I saw last night is not easily ""debunkable.""     1)  Date/Time: October 26, 2005, 1850-1930 E.S.T. 2)  Witnesses:  Myself, but there have to be others. 3)  Weather: Clear skies with broken clouds at approximately 2000-6000 feet. 4)  Narrative of Event:  At 1850, I was traveling south on the ""outer loop"" of the Washington, D.C., Beltway (I-495) heading towards I-95 south.  After passing the exit for US-50, a strange light configuration in the sky came into view on the right side of the highway (to the west or southwest) and it caught my attention.  I could clearly make out the lighting pattern of a helicopter and to the left of it were two white lights that were too far away from the helicopter to be attached to it but seemed to be keeping pace with it.  The aviator in me immediately wondered if the helo was flying in formation with another aircraft, and if so that sure was a weird lighting configuration.  The helicopter was moving towards the highway ahead of me at an altitude of about 1000 feet or so, and the two lights remained in perfect formation with it.  As I got closer to the helo (I was travelling at about 70 MPH), it was just crossing over the highway.  I rolled down my window and could hear the sound of its rotor blades and could briefly see portions of the fuselage of the helo illuminated by ground lights and its own rotating beacon.  It appeared to be a Blackhawk helo, but between watching the road and looking at it I couldn't make a positive identification.  What kept me focused on it was the two weird, white lights to the left of it.  As it crossed over the highway just in front of me, I couldn't make any sense out of what the two white lights were.  If they were attached to another aircraft there was no visible fuselage, and I continued to watch as the helo and the lights crossed the highway in perfect formation.   At the point when it was closest to me, I was able to discern that the two white lights were not part of an aircraft or the helo, but instead seemed to be just ""floating"" in the sky next to the helo in perfect formation.  I then lost visual contact with helo and the white lights because of trees along the left (eastern) side of the road.  In my mind I thought, ""Hmmm, they must have been hauling something underneath or trailing wires of some kind with safety lights so other aircraft wouldn't hit them.  I put it out of my mind and focused my full attention on driving again.  I noticed my speed had dropped to 55 while I was watching the helo and some cars had stacked up behind me.  I increased my speed back to 70 and kept driving.  In my mind I just thought ""Wow, that was kind of weird,"" and I more or less put it out of my mind.   A few minutes later (1855 or so), I was travelling SE on I-495, and when I was near the exit for 620 (Brook Hill Road) a new, bright, white light appeared in the sky to the right (SW of my position) of the road and immediately began to drop straight down.  Being an aviator who had just seen a helicopter, I immediately thought ""Wow, they're dropping flares now, I wonder what's going on.""   Keeping my eyes on the light, I watched as it dropped straight down with an increasing rate of speed.  As I watched it fall I thought ""Wow, that's pretty bright for a flare.  If that's a helo's landing light, he's auto-rotating and he's going to crash!""   I then thought that perhaps it was a meteor burning up in the atmosphere, or perhaps I've just got a weird angle on an aircraft approaching Dulles airport from the south.   What I saw next is very difficult to explain in terms of my aviation experience.  After falling straight down for about 5-7 seconds at an increasingly fast rate of speed, the white light just stopped (on a dime) and became stationary in the sky.  12 years of aviation experience immediately told me that was no helicopter, and certainly not a flare.  Meteors burn up and the light extinguishes.  I couldn't explain how the light just stopped after dropping straight down vertically.  The light remained stationary for quite some time.  As I drove on, I-495 got closer to I-95 south and I had intermittent visibilty with the bright, white light.  During about a 10 second period of visibilty I was able to clearly discern that the light had started moving horizontally to the south.  I-495 was now taking me SE to almost E, and I lost visual contact with the light.  It took me a few minutes to get to I-95S because of traffic and once I got onto I-95S, I checked the time and it was 1905.  I was looking for the light after I got out from behind the sound barrier walls on the sides of the roads, and immediately regained visual contact with the light.  It was now clearly moving horizontally to the south and would stop for short periods of time then continue moving.   The way it was moving didn't seem quite right for it to be a helo.  It would go fast, then slow, then fast again.  Sometimes it would drop straight down for a second or two, then continue moving horizontally.  (A key point here: I never saw it move straight up!)   I was now travelling S-SW on I-95S and I scanned the horizon for aircraft.  I could clearly make out 2 low flying helicopters.  One was to my left (east) and another to my right (west).  I could see other aircraft flying at much higher altitudes, but the prominent feature in the sky was the bright, white light to the SW of me.  Using my fist, I checked the distance from the ground to the horizon and made a note that  the white light was about 15 degrees up from the horizon.  It began to move south again and I wanted to follow it.  I got off of I-95S and went west on Prince William parkway to try and follow the light.  The light then became stationary again.  I knew there was a Wal-Mart nearby and that I could park and look at the light from there, so I went to the Wal-Mart parking lot at 1400 Worth Ave, Woodbridge, VA and got out of my truck to look at the light.  I keep a pair of binoculars in my truck (I'm a country boy) and I took them out to look at the light.  I focused on the light which was stationary again and all I could make out was that it was white, bright, and fairly large.  It remained stationary for so long I began to think that I must be just making something out of nothing.  Perhaps it was just a bright planet or star on the horizon and the fact I was moving when I was watching/following it is what made me think it was moving.  I was about to just write it off as an overactive imagination when I looked at it again through the binoculars and it slowly moved horizontally out of my field of view.  Thinking that perhaps it was me, I spread my legs shoulder width apart, stood firmly and regained the light in my field of view.  I was not moving, IT WAS.  It then dropped straight down out of my field of view, and when I regained it, it was stationary again.  At this point, it was almost 1930 and I had been drinking coffee during my drive.  I had to go into Wal-Mart ((deleted)).  I put the binoculars away and walked (at a fast pace) into Wal-Mart.   The light was visible in the sky to the SW the entire time I was walking in.  What struck me as odd, was that no one was looking at it or noticing it, and having seen everything I had just seen I thought ""Wow, there really could be UFO activity over a populated area and most average citizens wouldn't even notice!""  I went into Wal-Mart, used the restroom quickly, and when I came back out the light was no longer visible in the sky to the SW of Wal-Mart.  I looked for it on the horizon but couldn't find it anywhere.  I went back to my truck, got out my binoculars, and scanned the sky visually and with the binos waiting for it to reappear.  While I was waiting for it to reappear, I noticed there were two aircraft flying high-enough that I couldnt' hear them and in a tight formation (that appeared to be military) flying SW.  The light never reappeared, and due to all the buildings and ground-based lights I realized I couldn't really see much anyway.  I got in my truck and left at 1945.",2005-11-03T00:00:00,,

During the early morning hour of October 1, 2005, my friends and I were traveling from White Castle's in Midlothian, IL to our friend's house in Posen, IL.  My friend and I pulled up into her driveway and the rest of our friends parked on the street.  As we were walking up to enter her house, our one friends who had parked on the street called for us to come over by him.  The rest of our friends were looking up to the sky and when we finally made it over by them, we saw what they saw.  3 pulsing red lights that were in a triangular shape in the western sky.  They were not moving fast and almost seemed to be hovering, while staying in that exact formation.  It was something you would see out of a movie.  At first I thought they were lights on towers or something, but they obviously were not.  My friend instantly called our one friend who had gone home instead and he went out into his yard and saw the same thing as we did.  He also called his brother who went out right away and saw the triangular formation of red lights as well.  I watched them for a little bit and ran inside with my friend.  We looked out her back bedroom window and we could still see them in the sky.  I went to the bathroom and then called my parents while I was still inside the house.  I described to them what I saw and I told them to go outside.  They were looking in the west, but said that they found them to be in the east sky.  And that there were only two pulsing red lights now.  I thought that was odd, because I saw three, so I went outside and looked to the western sky where I originally had seen the triangular formation.  They were not there.  I looked over at my friends and they were all looking straight above into the sky.  In the time that I was in the house they had moved to directly above where we were standing.  I asked my friends what happened to the third light and they said that it had gone out!!  About this time one of our friends called the Midlothian Police non-emergency number.  He said he had to report something he saw, and before finishing the statement, the dispatcher asked if it was the three red lights in the sky.  They said that it has been reported already and that they were looking into it.  We also contacted the Posen Police non-emergency number who only offered to send out an officer.  So I stayed on the phone with my parents while we were watching the red lights.  They moved further east and the second light flickered slowly and then burnt out.  A little further east and the first light did the same, so there were no more lights in the sky.  It was like we knew when the lights were going to go out.  They went out in order from the far left light, then the far right light, and then finally the point on the triangle went out.  When they were directly above us the two lights seemed to have moved closer together, with the tip of the triangle only a little bit ahead of the other light. Another odd (maybe) thing was that there were many shooting stars in the sky (according to my friends who saw them when I was inside for the short time).   These pulsing red lights did not seem to be attached to any sort of aircraft that we could see.  They were extremely high in the sky compared to the plane that had passed below them when we first sighted it.  My father also looked at them with binoculars and said that it looked the same as with the naked eye, and he could not see an aircraft either.  The next day my brother's friend at work told him that he saw two red pulsing lights in the sky while he was at the K-Mart in Tinley Park, IL around 1 am.  Three member's of our friend's family also saw the three red lights.  Also, our neighbors in Midlothian, IL told us that they saw white lights flashing across the eastern sky around 10:45 pm of Sept. 30th, only hours before we saw the red lights.  They said that they would dash back and forth across the sky, sometimes one at a time or in clusters, and sometimes in a straight line or in triangular formations.  I never want to see anything like this again in my lifetime...that is all I can say!

I do not know how long previous to that they had been visible.  I was advised of the lights by a family member who had just arrived home by automobile.  The lights had been visible to the family member while driving east on 151st St. between Route 45 and 94th Ave. (approximately 5/8th mile north and ¼ mile west of and 5 minutes from home). From that location lights were in southeast sky  Following are my observations:  The three lights were approximately 40 degrees above the eastern horizon.  For comparison they were about the same distance above the horizon as the star Belelgeuse was at that time.  I am 6’ tall.  With my left hand and arm fully outstretched, when the south (or right) light was lined up along the right edge of my pointer finger, the north (or left) light was lined up with the left edge of my middle finger.  The southernmost of the three lights was due east.  The northernmost light was about the same distance north  of due east as Betelgeuse was south of due east.  The lights were of a brightness similar to that of the anti-collision lights seen on commercial broadcast antennas.  The color was similar to that of the red LED on the tape recorder I was later making notes into.  The planet Mars was much higher in the sky, almost due south and almost overhead.  The lights were much brighter and much, much redder than Mars.  The lights pulsated, meaning the brightness varied, but did not disappear.   Pulsation was independent of other lights.  The lights were equidistant from one another.  From a drawing I made during the sighting, the lights were at an angle of about 45 degrees from the horizontal with the south light being the “high” light.  When I first sighted the lights, the middle light was slightly out of line with the other two lights, being slightly above an imaginary line drawn between the two outer lights.  The middle light slowly drifted closer to being in line with the other.  As a whole, the group of lights was almost stationary, with just the slightest drift to the north.  A commercial type airplane flew from north to south during the sighting, and appeared to be between me and the lights.  I am very familiar with the commercial air traffic in this area due to our being under one of the approach paths to Chicago Midway airport.  What was unusual was the altitude of the aircraft.   The aircraft was at the low altitude that I normally see inbound craft at while in the approach pattern to Midway.   The aircraft was heading south, away from Midway.   Southbound craft are normally much higher in the sky and under full power.   Perhaps he had been asked to take a look.  The sky was exceptionally clear.  In the Chicago area you do not get nights this clear very often, usually only in the dead of winter.  The weather at Midway Airport at 0053 Oct. 1, was 58 degrees, clear, SW 9.  Although I assume totally unconnected with sighting, family member did see white meteorite trail in sky almost overhead going south to north during sighting.  During the sighting, I observed a neighbor looking out his second storey window.  I verified that he also had lights in sight.  He also confirmed this later in the day.  Family member and I agreed that we would maneuver by automobile to get a better fix on location of lights.  We went inside to collect cell phone, police/air scanner, tape recorder, etc.  Another family member stayed outside to observe.  By the time I came back outside lights were gone.  Family member who had stayed outside had seen lights disappear.   We did drive around the area for a while but were unable to reacquire lights.  Did not hear anything on scanner concerning lights.

They flickered much like a star or planet from atmospheric interference.  I didnt notice any constant pattern it was very infrequent and sometimes.. flickered like some one playing with a light switch rather than atmosphere interuption.they seem to be traveling east north east and there foward momentum seemed very un uniformed.  I woke my sixteen year old daughter up to witness this with me..  I even called my brother n law…  He didnt observe them however my daughter did..at about a twenty degrees past the north star the lights took a more North East  direction and when they did this the last trailing light seem to go out..  however this is probably due to the overpowering lights of chicago on the horizon.. Tried to get video however my new digital video camera is crud at night...and my luck the battery was dead.. I am ex coast guardsman and currently work as a paramedic for a private company here in Chicago. My daughter is an honors student at a private catholic school here in Chicago..

Then there were two star-like objects in the northeastern sky that would appear and disappear in slightly different areas than they were before, but their distance from each other remained the same.  Then we saw a star like object move over head from north to south. It passed another starlike object and made an immediate turn back and joined with the object it had just passed.

It stayed in the same spot for around three to four minutes (it could have been in the sky longer, i dont know) then did kind of a small circular motion then took off in the other direction at a speed  I would consider too fast to be a helicopter.

Thank you for this site.  I have wanted to tell my story since I was a boy.  I was 11 years old and asleep.  I woke up with vibrations in my body and a strong desire to look out my bedroom window.  It was a high window and I had to stand on my bed which was below it to see out.  We had 80 acres of flat land in back to look out on.  In the very back was a bright cigar shaped object that I some how knew was an alien ship.  I called it a flying sauser as that was the only term I knew that would fit.  I ran into my parents bedroom and woke them up.  I told my dad there was a flying saucer in the back yard.  He told me to go back to sleep.  I said, ""no it's real. Look!""  He did and he saw it.  He called Soufidge Field (Spelling is probabbly wrong but I'm sure it's still there) the military airbase in the Detroit area and asked them if they had picked something up on their radar.  When they asked why, he told them we had a flying saucer in our backyard.  They took his name and address and told him to go back to bed.  Right!  We loaded the shot guns and rifles.  The lights went out on the craft and it was dark in the back 80.  A few minutes later we heard foot steps on the porch and a knock at the door.  I opened the door and my father and older brother put the shotguns to the opening door.  The door opened and a cop was standing there staring down the barrels of two shot guns.  He asked what was going on.  We told him, and he said come outside and show me where.  We stepped into the front yard and pointed back to the area where we saw the ship.  He was taking notes on his clipboard and mocking us when all of a sudden the lights went back on on the ship.  It rose silently in the air about 100 feet or so, hovered a second or two and then rose quickly 10 or twenty feet and then vanished in an instant.  We all stood there in silence for a few seconds.  The cop went over to his patrol car and radioed in what he saw.  They told him to go back and investigate.  He said, ""Not me, you're not going to find my shoes in the morning.""  He left, and that was that until the morning. Around 11:00 a.m. the ""Men in Black"" arrived.  CIA, FBI, Air Force, I don't know, but three cars pulled into the yard and my sister and I escorted the men to the back where we saw the craft.  The men weren't wearing black suits, but were wearing blue suits.  There were four men in suits, and two dressed in lab type suits carrying giger counters.  They found areas where they said they thought the tripods landed as the weeds were laid flat.  My father was at work, and my mother stayed in the house with my three younger brothers. My older brother was also gone somewhere at the time. The weeds in this area were tall, about three feet tall, and now were flat.  They took measurements. I don't remember the geiger counters going off. That was the last we saw of the ""Men in Blue."" I had the same feeling of vibrations in my stomach a few years later when as a 17 year old, I was attending Interlochen Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan.  I told no one, but didn't sleep well that night in the cabin.  The next morning in the breakfast line, I over heard two of the counselors talking about the flying saucers they had seen last night.  They both said they saw a group of four flying saucers flying in slow formation over the camp.  It verified the feeling in my stomach and I worried that the aliens were after me.  I don't think they were, but at the time I was concerned.  Oh, also, one winter we had a huge snow storm.  I was 14 years old at the time. (Winter of 1960) and the snow was deep.  I had the same feelings in my stomach and was afraid to move.  I felt the aliens wanted to talk to me, or have me come outside.  I did nothing but lay in bed praying.  In the moring, the blowing snow from that night had stopped and had packed itself on my bedroom window in a thin layer. A pair of tiny bootprints could be seen on my bedroom window where a small alien had walked across my long window.   I thought one of my brothers did that somehow, and so I went outside to see whose foot prints I'd find in the virgin snow.  There were no prints anywhere.  I was the first one to venture out in the new snow fall.  There were no prints anywhere in the snow, not even below my window.  The only fresh prints were on the side of the house and across my bedroom window.  I knew they had been there.  I can still see the prints in my mind.  They were small, about the size of a lady's  hand, shaped like a boot, and had ridges across the bottom. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

Night-time sighting of UFO over Midtown NYC.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible landing light on an airliner approaching local airport?

As I reached 43rd I turned east towards 8th avenue. I live between 7th and 8th. Halfway down the block, I looked up into the sky, it was clear and I noticed a bright object making circles in the sky.  The light was a bright steady white.  I stopped and continued to watch as the circles that the object made tightened and at a speed that no air-craft I know of could make, not even a helicopter.  Let me say that it appeared that the object as far as I can tell was at an altitude of several thousand feet, so that the circles it was making encompassed at the beginning, I would say aproximately a mile or so in diameter and doing this in just a few seconds, as the circles it made became smaller perhaps several hundred feet were being covered.  And this is what convinced me that this was no ordinary plane.   As I stood watching a man was walking towards me and I said out loud purposely to catch his attention ""Yes, no doubt about it, that is a U.F.O.""  and I pointed.  But at that very   moment, before the man could turn around to look, it winked out!  And that was very strange.  Is it possible that this craft was aware of my observation of it from a relatively dark street below and did not want to be pointed out to others?   Have been interested in the subject of UFO's since childhood and this made me since that time a keen observer of the sky and what usually is in it.  This was like nothing  ever observed before and the nature of it's movement convinced me beyond a doubt that this was indeed an Unidentified Flying Object, since nothing I have ever seen or heard of when it comes to aircraft could have possibly duplicated what this object did.  That it was under intelligent control I have no doubt either.  Have seen balloons and other objects subject to wind currents many times in the sky, this was like neither of those. Remarkable that far from being in a remote rural location this happened right over mid-town Manhattan!   Will submit a graphic image of the observation soon.

Two of the lights were blueish-green while one of them had an orange tint to it. Altitude was hard to judge (probably around 2 miles). The object was in the area east-northeast of Texas motor speedway. There were no clouds and visibility was extremely clear. This object was huge. Far larger than any aircraft I know of.  My friend and I are somewhat knowledgeable on aircraft. Particularly fighter jets. We frequently attend airshows and have never seen an airborne object this size. I was reluctant to report this but upon recent investigation I have found a few similar reports.

PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP FROM WITNESS)) follow up on talent, Oregon sighting a follow-up to my report early this morning: the craft is similar to the Lake Ontario illustration that appears on your home page. also, i was struck, after thinking about this sighting for many hours now, that the craft appeared to have the ability to cloak itself by diminishing its light intensity, appearing as any normal star or planet in the sky. in fact, when i woke my wife, she said, ""it's just jupiter."" indeed, it appeared orange in color, but upon further observation, it clearly showed several light sources of ornagie-white light that gained in brightness up to five times its lowest light-emission level. i have to say this: i'm a journalist and my father worked for NASA; i've always looked forward to the day when i would see something that was clearly a UFO. this was such a sighting. unfortunately, i have to believe this was a military aircraft. i say this because its movement was so random, there was no possible explanation for an extra-terrestrial craft to move like this, because it had no order, no apparent purpose. it appeared to be going through maneuvers. again, the movement of this craft was something i have never seen before. i watch the night sky quite often, and i've seen satellites and the ISS, and none of those sightings compared to this -- this was clearly a type of craft with a propulsion system well beyond contemporary jets. finally, i failed to mention this. at the very end of the sighting, as the craft appeared to virtually dissolve into the horizon (i had to look away from it to see it in my peripheral vision), it wobbled back and forth at a supernatural rate. back and forth very quickly until the night sky overtook it. good luck on this one, sir.((END))",2005-09-02T00:00:00,42.2457,-122.7887

I have looked through some reports of UFO sightings on reporting sights and found one explanation of a sighting that sounds like a possible match since we only had a side view.

Firstly I'm not crazy. I know what we saw. The other guys were just as astonished as I, but less reconciliable about WHAT exactly these lights were.  At approximately 02:15 I began my nightly exterior perimeter patrol of the building, insuring all doors are locked, the cyclone wire fence hasn't been obviously breached anywhere and that the site is basically safe.  Somewhere near the southeast corner of the building a light in the sky caught my eye. Though an airfield is nearby, it doesn't operate at night; still though, at first the light was nondescript and creepy--like the way a jetliner looks head on from a distance. Anyone who knows what I mean knows the lights of these are bright, there is no or little sound and the illusion of hovering or slow moving. I thought nothing of it really, just another jet. . . I made my way around to the building's northeast corner as usual, and had forgotten about the jet. As I approached guard post at the facility's main traffic gate, I saw my guard outside, looking at what I thought was the jet still. I looked again and knew why he was so stupefied; the light was a lot closer now, and was definitely bigger than a jet's headlights. We both mumbled something to the effect of ""What the heck is that?"" and watched the triangular?--shape as it drifted toward the building.  The intensity of the lighting made it's exact hull outline impossible to see. I am guessing that it was no farther than five or six hundred feet away, over an area of woods and highway (I think. I know beyond the cyclone fence is just woods). As we watched, the triangularish craft jerked to the left, then back some, and then to the right. It's light was no longer so bright, or not pointing in our direction anymore, and we both made out what appeared to be a bank of < shaped lights that pulsed a dark red from dim to moderately bright and back to dim again. Shafts of white light seemed to poke out from the underside of the craft occasionally. At several points during the 'flight', it had maneuvered so that we could see that indeed the shape was triangular and a brighter or more intense light lit each of the triangle points' underside. An inbuond vehicle stopped at the main gate and the driver got out, watching just as we were. Though I only counted once, the others said they saw twice, maybe three times, small red spheres falling to the ground, spiralling in a slow descent like oak seeds would. This went on for some minutes until finally something seemed to explode on the ground below the craft. But not like an explosion you'd expect. It was a loud crackling zap accompanied by a brief white light. After that the craft slowly hovered around in the area some more, as it had been before the small red spheres came down. After only a few more minutes the thing took off and disappeared out of sight. My guard began processing the driver and I decided to go back around to the corner where I first saw the light. I have one fear in life and it isn't UFOs or aliens, but I must admit as I approached the building's dark backside I became very nonsensically afraid. The fence was not breached anywhere that I could see, but it didn't make me feel much safer. The last detail I have to report is a strange staticky noise that overcame my radio as I approached the corner closest to the incident, and after only a few moments drained the nearly full battery (8 hours of charge left). It also broke my watch which I found later had stopped at 02:52, which is approximately the time I'm guessing I was in the area. People inside and at other guards posts had complained about an abundance of static for a few minutes, though it hadn't lasted very long. Two hours later, as the sun was beginning to lighten the sky, I went back around the building with a newly charged battery and experienced what I believed to be a small bit of excess static, but nothing like before. The three of us have decided not to tell anyone at work, and I only tell you know because the truth should be known.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,42.74402106339468,-71.48120613496933

I was outside on my front porch as I looked to my right and noticed a bright flashing object.

It changed colors from orangish to reddish.  Then the objects glare which made it look like a star faded for approx 1 second and came back. So I ran inside to grab my friend and told him to check this out. I noticed it had moved a little bit. It was slowly travelling to the left. But It was so slow that I could hardly tell it was moving at all.  I pointed it out to my friend and he couldnt explain what it was. The object then seemed to be coming towards us. The star like object was getting brighter and bigger so my friend started to run. I grabbed hold of him and told him not to be scared and that it was interesting.  Suddenly the object came into clear view and the Star like appearence faded and the object turned out to be a pure black diamond shape object with red blinking lights.  Now I thought... OK.. Its starting to look like a plane, but there is no noise, it was a silent night and why is it pitch back compared to the blueish night sky and diamond shape. It was close enough to see... Im not good at measuring but probably got as close as a few thousand feet from us. It then looked as if it was gliding in the air.

The date is a 'best guess', as my grandfather (born in 1893) was a teenager at the time.  It could have taken place anytime between 1903 and 1913. Grandpa and his brother were hunting ""out in the woods,"" as they described it, somewhere in, or near, Adair County, MO.  They spotted a light ahead of them which appeared to be swinging back and forth in an arc.   At first, they believed it to be someone swinging a lantern, then decided that it was too high and the arc was too big for that to be the cause.  They ran ahead to investigate.   When they reached a clearing in the woods, they saw a large, metallic, disc or saucer shaped object hovering above the ground in the clearing.  I can't remember if my grandfather said that the disc itself appeared to be swinging back and forth in an arc pattern, or if the light(s) on the disc were moving in such a way as to cause this illusion.  I believe he also said it seemed to be emitting a humming noise. Shortly after they came into the clearing, the disc/saucer rose very rapidly, straight up above the trees with a ""whooshing noise"" and took off horizontally, at a great speed, disappearing from their view.  They walked to the spot, above which the craft had been hovering, and discovered four large, circular burn marks on the ground. I remember my parents and other family members talking about this incident when I was a small child.  Then, sometime in the late 1960s (perhaps as late as 1970 or 1971), my mother had purchased a copy of a National Inquirer with a photo of a UFO on the cover.  One day when my grandfather was visiting us, he picked up the Inquirer and said, ""This looks just like what I saw when I was young.""  He then proceeded to relate the story to my brother and me. My grandfather was a man of high integrity, and everyone in the family who heard of his experience did not doubt for an instant that he was telling the truth.  The craft's shape, speed and flight behavior prove that it was clearly not a zeppelin, nor a balloon, nor any type of airplane which would have been in existence at the time.   I submit this in my grandfather's memory because he was so interested in finding out exactly what the object was.  It is also my sincere hope that relating his experience might help in the serious research of UFOs, if only to establish that a sighting had occurred in the very early 1900s.

I was walking south on Sharonwood Ave NW at Noon on a clear, sunny day, and the sky had a few white fluffy clouds against a bright blue sky. In front of me approx. 20 degrees above the horizon and slightly to the left of center was a stationary silver object, cigar shaped (if cigar is fatter at the center). I studied it carefully for some time, but in retrospect my guess is for about 2 or 3 minutes, though it seemed longer than that.  An airport was about 8 miles north, so at first I assumed it might be a plane flying directly at me, making it appear stationary, or away from me, but it didn't move at all, and it didn't get larger or smaller. It was very smooth looking with no markings, windows, or protrusions such as a wing or a tail.  I was only 12 or 13 years old at the time, but I didn't really think I was seeing a flying saucer, nor had I seen or read anything prior that would make me think along those lines.  The stillness of the object is what puzzled me, so I concentrated carefully thinking the stillness had to be an illusion, and it would soon give itself away, and I'd be able to tell what it really was. Then suddenly it began to move to my right and slightly upward.  I didn't know how far away it was, but I was guessing a mile or less.  It was at this moment I was convinced immediately I had seen something outside of man's technology. The speed at which it moved convinced me.  It moved so quickly and without noise or any appearance of accelerating.  It just moved quickly.   I only got to see its movement for maybe 20 or 25 degrees horizontally and slightly upwards because it went behind a white fluffy cloud. I expected to see it come out on the other side of the cloud, but it did not. It was gone. Another peculiar thing about this story is how vividly I remember it.  I'm 61 years old now, and have never seen anything remotely like what I saw that day, and I can still remember it all very much like remembering what I was doing the moment I learned of Kennedy being shot.  I told my mother what I saw, but there was something about her response (though she was very supportive) that made me not tell anyone else for many years.  I just couldn't expect anyone to believe me, yet I know I saw what I've described here.  My reason for reporting it now is that TV shows on the subject have shown people describing what I described, so perhaps the center will have other people reporting they saw it too.

We had been sitting for a while when we noticed three orange lights at relatively low altitude in the distance at about southeast relative to us (in the direction of tyndall airforce base).   These lights were arranged in a row and were clearly seen high enough over the horizon to know it was not a boat or anything like that.  They would flash in intermitent patterns, sometimes one would flash at a time or all three at once, they would even flash in sequence.   After noting this for about ten minutes we noticed something else.  At about a 50 degree angle to the south, about five miles form were at we noticed a distinct blue light floating motionless in the sky.  After about one minute this light split into two lights.  These started floating apart in a spiral trajectory moving clockwise.  Once they were somewhat far from each other one flew off at high speed towards the east while the other one started to look as if it was coming closer to our location.  After the second light was out of sight we heard the roaring of two jet aircraft come from the southeast and the second light quickly flew out of sight.

Memory is fuzzy.  However, I think it was about 5 - 8 PM after work, sometime between December 2004 to January 2005.   I had just finished work at Wal~Mart and myself and another coworker were warming up our vehicles getting them ready to leave for home.  We both noticed a cluster of white balls of light in the sky to the South of us.  We conversed a little bit about it and concluded that it must have been an Airplane coming in to the Airport.   Our location is at the East end of Airport Way.  The Airport runway is at the West end of Airport Way.  We assumed that it was an Airplane preparing to land coming in from the East.  It was moving slowly.  The Lights seemed Fixed.  In other words, if a person were to measure the distances between the lights during the 15 - 30 minute period I observed the phenomenon they would have stayed at a constant in relation to each other.  So the cluster of lights seemed to be from one solid structure.  There was no noise.   It was a crystal clear night with temperatures well below freezing.   After we determined it was an Airplane I got in my car and drove home.  My home was to the south so I was able to watch it as I drove home.  At the time I arrived at my appartment I went inside and then went out onto the balkcony.  The object was still there and had not moved as fast as I would believe an airplane would coming into the Airport.  I began to realise that it was not an airplane.  It was just moving to slow for it to keep itself up.   I watched it for a short period of time and further concluded that it was something conventional that I was not used to.  Having some understanding of Government, Military, and Area 51 Research I thought it was of no concern of mine and that even if it was a UFO it would only be another video tape of Balls of light against a Night Sky.   I did notice that it seemed to be larger than a Conventionsl Airline Aircraft.  However, there were too many variables to make any opinion of what it was.  But there was definitely something there, whether it be conventional or non conventional air or  space craft. Later my coworker agreed that he thought it was a UFO and not an Air Craft.

I am a 43 yr old male, from ross co. ohio.  I was  walking with ny nephew when we saw a bright light in the sky near our home.  It was following the hill that was located behind our house,then stopped and began to hover over a field on the hill.   We walked to the area carrying flashlights to find our way through the woods.  When we got to the field, we saw tht the light was above the treeline on the other side, and was fairly large.  We signalled the light with our flashlights and to our amazement, the light reacted by flashing, then changing shapes (pyramid,star,square-as if it was some kind of laser-light show).  Then it returned to its circular shape and began to glow in a purple light, until the whole field was glowing purple also.  We noticed what appeared to be some kind of entities coming out of the top of the globe, and they were gesturing at us with their arms. Then one came out of the globe completly and floated down until it stood in front of us.  It was shaped like a human, but was made completely of the purple light-like a hologram-and had no facial features, fingers on its hands, and wore a long robe.  We tried to communicate with it to no avail, so I reached out my hand in a friendly gesture, and the being reached its hand out and put it on mine.  I felt no pressure on my hand, no feeling of a presence at all.  We then noticed these four red blinking lights appear around the field, surrounding the field on each side.  One moved to the large  glowing purple globe then back to its position.  I had glanced up to see these lights and when I looked back at the being in front of me it was gone.  Apparently I had a lapse of memory once I touched the creatures hand, because I learned later from my nephew that the entity had floated back to the globe once the red light moved out of its position. I do not remember this happening.  Once the being of purple light was gone we began to get very cold, and got a strange feeling of paranoia, like there was something else in the filed with us that we could not see.  So we went home rather quickly at this point. We found our dog hiding in the woods, it had ran off when the being floated down from the globe.  I reported this  incident to MUFON, who sent mr hartinger from RUFOS and two other guys, to interview us.  This incident was also published in the MUFON journal.  Has anyone else ever had contact with this type of entity? Ive heard of the greys,blues,greens, but purple light???",2005-10-20T00:00:00,39.3335,-83.0168

A strange kind of ""bug,"" I thought.  A ""bug"" in the sky?  The ""bug"" slid parallel to the plane and was in sight for about 5 to 7 seconds.  Then it got to me.  It was no ""bug,"" but a dark silhouette of a rectangular object that looked like a coffin with a zigzag halo around it that was darker in color then sky.   The TV  monitor showed the ground speed to be about 800 kmh and 40000 feet above ground  (I could not remember exact data).   There was no reference point so it was impossible to determine the size and distance of the object. The question is now, what did I saw?  A balloon at a ground speed a little lowers then the plane or a new secret flying device of some kind patrolling the airspace over the US?   It is everyone’s guess.

The bottom of the craft seemed to be lined with lights that formed almost a full circle, about 3/4 of a circle. The craft dipped below the trees and began to head north at a lower altitude. I wanted to show a friend and my husband who came out and we watched it continue north through the tree branches and skyline until it seemed to head east again and disappear from site.

Upon opening my eyes, I looked up to see a 'black dot' simply stationary in the sky. I mean it was COMPLETELY stationary in the sky. At first it didn't register, because I couldn't figure out how it could be just HANGING there.   I continued to look at it, and either it periodically 'turned over' to reveal a red area, or else it was flashing a red light.   It seems like it was pretty far up there, but since I don't know exactly what it was, I don't know for sure how high it was.  However, if it was a conventional aircraft of some kind, then how high would it have to be to be about the size of Venus?   This was definitely NOT Venus or any other star or planet, not a helicopter, satellite, bird, or balloon.  The reason I rule out balloon is because if it WAS a balloon, then it would have to be extremely big, circular, black and red (or else black with a flashing red light)  AND have the capability of hovering.  Does this fit any known balloon?  Even if it were caught in a up draft, could it remaing ABSOLUTELY still?  It was NOT bobbing, jerking, wiggling, or doing anything else except possibly gently turning periodically to reveal another side which was red.  It could also have been a flashing red light.  I just don't know. This was about 5:30 pm, but it was still quite light, and the sun was behind me, so it could not have been in its own shadow. It was definitely black. That much I know.  What I DON'T know is what it was. After watching it for about 3 minutes, it suddenly disappeared.  Just gone.  Like that.  Poof. Not zooming, or fading out of sight. So my question is this:  Has anyone ever reported a BLACK UFO, a black/red UFO, or a black UFO with a red flashing light?   Thanks for your time. ((name deleted))  PS - Right before I wrote this email, I was outside to see if I could see it again.  Well, I didn't, but I did see 2 white 'lights' (similar to stars) moving VERY fast across the sky.  At first I saw one, moving in a straight line, then zig-zagging, then back to a straight line, and a couple of seconds behind it ANOTHER one, making similar movements.  Very strange.   At least 3 UFOs in 3 days.  Should I file a different report for that?   Also, the day before (Thursday) I saw a similar 'light' or whatever, but this one was just meadering, not going fast.  In fact, it was rather slow.  This has been the weirdest few days of my life.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,38.76717395833333,-121.3107662202381

I could tell the distance it moved by the windowsill I was watching it out of. Plus, our neighbors behind us aways, have a yard light.

It was visible directly forward while travelling on the I-15 southbound. I was traveling home from work on thursday, the 8th of December. The time was around 3:50-4:00 pm. I was headed South on the I-15, toward the 215 turnoff to head west (where I live). I saw a large object in the sky, completely circular and grey. It hovered just above the mountain which was facing me (south). At first my eyes did not recognize the object in the air, and then I did a double take. It hovered there for about a minute. During this time of me spotting the object, I was beginning to exit the 15 South, and head down the 215 west. Furing that turnoff, you get taken underneath a section of freeway, temporarily blocking the view of the craft. When I finally completed exiting the freeway, and was finally on the 215, I looked back and the craft was gone. I was able to look at it, and observe it for less than 30 seconds, but when I turned off, and was going to pull over to really pay attention to it, it was gone.  I am used to seeing commerical airplanes and hellicopters all over this valley, and since my condo sits on higher ground than the airport, I get a constant view of planes comming in for landings and taking off. My father was in the air force, so I was raised around aircraft. This was not something I could have mistaken.  It didn't move, make noise, cause any electronic interference I was aware of, and it didn't emit any light. It just sat there motionless in the sky, larger than any hellicopter or airplane I had ever seen in real life. It hovered about as high as normal hellicopters do when they are doing the traffic reports for the news. (I see them over the 15 all the time when I am heading home around 4:30-5 ish)  I wish I could have had the time to stop my car and take a photo. I had a camera but not within my reach while operating my vehicle. It was so large, I am astonished no one else has reported this.

I was driving west on Redlands Blvd.  Directly in the sky in front of me was what looked like an extra large half moon set with the curved side down and flat on top.  It caught my attention because it was so large and not in the correct position to be the moon although it was white.  I looked at it and realized the edges were blurred and there was some difined shape within ot and then I noticed very faint twinkles of lights on the top flat side.  As I drove, I came to realize what I was seeing wasn't right.  I turned into a parking lot and lost the object behind trees for a moment, then found it again it what seemed to be a slightly different place in the sky.   At this point I was calling my husband and kids to tell them to go outside and look at the sky.  They were downtown and couldn't see it.  I sat in the parking lot and looked at it . It seemed to be staying in the same place and was doing nothing. At this point I thought maybe it was a street light off in the distance and that I was having some sort of visual/perseption problem.  Then it changed into a perfect circle and turned slightly orange and got smaller and smaller.  I thought it was disappearing.  I was still on the phone to my son explaining all this to him as I watched it.  I told him it was disappearing.  Then it reshaped itself back into the  shape that it was in the beginning.  I decided to drive and see if I could get closer. I lost it behind buildings and trees.  Found it momentarily again but then lost it all together.  I drove back towards home on Redlands Blvd.  I went to the intersection at which I first noticed the object and actually turned around again (to drive west) to see if I could see it again from that same spot.  It was not there. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at Venus.  It is very bright, at present, and it is visible during the early evening hours in the southwestern sky.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I am the person whom reported this incident on 12/8.  I feel like I have to comment on the note at the end of my description of the event on the nuforc reports page.  The note said  that I most likely was seeing Venus.  This could not be the case.  I am familiar with what Venus looks like this time of year.  I saw a large glowing (not star like) half circle( with a few twinkles at the top)  that changed shape into a complete circle and changed color from white to orange.  It then shrunk to a pin point and then reversed the process and became a glowing half circle again althoug a little more stretched out (if that makes sense). The object I was looking at was MUCH larger than Venus. Again, Venus looks like a very large star with some orange color to it.  I notice it often.  This is NOT what I saw.  Thanks.  Just thought I should clarify. ((END))",2005-12-16T00:00:00,34.03061421800948,-117.14975355450235

Watching the plane a circular object crossed its path heading South. The object reminded me of watching satellite at night. It was traveling at a similar speed as the plane I was watching before. It appeared brighter than the satellite I've seen at night and if it was night it would of been as bright as the brightest star. Seeing the object got me excited so I ran upstairs to my bead room to get my camera. I grabbed it and ran back down and managed to take 3 pictures before the batteries died in the camera. I watched the object continue to move south until it came too close to where the Sun was in the sky. After that I couldn't see it anymore.

As I traveled along, I noticed it was going in the same direction as I was,West. I thought It was strange because it was very bright, and not very high in the sky.  I then thought, it must be a helicopter searching for someone.  I lost sight of it behind the trees on the winding road.  about 30 seconds later ,right in front of me just above the tree line I saw a triange shape craft with red and green lights underneath.  I stoped the car, because I could not beleive what I was seeing. It looked like a stealth, but was moving at a crawling speed.  I remember saying to myself it's not making any noise like plane.  I downed the car window to see if I could hear any noise coming from it , but I heard nothing.  It moved very slow and silent just above the trees toward the northeast.  I wanted to tell someone what I had seen but kept it to myself, because I knew they would think I was crazy.  that  was a little over a month ago.  Then I was on my way home from work again and heard a radio talk show on UFO's decribe exactly what I had seen.  I was bothered by it so much that I told my daughter and son-in-law. They searched for flying triangles on the internet and found your websight.  We couldn't beleive that what I had described to them was not only a true UFO sighting, but also had been seen by many others.  My son-in-law said that you had a UFO reporting center to help track sightings.  I decided to send you a report of my sighting. I hope it helps to find out what these flying triangles are.

Rogers (near), VA Shape: Cone Duration:6-9 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44632.html,"Camping out on a clear night, I saw a white cone of light touch the ground from outer space. In 2002 I hiked the length of the Appalachian Trail. It was around the first or second week in May when myself and four other friends where camped out close to Mt. Rogers. We were hiking north, but on that particular night we had been dropped of down the trail so we could hike south into Damasus, VA for the annual TrailDays Festival. We had set up camp out on an open field atop of a ridge where cows were grazing, a place which someone had named 'the boomer trail' (the words were carved on a wooden fence post at the end of the field). The view from ridge - essentially you could see for miles down into the valley in front of you, and miles in the opposite direction, down into the valleys behind (probably north and south views). A small part of our side to side (east and west) views were obstructed by hilltops along the ridgeline we were on.  It was not too long after sunset when all of us were sitting in a circle chatting and drinking tea. I was looking up at the stars. It was an amazingly clear night. Not one cloud in the sky. And since we were kind of isolated from any civilization, the stars were extremely prevalent. I believe there was also a full moon that night which was rising behind me, towards the south.  I was looking up and towards the northwest when, in almost the exact spot I was checking out, an amazingly bright light caught my attention. It was a white light and atleast as bright as moon, if not brighter. when I finally focused on the light, I saw that it was aimed somewhere behind me. A couple seconds went by when the light panned over top of us and down through the valley directly in front of me. It was then that I realized the light was in the shape of a perfect cone. It's hard to say how far across the light at the bottom of the cone was, but i would guess no more than 1/4 of a mile (pretty narrow).  When the spotlight had shut off it had already moved maybe two miles away from us. This whole process had lasted about 5 seconds. Although it appeared that the light had been shut off, there was still 2-3 seconds where you could see light coming from the source, kind of like the was fading out. However, I dont think the light was dimming. Rather I believe the beam had come from so far away that it just took a while for the light to finally dissipitate. When the white light had finally burnt completely out, it became obvious that the source was in outer space. What this light finally amounted too after this event was a near miniscule, dim, red dot that was slowly tracking across the sky. One probably would not have noticed it if the had not seen the powerful white beam that shot from it.  It would appear that it was a type of satellite, but I have never heard of any satellites that shoot perfect cones of light that touch the ground... About 5 minutes had past before the tiny red dot had tracked to the east and was no longer in our view....We all saw the red dot tracking, but only one other witness had seen nearly the entire length of the white-light incident. And, atleast one other person in the group, besides he, caught the tail end of the event.  All in all it was an amazing site to see and I have yet to tell the story to anyone that has any idea of what could have created such a powerful light. We were near a military base, so it may not be so suprising that something weird like that took place... The following day we were hiking across an open ridge and saw two planes doing manuevers coming toward us down in the valley below. One of the planes flew right over my head and it was so low I swear I could just about see the features of pilots face in the cockpit....Anyway, I would much like to learn what that light was and what purpose it has.......",2005-07-05T00:00:00,,

I am a U.S. citizen living adjacent to the northern-most shore of Tokyo Bay.  The condominium where my family and I live has a spacious outdoor terrace providing a 180 degree view facing due west.  The object I saw would be best described as triangular, although slightly irregular in shape.  My first impression was it looked like a ""stubby boomerang.""  The object was directly overhead at roughly 90 degrees from the observation surface.  It either emitted a dull white light, or was composed of a dull white material.  At arm's length the object would have measured 2 inches in width at its base, and about an inch and a half in length (thus the ""stubby"" description).  It moved from due south to due north and was visible for only 2 or 3 seconds.  There was absolutely no sound emitted from the object, and visual contact was lost after the object underwent a process that can be described as similar to television or video image dissolve.  In the same area, there have been numerous sightings of objects of varying descriptions.  I have seen several myself, my son reported seeing one and other individuals have either directly observed objects, or have recounted second-hand sightings.  Two years ago, a Japanese Air Self Defence Force helicopter was dispatched to the area described above and spent 30 minutes hovering at 60 to 80 feet.  I have no information about what a military helicopter would be doing making such a horribly loud racket and hovering so low over a residential area, but it seemed to be looking for something.  OTHER SIGHTINGS:  March 1993.  I was taking out the trash at approximately 21:30 and noticed in the corner of my eye something moving to my left at an altitude of 80 or 90 feet.  The object was almost completely transparent.  Heading due north, the object moved slowly and in complete silence.  From the angle I first saw the object, there were two hemispheres side by side facing downward (the rounded edges pointed downwards).  Above the hemispheres was a platform, like a table top viewed from the side.  There was a small building right next to me, and the view of the object was blocked as it continued moving in a direction directly behind the building.  I dropped the bags of trash and ran to the other side of the building and saw the same object again.  This time, the angle had changed.  The flying object was V-shaped with three hemispheres on each wing.  Again, it was almost transparent.  There were some people walking on the street who hadn't noticed the object.  The object was so silent and so nearly invisible, no one would have seen it unless they had happened to have directly spotted it.  Observation time: approximately 15 seconds.  July 1997.  In the same corridor, I saw an amoeba-like blob flying due south.  From our terrace, I had a front-and-center view of the setting sun (about 18:40).  The nearly transparent blob was heading in a direction that would take it directly in front of the sun.  I recalled my 1993 sighting and wondered what would happen when the object flew between my line of sight and the sun.  As the blob passed in front of the sun, I could see that the object looked about four times larger than the sun at the distance it was from me (300 feet or so).  Although the object did not block out the sunlight, the shape of the sun was slightly distored and slightly less light was emitted.  The object passed across the sun and continued in the same direction until it was out of sight.  Total viewing time: 10 seconds.  Two nights later, July 1997.  I decided to sit out on the terrace every night.  At sometime around 20:45, a gray-colored boomeranng-shaped object suddenly appeared from a due west direction and began flying directly towards me at an altitude of about 100 feet.  It was moving in a zig-zag configuration.  Although moving rapidly, it was clear that the object was changing shape with each curving maneuver it made.  Instead of having straight edges, the boomerang had wavy lines.  On both wings or blades of the boomerang shape there were darker gray-colored wavy lines extending from the front of the object to the tips of the wings.  Observation time 4-5 seconds.  Next night. July 1997, approximately 0:30.  I was out on the terrace hoping to see another object.  By this time, I had begun to theorize that the area of the sightings was a type of corridor for the objects.  I was outside patiently waiting and had been sitting for 5 or 6 hours and was about ready to go inside and go to bed.  Suddenly due west, a huge V-shaped object appeared at about 100 feet in altitude and at about 300 feet from my position.  It was very similar to the object I had witnessed in 1993; V-shape with hemispheres on the bottom surface of the wings.  There were some notable differences from the 1993 sighting.  First, instead of being almost completely transparent, it was dark gray in color.  It looked as though it was made of smoke or cloud, yet the giant V maintained a coherent shape as it glidely slowly due south.  Second, although the wings were parallel to the ground, the wing tips curved upwards and emitted either some type of particles or energy.  The edges of the wing-tips wavered in a manner resembling heat radiating off a hot paved road.  As I watched the object move slowly and silently in a steady due south direction, I couldn't help but wonder why the object had swept V-shaped wings.  At the speed it was traveling, they would have served no aerodynamic function.  Then a fortuitous event happened.  As the object progressed on its unchanging trajectory, it approached a 12-story condo building, and from my viewing angle, flew above the building which is about 350 feet away. At the mid-way point on the roof of the building, there is a rectangular structure that houses a water tank and air-conditioning equipment.  The V-shape object passed directly behind the utility structure and the left wing just barely cleared the structure.  Using these coordinates as a reference, I would estimate that the V-shaped object was 150 to 160 feet lengthwise, and about 80 feet wide from wing-tip to wing-tip.  At this point, I had been observing the object for at least 30 seconds.  I continued to watch it for another minute as it continued on its trajectory. Although the object had not yet disappeared from view completely, it had traveled far enough away that it appeared much smaller and far less visible.  It was still vaguely visible but I decided there was nothing more to observe, so I turned away and went to bed.  The above sighting was the most spectacular of any of my observations, including those leading up to the time of this writing (June 2005).  These experiences have led me to search the Internet to research what other observations have been made in other locations.  There is one important distinction that can be made about my observations and those made by other people.  The Internet has numerous postings of triangular-, boomerang-, and V-shaped objects.  But in every instance, there have been discriptions of lights on the objects.  In every case I have personally witnessed, the objects did not have what might be interpreted as mounted lights.  The objects have consistently been monochromatic or transparent, and when illuminated types were observed, the entire object was bright, not with light sources on isolated surfaces such a wing-tips, nose or center.  Again, I emphasize that each sighting I have made has been while I was alone.  However, individuals, including my son claim to have witnessed objects in the same corridor.",2005-07-05T00:00:00,,

It was about 1am on 05-21-05. Myself and two of my friends were at a campsite deep in the mountains in Suches Georgia. The campsite is located along an old dirt road called Old 41 that wonders through the southern appalachians. We were literally miles away from any other people.  It was a quiet, clear night.  We first noticed something strange when we saw a brief flash of light that lit up the canopy of trees around us.  It almost seemed like lightning.  There was no following thunder.  All three of us noticed right away that the skies were completely clear.   About twenty seconds later as my companions and I pondered and verbally discussed the source of the mysterious flash of light.  A triangular shaped craft flew directly over head at an amazing speed. The craft must have only been about fifty to one hundred feet over the tops of the trees.  At that speed and altitude, a pilot in a coventional plane would of had to be insane.  The object hissed as it passed by.  There was no other sound.  The object projected a sharp bright light (similar in brightness and color to a halogen spotlight) towards the ground and lit up every thing within my sight as it passed over.  The light was being emmitted from an area about 10 of 15 feet in diameter from the bottem center of the craft.  I think there might have been smaller more faint lights around the edges of the craft.  The ""fly-by"" only lasted a split second.  After the craft passed the wind picked up and lasted a minute or two. I can't remember how long exactly because I was franticly throwing my camping gear into the back of the truck.  Then we left at about 1:20am.

Not noticed in the desert; only noticed when I looked at my pictures. At 1:00 PM PST, I took a picture of a desert scene in the Mojave National Preserve, at the entrance to the Gold Valley Ranch. As I took the snapshot, I did not hear or see any object; it was only after I returned home to South Carolina and reviewed my pictures (taken with a digital camera) that I noticed what appeared to be a dark spot in the picture. When I zoomed in on my computer, the spot began to take the shape of some form of aircraft. I thought maybe there was a spot or blemish on my camera lens, but checked the pictures taken just before and just after the subject snapshot and found no similar spots on those shots.  The object is disc-shaped, with two distinct portions. the lower portion is disc-shaped and the upper part appears to be something like a cockpit. There is a reflection on the top part and the bottom is in a shadow. It is not clear from the photograph, but the object appears to be moving left to right, which would be heading west northwest. The reflection and shadow are consistent with shadows cast on the ground.  I estimate the object was about 1 and 1/2 miles from me. This is a judgment call, referencing the mountains nearby.  Please note that I am a skeptic regarding alien ships and such. I'm sure there is a good explanation for what is in my picture. Upon request, I will submit the photograph.",2005-07-05T00:00:00,,

On Sat . 6/11/05 I woke up at about 11:10 p.m.  I had gone to bed early, it was very hot.  I'd had a very strange dream that had woken me up. I turned on the light in my bedroom and lay there getting my wits about me.  I then got up  and went downstairs to use the bathroom and to get a drink of water. As I passed through the dining room in the dark, I glanced out the windows and saw a bright blinking white light about 100-150 feet over the road.  I continued into the kitchen, then bathroom.  When I came out, I stopped and got a drink of water out of the refrigerator.  As I walked back through the dining room, I glanced out of the windows again and walked to the window to get a better look at the blinking light that was still there and saw the light moving from over the road towards the field between my house and my neighbor's. I stood there for a minute or two trying to figure out what it was when these blue bubble-like spheres began to fall from the light towards the ground in the field about 200 ft. from the house.  They seemed to tumble down and then sort of float a little way before landing on the ground.  They glowed bluish with a gold-like color interior, sort of translucent.  I think that about twelve or fifteen had fallen before I became very agitated as to what to do about it.  I then ran back into the kitchen and out into the enclosed porch off the kitchen facing them and turned on the outside lights on the porch roof that shown in the direction of the field. As I returned to the dining room windows (I looked at the kitchen clock and it was 11:22 p.m.) to see if I could see anymore of the bubbles or the blinking lights and I could see nothing.  I left on my outside lights all night long and didn't go to sleep until about 3:30 A.M  The next morning I walked the field but could find no evidence of what I had seen the night before.  I have seen several strange things in  the sky here for several years now, but nothing as up close as this.  I am a professional person and am very sensible, with a sound mind.   This incident was just too strange, even in light of the last several years' sightings, some of which I have reported to you. Many I have not, though.  The night was dead calm.  VERY HOT.  There was absolutely no sound at all.   None from the object of light in the sky or the bubble-like spheres.  None in the entire area at the time of the sighting.

A man and his young son had exited the building and let a group of helium filled balloons go.  I watched the balloons drift to the west with the parking lot attendant, who after a few minutes turned away.  I continued to watch the balloons when I saw a round sphere shaped object appear to the left of the balloons.  The sphere had sharply defined edges and appeared translucent and seemed to turn various shades of grey.  It began to move in an arc downward and to the right, as if circling the balloons.  I called the parking attendant to come and see this but before he returned the sphere, after completing a quarter circle and being below the balloons, simply vanished. What happened next was strange in that both the attendant and myself had this unusual visual effect like hundreds of bright particles flashing around in front of our eyes.  The attendant described it like crystals shooting about.  This effect continued for 4-5 minutes before it began to dissapate.   I am a field investigator for MUFON and have had several sightings in the past where the UFO disappeared and I have seen this same visual effect.   I filed a report with MUFON on this sighting.

We turned off Interstate 71 about 15 miles south of Columbus on State Rt. 62 at the Harrisburg/ Orient exit.  We were seven miles south of I-71.  The terrain is flat for the most part.  Upon approaching a rise in the road, (much like an overpass), the road curves to the left.  As we were approaching the rise there was a bank of four white lights came on above the rise.  They were straight ahead and beyond the rise/curve maybe 500-1000 feet past.  They were 300-400 feet high.  They were street light sized and intensity and spaced 4-5 feet apart in a stationary horizontal line.  I know the height because I routinely climb a 200 foot tower for work.  At first I thought they were maybe a cell phone tower.  I did not see a strobe or beacon.   My daughter was awake and saw the same thing.  We didn’t say anything about it at the time.  The time was approx. 2100 on Friday the 28th of October.  We were chatting normally for the next few miles maybe 5-7 and the we saw exactly the same thing on the opposite side of the road.  This time we both looked at each other in amazement. She asked what the heck was that and she indicated she had seen it back at the curve.  I replied that it was probably an aircraft or cell phone tower.  We kept talking about it and then we wondered if maybe we had seen a UFO.  The lights did exactly the same thing each time.  All four came on for about five seconds and then went out one at a time from left to right at one second intervals.  Each time it looked like we were passing the object because the viewed angle changed as we moved forward.  Speed was approx. 60mph.  The object stayed motionless.  No sound. No shadows.  No illumination of the surrounding structure.  The night was very clear. Moon was maybe a crescent.  Air was cool, about 35 deg F.  We were well into the country. Not much ambient light.  We continued talking about it the rest of the trip.  We arrived at out destination at the expected time, about an hour later.  We had not been on this route since May but had been this way many times before.  We decided not to worry about it but to look closely on the return trip, which was two days later. It would be daylight on the return trip.  Thirty-six hours later we were on our way back home.  We had decided to watch closely once we were north of Washington Courthouse.  We would then know if there were indeed cell phone towers in the area.  There were NO cell phone towers anywhere in the vicinity of Rt. 62 north of Washington Courthouse and all the way past the overpass where we first noticed the lights.  We were just curious if this type light pattern had ever been reported and if there were some reasonable explanation. ((initials deleted))",2005-11-08T00:00:00,,

Our company allows us to sit down after our work is completed for the day.  On this day we decided to go outside and sit.  It was a mostly clear with a little wind blowing to the west.  Our plant is near the railroad tracks so we watch the trains and the jet airplanes as they pass by (there were several that day as always).  When I first noticed the objects (at least 3 maybe more) they were northwest of our location.  My first thought was that they were gulls (birds) because they appeared to be white in color.  They were circling each other when I said to my co-worker ""look at that"".  At that point one shot off in a southeast direction at a high rate of speed (much faster than any jet we have ever seen).  When I looked back to where they were the rest were gone.  My next thought was maybe this was a mylar balloon.  That is when I noticed which way the wind was blowing (the other direction).  As the object moved across the sky it sort of changed colors.  As I said, it first appeared white but as it moved it would look metallic or silver in color. This might be because the object appeared to be banking or rocking back and forth.   When it had left our sight (because it went over our building), my co-worker said ""what was that?"".  I ask him if he had seen the other ones, to which he replied that he had only seen the one moving to the southeast.  He also stated that he had never seen anything like that before (me either).

I saw several (could have been up to 15) large lights in the skies driving in an area of about 5 miles; I saw these lights everywhere in the sky all of them spaced out evenly.  Some were more lit than the others, and their lights appeared to be twinkling/flashing/pulsating, they seemed to be more or less stationary with slight movement.  As I got home I saw about 3 of these lights above my house, only one was very bright while the others were not as bright; I stood there for about 10 minutes smoking a cigarette and staring at these lights.  I noticed that the larger light was either going round in small circles, it was definitely moving of some sort but I couldn’t make out the formation of it's movement, as I was too far away.  As I watched them for 10 minutes or so they all dimmed a little but they were still visible.  The next day I told a few trusted people and they say they didn't see anything of the sort.  I have never reported a UFO before and felt a bit confused that I was the only one who saw these lights; my only thought about this is did anyone else in my area see any of these lights?  It was very strange indeed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",2005-05-11T00:00:00,,

Around 1:20 a.m. my wife noticed a star-like object swaying in the distance, through our bedroom window. It was extremely clear that evening and the moon was very bright (rare for Washington nights this time of year). We both got out of bed to get a closer look, when we noticed 3+ objects, all emitting what looked light red and green light. Not believing what we were seeing, several other craft came into view to the north of us. We witnessed strange and rapid movements, and light emissions. After 10 minutes, I grabbed our video camera and started filming. We switched off, capturing 20-30 minutes of footage. We filmed interaction between the craft and obscure individual movement of 2-3 of them. Viewing the objects through the video lens allowed us to see much greater detail and some great close-ups were captured.  One object was mainly filmed as it was the brightest and most prominent. My wife believes she saw this same bright object the following night.  However as she turned on the video camera and started to focus on it, the video camera shut off.  She tried a second time, and the video camera shut off again.  The bright object was in a different position in the sky, and this was an earlier time of night through a different window in the house.  This is the 3rd night since our first sighting, and the sky is cloudy so we cannot see anything. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at the star, Sirius, or perhaps some other ""twinkling"" star or celestial body.  We spoke with the witness, and he sounded quite sincere, but he witnessed the same object several days later.

I am writing to you about a very strange sighting I saw around my house about a year ago and that my younger brother saw October 26th 2005.  In the mid summer of 2004 I was driving home from work and it was around 12:00 in the morning. Living in a fairly rural area with fields and forests all my life I am accustomed to seeing the occasional deer, fox or if I am lucky Moose.  On that night I came around the corner of my street and saw in the light of my neighbours driveway two upright beings that stood at around 7-8 feet tall and did not appear to be clothed.  At first I thought it was my neighbours walking at night, but when I saw the height, I was surprised and the their walking movement was much different then that of a human being.  Consequently I was a bit nervous, but as I turned the corner and had them in full view they walked into my neighbour's driveway out of sight.  As I came by my neighbour's house the two beings were no where to be seen, there is a 16 foot cedar hedge and large overgrown field next to my neighbors that's where I think they may have gone.  Once I came home I recounted the situation to my family and haven't really thought much of it since then.  Tonight, the night of the 26th of October 2005, my father asked my brother to bring the garbage out at around 9:30.  To my surprise he came running to my room out of breath and recounted what he had seen in front of my neighbours driveway.  To my surprise his sighting sounded very similar to mine accept for the fact that he only saw one being and not two.  I feel kind of stupid and I have spoken to my girlfriend about it and she just laughed at me, but I know what I saw and I feel kind of stuck because no one will believe me  accept my brother who has witnessed the same sighting.  So I came on to the internet and decided to look for places who studied aliens and other strange sightings as this and I came across your site and decided it would be best if I wrote to you about the situation.  I am just wondering if anyone else has seen anything similar and if you have any explanations as to what my brother and I saw.  I would like to thank you very much for your time and hope to hear from you in the future. I remain. Contact me via e-mail.",2005-11-03T00:00:00,45.40004642857143,-74.03078571428571

We were on highway 280 driving on our way to Redwood city from San Francisco when we saw these objects.  It was my wife who pointed these two mysterious objects out as I was driving.  She tapped me on the shoulder an told me to looked up to the upper right corner of the sky.  I saw two bright stationary objects (they appeared to be brighter than the sun or anything I have ever seen in my entire life. There was a large object above a smaller one.  I did not look at them the entire time because I was on the high-way and I did not want to risk an accident with another car, so I turned away and started driving.  When there were not any cars around and it was safe to slow down, I looked back up into the same spot of the sky I had just looked at and saw five white lights in the sky.  They were as bright as the other objects I had seen except this time they were smaller.  As I watched them they appeared to be falling towards the earth (I do not know how high up the objects were). I asked my wife and children what had happened and they told me that the object had exploded in the sky after a light green object emItted some kind of a beam.   According to my wife and children, the two bright white objects had been obviously been attacked and destroyed by the green object.

We all saw 3 red lights in a triangular pattern.  We saw directly West of us, about 40 degrees above the horizon.  We do not know how long they had been in the sky before we saw them.   They were moving directly East (090 heading) slowly.  It was difficult to tell if they were moving at first.  The lights were the brightest objects in the sky, the moon was not visible.  They did not light up the sky, but they were much brighter than any stars.   We were able to see stars between the lights, verifying that it was not one large craft.   We also saw between 3-4 shooting stars in the general vicinity of the lights, which is odd for a suburb this close to Chicago.   One light disappeared at about  70 degrees above the West horizon.  They passed directly overhead, then a second disappeared at roughly 70 degrees above the East horizon.  The final one disappeared about about 45 degrees above the East horizon.   The lights passed us over in complete silence.  The event lasted approximatley 15 minutes.  The lights were constant, and were only red.  Not any civilian aircraft, which have red/green nav lights, and usually strobes.   The speed was very difficult to judge, because altitude was difficult to judge.  The brightness of the lights implied that they were not very high, but the speed implied that they were not very low.  Very difficult to judge.

My brother called to tell me, at 1:07 AM, that there were two strange red lights in the sky.  This seemed to be worth getting up for, especially since I was watching Casino on the Bravo network.   My brother is located in Oak Forest approximately 20 minuted from where I am in Evergreen Park.  Oak Forest, being farther from Chicago has alot less light pollution.   But when I walked outside, the first thing I noticed was all of the celestial objects I could observe when I look up; 75-90  degrees in the sky.   However, I was not outside to stare at Ursa Minor and Venus; I was looking for red lights.   I asked my brother where the lights were, he did a bad job describing where they were so I just looked toward his apartment (South) and then turned my head away from the apartment (east).   I then saw what he was talking about, two red lights just sitting in the sky at a 45 degree angle from my vantage point, no movement at all.  It took me about 5 secs to come to the conclusion that I could not create a rational explanation for what the lights were.   My heart fell into my stomach and my feet toward my house; I knew I had to get my digital camera.  I was back outside in about a minute.  I tried to take a picture but the battery in the camera was drained of power because it has to sit in the charger not the camera and has been in the camera for about two weeks.   I observed the object for maybe two more minutes before it just faded.  I have never seen anything like this, I could rule out the following as explanations: helicopter (never heard of a silent helicopter), satellite (satellites actually move).  It was not a plasma flare because these were lights on an object.   Was it an airplane?  No, it was not because of the same reason it was not a satellite, they actually move.

An addendum to my report of the Tinley Park lights sighting on 10/01/05: I noticed that in other reports that were posted about this event that people saw a number of meteors in the vicinity of the lights that night.  I too saw a meteor in the NW sky @ 70 degree angle from the horizon while the lights were visible.  At that time, and even now, I think it was just coincidence. It was another report that really got my attention, it was from New Lenox IL.  The individual stated that he saw 3 star light or satellite colored objects in the sky during the evening of 9/30/05 and that he never saw anything like that.  As a point of interest, I referenced in a report that I posted after witnessing the 10/31/04 lights over Tinley, that I saw a triangle formation of satellite looking lights fly directly over my house during the 8/21/04 red light sighting over Tinley.  Interesting thing is I was unaware of the red lights at the time and didn't find out about 8/21/04 sighting of the red lights untill the 10/31/04 incident.  Food for thought. I will probably file a separate report about an interesting object/light I seen last evening on the way to work.  Debating if it was a plane or not.

On one of the nights (yesterday), I was gazing far off into the night sky observing the constellations when I saw a streak of light, akin to a shooting star--though it appeared as if the light source came from behind a cloud. It looked as if whatever was zooming at high speed behind the cloud had casted its light onto the cloud--something which a shooting star is unlikely to do.  I felt an odd sensation on the top of my head , almost like goosebumps or static electricity. I felt the need to run my fingers through my hair to make the feeling go away. I found this as odd, but passed it off as only a shooting star.  However, the night after (tonight) I experienced something similar to the night before--only much closer...while walking along a sidestreet before getting to my home, I thought i heard an animal behind me, so i turned my head to take a cursory glance; almost half a kilometre away and a quarter kilometre above myself I saw a flash of light streaking across the sky horizontally, as if a firecracker went off; vibrant white, almost blinding. I could hear a hiss and a crackle (like a vinyl record player makes).  And again, that odd senstation occured--a static feeling on the top of my head followed by vibrations down throughout--stopping around my knees.  Though what is strikingly odd is how close it was to the ground and to myself.  I could hear it as well, so there is no mistaking the streak of light coming from within the earth's atmosphere. During my 3 years of walking during the night I have never seen anything like this--not to mention twice during two nights. I have seen a shooting star before several years ago, and I know enough to know that there must be another explanation for this. However, the sensations that have occured directly after the flashes were not caused by my inner body, as I have never felt this particular way ever before.",2005-06-20T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

Each circle had 6 lights to it.  My wife saw them as well.  They really did light up the sky. There were loads of these circles that were slowly moving around the night sky. Some dipped below the mountains and some rose above the terrain as they moved.  I took pictures on my camera phone of these lights however i cannot send them to this site as they cannot be transfered to computer unfourtunatly.

As my 2 co-workers and I looked at it, we said ""are they birds?"" but they were too shiny in the sky and there wasn't really any sun hitting them, besides, birds fly in formation, not hover, and they were about 6-8 miles away anyway.  They couldn't have been fighter jets because jets are usually travelling very fast and don't hover, especially in formation.  As they kind of floated there somemore, they suddenly all 4 disappeared up into the storm cloud.",2005-06-20T00:00:00,39.615879827400214,-104.88518732470335

I was throwing a football straight up in the air and catching it as it came back down when I noticed the object in the sky.  It was small at first, about the size of a star but I remember thinking it couldn't be since it was nearly noon and directly overhead.  It got bigger and bigger and I realised it was coming down.  It made no sound at all.  At one point it just seamed to hover above me, and apeared to be a small silver ball about the size of a dime held at arms length.  It was hard to tell how high it was, my best guess is that it was somewhere between 2,000 - 5,000 feet high.  I continued to stare at it, wondering what it could be.  Then I remember feeling a strange sensation as if my whole body shifted an inch to the right in a matter of an instant as I continued to stare at the object.  A few seconds after that point I noticed a jet heading towards the object.  Thinking back now on the situation, I realise that it may have been a military jet coming from the direction of the Whiteman Air Force base, just west of Jefferson City.  As the jet got closer to it, the object appeared to rapidly ascend straight up until it was no longer visible.  The jet that had been coming towards the object turned around and flew back in the direction it came from.  I remember going into the house and being scolded by my mom for not answering her calls for me, and I thinking she was crazy since I was just outside in the backyard and did not hear her calling my name.

We reported this sighting to the county sheriff’s office.  Two local papers, the Journal Herald (no longer in print) and the Dayton Daily News, picked up the story from the police report and published reports from our interview.

I was 7 at the time and was interested in space and any kind of airplane. I was actually mad that I had to leave the house that night because of a report that I saw that was coming on NBC Nightly News with John Chancellor that I wanted to see. The report was on the flap in Mississippi at the same time. Subsequently, we found the haunted house and drove by, not stopping to go in, when we turned around to go home and saw a huge bluish-green oval in the sky. People in their cars were looking up and pointing to it. We followed in the general direction of the craft and turned into a neighborhood off Archdale Dr. near Park Rd Park. As we approached a group of trees in a front yard the object seemed to turn and as we cleared the trees the object had vanished. From that point on I have studied the subject intensely. I currently work at CDI Airport and am familiar with all sorts of aircraft. It was no aircraft, civilian or military, that I have seen then or since. It wasn't a weather balloon, temperature inversion, searchlight, swamp gas, Venus or a ""mass hallucination"" (my favorite BS explanation).

It wasn't much bigger than a star but it was much brighter. At first I thought it might be a hovering helicopter with a searchlight (although no other lights were flashing).  Soon after I pointed it out to her it streaked towards the ground like a shooting star. It left a streak as it fell. My fears of a helicopter crashing suddenly evaporated when the light stopped at the horizon.  I have no clue how high it was due to its distance away from us.

Miffed at the speed of the fall and the sudden stop, I still was trying to figure out how a plane or a helicopter could have recovered from such a quick descent.  Suddenly it streaked horizontally from in front of us to 90 degrees from the front of the car on the drivers side door. It seemed to hover over a tree line across a field off the highway. Suddenly the bright white light went out and a smaller red and blue light alternated on and off for a few seconds. Then the white light came back on brighter than before.  This whole time I was trying to watch and drive at the same time as my mother watched from my right. I eventually had to stop watching as I was having to look back at this point. It was still there the last time I looked. Never moving but just hovering over the trees.  I'm a CAD/CAM Administrator and have never seen a UFO before (although I believe in them). My mother is a hairdresser and she fully admits that she whitnessed the whole event as well. The relatives later that night were not as amused.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,39.9548,-82.7693

I was so exhausted when I ""fell"" into my bed. I told my best friend after this happened.  I truly do not know how much time had passed before telling her. I feel like the time has just gone in my head.  After I told her, I wrote it in my journal on Dec. 26, 2004.   Here is my entry:   I truly believe I was abducted by aliens  a couple of weeks ago.  I don't remember what day it was but I did have to go to work.  (I work Mon- Fri).  My ""dreams"" of my house were too vivid to be dreams; something happened.   I remember standing at the patio door looking up.  The ship was huge with 2, 3 or 4 big lights.  I remember a red and a white light.  I knew I was looking at the back.  But, instead of seeing my backyard, there was a field with 2 cars.  I think the one closest to me was a red convertible with the top down.  There was a woman leaning against the car.  I think she had dark curly hair to her shoulder.  Darker than mine and softer curls.  I think there was 1 or 2 men sitting in the car drinking.   These details are too vivid and too memorable to be a dream.  The ship was a very strong material; gunmetal grey in color.  (Here I drew the picture of what I saw).  Backend - what I saw, the house blocked the rest of the ship.  (I was looking up).  The clencher is that I was jolted ""awake"" (in bed).  I turned over and the clock read 5:26 am.  I felt like I had just gotten in bed and I was exhausted.   I didn't want to have to get up and go to work.  I turned on to my left side and my first thought was that I'd need to get checked out for any implants.  I tried to find something on the internet to tell my story but didn't find anything in that short time.  I told [my best friend] last night and she doesn't think I'm crazy.  When I wrote it, I wrote things going on in my life before and after.  There was no break.  Also, I remember when I wrote this how calm I became.  To clarify how I saw the ship, I have two sliding glass doors going outside.  I have to open both of them.  I remember seeing everything in the den as it is right now (not like a dream where everything is distorted or made up) and I was standing in the house, at the first door, with both open, in my, probably, nightgown that night.  I was looking up and if I had stepped out and jumped up, I could have touched the ship it was that close.  I have metal awnings but that night, it was like they were gone.   Because the ship was so close, and the view I had, that's why I could only see the back.  It was like I was being dropped off.  I didn't feel strange or funny or have any weird things.  (Supernatural things do happen to me at night but as long as I pray,  it helps.   I now wear a St. Michael the Archangel medal that was blessed by the Pope and pray to him each night also and that has helped tremendously).  To clarify being exhausted.  Have you ever gone out one night and partied and got drunk (not too drunk but enough to know you're drunk) and you came in at 4 or 5 or 6 am?  Then, you throw yourself in bed and you're asleep before you've stopped moving?  That's what I felt like.  I had gone to bed the night before, as usual, but when I was jolted awake, I looked at the clock (see above) and literally felt like I had been dropped into my bed and that I had not gotten any sleep.   My best friend is the only one I told about this because I'm too scared to talk to anyone else.  Maybe I watch too many tv shows and movies but I have not spoken to anyone about this.  I've thought long and hard and I wanted to report this but I don't want anything bad to happen to me.   I watched the Peter Jennings show tonight on ABC and you were mentioned at the end, with no contact information but I wrote down your name and was able to google it.   I've considered being hypnotized to dig deeper but I don't want to be alone when it happens to avoid any muddying.  I hope in some way that you do take me seriously and can help me to come to terms with what has happened to me.  I will state now that I don't party, I don't get drunk, I don't do drugs, I don't take any special Rx medications. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I immediately said something to my friend to look up and tell me what that was, but it moved too quickly and she did not see it.

I will repeat what I wrote in my original e-mail. ""Tonight- Saturday - at 9:15pm I went outside for a smoke and did so on the backdoor stoop - which faces east, north and south. On the horizon to the east (added - from Mary Lake subdivision)I briefly saw a light low on the horizon but obscured by trees - thinking a star. I moved slightly to to look for it again but did not see it. A few minutes later again saw a light briefly but again it disappeared. A few minutes later a light appeared from the east in the direction I had seen before along with another, following. Both lights were of the same intensity and both were of a reddish colour about 3 times the brightness of the planet in the ESE at the time. Both lights followed each other, slowly. First impression was of 2 helicopters coming in to land at the airport. There were no flashing lights, just a reddish light common to both with no apparent difference in intensity nor quality. Followed the lights, measured the distance between then when above (as high as an uparm salute {80 degree arc?}as the distance of 3/4 of my index finger. The flight path came from the east deviating in a northerly direction. When at their highest but to my left both lights stopped. The lead light then turned north (and at this time a small meteor came from the east) and within a short distance faded altogether. The other light then continued on its flight path - easterly/northerly - and I had to step off the stoop to go to the edge of my deck {16'} as the roof of the {2 storey} housebegan to obscure the light. The light then continued for a short while until it too faded. I am assuming that perhaps this was a satellite insertion of some sort. However the colour of the lights and slow speed were not something I have seen before in reference to satellites nor the direction. Other satellite insertions have been from the south to north - where rocket/satellite separate at relatively high speeds/altitudes and with a colour of usual satellite observation - ie white. I have no idea of the altitude of the reddish lights. Difficult to judge without knowing the size of the lights. There was no sound involved. Incidentally at 11.45pm there were 2 meteors coming from the north - the first with quite a ""head"" to be followed seconds later by a smaller one."" I live in Wolf Creek Rural Residential Subdivision which is located 1 mile west of the Mary Lake Subdivision mentioned in one of the reports on this incident and my property is on the eastern boundary. This area is on one of the flight paths into Whitehorse airport and on the flight path of Anchorage flights to the east and reverse.

He came and woke me up, and we tried looking at it with my binoculars (which are better than some telescopes).  I too thought it looked like there were two separate things.  It looked like a ball of light, about the size of a very large star, and sometimes it would separate into two balls of light.  Even through the binoculars it still only looked like balls of light with red and blue parts.   Sometimes the two things were so close together it looked like one, and sometimes they looked like they were circling around each other.  Their position in the sky did not change.

I'm a licensed private pilot.  I was in my kitchen in West St. Paul looking out the window west northwest towards downtown Minneapolis 11 miles away from me. I saw a bright light over Minneapolis. I knew it was the landing light of a large jet on a downwind leg to land at Minneapolis International Airport.  My 10 year old son was the only one home with me at the time. He was in the living room watching t.v. The jet was coming directly toward me and also decending, so it looked from my perspective like a stationary light in the sky that was just growing larger and larger.  So I thought it would be fun to play a joke on my son, so I said come quick, there's a U.F.O!"" He came running. We looked out the window at the landing light on the jet growing larger and larger. My son was in awe!  We watched it for about 2 minutes and then as it became near enough to us, we could finally see the red and green wingtip navigation lights and a blinking white strobe light on it's belly. I said to my son ""oh boy, I guess it was just a jet plane after all!"" (At this point, I would say that the jet was about 2 miles from us, maybe a bit farther).  No sooner  had I finished saying that, both he and I saw a large spherical ball, I would guess about 50 feet in diameter, descend to Earth from an altitude much higher than the jet was flying. We were right at the window, and the object entered our fields of vision from the top of the window opening, so it must have come from an extremely high altitude. I have seen many meteors, and this was no meteor.  When it first appeared, it was falling in a slight arcing travel path from northeast to southwest, but very quickly changed into a strightline fall directly down all the way to Earth and disappeared behind the treeline. We didn't see it rise up again. I think it struck the Earth.  I know it wasn't a meteor because it fell much more slowly than a meteor would, like it's speed of descent was being controlled (imagine a meteor with a large drag chute, if you will.) The object was glowing in a very faint, light blue aura that reminded me of what a blue topaz gemstone looks like. It was EXTREMELY beautiful!  Me and my son looked at each other in amazement and we both said ""what was that?!"" at the same time!  I say there were 4 witnesses to this sighting because the object came down in it's path of travel directly between me and my son and the two pilots of the jet.  I know that there is NO WAY that those 2 pilots could have missed seeing it!  I watched the T.V. news and the newspapers for a few days afterwards hoping that there were many more witnesses and that there was a story to be told, but I never heard a word about it.  I'm not exactly sure of the date being March 10th, but I am sure it was in early March at about 6 p.m. I'm reporting it now, because as the weeks have gone passed, I am at an absolute loss to explain what I saw and I'll just bust if I don't tell somebody!  If this object indeed came to a rest on Earth, I would estimate it's current location would be along a line between the north end of the city of West St. Paul and downtown Minneapolis about 2, maybe 3 miles from West St. Paul toward Minneapolis. I would guess it hit the ground near Cherokee Park in St. Paul, or perhaps in the Mississippi River between the Ford Dam and downtown St. Paul.  I will never forget it's slow fall and beautiful faint light blue glow! Like an angel's halo!!! ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi! The best I could do to reconstruct the date was to look at our calender back in March for any unusual events. My wife gets home from work at 5:30 p.m., so she would have been home, but she wasn't. The only thing the calender shows is that on Mar. 8th, she was gone in the evening to our church for bible a study, so I believe now that the sighting was on Mar. 8th, 2005, not Mar 10th.  I didn't contact any investigators or authorities because this sphere was just so unusual that it just couldn't have been anything easily explainable (from Earth!). I figured if I watched the news carefully, the two jet pilots or the FAA controllers at Mpls. International would be speaking about it, or the fact that this thing came down near sunset but still very much in broad daylight in the center of a major metropolitan area would mean there were probably many thousands of witnesses, but nothing in the news ever appeared.  If I ever see anything like that again, I will certainly take careful notes, now that I have somebody like you guys that I can tell about it.  I'm 48 yrs. old, and I've never seen anything like that in my life! I kinda hope I don't see one ever again! Kinda scary in a way, not knowing what you just saw, you know?

I say military jets because I had enough time to ponder if they were helicopters but they were moving too fast.  They weren't falling but seemed to be flying down and forward at an angle toward us.  At the time, it didn't occur to me jets make lots of noise and there was no noise.   Just at the top of the treeline, the first light blinked out and shortly after, the second light blinked out.

I went out for a long walk down the east side of the Charles river starting from Mass Ave and made my way north always keeping close to the river. When I got to the first bridge after passing the Longfellow Bridge I decided to head back from the other side of the river. I crossed this bridge (passing by the Museum Of Science) and started walking back down south again sticking close to the riverside on a small pathway for runners and bikers. It was when I was around the proximity of Memorial Drive when I saw an black flying object that was shaped like a disc, floating in the distance over the Charles River. At first I thought it was a kite that someone was flying but the way it was flew wasnt convincing enough. It flipped on all three axis and it was flying only in one direction. The altitude never changed (it was flying pretty low already but could fly over 10 story buildings) and it flew way to far to be a in a kites flying range. It flew pretty slow. I stopped to watch it fly by until it flew over the buildings out of my sight over memorial drive and up north. There were people around me at that time of the event but most were runners who were out for an exercise and didnt see the flying object. I looked around to see if anyone else is pointing or looking skywards at the object but I couldnt see none. I was pretty depressed that day (hence the long walk) so I didnt bother talking to anyone around me about it. Also, at that time, I have already walked for over an hour, and it was around dinner time and I was a bit hungry. I was also listening to my i-pod all the time druing my walk. But I am pretty sure I did see a tangable object fly over Charles River that day in the fashion as I have described above.

I was watching one of the jets flying straight up at a high altitude when I noticed a silver ball north of the Blue Angel jet.

My Meade LXD55 AR-5 telescope had been set-up and aligned for viewing Saturn and Jupiter tonight. While scope was tracking Saturn and waiting for the optics to cool down for better views, the SW sky was being observed just in case any more orange lights like the ones sighted on 02/24/05 might reappear, which, surprisingly, they did. The first instance happened at precisely 19:23 {the hand controller for the scope can display the time among other useful information} involving 3 orange lights flashing once sequentially one after the other, spread out at roughly a heading of 238 degrees and 12 degrees above the horizon plus and minus around 3 degrees for each coordinate to encompass the total area in which the phenomena was first noticed. A quick GOTO of the scope to the star, Aldebaran, and then switching the ""targets"" submenu to ""terrestrial mode"" {disables the RA motor so it no longer tracks celestial objects} before slewing to middle of the region of sky containing the orange lights via the use of the scope's red-dot pointer/finder is how these objects can be precisely located and documented by me. The second incident occurred at 19:27 and was quite similar at about around 3 degrees lower above the horizon than the initial group. The third and final incident was at 19:32 hrs. I was able to slew the scope's red-dot precisely onto the location of the center light as they illuminated a few seconds longer than before, they were also tightly bunched together this time at a precise heading of 242 degrees/ 13 arcminutes and an altitude of exactly 5 degrees/17arcminutes plus or minus 5 arcminutes - the average accuracy of GOTO slews to celestial objects after a precise polar alignment. The orange lights did not stay on long enough to get a peek throught the scope, unfortunately. Whatever these things are {satellites? Iridium flares?} must of moved below the treeline and eventually the horizon after the last series of flashes. Absolutely no nav lights flashing while briefly observed if these are some kind of aircraft. Numerous aircraft were spotted travelling towards the general area of Ft. Smith at the time, which were definitely adhering to FAA regulations. Location of observations is at 35.26N by 093.40W.

On Saturday night, March 12th 2005, I was working at the front desk of the Continental Plaza Inn in Seattle, WA.  This hotel is located on Queen Anne Hill, just south of the Aurora bridge.  At approximately 7:45pm, our computer, Xerox machine, and several lights in the lobby all seemed to blink and then began to hum for a split second.  Being the only employee on the premises, I was worried that the hotel might be in the middle of an electrical outage.  I looked at the clock on the wall, which read 7:45, grabbed a flashlight, and headed towards our parking lot.  Once outside, I found that our parking lot was completely dark.  Four of our exterior lights, and one street light, were all out.  I then walked to the sidewalk which runs along the east side of Aurora avenue and looked north.  Several street lights, including those at the corner of Aurora and Halladay avenue, were out, along with several near the Canlis restaurant nearby.  While I was walking towards a utility room to search for the circuit breaker the lights suddenly came back on again, they were out for a total of three minutes.  It should be noted that the four exterior lights which went out are not activated by sensor, they are turned on by timers at the same time each night.  I would not have been bothered by this occurrence until later when I heard on KIRO radio that some sort of object had passed over the Pacific Northwest at the same time (7:45pm).  I also heard from the radio that a variety of other electrical problems occurred in the Queen Anne, Fremont, and Ballard areas of Seattle.  I have a very strange feeling about the entire episode. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be both objective in his description of the events, and quite credible.  Given that the presumed meteor was at least 200 miles to the south of Seattle, we doubt that its presence could have anything to do with the power failure here.  No power failures in Oregon have been reported to NUFORC, as of the date of this writing.  PD))",2005-04-16T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

They were not driving back towards the city of Van Wert where they lived when they seen a jack-o-lantern type of light in a woods to their left that was probably a couple of hundred feet from where they were.  The light was in or or on the side where they could see it OK. It was about six feet above the ground and it raise to the top of the trees and then went back down again. It done this several times as mom and dad sat there and watch it.  Suddenly their engine stopped and dad could not restart it. He open the door and got out to raise the hood when, I think, they heard a strange ""wrirring' sound over head. Dad looked up and there was a flying saucer flying over them. You could see the ""saucer"" shape easily in the twilight.  Thirty years or so has taken its toll on my memory so I have lost some of the details over the years, also consider that they had seen something back then, at least, you could be considered a crack po. I imagine that countless sighting are lost because of our govenments effort to deny and also ridicule someone for sauing what they seen.  They told me that they seen window like lights around the top of the craft. Also I think that they mentioned green and red sparks eminating from the craft. I would estimate that the craft was 50 to 75 feet above them.  The UFO stopped for a breif period of time over the woods and then it resumed its course of I would estimate at about 280 to 290 fegrees true that would take it just north of Ohio City and somewhere around Fort Wayne.  My family and I had came from South Bend to visit relatives around Van Wert and we were visiting my parents. Dad and I were talking about science and he started to tell me about something and then paused.  He said that they had an encounter a few months ago and were afrai to tell anybody. I said, ""dad you know me better than that, you apparently had just seen what I have been looking for"".  Within a few minutes I had mom and dad in my car as we heard to the site. They told me about the whole incident as we drove to the location. They should me exactly where they stopped, where the craft went over head and the direction in which it continued on.  Now dad and mom are both church going Christians and I can vouch for their honesty, dad only ""sipped"" but he did get high on his home brew sauercraut, Ha! They both are not with us now and I was glad that I was able to learn about their encounter.  If all the trousands that had seen UFO before them fully convinced me then I am sure that their encounter did. And the look of fear and concern as they relayed their story left no doubt to me of its autherticity.  I have nevere seen a bonafide UFO, I have seen lights that I diid not know what they were but I had enough objectivity to not think that they were extraterrestrial. But my parents did see something that was not of this earth, or at our concept of this earth.  I believe that the apparition that they seen was some kind of a remote drone and that the flying saucer retrieved the drone. Perhaps they witnessed a terrestrial biological android or drone after it collected specimen from the woods. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

We lived west of Odessa, TX at the time.  My husband's grandmother (now deceased) called and asked to speak to Stanley. She said she wanted him to go outside and look at the UFO she had been watching that looked like it was close to our area. After talking to her we went outside and looked to our west. There was a huge, building size, silver, saucer shaped object with what looked like an upside down cereal bowl on top of it hovering in the sky about a mile from our house.  We had been outside just a few minutes when my brother-in-law, Jim (now deceased)and my sister-in-law, Georgia, screeched their car into our driveway to ask us if we had seen ""it"".  We all looked at it for a few minutes and then Stanley and Jim decided to ride down the road and see if they could get close enough to tell anything about it. Georgia and I just sat there and watched it. It didn't move at all. it just appeared to be sitting over a radio tower. When Stanley and Jim came back to the house about 30 minutes later they told us that they stopped at the entrance to the dirt road leading to the radio tower because they were afraid if they went closer they might get picked up and taken on a ride they didn't want to take. We got the radio and tried to listen to the news and see if anyone else was reporting this or watching it. We finally found an announcer on KBZB radio station that was talking about all the static they were having on their radio transmission and how they were sending a trechnician out to the tower that was having trouble to see what as wrong. Stanley called the station and was asking where their tower was. The disc jockey was talking to him on the air and we could hear the whole conversation on the air while we were outside still watching the saucer. The disc jockey confirmed it was their tower where the saucer was. Stanley hung up and came back outside to watch. Almost an hour after we started watching it the saucer began to move toward the North. It made a turn that was a 90 degree angle and slowly moved off until it was gone. No flashing speed, just slowly drifting away.  The radio station had stopped broadcasting anything about it so Stanley called the disc jockey back and asked him why did they stop telling about it, what happened? The disc jockey told him that their  technician got to the tower and when he saw the size of the saucer over the tower he went into shock and left. He said they had to take him to the emergency room and get him medicated to calm him down. The disc jockey also told Stanley that he had been contacted by someone claiming to be with the federal government who told him if he didn't want the radio station to lose it's license and be shut down he better quit talking about what happened. He said he was told ""Just be Quiet about it"".  But we were all there, and saw it happen before sundown on a bright, summer night. I had never seen anything like it, and don't know what it was for sure, but I know it was really there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

The color was stainless steel.  It made no sound.  I sent a report about the ufo in Odessa yesterday Sept. 12.  You sent an email back saying you want detailed information.  I said I was a slow typer, so my little sister said she would type the complete event.  I had worked real hard that day for the state highway dept. and I was tired, so I took a nap when I got home.  This was a clear summer day, and all the events occurred in the daylight.  My grandmother lived in the southwest part of the city of Odessa.  As I was taking a nap, she called my wife.  She said, have Stanley go out and look, because there is a ufo heading your way.  I lived west of town out in the country.  There weren't many houses out there at that time.  When I awoke, I sat and thought about it a minute, and thought my grandmother is very serious.  She doesn't tease.  I decided to get up and go outside and look for the ufo.  First I looked toward town and saw nothing, which would have been back toward the east.  Then I turned and looked toward the north and south and saw nothing.  When I turned and looked toward the west, there it was.  Above the radio tower, about 1 mile from my house.  My wife and I got very excited, because we knew it was probably an alien ship.  It made no sound.  About this time, my brother in law and big sister who lived about 2 streets over came flying around the corner in their car.  They were hollering out of their window as they approached, saying ""do you see it, do you see it?"".  When they got out of their car, of course all four of us were excited, and I don't remember what we said at the moment.  We had no camera and they had no camera, and I ran to the neighbors house to borrow a camera and they weren't home.  Then as we watched it, we were all amazed and I said, wait a minute, I think that's a radio tower!  So I went to my car, I turned the radio on and started scanning all of the channels.  Then in our amazement, we came across a station, and my wife said it was KBZB, to the best of her memory.  But of course you have to realize this was about 32 years ago.  We were really shocked when we heard the disc jockey saying that they had a ufo above their radio tower causing static.  So we kept listening to his reports and watching the ufo, and I decided to go inside and look up the phone number of that radio station.  I did get the disc jockey, and I don't remember his name.  I did ask him if his radio tower was out on west university and he said, yes that's our radio tower.  I said, we're looking at the ufo that you're talking about.  I don't remember what else I said at the momet, but in a little while I hung up and went back outside with everybody else.  Already the ufo had been over the tower about 20 to 25 minutes.  My brother and law and I started having the discussion of driving to the ufo, which was about 1 mile from my house.  So we tried getting to the tower by going down different dirt roads and couldn't reach it from that direction.  So we drove to the main highway, which is west University and found a road which led to a little road which goes to the radio tower.  Whether or not the ufo would have interefered with the elctric system of the car, I do not know because we killed the car and stopped at the beginning of the little road that led to the ufo.  We were probably about a half mile, maybe a little farther, from the ufo.  The color of the ufo was a stainless steel.  My brother in law and I sat there and started having the discussion of whether or not to drive up to the ufo, which we could have done.  We actually decided not to drive under the ufo, because we thought we might get a flight we did not want.  I don't recall what we said during the time we sat there but gradually the ufo moved from the radio tower to the north, it made a 90 degree turn and drifted off toward the west, out of sight.  We drove back to my house and they were no longer reporting the ufo on the radio station.  I called the radio station again and got the same disc jockey and said, why did you stop reporting about the ufo, and he said that the government told them to shut it down or lose their license.  He said, I will tell you something else though.  Our electrician went out there to check on why we were having static, and when he got back he was so excited and disturbed that we had to take him to the hospital to get him a hypo to calm him down.  He said there were hyroglyphics on the bottom of the ufo.  So I hung up after that discussion and later on I called him back one more time and he said one of the t.v. stations had pictures of a ufo above the street lights on west university at night and the government confiscated their pictures and told them to be quite or lose their license.  He said that he didn't want to talk about it anymore, because he was afraid he would get in trouble.  This completes my version the best I remember of this event, and it is the truth.  There were five witness, and I have thier names and occupations on the original report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

This craft was right near the roof, not even four feet above it.  This craft was bigger around than the houses and the bottom was lit up, either one big light or a whole lot of lights to light the whole bottom up.  then i remember running down my yard and following about 5 or 6 of them to this field we called Sandy Hill.   We had a very long skinny backyard and at the bottom we could access this trail that went through the woods and at one end it ended up at the stores at the top of Freeway Rd. and at the other end of the trail was this huge giant sand field we called Sandy Hill.  These objects were headed toward sandy hill.   After this experience i remember my mother saying that she was awake and floating overtop her bed, my dad said it was probably some type of spiritual dream, but she insisted it was not a dream and she was definitely awake.   I remember my brother coming into my room, terrified cause he had all these little men all around his bed.  I remember our television could not get a picture at all and my dad and his friend got on the roof to check our antennea and it had been completely broken off by something and could not be used anymore so they took it down and it layed in our backyard for quite some time and we use the rabbit ears antennea that you use to put ontop of the television.   I remember when i would get near the t.v. or touch it the picture would completely get static and you could not see the picture, i would play around and touch the t.v. quite a bit and my parents would make comments.  I remember for some reason that i started waking up with these splitting headaches that would make me throwup every morning for quite a while.  I regretted waking up in the morning cause i didn't want the headache.   I remember something happened to my right shin bone.  What? I just remember i use to roll my sock down and roll my pant leg up so nothing would touch this spot on my leg.  This spot was extremely sore, like down to the bone, but no bruise or mark at all.   I remember for some reason this huge thing was really scary and this little thing was scary too but not as scary as the big one. I remember laying on my right side, and remember a needle thing or something. To this day i still don't know what the big and little things were.   In the early 90's i called my brother and asked him if he remembered the little men and he didn't but he does believe in ufo's and has seen them throughout his life.   I remember a dream i had in the 90's that had to do with my leg.  I was laying on an operating table, lifted my head up and seen my leg open in the exact spot where it was sore when i was a kid, and i seen these so called doctors or something around me, mainly seeing eyes around me.  I remember thinking i should get my leg checked.  Never did.   I have many, many dreams of ufo's and have seen objects while definitely awake.  I find this subject the most fascinating of all time.  Also in the early 90's i began investigating my dreams and memories and went to the local library here in cumberland, i asked if they could find out if there were any ufo sighting in balto.  in the early to mid 70's and i ended up getting articles from The Baltimore Sun and The News American dated October 18,1973 about ufo sightings in baltimore and surrounding counties.

I was 7 or 8 years old.I was with my cousin (same age) on the porch of his home near the Snoqualmie River.  We were taking, looking out over the field, when I saw this thing coming toward us.  It was floating/bobbing along, at just about the height of the apple tree in the field, possibly 25' off the ground.  It was pinkish-colred and it glowed.  It was clear, not fuzzy at all, perfectly symetrical except for a small triangular 'tail' on the back side of it.  It came toward where we were, and I just knew, somehow, that it was going to stop when it got to us.  It did stop.  We were on the porch.  Across the driveway, just out in the field, just above the apple tree, it stopped and held perfectly still.  There was no sound at all.  I looked for features on it and there were none that I could see.  There were no doors, no windows, no sign of how someone would enter such a craft.  We both just stared at it for awhile, talking to one another about what it might be.  Then I yelled for my parents to come out and see it.  My parents and my aunt and uncle were in the living room, talking, and they had locked the front door to keep us-all from running through the house.  (We could get in through the back door but we used to like to run through the house from the back to the front and run out the front door and my aunt didn't like us to do this.) So, keeping my eyes on it, I backed up to the front door and yelled and knocked on it, but they still didn't pay attention.  Finally, in desperation, I turned around and pounded on the door with both fists and yelled my head off.  This got some results and they all appeared on the front porch, but by then the object had left.  My cousin said that when I began to really yell, it ""took off like a shot, like a streak of light, and disappeared"".  My parents took us inside, took us into separate rooms and had us draw pictures of what we had seen.  Our pictures and descriptions were similar. I remember being frustrated with my drawing because I couldn't make it look like what I had seen.  I still can't.  The geometry of the object was so perfect that I don't have the talent to draw it, even though it is essentially a sphere with a triangle in back of it.  It appeared to be machined; there was nothing at all plasma-like or unclear about it.  There had been a rash of sightings of UFO objects around the Snoqualmie Valley around this time.  A friend of my father's, a timber faller who was on a ridge with his crew, had seen a formation of 5 silver discs pass below them.  They watched them move up the valley and out of sight.  They were astounded, to say the least.  So, UFO's were on people's minds at that time and place.  This is the reason I am writing.  I just heard Peter Davenport mention on the Jeff Rense Show, that he has often heard of people talking about UFOs before sighting them.  I have a distinct memory of walking up from the river with all of my cousins (3 boys) and talking with them about UFO's and wondering what seeing one would be like, about 5 minutes before this event.  Although we have talked about this event over the years, my memory of it and my cousin's memory are no longer the same.  The cousin I saw it with now claims that what we saw was a ""silvery disc-like thing"" that was ""spinning around"".  Also, my older cousin, who was not with us at the time, now backs him up and also says he was there on the porch with us!  I have a particularly good long-term memory and am pretty sure I am right about ths.  Another thing I remember is my father coming into the house the next day (or so) and saying that there had been a ""streak of light"" or UFO,  spotted over Seattle at approximately the time that our object would have gotten there.It had taken off going in the direction of Seattle, which is very close to Snoqualmie and North Bend, approximately 25-30 miles. I should add that my parents and my aunt and uncle absolutely believed our story.   My sighting time and the date are my best attempt to pinpoint time and date.  It was a summer evening, it was warm and had been a sunny day, it was before we moved away from that area.  I am not positive whether it was 1952 or 1953, therefore I am not positive about my age.  The object would have been approximately 50 feet away from us, 25' in the air and smallish, maybe 6'in diameter.  If I had held out my hand at arm's length, it would  have just about covered it; but it was awfully close to us. Don't know if you have any interest in this, as it is unlike any other story I've ever heard.  Seeing it changed my life because i don't ""think"" there are UFOs, I know there are.  And I know, too, that this object wasn't from a terrestrial source...it was very strange and otherworldly.  I grew up to be a mental health professional, a licensed clinical social worker, so I also know that I'm not crazy.  Thanks for listening.

In a valley about 2/3 down the sliver of light I saw 6-7 massive disks hanging absolutely motionless in the ""air"" within the valley, casting individual shadows against the mountain walls behind them. They had to be miles across to be seen at that distance, were brilliant reflective silver, totally featureless, and were arrayed near the walls at various heights from the valley floor.

My grandparents owned a very large and remote cattle ranch and our family had enjoyed a wonderful evening togather and all had long since retired for the evening. I was awakened out of a dead sleep for some reason. I had fallen asleep in the living room on the couch with a huge picture window directly behind me. It was a winter wonderland outside with nearly three feet of snow and a thin cloud bank that was draped over Pikes Peak off in the distance and magically lighted by a full moon. Feeling totally awake, I turned around to really take in this enchanting scene. Then, I saw something that I couldn't believe, a tiny cloud moved away from the moon and fully lighted the valley where our ranch house was nestled. Not more than four football fields out from the house I noticed a big black shadow being cast down onto our meadow. What made me take notice was that the shadow had perfectly straight lines on the snow. I then realized that this cloud which I couldn't see due to our overhanging porch had straight edges. Impossible, I thought! so, at 2:30 in the morning and 20 below zero, I step outside on the porch in my longjohns and gazed up. what I saw, I'll never forget, a massive black rectangle shaped object just floating over our meadow! I ran back into the house, jumped into my coat and snow boots and took off running across the meadow toward the craft. Within a matter of four minutes, I was standing directly under it and realized it was less than 300 hundred feet above me. This craft was silent and it had no lights or windows that I could see. It must have been 1500 feet long and 400-500 feet tall and 300 feet thick. I stood under that thing for as long as i could stand the cold. It did nothing. So, I finally just went back. What was very strange about this was that the entire time I was looking at it I ""felt"" safe and somehow knew that ""They"" were mining for minerals. As I was growing up on the ranch there was an area on the ranch that you could not go to. Horses would refuse to go into this area and if I forced the issue they would go crazy and start bucking. I never could walk into that range of small mountains. If I did a very strange overpowering fear would sweep over me until I turned around and crossed that invisable boundry and instantly it would go away.I learned from the  horses where the boundry line was and it never changed. For all I know it's still in place. I had numerous encounters with beings and craft on the ranch growing up. The most beautiful craft of all that I saw twice, was a golden teardrop shape. Always, coming or leaving this area that was around 3000 acres. It was common knowledge on the ranch about that location. It was a family joke that we always knew where the cattle and the horses weren't. When I was a kid I would take friends to the borderline and we would run into the area in an attempt to try and tease the aliens. I found out in short order that they weren't amused. Because, I began having terrible nightmares. I knew it was them so I went back to the boundry line and shouted to them that I was sorry and I wouldn't bother them again. That night the nightmares ended and so did my trips to the area. You might say I've grown-up with aliens. I've seen them. Some look like us, others, the old wise ones are on average 7 feet tall with elongated skulls with blue translucent bodies. They are trillions of years older than we are and are very gental and loving. I have had two of them appear before me from time to time to check-in on me. They watched me grow-up as an only child on our huge very isolated ranch and I always could feel them protecting me when I was alone in the forest. They love us and consider us their children. They have come back now to help us through what is coming. They will soon introduce themselves to the world. That is why you are seeing so many ships. The blue beings don't need spacecraft, they are far more advanced. They travel by thought. They have showed me what is coming. A global nuclear war that will distroy nearly all of America, Europe, Russia and China. There is an alien faction that is running the New World Order. But, they're no match for the ""Blue Beings"". They aren't here to stop it. They are here to pick-up the broken pieces and help us start to rebuild once again. The new center of growth and knowledge will be Venezuela. During the war that entire country will be covered by a protective dome of energy. If you want a good time-line watch very carefully what happens between Venezuela and the NWO. More and more there's going to be agression aimed at Venezuela by Bush and the NWO. Everyone will think it's for the oil. Not so, it's about ""The City"" There's a massive underground city built by a confederation of aliens hidden in the southern jungle of Venezuela preparing to re-build mankind. Tesla,Marconi and Fulcanille were involved. I have met personally, two high ranking Venezuelan officers who interface with ""the City"". The NWO knows full well about this city but, are powerless to do anything about it. My entire life has been about what I've just related starting with my first trip deep into the Venezuelan jungles in 1989 exploring for gold and diamonds. That is when I first learned of the city and was once again visited by the two ""Blue Beings"" who showed me what is coming. There is much more to this story, I've just hit the highlights. I can only state that what I was shown in 1989, appears to be falling in line with what is now taking place. The NWO is looking for something, something that would give them power and control over the ""Blue Beings"", what they're looking for is hidden in the jungle. However, they will never find them and that is why they are doomed and there time is running out.",2005-02-22T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

(Closed to non-tribal members of Taos Pueblo Indain Reservation)    While driving, the road we were on "" Rio Lucero Rd"" goes in the direction north, with open land full of sage, and pinon juniper trees to the left of the road.  On the Right hand side of the road is ""Pueblo Peak"" or ""Taos Mountain"" as many of the locals and natives to Taos call the mountain.   Puebo Peak is part of the Sangre De Cristo Mountains which runs from Colorado through Northern New Mexico.  Taos Pueblo is located at the base of Pueblo Peak.  The Reservation which has roughly about 2,500 residents, and 150,000 acres of land most of which is wilderness.   Along with Pueblo Peak and the mountain range is pinon juniper, cotton wood trees ponderosa pine, doug furr, white furr, (mixed conifer) and the Rio Lucero River.   While driving north we noticed lights in the trees to right of the road, which we thought at the time was someone else driving in the area at the time.  We paid no attention to the lights, we moved another 100 ft ahead and I noticed the lights shifted from behind the trees to ontop of the trees, at that point I asked my friend if he had seen the smae thing.  He aknowledged yes.   He steeped on the gas to seed up and the head lights flickered on and of three times, and the instrument lights of his truck faded in and out.  When his lights flickered the object above the trees which had two lights flickered its lights back to us.   Then a third light came on underneath the two which were already on.  Bright lights, almost as brite as day.   When we started to approach the lights, they backed up towards the mountain and started to go higher in the sky.   My friend stopped the truck and we got out to take a look, when we got off the truck the lights disappeared.  The night was clear and no moon, just stars, so it took a while for my eyes to adjust to the dark.  When i got my vision stable we noticed a triangle shaped object above the truck, you could barely see it but, you knew it was there.  And boy, was it huge!  No lights, just the light from the sky and stars against the backdrop of the trianlge.   At that point I wasn't scared, but something in the back of my mind told me be worried.  Before I could talk to my friend the object left from where we standing in a blink of an eye, to about 11,000 ft in elevation close to the mountains, Vallicto Peak, which sits at about 12,300 feet behind pueblo peak.   When it got close to Vallicito Peak, orange and blue lights came on, on the object.  It stood, still at that point for a second and then again the orange lights went off and it went vertical straight into the sky leaving a trail of blue light as it went.   After the the Triangle left a feeling of panic and paranoia fell over me.  We left the area and went back to town.   The next day we went back to the area and looked for clues, but found none.   The Pinon Juniper that grows aroung here in Taos grows to 8-10ft in height, but still we never found anything yet to this day.",2005-10-20T00:00:00,,

September 18, 2005  My backdoor neighbor and I where outside talking and taking a walk through my field at night (11:30pm) and I noticed a fast paced moving object to the north-east with  a red blinking light.  It seemed to be in outer space, and I thought it was a satellite.  I soon realized it was moving at ""sporadic"" rates of speed, it would stop, and go, and change direction seemingly randomly.  After raising and lowering from about 40 degrees in the sky to 30 degrees in the sky again at sporadic rates of speed for about five minuets, it started to move to the west, to the point I was looking north at it, where it stopped and held its place for about 30 seconds. There were very few small clouds that night, and one of them happened to be passing over the moon which was bright.  I could see the object more clearly when the moon was covered, and spotted two (2) more crafts approaching from the east.  At this time I was under the impression that they were in our atmosphere, and I could see more detail, they seemed to be oval in shape, and possibly metallic in color, and slightly reflected the moons light when the red blinking lights paused. The first object was holding its ground while they moved from my east to north field of view, and as the second and third object held speed at my approximation of over 300 MPH or at about the speed of a jet.  The first object instantly picked up speed and traveled in triangular formation with the other two seamlessly, as they did not hesitate or slow down.  They then seemed to grow brighter, or move closer to my location.  I could make out a fourth ship, which came from under the tree line/horizon and did not follow in formation instead rising in the sky and movingly slightly North East.  The first three objects continued to move to my west, where they stopped, and the third most eastern object would stray off to a random direction and the other two would then lag behind for milliseconds, then have to keep up with the third ship to keep formation.  The fourth object was moving sporadically in all directions, at different speeds, ranging from very a halt to faster than an airplane. The fourth object then moved behind one of the clouds in the sky, and then reappeared on the other side as it traveled South East.  The first three objects were hovering about 30 degrees over the horizon.  The fourth object then was flying south to the point where I had to look away from the first three objects, where I could not see it.   The first three objects then started to move east, and I could see them more clearly then ever. They had three (3) red lights, seemingly moving as if electrons around an atom, around the ship, pulsing or blinking at different seemingly random rates and times.  They then moved south, and seemed to get more distant as if flying upward.  They continued to grow fainter over the last five minuets, as they moved south and lower in the sky below the tree line. The objects did not produce any apparent smoke, or exhaust or a trail of any kind, nor did they make any noise. Abruptly afterwards I called my friends that live 30 miles north east of me and told them to look for them, and to my surprise they had been watching them for the last thirty minuets as well, and told a very similar story to mine. This could not have been a hallucination; I was of well state of mind and sober, as well as all witnesses.",2005-10-20T00:00:00,43.2361,-88.0336

Most described light as greenish, but sometimes whitish, sometimes with reddish tinge.  Speed was described as fast, but NOT as fast as a meteor.  No sound.   Calls came from witnesses in the Eastern, Central, South Central, Northern, Northwestern, and Western parts of Iowa, all looking to the west EXCEPT a trucker who says the light descended to about 300 feet over a field to the right of the vehicle, and no more than 1/4 mile distant, where the light then went out, and was seen no more by the driver.  [[It should be noted that SOME of the witnesses could NOT have been seeing the same thing as the driver by looking west, because of their location - assuming, of course, that the driver was fairly accurate in perceiving a close-up approach of the light.]]   ALL WITNESSES MAINTAIN THAT THE LIGHT/OBJECT DID NOT DIMINISH IN SIZE as it sped from E to W. Questions that arise:  Was it a meteor?   Was it space junk?   Was it only one event?  Or in the case of the truck driver's adamant description, is it possible that there were two (2) events in progress?  Or was it only one event, with a temporary change in altitude, speed, etc., with the light then proceeding on its westerly way unobserved by the truck driver?   Results of the investigation are interesting, but obviously open-ended.  Many calls came in to the radio show the following morning looking for answers, and Bev Trout again was interviewed on results of the investigation. [It should be noted that NUFORC's Iowa Database lists a 9/14/05 event at about 6:00 a.m., which sounds as if it might be the same event(s) as described above.] ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Beverly Trout for sharing the results of her findings about this incident.

On Saturday morning at 9:30 AM October 1, 2005, with unlimited visibility on the far east side of Albuquerque, I observed what appeared to be a weather balloon approximately seventy degrees in elevation (not quite overhead) traveling at a slow rate of speed from NW to SE.  In the past I have observed 10-15 weather balloons released from Ft. Sumner, NM or Pasadena, TX.  Immediately I noticed two things which drew my attention to this object. The rate of travel to the SE was slow but much faster than any any previously observed weather balloon.  And the color of the object was brilliant silver as if reflecting sunlight from polished chrome, whereas weather balloons appear to reflect a dull white, almost beige, color. As I ran back in to the house to retrieve my 7x35 binoculars, I called out to tell my roommate to have a look.  As I was observing the spherical disk, now stationary, through my binoculars, I noticed what appeared to be a long, thin, silver antenna-like rod, three to four disk diameters in length extended from the top side of the object. The total estimated NW to SE distance the object traversed from initial sighting to stationary point was approximately 25 degrees (one palm width at arm's length equal to 10 degrees). At the same time, my roommate asked if I could see the two blue objects approaching the disk. When I handed the binoculars to my roommate, I then saw two bright blue pinpoints (not disks) of light slowly approaching the disk, also traveling NW to SE.  Initially, the distance from the blue lights to the object was approximately 35 degrees, the spacing between the two blue lights varying from 10 degrees, then closing to 5 degrees, then opening again to 15 degrees of separation and finally converging on the silver object with very little spacing between the two.   The closest of the two blue lights moved to the left side of the silver object and became stationary approximately 2 to 3 degrees from the silver object.  The second blue light became stationary approximately 5 degrees to the right of the silver object. After one minute of observing these three objects, the two blue lights disappeared as they converged onto the silver disk. Immediately thereafter, the silver object, with no observable acceleration, silently moved off to the NE at the rate of speed equal to two or three times a jet airliner traverses the sky. I, myself, have been ""watching the stars"" all of my life.  I have observed and photographed several solar eclipses, as well as many lunar eclipses and meteor showers.  A school I attended loaned me their 9 1/2 reflector telescope for the summer (not only is astronomy the oldest science...astronomy is considered 'the beautiful science').  It was an opportunity to teach the children of the neighborhood. While working night shift for four years at a small airport on top of a dark mesa ten miles west of the city, I observed several fireballs and the last successful re-entry of the Shuttle (to repair the Hubble telescope) before its final tragic flight.

No blinking or brilliant light, but dime orange color light (Note: the sunrise time was 7:00 a.m.).  The weather was clear: cloudless night sky.  Its altitude cannot be determined.  The object must be flying over the high altitude or possibly outer space.  I could only compare the object with star lights and its dime orange color.   The object seemed to be moving slightly zigzag at times (it might be caused by the atmospheric effect).  The speed was undermined, but it moved faster than conventional airplanes.  I observed for about 3 min. and eventually could not observe it due to its distance.  While wondering what it might be, approximately 30 seconds or less than 1 minute later, I noticed another oval object (the same color and size as previous one) was moving horizontally from North to South passing over our house.

My friend and I were driving home from work at about 10:30 at night (she was driving).  We were approaching the four-way intersection of rt.9 and rt.287.  We both suddenly saw what looked like the headlights of a car in the sky and both exclaimed. There might have been one other car at the intersection but it pulled away before we got there (we had a red light). We stopped and looked at the lights and as they approached and we noticed that there were smaller white lights along the bottom of the craft as well as a slowly pulsing/blinking one on top.  All the lights were white.   I opened the car window and hung my torso out and did not hear any noise from the craft at all.  The craft was lower than any aircraft I have ever seen and was moving much more slowly than a normal plane.   We were not close enough to Dulles airport for the craft to be attempting to land there.  I'm not sure exactly how high the craft was as I am not great with distances but it was certainly above the tree line but significantly lower than normal planes.  As the stoplight changed to green, my friend pulled through the intersection and the craft was simultaneously passing over our car.  I was still hanging out the window watching the craft and saw the shape of it from below.  It had a elongated triangularly-shaped nose that was split directly down the middle and it had a compact body with short wings and no tail. There was no exhaust.  My friend and i drove on discussing the sighting.  About 5 or 6 minutes later, we were still driving to my house and were on a non-lined paved road right before the turn onto my dirt road.  My friend pointed at the sky and exclaimed that it looked like there was a storm far off in the distance (it looked like there was lightning behind the clouds. The light was slightly glowing and pulsating).  At this point I suggested that we stop the car and watch the storm.  My friend stopped and a craft that looked exactly like the previous one sighted, (same shape, size, speed, and height, and similar bearing) emerged from the clouds.  The pulsing light that was on top of it was what we had thought was the storm behind the clouds.  I rolled down the window completely and stuck my whole body out of the car, leaning on the roof and, admittedly, yelled profanities at the craft.  This craft did NOT pass directly over our car but  passed over about, maybe....25 yards away.  My friend and I sat in shocked silence for about a minute and proceeded to my house.  She dropped me off and for the rest of the night I was entirely jumpy and kept darting to the windows to see if another craft would appear.  The crafts could not plausibly be the same due to time and distance differences.  Neither my friend nor I were intoxicated nor did we have drugs in our system.  We are both responsible and trustworthy high school students and while I know that my reveal of our ages can lead to an assumption of untrustworthiness and unreliability, I assure you that every bit of this account is true and unaltered.   The main reason of my posting this report is to seek other people that sighted the craft(s).  I would really appreciate other postings that correspond to mine.  I urge the creators of this website to look into this sighting as I am very confused as to what the crafts were.  If there had only been one craft I might have believed that it was an experimental military craft but the two sightings in one night is too coincidental and astounding to write off as nothing.

Then I noticed what I could describe as a somewhat boomerang-shaped craft gliding silently from North or North-by-Northeast to South or South-by-Southwest, almost directly over my head.  It was dark, so it was hard to tell exactly how high up it was, but my best guess is about 75 meters.  It looked to be about 20 times the size of the moon.  It had 5 round, significantly sized lights that I could see, quite faint, and they seemed to get fainter at the edges.  They were spaced as such: one at each corner, and the other two were spaced just between the corners. I can't be totally sure because it was dark, but the craft looked black, and I could somewhat make out the shape of body as it flew by; it looked like a boomerang, but, hm, how to describe this- if you were to take those five round lights, then make a circle around each light so that the outer circles were about 80-100% bigger in diameter, then joined them all together in a chevron shape, that's basically what it looked like.  Though between each of the circles there was a smooth connection.  Really the best way to describe it was like it was a lumpy boomerang. It made no sound that I could hear, even though it looked close.  The speed was also too slow to be an airplane.  It looked like it was just gliding along.  It flew with the point (to clarify, it wasn't pointy, it was rounded all the way around) of the chevron first.  It was clear to me that what I was seeing was not ordinary.  I thought about trying to get the attention of someone in a parked car, but it looked like it was about to go over the hill, and the bus was coming.  Since it looked like I wouldn't be able to see it anymore and it was really cold outside, I decided to hop on the bus after a moment of hesitation (now I regret that).  I was able to see it for about 20 seconds total. My background: I was born and raised in America and studied Japanese and Computer Science related fields in University.  I got an internship in Japan and that's why I was there.  I'm still there actually.  This all happened about 3 hours ago and I'm sitting outside of my apartment room, catching a neighbor's Wi-fi connection to write out this report in freezing weather. I was at the bus stop of ""Hikari-dai Itchome Minami"" in Hikari-dai, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun, Kyoto prefecture, Japan at 18:18 on 12/12/2005 just east of an NTT (telephone and technology company) research building when this happened.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,,

Then after a few seconds of not seeing it, I noticed several bright lights streak very fast across the sky heading south lasting only a couple of seconds as if it was leaving and then disappeared for good. (so I thought) About 5 to 10 minutes later, I was on the other side of Coalgate heading east and continued to look to the south to see if I could notice the bright light again.  I then saw the light appear again and immediately began to slow my car down so I could get a good look. Stopped in the middle of the road I noticed two smaller orange lights, one above the other which lasted only a few seconds before disappearing. As an oncoming car was heading my direction I began to drive off again and looking back to where I saw the two orange lights I saw what appeared to be a slow moving orange fireball which was leaving a small tail behind it.

I recieved a call from a neighbor about three miles down the road who told me to go outside and look in the sky.  Looking to the left of the moon were two blue spots of light.  Off and on about once a minute they would strobe white light.  They stayed in place and never moved and never made a sound.  While watching these two things my neighbor (Still on the phone) said look in the direction of Denton.  I saw what looked to be a bright yellow dot of light. (maybe ten miles out)  As we watched (Wife and myself in person, neighbor on phone) the light seemed to get closed and it looked almost flat.  As we watched the light started to sway back and forth.  It would then move maybe about half a mile out away from where it was sitting and then shoot back to where it first started.  It did this over and over again for about 20 minutes.  From there it then seemed to circle in one spot over and over again, it did this about ten times then sat still.  From there is would shoot out like before and curve out back to where it started.  (The other times it shot out before it would go in one line and shoot back in one line in what seemed like no stop)  It then quit this after two runs and stayed in the same spot it first started.  We then saw what appeared to be a 747 or other large aircraft some close to it headed to either DFW or Alliance and the thing went up and away from the object.  When the aircraft left the area the thing went back to the same spot.  The thing just stayed still with the odd movement off and on until about half an hour later when a small jet went into the area and the light just vanished.  I have two other people that saw this other than me and we are willing to talk about it.  I never have seen anything quite like this before.  These things never made any sound.  Where I live sound will travel for miles upon miles.  The area is also blessed to not be under the glow of city lights.

On March 10, 2006 I was driving on Highway 281 at 12:30 A.M. past the Alamo Dome in downtown San Antonio when a large bright white light caught my eye ahead in the sky about 1-2 football fields high(the craft stayed about that far away the whole sighting). At first I thought it was a tower light or something like that but when I got closer to this object it eventually got right above my car in the middle of the highway. I then saw the bottom of the object. It was triangular in shape with red and blue lights on the three corners blinking. I watched it until I had passed it.  Astonished and terrified, I decided to take the next turnaround and go back and see if what I saw was real or not. When I got back to the place of the first sighting, I  no longer saw the craft in the middle of the road but instead I saw the object near the lookout tower on the opposite side of the highway to the right of the tower. I then decided to take the next turnaround and find a spot to park on the side of the road to get a better look. But when I got near the tower again on the highway there was a 2nd craft that was smaller and had red and orange lights as opposed to the red and blue lights of the larger craft. I should also note that every time I saw these things during the hour of my sighting the crafts top bright light kept turning on and off randomly.  When I saw this second craft I got scared because it proceeded to come straight towards me. This smaller    red and orange craft eventually went right over me like the larger one did before. This craft looked like the first one did, triangular in shape only with red and orange lights on the bottom at the three corners. It also had a top bright light as well. It passed me and went to the right of me on the highway and then immediately changed directions and joined the larger craft on the left side of me on the highway quite fast. At this point I was not about to pull over and stop as these things were just too close for comfort. I was shaking, I honestly don’t know hwy I was so scared.  Instead I just kept taking turnarounds and went in circles about 3 times until they disappeared. I saw them going back and forth across Highway 281 every time I turned around. It is almost as if they were following me, playing some kind of game. It’s kind of  egocentric of me to think that these things were there only for me but at the time is how I felt which is probably why I did not want to stop on the side of the road for a constant look at these things.  When they were no longer to be seen I headed back to my original destination point, home. About 5-10 minutes later I was near the University of Incarnate Word still on Highway 281 when I saw the small red and orange craft yet again on my left side no less than a football field high. I could not believe that it was near me again. It proceeded to cross my path giving me another view of its bottom and headed to my right until I passed it up.  So I took the next turnaround yet again and when I got back it was gone. I then went ahead and drove a few more minutes before taking the next turnaround to finally go home. But when I got back the larger blue and red craft had returned and was approaching my left side until it got right overhead of me again. This time however I saw a bright beam of light that looked like those airplane beams you see near an airport or major highway shoot out of the bottom of the craft and proceeded to point it EVRYWHERE. When I say everywhere I mean it pointed it at cars, buildings and houses nearby. The odd thing was it never once pointed it at me. At least I think, though now that I think about it when I saw the craft overhead the light was so bright I had to shield my eyes for a second so it might have shined it on me at once. It very much looked to me like it was searching for something. After it got done with the beam it went on its way to the right of me and I lost site of it when I got too far from it. I should note that when it did this i got a pretty good look at the side of the craft. It looked disk shaped. I was scared enough that i went home.  Before I got home however I saw the small red and orange craft flying over 281 and towards my neighborhood near Brook Hollow Blvd until I lost sight of it beyond the trees on the horizon.  It was around 1:40 A.M. when I got home.",2006-03-11T00:00:00,29.488865917141535,-98.4752404435546

We were scared,shocked, in disbelief, wondering how and why we were looking at something we could only guess was a giant quonset building or some really strange building basically between us and the safety of the barns, house or whatever.  I was terrified, but the cows skirted to the right of it and kept on going.  So did we, and in about a minute or two, it just was no longer there.

Foreign Object Just Whizzing By Lights Up the Sky in the Summer of the Late 60's.,New York,NY,,diamond,3-5 Minutes,"Occurred : 8/1/1967 19:00  (Entered as : 08/01/1967 19:00) Reported: 7/6/2005 9:38:00 AM 09:38 Posted: 7/13/2005 Location: New York City (Queens)(Middle Village), NY Shape: Diamond Duration:3-5 Minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44795.html,"Foreign Object Just Whizzing By Lights Up the Sky in the Summer of the Late 60's A friend of mine and I were discussing the upcoming sighting of Mars sometime in August of 2005, and upon talking about that, it made me recall an incident when I was a young child of seeing what I can only refer to as a UFO sighting.   I told my friend about this, and while she ""believed"" me, just for a little more verification, she found this site and also saw someone else around my age who remembers seeing something similar at around the same time! -- She then brought it to my attention, and I was so excited about it, that I decided to now post my recollection of what  I saw on that summer evening probably sometime in the late 60's!  Unfortunately, since I was so young at the time, I cannot really recall the exact date or time of when I actually saw it, but it is a safe bet to say it was definitely in the late 60's, and it was definitely in the evening and in the summer.  My guess would be around August of 1966 or 1967 at around 7:30 PM or so.   My Aunt and I were in the living room in our home in Queens, New York and all of a sudden we heard this extremely loud noise of something flying over the house -- though, it was not the same type of sound like an airplane, a helicopter or even a blimp makes, though, if I were to pick which one of these it resembled in sound the most, I'd have to say a blimp, though, it's hard to describe the sound really, but it was very loud, and it was different, so we both ran together to the front porch window and we both looked out just in time to see this huge object that had just flown over our house.   As I recall, it was long and left a beautiful redish and greenish color streaked across the sky as it passed.  It was actually travelling quite fast, and was also flying quite low -- at least what had looked to me to be much lower than I had ever seen any plane fly in the sky at that time. As I recall, the front end of the object was like a big, red diamond-like shape object attached to what looked to me like a long rod-type of thing, and the bottom had a green diamond-like shape attached to it, which, as I also recall, was quite smaller in size than the red diamond-like shape. -- (It's actually been so long since I saw the object, that it could also very well have been visa versa -- the green diamond-like object could've been on the front end of the rod-like object and could've been the bigger one in size and the red one could've been in the back, and have been the smaller diamond-like object -- I'm not really 100% sure about that anymore -- but I do remember very vividly the red and green colors and how bright both shapes were, and how diamond-like in shape that they both were and how extremely loud the object was as it flew over my house -- almost like it vibrated the house a little as it flew over it!)  As I also recalled at that time, there was some mention on the news about there being spottings of people seeing a foreign object, so we really weren't completely shocked by the sighting, but just real excited about seeing it!  As it passed over more houses, it became out of sight, so I quickly ran upstairs and looked out my hallway window, but lost sight of the object after that.  However, as I said before, it left a beautiful streak of red and green in the sky, which lasted for a little while!   My Aunt is deceased now, so I cannot ask her what her recollection of the sighting was, and if she remembered anything different than I did. -- But even today, I still get excited when I recall the sighting!   I think it would be very nice if you had some kind of message board or something like that on this site where people who have had similar sightings could talk back and forth with each about them if they choose to, as it's kind of nice to know that I'm not alone in what I saw back then!  I also never even knew that this site existed until my friend just brought it to my attention....  But I'm glad at least for the opportunity to post my recollection of the sighting -- and I thank you very much! ((NUFOR Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I have never told this to anyone until now except for close relatives.  This happened when I was 14 years old, but I remember it vividly to this day.   I was visiting my aunt and uncle who lived in Lima, Peru in South America at the time.  I had gone up to the balcony of their home.  Across the street was a large park about 4 city square blocks. I had climbed on to the balcony to look down at the park to see if I could spot any of my friends playing there.   As I did so I saw that everyone in the park, and there were many people, were all looking up, so I looked up as well.  As I did I was so startled that at first I thought the sun was crashing down upon us, but in that split second I realized that what I was looking at was stationary and was not going to crash on top of us.  Then I realized I was seeing a circular material object that was very huge and bright white. It was hovoring over the trees at very close range.  It was at least the size of the park itself.   It cast a huge shadow over the park.  It hovered there for what seemed several minutes.  It seemed to be spinning quite rapidly.   Then, suddenly out of the blue it took off at incredible speed and disappeared.  I was stunned I was not sure what I had just witnessed, but eventually I came to the realization that it must have been some type of space ship.   When I looked back down at the park no one was looking up, and everyone seemed to be going about there business as if nothing had happened.  This was something that impressed me a great deal, because at that age I was hardly interested in UFO's or any such thing.  I was a typical 14 year old kid. UFO's were the last thing on my mind.  It left me completely dumb founded for quite some time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))",,,
"A very bright , horizontal elliptical disk aprox. the length of a yardstick held at arms length, hovered one hundred feet  away.",Kitchener,ON,1971-10-07T01:00:00,disk,45 min,"Occurred : 10/7/1971 01:00  (Entered as : 10/07/1971 1:00) Reported: 7/7/2005 1:12:21 AM 01:12 Posted: 7/13/2005 Location: Kitchener (Canada), ON Shape: Disk Duration:45 min",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44811.html,"A very bright , horizontal elliptical disk aprox. the length of a yardstick held at arms length, hovered one hundred feet  away. Before I describe the sighting, I would like to say this is my first public acknowledgement of what I have seen and I do so out of frustration with the smarmy attitude our governments have about the subject of UFOs and to encourage others who have experienced the same to speak out loudly.  After reading the 'CANADIAN,TEXAS,JANUARY 15, 1993 STATE TROOPERS' report, I was struck by his sense of awe and resignation to the fact that his reality had just been assaulted with the blunt force of indisputable, emperical evidence that we are not alone. This is a feeling that is shared by millions of human beings around the world, including myself, who do not place a 'belief' in UFOs on a wish and a prayer or some peculiar fuzzy lights in the sky; but on heart stopping, nerve stunning, in-your-face, up-close and personal 'I am HERE, I am BIG and you are very, very small' close encounters with these things. And I'm madder'n hell that this situation goes on every day without any advisement from our so called 'by the people for the people' governments whose biggest fear next to real democracy is that we find out in fact they do not nor ever had a clue about what these things are or where they come from.  WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS when these things appear, do we greet them with a smile and a handshake or should we run like hell away from them! I think our governments know at least as much to describe the various objects, tell us what the present state of affairs is concerning UFOs, and what is the nature of the contact environment for human interaction with each type; so we can at least act neighborly without putting ourselves into harms way. If these things are dangerous and out to get us, can we pop off a few rounds when they get into our crosshairs?  I think it's time humanity had a million-man-march on capitols around the world to force the truth out from between those lying teeth of politicians responsible for holding back the truth. This is a new millenium and it's time for a new world order alright but not the stilted, contrived, patrician 'we know better than you' models we now have. Their silly secret society, michiavellian intrigue ways of doing things went out with the buggy whips that remained in the last century; and are as bizarre and artificial as the pathetic face-hip-boob lifts obsessed by celebrities today. There are many, many things that cry out for answers and change in our society, that require a different attitude from human behaviour away from competition and greed. The UFO issue may hold a very significant dimension to the problems our world faces today.  For starters, who the hell are they and where do they come from? Are they here to eat us or eat with us? I have had three unforgetable events involving UFOs and I will describe them in three separate reports dated; Oct.07, 1971 - Nov.15, 1987 - March 12, 1997.  On approximately October 7, 1971 at 1 AM my wife and I were travelling south east on county road #17 just past Conestoga and approaching Kitchener, Ontario(Canada) city limits. It was a clear moonless night but when we saw a peculiar object hovering above the treetops to our left about 1000 feet away, we considered it to be an interesting effect the moon was causing, reflecting off the top of a silo to look like a flying saucer. As we proceeded along the road I continued to glance over my shoulder expecting it to change shape and get smaller as we moved away from it. However I discovered that not only was it holding its horizontal, elliptical shape, it was getting bigger and brighter.I craned my neck this way and that looking for the moon that I thought might be causing this but didn't find it. I asked my wife to look out her side of the car to search for the moon and she discovered also, no moon! When I asked her to look over her left shoulder and describe what she saw across the field she confirmed, it was a disk shape and bright as moonlight. I pulled over and stopped the car. By now my wife was frightened and refused to get out of the car, clinging to the doorknob out of fear. I wanted to settle this and conclude it was our movement caused by driving that was responsible for what I expected was an illusion. Up to then my only knowledge of flying saucers was in the realm of science fiction and peculiar stories from history books. I never put much credence in the few current reports I had read and didn't really know what to think about them, the jury was still out. So I got out of my car and stood very still, bracing myself against it to to be sure of my bearing. Well the disk kept moving very slowly from a WNW direction skirting the top of the forest across the field from us, but not yet coming directly towards us. By now  its scale had gone from a dime size at arms length when we first saw it to a nickle size. Its steady movement and even moonglow illumination convinced me it needed closer inspection. Looking back at my wife I said I was going for a closer look to which she groaned her displeasure. I blythely and quite naively raced across the road towards a point in the field about five hundred feet away where I expected to come as close as I could, considering its trajectory and speed, and the distance I would have to cover in the time I had before it would pass us. This involved a possible encounter with a barnyard dog, in the dark, because we happened to be next to a farm house to our north east. I made it across the yard without incident, over a fence then into the field which was fallow with weeds and short scrub. I ran towards the predetermined point in the field ahead, keeping my eyes on the prize and soon realised it had changed course and was coming towards me. Our paths met quicker  than I expectd and was caught by surprise. Now looking due north, my head canted way back so sharply as to cause me to realise this thing was REALLY close and REALLY big and I should stop NOW. It was as long as a yardstick held horizontaly in your hand at arms length. My best guess was one hundred feet off the ground  and one hundred feet away from me. ""Come on down here and talk to me!"" I shouted up to it. It just hovered there and glowed. I saw no one, no details, no sound. Just a horizontal, elliptical disk shining like the moon. Out of the corner of my eye I caught the glint of headlights moving up the highway about a mile away so I ran back to the road, flagged the car down, pointed to the UFO and said ""Look!"" At that moment it went from five inches across at arms length, moved up and away to a pin point and vanished in one second. My wife and I reported it to the night officer at the old OPP station on King street near Rockway Gardens in Kitchener that night. He made a written record of our report, also checking with the local airport for possible flyins or radar evidence. Nothing was reported that night. Since then I have encountered a born again christian and a business man both men of character beyond reproach, confiding to me of encounters they had that were very similar to ours. My wife and I are not sure if there was any time loss but I do recall her remaining in the car terrified. She on the other hand recalls getting out of the car, this being our only point of disagreement with the whole incident.

November 15, 1987, 2AM (time approximate) While returning home from work on a crisp, clear, moonless night, I was travelling east on hwy 50 just north of Gatineau, Quebec(Canada). I passed the Gatineau Airport on my left. It was closed for the night. I was alone in my vehicle and there was no traffic on coming or behind me. Making my way to Buckingham I passed several overpasses encountered on this highway and was approaching the last before my turn off which is about six miles east of the aforementioned airport. As I approached the last overpass I noticed a bright red light just ahead and to my left, about 100 feet off the road and 100 feet off the ground. The size, colour and brilliance resembled the kind of warning light you see on top of hydro towers. I thought this was peculiar because there was a hydro tower nearby but not at that location so I figured it must be a late arrival flying to the Gatineau airport. But it was closed and this was way too far away for a flight to be in a landing pattern anyway, so I slowed down expecting the plane to make a hard landing in the field. I pulled off to the side of the road just west of the overpass, stopped and got out of my car. The field extending north of the highway is fairly level and consists of scrub and weeds for about 1500-2000 feet until it reaches the bottom of a rise in the terrain that goes up maybe 100-150 feet. So looking north is fairly black with no illumination or dwelling in my line of sight  until the horizon which is higher than where I'm standing. The night sky explodes with stars and the milkyway from the horizon up. The red light is in a fixed position in the darkness below the horizon and I'm marvelling at how an aircraft can remain stationary for so long. I look around for possible wind sources to make this happen but the air is still; and I haven't been able to make out any kind of outline to put a fix on the aircrafts shape. So I walk across the double highway, down the ditch and up to the fence. This gives me a lower but closer perspective, all the while looking up at this thing to see if I can make its shape. When I reach the fence I begin to think this might be some new stealth vehicle the military is trying out because I don't hear a sound and still can't make out its outline. My eyes becoming more accustomed to the inky darkness I find a hard straight edge that leads up into the sky and then to my utter shock begin to see the staggering size of this thing! I stumble back from the realisation that the inky darkness was part of a craft that was triangular in shape blotting out most of the bluff in the background, the horizon and part of the night sky! What I mistook at first to be just a lack of stars in that particular section of sky was an enormous triangular shape the reached from above and just ahead of me to just below the horizon. The point forward I believe seemed to be to my left bearing the red light under its tip. It was all I could do to see the shape. No details, no one and no sound. You could almost describe it as an absence of light, like looking into a dark hole. Having never heard of flying triangles as possible UFOs I didn't speak of this until 2001 when I read a report about them for the very first time. I was very excited by the facts and descriptions regarding triangles and discovering I wasn't alone in seeing one. When I drove away from the object that night, I contented myself with the explanation that I had witnessed a military exercise of some secret airborne vehicle and always referred to it as such, never even suspecting a possible UFO context. After 45 min I left thinking what a mammoth airplane. Truly football field size as they say.",2005-07-13T00:00:00,45.48421847649919,-75.67076288492707

My two teenage children were at home with her, so I was alone in the car.  Coming down Parker Street, which is a suburban area, I started going past part of the golf course on the left.  There are many trees here and the night was dark although there are streetlamps.  I was compelled to slow down the car (windows were open) and look over to the left as I pulled over to the curb.  There were no other cars on the road, which is strange for even this late hour as Parker Street is a main four-lane throughway.  I know the radio was on, but cannot recall any music playing just before, during or after the incident.   I realized that hovering directly over the treetops (maybe 40' at the most as they are predominantly maples) was an immense black triangle. No lights, but it blocked all stars and ambient lighting from the surrounding area so that it was like dense black velvet. It was silent.   As soon as I recognized it as a UFO, I recall nothing else until I was pulling away from the curb and driving on my way home.  I had a hard time understanding why I had been pulled over in the first place and struggled to recall.   A few moments later it came back to me what I had seen.  Then I heard the music playing, looked at the car clock realizing I was missing 18 minutes of time.  I cannot recall the exact timing but I do recall the 18 minutes as the number 18 is a lifelong pattern of synchronicity. I had to laugh at that one!   I told my mom when I got back to the house about what had happened. Her reaction was, ""It doesn't surprise me!"" (UFO's are a ""known"" 4-generation experience for us!)

I was telling my friend outside in his front yard of aan incident that occured when I was young of star-gazing and seeing a ""star"" that changed color.  Then he looked up and said ""kinda like that?""  I was amazed to see the same type of bright color-changing light that I saw in nearly the same area and same position in the sky as when I was young.  My friend lives about a block away from the house that I was in when I saw it the first time.  We stared for a long time and viewed many color change patterns.  We saw yellow, green, blue, red, purple, and white lights come from the object.  After looking for a few minutes, he ran inside and got binoculars and we looked closely to confirm that it wasn't a plane (I dismissed this idea immeadiately because it stayed in one spot in the sky for a long time) or a radio tower light.  Both possible explanations were impossible because planes only have one or two color blinking lights and it was not attached to a radio tower.  Soon after this, we spotted another color-changing light below and to the left of the first.  I saw what looked like fiery explosions coming from both of the objects and they moved in the sky, going from point to point and stopping rather than moving as a plane would.  We decided to go inside because we were afraid, but I kept checking to see if they were still there.  About ten minutes later, one of the objects had disappeared.  then, the other one left also, but possibly not for good.  I'm not going to say either of the objects landed because I cannot confirm this next part.  My friend was pacing up and down the street when I heard a sound behind him.  It sounded like a car went speeding directly behind him at over 100 mph. This would be impossible as his house is in a position where no car could accelerate that quickly.  He asked ""Did you hear that?"" and ""Did you see anything behind me?""  I did hear, but I did not see anything behind him.  He then told me that when he heard the sound, it felt like something ran directly behind him.  It was so close, he said, that he could feel the wind from it.  I have no idea if this second incident has anything to do with the lights in the sky, but it certainly made us believe that we were in the presence of something unsual.

I was looking at the sky when I suddenly noticed a strange flying thing. It was definitely very far away, because I could only see a small circle moving quite fast from north west to east or south east. It couldn't be an airplane, because there was no sound, and it was too high. Moreover no planes fly that way. If u'd look to the map, u would see that Kaunas is in the centre of Lithuania, and Vilnius, a capital, is in the east. So the biggest part of airplanes fly from east to west(and vice versa), or, if airplanes just cross Lithuania, they have to go from north to south. My father said it could have been a sattelite, although it was day and the sun was shining.  I was lucky to carry a digital camera with me, so I captured an image, therefore I know the exact time of this event (2005-06-20 16:57). The image (I've sent it to You) shows a small object. I used the biggest zoom (3X optical + 4X digital) to capture the object, so the quality isn't very good. It could look like a cloud to You, but I can asure You that it was much smaller and it was moving constantly and very fast. I could see it for 20-30 seconds, and then it hid over the clouds (which means it was moving higher than clouds)  Probably I was the only one witness, although there were 20-30 people some 100 metres away. I'm sure they could have seen the same if wanted, but the object was very small, no sound was spread and it hid over the cloud after 20 or 30 seconds.  I have no idea what was there. I can't say it was UFO, but I haven't seen anything like that before. We have many airplanes (small ones, and big passenger jets) passing Kaunas, and I know how they look and sound like, so it couldn't have been an airplane. The other possibility is that it could have been a sattelite, but, as I've said before, I have never seen anything like that before.",2005-07-05T00:00:00,,

I could hear absolutely no sound as it flew over.  I would normally hear a jet engine if it were an airliner or normal military craft.

I was with my friend on a beach enjoying the clear sky.  The water was calm, the air cool and the stars shining.  We both witnessed a shooting star.  At first it was blue and after it broke up some, it turned green then finally vanished leaving a gray trail.  I saw a red shooting star that my friend unfortunately did not get to see. I was sitting on the beach facing east and turned my head to face north-northeast.  I first saw a flash of light, like a fat short lighting bolt with even sides.  The end of the flash bent to my left slightly, then disappeared.  What appeared then I can describe as a small dot of light.  It was an orange-yellow color and it just stayed in the same place motionless.  After a moment it started to move to my left.  At first I figured it was a helicopter, but it soon made a manuver I haven't seen a helicopter make (aviation has been a hobby of mine all my life).  It went down at a 45 degree angle to the right for a moment, then stopped.  It glowed different colors after it stopped, from yellow to orange, then the light suddenly disappeared. We both watched in amazement of what we had just witnessed.  After no more then 10 seconds the light reappeared in the same position.  This time it was shifting from red, yellow to orange (in no particular order).  The light then moved to the left, and then in front of it several different colored lights appeared.  I would say there were 3 green lights and one yellow/white light.  The formation of lights slightly resembled an airplane, but pretty soon the lights were changing formation.   More yellow/white lights appeared and the green lights went into a triangular formation.  As the lights moved to the right, my vision of them was obstructed by trees.  As the last light was just about to vanish by the trees, it violently changed colors from red to yellow/white.  The rate it was flashing was like a strobe light.  It then was gone. The objects were only round dots, like the period at the end of this sentence.   Me and my friend are both 18 years old and male.  We were only star gazing looking at constellations on a beautiful night.   A few minutes after witnessing this my friend became irrationaly afraid of a noise in the bushes behind us.  It was just a deer and nothing to be afraid of, and he knew it; but he still wanted to leave the beach.  I told him to calm down and to give me a cigarette.  I layed down on the beach trying to make sense of what happened.  Halfway through the cigarette I sensed an overwhelming sense of dread and panic, basically my brain demanded that I leave the beach.  I told this to my friend and he agreed wholeheartedly.  We walked back to my house and didn't talk much of what we saw, we mainly focused on the shooting star we both saw. For some reason we both try to deny what we saw.  We told our friends but the memory is a burden, it feels like something only crazy people would talk about.  We both tried to agree to not mention it again.",2005-11-08T00:00:00,41.5112,-71.3778

I was singing and working at my piano on some songs I've written for about an hour, and heard a loud buzzing sound. I stopped to listen if it was the sump pump. It was coming from my right so I looked to the right and out the window right next to my house but on the other side of the tree next to my driveway was a large craft, 1/2 was lit in what seemed light green lighted slats, and the rest of it had red and white lights flashing on and off, I think some of the white may have stayed on.  The green lighted part was the front or the direction it was moving. I couldn't make out the shape of the entire thing because it was so dark outside. I ran upstairs to call the police on my cell phone but looking out upstairs at it, as it kept moving slowly away, I started shaking so badly I couldn't function to call the police, couldn't remember where the phone # was.   I finally called 411 for the police in Green Brook as it seemed to be going in that direction.  The officer laughed at me sarcastically and suggested it may be an advertising gimmick.   This is the 5th siting for me since I was 13 (I'm 55 yrs old now) and the closest ever.  I am very uncomfortable about this as I had earlier left a cell phone message for my brother wishing him a belated happy birthday and ended with ""Well, I haven't seen any UFO's lately"".   I got a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach right after I said that.  I knew I would see one again but did not expect it so soon or so close to me.  It may have been about 20-40 feet away from me and about 25-30 feet high.  I could tell it was flying behind and away from my tree as I saw the branches in the light of the craft as it moved.   The green was a beautiful color, but appeared like they were slats laying or placed next to each other at an angle that suggested it to be a wide oval but the rest of it was not visible to determine that.  I would guess it was the size of a small airplane, and a blimp shape.   I do not look forward to another siting but know this will occur.  They are getting closer each time.  My sister called me after I told her about it that she heard on the news that there are meteor showers and we may see green lights.   This was NO meteor shower.  This was a vessel, deliberate in its movement low across the sky right next to and perhaps when the buzzing started, right over my house.   Once I reported it to the police in GB it disappeared either from view or the lights just went out.  I could not tell.  I intend to buy a good digital camera to keep on me at all times. Since I may not always be able to put my glasses on, I am even considering laser surgery on my eyes for distance. I want to be able to show proof.   I will try to submit a map and drawings (of the bright orange oval craft I saw 10-14-04 as well).",2005-05-11T00:00:00,40.550250322580645,-74.46203032258065

They looked like lit-up windows one might see in a house from far away. In retrospect, I am pretty sure that they were two separate lights (or lit windows) on a single craft because there was a definite curve in the lights, as if they were curving around the craft. It was not an airplane; it wasn't moving at all and it certainly was not a star or planet. Believe me, I can tell the difference and this was not something you normally see in the sky. The lights or whatever they were a part of did not move at all; they remained perfectly still. Anyways, I tell my mom, who was driving, ""Look. That doesn't look like a star and it's not moving. What the heck is that?"" So, she looks. Moments later, the light dimmed over the span of about two seconds until it was out. I'm a pretty sensible person, but this definitely wasn't normal.

But if you just watched it for a few minutes...you will realize it just doesn't move...its as if it stopped but still hovering over the city....watching and looking for something.

I was about to shut the blinds in one of the upstairs bedrooms when I noticed a rather large white light in the sky.  Knowing that stars twinkle, and the light of a planet stays steady, I assumed this must be a planet.  I grabbed my binoculars.  As I was fixing on the object I noticed that this light was kind of bobbing back and forth, and up and down in small increments.  I'm thinking that atmospheric conditions are the cause of this apparent movement of this ""hanging light.""  While looking through the binoculars it was impossible to keep the light steady in view, but I noticed a black triangular shape which was darker than the night sky that enveloped the orangish-white light. This thing just continued to slowly bob and zig back and forth and up and down in very small increments while at the same time slowly moving to my right until it moved out of view disappearing behind the rooftop of my neighbor's house.  The period of time from first notice until it was out of my sight was approximately 20 minutes.  The next night (tonight-10/29/05) I went to shut the blinds in the guest bedroom as usual and this light was exactly where it was the night before--appearing and behaving exactly as before on the previous night.

I work at a place in Carlsbad, Ca., which has 24 hour security.  I was doing these security rounds at about 8:15pm at night when I had my sighting.  I had just walked out of the Southern part of a building, into a courtyard between the offices buildings, turning East to walk back towards the main building.  I looked up into the sky as I usually do and spotted what I assume in Mars.  I remember reading a news story about how Mars is supposed to pass close to the Earth again and look bigger than normal.  I noted this must be Mars as it looked bigger than any other star and seemed to have an orange tint to it.  Just to the right of Mars, off to the ESE, I then I spotted something I'm not used to seeing at all.  In that part of the sky, I saw two very far off red flashing lights. They did not flash at the same time, rather one and then the other. The first thing I thought was that these were military helicopters, flying at a very high altitude. They seeming to be flying to my right, which was South. I assumed they were flying from Camp Pendleton to Mira Mar, both Marine bases in San Diego. This would not have been unusual if this was the case. I've often seen helicopters fly a NNW to SSE flight path over Vista and San Marcos down to Mira Mar, even at night. I stopped for a moment to watch them... and they blinked out.  The sky was completely clear. You could see every star. There were absolutely no clouds. I was stunned. I waited. I wanted to see them again. I wanted to make sure that maybe they didn't just fade behind a very thin cloud that I was unable to see in the night sky. I expected them to pop back out further to the South, possibly leaving my vision on the SE horizon.  That's when they reappeared alomst directly overhead.  I looked up, surprised by their new position, but then I realized that they may not have been flying SE at all. They may have been approaching and flying directly West. I just percieved the wrong thing at first because they were so far off on the horizon.  They were now directly overhead, just South of the zenith. I watched them pass. They still appeared to be very high in the sky, however, the red lights flashed a lot brighter. The stars were even more clear in the sky. I thought that I might be actually seeing a black tringle. So, I carefully watched the sky between the lights to see if I could see an edge or perhaps see stars ""blink out"" as it passed by. I did not, so I was able to rule out this was a single craft. The two red lights were two seperate objects. They matched each other in speed and brightness so well, though, that if was hard to tell. I had to look just to make sure.  Once I ruled that out, I still noted no sound. I called my roommate on a cell phone I was carrying and reported what I was seeing to him. He was at the apartment, a few miles to the NE of my position, in Vista, however, the apartment faces NW and he doubted that he would be able to see it. Even as I spoke with him, the two lights were slowly making their way across the sky and out to the Pacific Ocean.  I continued to watch them, never taking my eyes off them, as I spoke with him and watched them bank to their left. The two lights took on a 45 degree angle in the sky as they seemed to turn from going West to SW.  Eventually, the lights met with the horizon of another office building and I had to walk away because I could no longer see them from my point of view.  My thoughts are that I believe this was military. It could possibly be either fighter jets or military helicopters flying at the highest altitude, however, what gets me if the total absense of sound, nor any other lights. Now, in the flashing of the red light, there could have been a smaller white one mixed in there, but the lights were so high up, and the red flashed so quickly, that I was unable to tell for certain.  I'm reporting this just in case I'm wrong and the military didn't fly these two crafts tonight. I am familiar with the two red light sightings in San Diego around the 4th of July and New Years. I'm reporting this just in case these may actually be tied into those sightings as well.  Note: As an added note, there was tons of air traffic tonight. I saw at least 5 other small planes in the sky returning to the main building. Three of which seemed to be flying up and down the coast of Carlsbad at the same time as my sighting. One plane was landing at Palomar airport at 8:18pm. It's possible other pilots in the Northern Western part of San Diego County may have seen these two lights and can be a better judge of altitude and position. ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS; SUBMITTED 10/28/2005 AT 21:02 HRS.)) Flashing red light returns, alone this time, flies same path overhead, and disappears over SW horizon Refer back to 20:15 sighting in same location.  This is the same person reporting.  The lights came back.  ((NUFORC Note:  at 21:40 hrs.))  One of them did, anyways.  This time there was only one flashing red light in the sky as it passed overhead, going the same speed, same direction.  Now I really am wondering if it's military aircraft circling.  However, as always, because the lights would completely stop flashing and go out for a few passing moments, and because this still did not have any sound, or any other lights associated with it, I wanted to report it here.  This time I can give you something else I didn't note the first time.  There was a sequence to the flashing lights.  It flashed in sequence of 1-2-3-stop... 1-2-3-stop... each time it stopped, there would be no lights at all.  I could only still make out a red light.  I watch it blink out while overhead this time and still could not even make out a shadow of a dot in the sky.   I watched it fly west, all by itself, and bank to the SW again before I returned to what I was doing. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS)) Peter, I'm sorry, but it turns out that these aircraft were fighter jets from Miramar MAS. They returned a third time later in the evening and I had a witness with me who was able to say with certainty that these are what they were. During the third sighting, we actually saw four of them, flying the same exact circular path, two by two. He agreed with me, however, that it was very strange that the pilots were turning off all their lights. Again, right over the area of Encinitis, Ca, the flashing red lights would turn off and they'd fly a short distance for about a good 10 seconds with no lights at all. Also during the third sighting, things were finally quiet enough in the area that we were both able to hear the very distant rumble of fighter jet engines. I apologise for posting these reports, now that I know what they were, but, like I said in those reports, the fact that I couldn't hear them at first and the fact that they were actually turning off all their navigational lights was throwing me off. I guess they thought they were flying high enough that they didn't need to worry about commercial and private aircraft hitting them. I wonder why they still did that, though... I guess you can still post the reports based on that weird fact. Maybe they didn't want to be noticed and were flying at such a high altitude because they were flying something unconventional. I have no doubt now, though, that it was military aircraft from Miramar. ((END CORRESPONDENCE))",2005-11-03T00:00:00,33.12780664961637,-117.30352710997443

Sunset Blvd., which is a major thoroughfare here, I happened to look skyward and my eyes got focused on  something unusual. I indicated the direction of what I am seeing to the man I was talking to to find out if he can also see it. He tried a couple but could not perhaps due to some eye problem, he did not.  I somewhat ran to a parked care quite nearby to assertain if they can see what I am seeing. Again I indicated the located and sure enough, they can see them. At first, I saw simultaneously a solitary whitish disk and a couple, and later a 4th one. They are at an altitude that makes them look like US quarter coins. They are in a formation like a big letter T on its sides. They are slightly changing formation with the middle craft slightly moving to the solitary craft and then forming a big arrow. As soon as the couple say them, they were trying to capture it with their camera phone. (I did not know if they were able to photo it). The couple were also commenting that the crafts seem to be moving when they are in formation--like they are rotating or vibrating. Laster on, the arrowhead formed into an equilateral triangle that slowly rotated and at one time stopped as an arrowhead.

Later on they disappeared and later on a couple reappeared at a higher altitude until I could not see them again anymore.  Footnote: Am a middle-aged man who works as a Market'g Ex for a small med. vocational school where I had the sighting. The couple in the car where from late twenties to early 30's. The woman was born in Mexico but grew up in So. Cal. and interestingly enough, she told me of a close encounter when she was 12 together with her Mom, sister and their neighbors. She described of quite huge crafts emitting different lights that hovered low above their houses. The male of the couple, at the moment this was happening, phoned to inform his mother. Then he informed a couple youngsters who were crossing the street about the UFOs. So there were not much people really at the exact vicinity where we had the sighting though it could get busy at other times.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,34.05070709047974,-118.27993506711411

At first what caught my attention, was a sound that sounded like a kite or flag flapping quickly in the sky...I looked up towards sound, and saw a very dimish light.  I watched for a few minutes, expecting it to be a bird, or a kite...but it stayed in same relative spot in the sky.  It was to the East, about 50 feet above the tree line..so it might have been farily low to the earth.   I then went back inside to get my Mom (63) and daughter (9) to have then take a hear and look.  Both heard it, both saw the dim light moving around kind of ""intelligently"" but also kind of random.   It seemed to stay in the original spot for at least 10 minutes.  By this time, I secured my LED flashlight and started to try the old Close Encounters light flashing...Hoping of course that I didn't upset what ever it was...but mostly trying to see if it would respond to me.  It didn't.  After a few more minutes it started to move off to the East and get higher..at least higher so that I could no longer hear it.  I watched it another 10 minutes as the light moved, again in seemingly random pattern, and behind some clounds until it was no longer visable.  Near the end of this sighting I did see an airplane flying west to east ( most likely towards Sacramento Airports)...and I could clearly see the plane.  I am a computer IT manager.  My dad used to fly P-3's for the Navy looking for Soviet subs ( when that was the treat!)...so I am quite familiar with things in the sky.  I have seen satellites at night, planes at night, helicopters at night, birds and kites at night.  This was NOT any of them.   It was weird, but I don't think it was from ""outer space"".  I tend to think it was either some new UAV that is autonomously roaming, or maybe some really weird birds (owls ??)  but it just sounded too loud to be a bird, and stayed in the same spot too long.  I have seen birds feasting on gnats and they move about differently.  In my 38 years, it is by far the only time or object that I have seen that I have been compelled to write about.

I was in Shanghai with other American students in a bus travelling to the Shanghai Hotel for the first time.  I decided to take some pictures of the Shanghai skyline with my digital camera when I shot this photograph.   There were not any objects in the sky before or after I took this picture, at least none that I or anyone else in the bus noticed.  The tall tower building you see the object next to is the Pearl Tower, the tallest building in Shanghai, China.  This picture was taken in a moving bus without flash, mind you there is still a window between the camera and the outside.    The dark outline on the right of the picture is the curtain. The dark spot just left of the middle of the picture is a smudge that appeared in several of the pictures taken out of the same window overlooking the same area.  Strangely enough, I was never able to identify the location of this imperfection on the window but I give it enough doubt to believe that it was not anything outside.   If you zoom in on the object you can see its detail.  It is reflecting the sun from the same angle as the tower and you can even see a bit of a shadow on the bottom of the object.  I know it is not an aircraft because there weren't any in the air before and after taking the photo.  I had seen a few aircraft in the air that day but none had been so reflective and not one was even close to this shape.   I also know it is not a reflection of anything from the outside creating a glare on the window, because the glare would have bled out more on the dusty windows.  There is definitely something out there in this picture; the pinpoint detail that can be seen really shows it.   I showed this picture, instantly after taking it, to the other students in the bus.  There were mixed explanations.  I don't know what it is, so I leave it up to you to interpret what it may be.

There is lots of airplane activity over our house, as we are directly under a major flight pattern coming from JFK airport.  I always like looking up at the planes, especially when they are lower. At about 7:35pm, a plane flew directly overhead.  As I looked up to watch it, I saw what I first thought to be a star. The plane flew past, but I kept looking at this light.   My wife saw it too.  It was still very light out, and this star would have to have been very bright.  After a few seconds, we noticed that it started moving towards the east.  At first, my wife thought it may be a balloon very high up, but it was moving too slow and too uniformly to be a balloon blown around by the winds.  After about 3 minutes of very slow movement, the object stopped.  During the time it was moving, my wife ran inside real quick to get the digital camera.  She also witnessed it begin to move, and then stop moving.  Once it stopped, I took the camera, and tried to get a picture of it.  As I was training the camera on the object, it basically vanished.  We didn't see it zoom off, it just stopped being there. My wife is a bit of a skeptic, but even she thought it was weird looking.  She keeps saying it could have been a balloon, but she seems to be trying to convince herself more than me.  I'm still not sure what it was, but it had the brightness and look of a star, but it didn't twinkle.  It was stationary, moved to the east slowly and in a straight line, and then stopped again, before disappearing.  By 7:40 it was gone (according to timestamp on the camera).  I did take 3 pictures of the sky, but the object was gone at that point.

At one point, I turned my head to the east (my left) where the sky remained fairly clear and some stars were still visible, and it was at this time that I saw what I at first believed to be a very large meteor burning up as it entered Earth's atmosphere. Approx Ground Coords Under Event: 34 Deg,34.152 North, 093 Deg, 12.730 West (WGS84)  I was immediately puzzled by the fact that the object appeared to be pulsing as it traveled from east to west across the night sky. The effect was as if a very bright, blue-white, blinking light was moving at high speed, creating the optical illusion of a series of ""dashes"" as it traveled. The object blinked, creating 4 dashes on it's east to west heading and then to my complete surprise, changed direction without any visible manuvering or change in speed. One split-second it was traveling east to west, the next, it was traveling a nearly reverse heading, approxmiately 15 to 20 degrees more southerly than it's initial heading. The object blinked four more times, creating visible ""dashes"" each time and then simply disappeared. The light from this object was bright enough to leave an after-image on my retina for several minutes.  There was no sound and no other observed phenomenon in relation to the appearance and disappearance of this object.",2005-06-20T00:00:00,34.5232,-93.2812

A few milliseconds after it reappeared as a darker object, it flashed brightly.

I'm 60 now, but not a professionnal journalist. Now I'm an artist.  In probably July (or August) of 1978, I arrived on trail 254, I believe it was, at the base of Santa Fe Baldy mountain, in the Pecos Wilderness, just east of Santa Fe city, New Mexico.  Checked my watch at midnight there, had walked in 4 miles, and here it began. I saw lots of fog upon leaving the tree covered part of the trail, especially to the West, or left of me. In this fog were small, perhaps 1/4 or 1/2 inch across, lights of a dull red color. They started out a foot or two off the ground, and went slowly straight up, to perhaps 4 or 5 feet, then arched over such as a flair gun would create, but I did not see anything like a flare gun. Some lights may have gone farther,up to 10 feet..  These lights moved slower than any rising anything I had ever seen. I could euphemistically say time slowed down for these rising lights. But this is only a description, not a claim of time slowing down.  After watching this for a few minutes, I walked into the area where the lights were, which had ground brush and a few higher bushes, but the lights disappeared before I could reach them. They were spread out over 25 plus feet parallel to the trail, and launching at random intervals. I went back  to the trail and waited but no new lights appeared. So I walked further on the trail.  There was considerable fog about, and I turned right to sit on a log and rest. After a while, I saw huge red lights, like balloons 100 feet across each. They were linked by a chain of the same dull red color and its intensity as the ""balloons"", indeed as the ""flair"" lights now 50 feet back on the trail. This braclet configuration, was laid across the top of Santa Fe Baldy, as if a giant child had dropped it on the mountain, above its tree line (thus Santa Fe Baldy) so that the center of the bracelet was where the top of the montain was and the braclet's ""balloon"" fobs were perfectly horizontally surrounding the mountain a few hundred feet down from the top of the mountain. I estimated 2 or 3 such fobs would be behind the mountain, where I could see nothing. I saw either 5 or 7 that were partially or fully in view.  This dull red color was consistent throughout both the fobs and the thin chain that linked them. I was stupefied and opened up a candy bar. There was no noise whatsoever, and I realized there was no 3 dimensional depth to any of the fobs. I took them to be spheres, nevertheless, rather than discs. The fog cleared a small amount and I was more sure of the sphere shapes.  As I sat there some non-corporeal ""spirit"" type beings, two, one adult male and one apparently teen male,wearing white robes, sort of like the proverbial ghost,floated in from behind me on the left, a foot or so off the ground. I was used to that having extensively practiced mediumship (I become a human telephone between this world and the ""spirit world"" whether for departed humans or never incarnated intelligent beings) but this appearance was the last thing I expected in this event.  The taller adult one telepathized to me: ""Too many doorways!"" So what? So what does that mean? Oh... I had been thinking of climbing up for a closer look. Had done it in the daylight before, and even that was rugged. He repeated the warning. Then the shorter, apparent teen (say 17 to 18 years old) said: yes, that I could actually get killed doing it. I thought nonesense, and was unmoved by them. The older one then kept repeating ""Too many doorways!""  Too MANY doorways, I thought, what does MANY have to do with it? I thought about it for some time and pretended to agree not to make an effort to climb Santa Fe Baldy there that night. The spirits levitated back to where they came from behind me.  I chuckled to myself ""Like Hell!""  Daddy and Junior came back and Daddy yelled (telepathically): ""I said 'Too many doorways!'."" I was mad, but yielded. (Damn spirits, I thought, too holy to say more than a word or two. And god forbid there should be a discussion with them. Thank hell for important people! ((No, they weren't demons, just jerks.))  They left and I continued watching. Nothing changed. I saw no movement. I realized the fog probably obscured the dull red something from being seen at all down below some 3,000 feet in Santa Fe. I watched some more, got bored, remembered if this were a ufo something, its power system could be extremely dangerous, and so decided not to spend the night nearby.  I walked away from the mountain for 2 miles and arrived at my reserved camp site at 2am, and the walk was hard because I felt very tired. I couldn't figure out why I should be so tired, and this walk seemed to take forever.  Then, when I got to Spirit Lake, on the near side, I had to walk through a group of 15 or so, late-high school or early college age kids, 2 or so of which were girls. They had no camping equipment, but 2 or 3 other young guys did. I went through them and followed the shore of the 50 yard-acrosss-lake to the far side. There I resolved to awake at 10am completely refreshed. I ate a bit, zonked out, and woke at 10 am ""completely refreshed."" Only the kids with gear were on the far side of the lake, groggily rising. The 15 kids were nowhere and I guessed they were at a camp somewhere not too far away. I ate, packed up, and walked back the way I came, without incident, to the car six miles away.  That's all, for that situation, at least.  There's a lot more, best for another time, when I have more energy. I'm 60 years old and this happened 28 years ago. Thank you for reading. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS)) Part 2 of seeing dull red light at Santa Fe Baldy mountain in July 1978. Part 2. I am the person reporting dull red light on Mountain Santa Fe Baldy. I am the journalism backgrounded writer.  Loose ends for part one. in 1978, when this occurred,I didn's need, nor used any prescription, nor any hallucinogenics.  As I said, the next morning I woke about 10am, very rested and refreshed, ate and headed back by the same route I came in the night before. No manifestation of the dull red light was anywhere. Everything was completely normal.  The next night in Santa Fe, I saw the same dull red light, in the sky in the southern area of Santa Fe. This time it was a single light, going on and off like a plane might do. Due to the dull red color it appeared slightly fuzzy, and was heading south, slowly, like a light airplane might appear to move.  Off and on for several nights, weeks, a few months such appeared in the night sky. In late 1978, I moved to Denver, CO. With some friends I went during the summer on an overnight backpacking trip in the mountains, about 100 miles west of Denver. That night I saw another one of the dull red lights flying in the sky.  I stopped bothering to look for them. But, 20 years later, I saw a red light and heard a simultaneous sound of a light plane engine, for a few seconds. It was also dull, located just above the buildings east of the intersection of E. Evans and S. University, on the north side of E. Evans. I had just come from Chamberlain Observatory where I had viewed Saturn with their older but powerful telescope. There the astronomer lecturing for 45 minutes, started by telling people who wanted to talk about flying saucers to leave. A legitimate request, since it was his show, that of Denver University, and conventional science. Later, I viewed Saturn through the telescope.  This viewing of a dull red light lasted 5 -10 seconds, and when it went behind the building from my viewpoint, the airplane engine noise also went away.  Why all the continuation of this dull red light, starting in 1978 as on the land of the mountain, plus the ""flare gun"" effect, then appearing in the night sky like planes? Then the final light appearing and disappearing in the busy intersection at night?  Kind of every which way but loose. A saying in journalism is: Believe nothing of what you hear, and then only a tiny fraction of that. I'm a long way from a conclusion of what I saw, UFO or not. Someone has a book in which he said Martians have a cave under Santa Fe Baldy where they live and do whatever, but I don't remember the author or specifics. And there's been some remote viewing, which is a close relative of the clairvoyance I have used at times.  Because the continuity of the appearances of the dull red light in whatever shape, bracelet or single light in sky, I record this. The bracelet did not fly, of course. And I was certainly puzzled by the flat appearance of the bracelet's fobs, which could have been due to the fog present thickly at first, and thinner later on, but making a false visual of flatness, even though otherwise it ""should have"" been a sphere (each fob).  Heard the saying ""You make your own karma.""? This means whatever you do, you set in motion some of whatever happens next. Go to Santa Fe Baldy and use your wits.  Also, this was in 1978. I haven't been back there since. I did not record these events at the time, that I recall. If I go back into researching these memorable events, I think I'll really want to seek out more current events. I do notice that I almost never, if at all, see accounts of dull red lights in UFO reports.  Finally, there is more to this story than I have told, and I suspect it would take a small book to cover it all. I've seen enough Science Fiction to help with scenarios which could illuminate these events, however indirectly. And I think there are multiple possibilities for the ""story"" of these dull red lights, including UFO source and non-UFO sources. And I had no direct reason to believe I was abducted in the 1978 or subsequent sightings of the ""something.""  Thank you for reading this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

Then the object turn 3/4s around and clearly sped to the left turned and sped back to its original position, then sped straight off the axis or curviture of the earth.

We called three more family members outside at this point for them to witness what we were seeing.  The craft was HUGE, black and triangular shaped with some lights on the bottom.  The craft made a very low, faint humming noise.  We watched it go over our house.  As it passed overhead, some helicopters and small planes were following it.  Five of us witnessed this sighting.  We didn't discuss this until some years later, when we thought how strange it was that, on a warm Sunday evening, on our usually busy street, we were the only ones out to see this amazing thing.  We wonder now if we were maybe ""taken"" and the memories were erased from our minds.  Since then, my son has had sightings where we now live in West Virginia.

The non-factory air conditioning in our car would fail against the heat of the desert so we decided to drive home from Southern California to Central Texas at night. My fiancé (now my wife) and I were somewhere past the Arizona/New Mexico border going east on I-10 in the wee hours of the morning, Thursday, June 18, 1981.  We were barely across the NM border somewhere near Mondel, NM, as I noted hwys 80 and 338 coming in from the south as the next signs of any roads. I’m not sure of the exact time, but we had been driving since 4 p.m., stopped to eat for a half-hour in Tucson, and it’s about ten hours to Deming where I have relatives. I remember this because I knew we’d miss them as we’d drive by too early in the morning. So I place this observation at between 2:30 and 3:30 a.m.  As we were driving, totally alone on the open stretch of pretty straight highway, we both noticed a very bright light to the north. At first, because of the intensity, we thought it was rather close. But as we kept driving, and it remained in about the same position, we kept talking about it and placing it farther and farther away. We were traveling along for at least ten minutes and we could still see it directly north of us, perhaps the equivalent of one car length more westerly than when we had first observed it. It did not seem to be moving. This was 1981 and I don’t think I had ever seen any vapor, tungsten, halogen or other lights - just fluorescents and incandescents. I had seen a search-light close up, and this was the intensity of about twenty of those. The light was not directed at anything, had more of an emission than a beam, and it did not appear to be moving. The only reason we noticed it as strange was that it had such brightness from so far away. We could see that it was above the landscape, no more than a hundred feet, but it just looked like a very intense factory lighting system that appeared (at our distance) to be one solid light.  Then it moved, or I should say ""shot"" from our left to directly in front of us. In less time than our eyes could adjust and follow, the light was above I-10 about three hundred yards ahead. It didn’t have any searching quality. The movement made no noise (we had our back windows open.) We could make out no shape. It was just one intense source of white light which flooded everything on the ground around it and us. This one light could fill six football fields. I instinctively moved my foot to the brakes but, before I could apply them, it again shot up and to our right (south) and disappeared into the sky above us in less than two seconds. This time our eyes followed it, she out her window and I through the sunroof, until it just blipped out. We both said, ""That was no building!""  Fortunately, we both witnessed the same thing and talked about it for many miles afterward. Neither of us could attribute this phenomenon to sleepiness, reflections on windshields, somebody playing tricks with mirrors, air balloons, or any known aircraft or light source.",2005-01-19T00:00:00,,

My wife, children and I were driving home from a friend's house, westbound on Feather River Boulevard in the ""linda"" section of Marysville, cruising about 25-30 MPH when a rapid, strobelike flashing began to reflect off of the tall trees on either side of the road.  The flashing appeared similar to the effect one would see if lighting a white flasher firework on the 4th of July, except that this light just kept flashing brighter and brighter.  We were amazed at how much of the boulevard this was lighting up, and we looked back to see the light that seemed to be coming from behind and above us.  I slowed down to stick my head out of the window opening and look.  What my family and I saw was startling, unbelievable, but undeniable....there it was.  I thought I was going to have to slap myself.  This round, disc-like object, I thought, was something that came maybe from a movie prop?  People weren't supposed to see this for real,  just in the movies, right?  The very closest description I could give you for this craft is that it was able to hover, it was approx. house-size equivalent, it had a large bay-type, bluish-tinted window with what appeared to be 2 beings standing behind it, looking out towards our direction.  These beings may or may not have been people, but if they weren't, they were at least darn close.  They wore some sort of dark, wrinkly iniforms I think.  The one on the left I took for a male, and he waved briefly.  The device that was emitting the strobe-light like activity appeared to be a rotating ring of lights on the underside of this craft that were in a mini-structure that was only slightly lower than the ships bottom, or belly, and was round.  I swear I have never written anyone about this before, but you could get a great idea of what this craft looked like if you view one of the old lost in space rerun episodes featuring the jupiter 2, except that some of the edges were only slightly more rounded.  The craft continued its descent, approaching a distance of close to 75-80 feet from us.  At this piont I panicked and floored the gas pedal.  The 383 magnum v-8  in that old plymouth we were riding in reacted by pushing us into our seats and accelerating the car to speeds which didn't occur to me at the time weren't road-safe. Now I'm sure the ship could have caught us, but instead abruptly veered off to the right and sped off into the distance.  It seemed to be completely out of sight in an instant. It made no sound as it traveled. Later, we were informed by our local sheriffs dept. that there were more than 300 calls placed about the object at that same time.  A representative told me that our local air force base had been called and had been informed that the air force base had no craft flying in the area at the time.  I was highly skeptical of reported ufo sightings before this took place.",2005-01-19T00:00:00,39.1587,-121.4726

While stationed in South Korea as an aviation helicopter maintenance mechanic, my unit was deployed to the field for a major training exercise.  I was at the field dining facility at about 6:00AM and noticed the fog rolling into the valley that our unit was set up at.  I noted that due to the fog, that there would be no flying that morning until the fog cleared.  The sun had come up and it was daylight.  As I was watching the fog move I noticed that the fog began to part as if something was disturbing the air.  Out of the fog came a cone and top shaped object of silver color, smooth skin, and had rotating green, blue and red lights at the top and at the bottom. The craft made no jet engine noise or internal combustion engine noise whatsoever.  I did detect a slight humming noise but the craft was about 1/2 mile away and I could not hear it well.  The craft hovered slowly at about 10 to 15 KIAS (knots indicated airspeed) and did not deviate at all from its course.  It slowly passed over our training site and then moved up into the valley and then disappeared into the fog.  I looked over at the Dining Facility Manager, a senior NonCommissioned Officer of the US Army, and asked him if he just saw what I saw.  He nodded in agreement and then stated, ""We didnt see nothing"" and then turned around and walked away and never mentioned it again.  I detected no military markings, weapons, or any type of surveillance equipment.  I detected no US Flag markings or any International Flag markings or International Number designators on the skin of the aircraft at all.  It left no fuel vapor and it left no exhaust smoke as a jet engine would or an internal combustion engine would.  In the area were 18 US Army Attack Helicopters, 12 US Army Observation Helicopters and over 250 US Army personnel.  When I mentioned this incident to my squad leader he just laughed it off and told me that it was probably something from North Korea checking us out.  I explained to my squad leader that it was not a military aircraft.  He told me to forget about it.  To lend credence to this incident, I made the military my career and retired as a Senior First Sergeant/Master Sergeant of Army Aviation.  I also had for over 15 years a US Government Secret Security clearance that was renewed every 5 years after a thorough NSA background check. To me and to the dining facility manager this was something that neither of us were familiar with and knew that it was not something that could be classified as a military aircraft or top secret spy platform.

We were actually riding on the public golf course (knowing we were not suppose to! We were about 10-11 yrs old) and ther was a back way out of the golf course. So after driving over a couple greens and tee boxes we deside to go the back way out that leads to a gravel road about 3/4 of a mile from the GC. We head out and down through this trail that at first is thick trees and then becomes an open plowed feild. We ran through this trail many times before. Well, just at the end of the trail, the tree line stops and the open feild begins and there is a jump or a dirt mound that we always liked to jump. We get up some speed and ramp this dirt mound and become airbourne! As soon as we land and look ahead my bud slamms the breaks and we both say at the same time ""What the hell is that!""  The craft was about 50yrds in front of us and hoovering about 30 to 40 feet or treetop high. It seemed to be moving very slowly to the east away from us. (It has been 20 yrs but I still remember it well) I knew immediatly what it was and I told my bud to turn around and get the hell out of here, but he wanted to observe it for a minute and I said ""that is a UFO and the dam thing will take us up if we don't go"" and that scared him, so we tured around and boogied off back through the golf course. Nobody was playing golf that day cause it was wet and cold. Although, that day was very clear and the sun was just starting to set. The UFO looked like it had  a welding ark multiplied by 100 on the top and all colored lights like a rainbow dimmer than the top ""ark"" brightness. How I could tell it was round was because in the middle of it, this row of approx. 2' tall by 1' wide squares of orange lights would start at a point at us and go around to the otherside of the craft and then end up back at us, but moving constantly. I could hear a faint hum over the 3-wheeler at idle. It sounded like what a guardlight sounds like in your back yard. Besides the lights, the color of it, looked to be smooth stainless steel or some alloy.  I was only 11 yrs old, but my mom had seen somthing a few years before and started researching the UFO thing and talking to people in the area that had seen things like UFO's. I was, and still am, up to date on all the latest Technology as far as Public ""need to know"" goes. I have 2 brothers, 1 in the USAF serving in Both gulf wars and knows a lot of stuff about a lot of things along these lines, and another that was in for 4 yrs and got out. I have worked at a top secret Gov. facility but I won't go into detail on that. I know this UFO was definitly a UFO. In a rual town near a rual road in a wheat feild looking like that!! I've been waitng for somthing to look like it for 20 yrs but I have not.  There had been a lot of strange sightings around that area in the early 80's. If someone can explain what it was please do so. I'm not sure if it took us up, but I'm sure curious! I have a diviated septum if it means anything. My bud became one of my enemies later in life over a girl, so I don't know if I could talk to him about it, but I think we could.     I had another encounter in the exact same area about 10 yrs later, but I will save that one.    I have waited 20 yrs to tell this to the public! ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

As we were traveling i spotted what at first seemed like a bright star on the northern horizon, I pointed it out to my wife and as we kept traveling I noticed that it wasn't shifting as the other stars over the horizon.It appeared brighter I relayed to my wife that it looked like an airplane that was headed straight for us however that was way out of line since there are no nearby airports and besides this is rugged mountain terrain. as we drove around a couple more curves we saw what at the time looked like a giant street light approxamately 100-200 feet above peak to our left. I stopped the car as there were houses nearby and I got out. I could hear people talking however it didnt seem to be about the object on top of the mountain . at this time my wife got out of the car, we were about 1/3 mile from the light when all of a sudden the light started pulsing and large ring about half the size of football field lit around it. the light being emitted from the ring was a light bluish tint and was going around simalar to flowing lights on light ropes  I exclaimed to my wife that we shoud leave from there and that we were probably been noticed. A great fear arouse in me as I thought, what if someone took a rifle shot at it which is entirely possible in this part of the country. After the thought I was afraid, what if it could read my thoughts. I could see the object and here is my description. I haven't yet seen any description like it. it looked like a giant childs playing jack with the top and bottem flattened to one third their size. there were three other tips instead of four sides the ones with the little ball tips on a childs jack. The tips were thick and were all attached by a circular sphere, all parts being about as thick as a schhol bus the light blue lights were glowing of the circular shape and the initial light was in the center of the bottom tip of the object. It began to move and disappeared over the mpountain top to the right of us. It never made a sound at all. We tried talking to several people about it, however people looked at us as if we were crazy to this day I wonder what ever happened to us, and if any one else saw it. My wife refuses to talk about it except to acknowledge that we saw the craft. Occasionally I go there during the day because I get the feeling that so much more happened.

We got about 3 blocks from the house when our friend in the back seat said ""you better look up"".  We looked up and sitting next to the chemtrail was an object either reflecting sunlight, or it was self-luminous, we are not sure which.   We stopped and watched the object which was moving very slowly. It moved into the chemtrail and then slowly drifted out again.  We were unable to make out a definite shape but could tell that it had some sort of protrusion jetting out from it.  As we sat, the chemtrail began to drift and diffuse somewhat.  As it drifted, the object also drifted with it, following it.  It continued to move in and out of the chemtrail.  Having no camera with us, we raced back to the house to retrieve a camera.  As we drove in, we found our two sons were outside and they were also watching the object.  By the time I got the camera the chemtrail had drifted a good ways away from us and the object was almost undiscernable.

I was facing North and saw what appeared to me as two reddish, dimly glowing lights travelling at high rate of speed in a northerly direction.  My initial thoughts were that this could have been an aircraft such as an F18 and I was seeing the jets as it flew away from me. I continued to watch the sky for a few moments and then saw another reddish glow this time moving in an easterly direction. This time I am certain I saw the body of an aircraft even though it was dark. There was no sound!  When jetliners pass overhead at 30,000 ft I hear them.

Four friends and I were camping at North Lake, We were doing some stargazing when from the southeast we saw a slow moving object that looked like a star that moved from southeast to northwest, we thought it may have been a satellite, or a jet with no flashing lights like a spy plane, but then we saw another object on a different path, going north to south.  This object moved the same way.. slowly, but changing speed at times, and almost in a straight line. the second object was viewed through binoculars and appeared to glow bright blue, and had a slight cigar shape... Just when we were starting to think things were getting strange, 10 minutes later we saw another craft flying in the same direction as the first craft, again it was a blue rounded cigar shape. I got up into the middle of the clearing to get a good view of the sky at this point, just as the 3rd craft floated out of view I saw another craft flying VERY CLOSE. It appeared blue and sometimes had an orange gleam, it was moving across the sky like a helicopter but made no noise at all. I yelled for all my friends to take a look and they got up and all saw the object, several of them said it appeared to be spinning, as we all watched it move across the western sky an airplane was flying from the opposite direction and it looked like they could possibly run into each other. The pilot must have saw the object and climbed quickly as the object.  After that things seemed to die down and we all agreed we saw something that was out of the ordinary. Even my girlfriend who has always been skeptical of UFOs was convinced the 4th object we saw was something strange. The next night we all looked in the sky at the same time as the night before, and sure enough we saw an object flying high in the sky, this time from northwest to southeast. We saw it stop at the horizon, and seem to stop, but the object was actually getting closer. it stopped short of actually comming right back at us, and floated southward across the east side of the lake, once again all of us saw the object up close. After the object disapeared, we saw four or more airplanes flying toward where the UFO was last seen.  I would really like to know of anyone else in the area saw this, or if it can be explained naturally in any way.

I was outside watching night sky last night and at 22:42 I spotted what I presumed was a satellite moving in a west to east direction. Apparent magnitude about 3-4. As it reached the zenith I checked my watch to note the time so that I could check its identity on the Heavens-Above.com web site, which catalogs satellite and ISS tracks over my location on a nightly basis.  As the object moved into the eastern half of the sky, a second object, moving at what appeared to be at least twice the first object's speed suddenly appeared to its south and intercepted the first object and then disappeared.  The first object continued on at its original speed and eventually became to faint to follow.  I looked in vain for the track of the second object, which I thought might be a second satellite, but its speed and trajectory suggests to me that it wasn't an ordinary earth satellite with which I am familiar.  It may have been a meteorite, but again, the odds of a meteorite appearing to intercept the original object would seem to be way too long to be probable. As soon as the first ""satellite"" disappeared from view, I went into the house and looked up possible candidates crossing my area at 22:42 on a similar orbital flight path.  There was only one object, a Cosmos rocket, in the sky at that time, but its trajectory was wrong.  While the transit of the original object lasted several minutes -- which is the normal passage time for an earth satellite -- the ""interception"" episode last perhaps a second or less.  In fact the event took place so quickly, that I have the distinct impression that there were actually several objects that intercepted the first, coming from different vectors, but I am only sure about the one ""intercept"" which is the one that caught my attention.  I was very excited about seeing this unusual phenomenon, made more so when I learned that there were no publically-cataloged satellites operating on this trajectory (orbit)at this time of the evening over my location in East Central Nebraska.

I never saw the Space Shuttle but continued to look and look.  Then I saw a very small ""star-looking"" object that stayed basically in the same location way overhead, almost straight overhead, but slightly west.  It moved in an isolated area making circles and less that 45 degree turns and weaved back and forth.  It could not have been a helicopter because they are unable to move like that.  This object appeared as a faint star with no flashing lights.  There was what appeared to be a regular airplane closer and to the NW that seemed oblivious to the object I saw.  The airplane seemed close, the ""object"" seemed like a far away star by comparison. I was reminded, by it's movements, of a paramecium under a microscope, the way one would randomly move about making strange, almost frantic movements.  I would step away and change my angle of veiw to see if it were something close, a moth perhaps, or a bat or bird, but no, it was way up there.  It never left it's limited area of movement.

While viewer records it all. On the morning of August 6th between 7:00-7:30AM My wife and I were watching NASA TV from our Direct TV Satellite dish.  I was also recording on my tabletop VCR and while we were watching NASA's broadcast of the STS-114 Discovery mission.  The Shuttle had undocked from the International Space Station and passed between Australia and New Zealand on it's orbit and was now half way across the Pacific Ocean south of Hawaii and west of Chile.  The TV camera located at the back of Space Shuttle Discovery's cargo bay was trained on the Earth's darkened ocean and horizon showing stationary bright and dim stationary lights with some blinking on or above the surface and what appear to be stars in the sky at the bottom of the frame.  With the curve of the Earth visible.  The view is upside down because of the orientation of the Shuttle (flying upside down).  Suddenly one dimly lighted object appeared around 9-o'clock in the frame and quickly traveled down to the lower right around 5-o'clock in the frame and slowing to a stop at the curve of the Earth.  A few seconds later a large bright object appears around 4-o'clock in the frame and swiftly travels left across the frame at an upward angle and slows to a stop around 9-o'clock then reverses direction and retraces its path across the frame.   Around the same time you will notice a dimly lighted object from around the 1-o'clock position in the frame travel straight down and exits at the bottom of the screen.  Also at the same time there is another dimly lighted object around the 8-o'clock position in the frame traveling from left to right at an upward angle across the frame to around the 2-o'clock position in the frame and exits the frame.  When the large bright object approaches the 4-o'clock position the camera is panned to the left away from where the object is traveling and clouds appear from the top of the frame and dims half the screen.  Then the down link is cut off by NASA TV.  The programming comes back on showing the computer grafic of the orientation of the Shuttle and then changes to the Shuttle bay camera again showing the Earth as it's orbit brings it into the lighted part of the Earth.   I counted a total of four moving objects.  Three dim and one bright.   The VHS tape I was recording the broadcast with was recording in the SLP setting (not the best quality) but I converted the footage to DVD format and the video is very clear on a computer monitor.   I have sent a copy of this DVD to The National UFO Reporting Center for evaluation.  I have also e-mailed stills from the video to the Director. ((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed the DVD sent to our Center, and we agree with the assessment provided above by the witness.  The footage is so interesting that we have decided to post it to our website, for visitors there to be able to review.   We have no ready explanation for how an object, seen moving across the sky, would suddenly slow, and then reverse its motion.  Its direction and velocity can be determined, given that the object of interest can be seen moving, relative to the star field.   We invite comment from anyone who can determine what the object is, or may be.  We express our gratitude to the gentleman who shared the footage with NUFORC.  PD",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,
