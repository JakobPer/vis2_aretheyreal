I was outside having a smoke, when I noticed a very bright, pulsating light in the sky that did not resemble any aircraft I've ever seen.  It moved quickly across the sky, its light changing in intensity, from very bright to almost unseeable.   I managed to capture it on video with the camera on my phone.  When it went behind my house I stopped the tape.  I hadn't heard any noises but as soon as I put down the phone, I heard what sounded like a quiet plane.  I saw the light in the sky, which had become three separate lights in a triangular form, flying back over my house and was able to start videoing again. I remember feeling afraid but unable to speak, I watched the lights turn from white, to red, to green, purple, back to white again faster than my mind could comprehend.  Once the information was processed, my first instinct was to run inside and alert my husband.  He asked me what I was doing out there for so long, even though the tapes only totaled two and a hal! f minutes.  He told me it had to be a plane, even after watching my videos, and for months I decided to forget about the incident.  I had even posted them to my Facebook and YouTube asking anyone if they knew what kind of aircraft this was.  I was met with no replies, just disinterested silence. I didn't even think about it until I went to the dentist six months later.  There was a metallic object in the root of my molar that had never been brought to my attention on X-rays before.  I made a joke to my dentist about it being an alien implant, but he quickly dismissed me saying it was probably metal from a filling I had as a child, even though I explained to him that my mother made sure I had the non metallic fillings. He didn't seem very concerned, but I was because sometimes that tooth randomly throbs with pain.  I know some would question why it took me so long to formally report what I saw, my answer is I did not know who would even care about it.  I'm not some hoaxster who is capable of using technology to fake this, I'm just a normal, e! veryday person with a family and store clerk job.   The second video of the craft flying over my head is the most amazing, especially when you zoom in on the object, play the tape frame by frame, and apply a filter that really makes its features stand out against the night sky.  I have some screenshots where there appears to be some sort of window. So I will say the same thing I posted with the videos all those months ago, if anyone could tell me what this is, I would really appreciate it!

It was about 2 am, when I decided to go grab something to eat from the local McDonald's where I live.  So I headed out.  On my way back in, getting closer to my house there is a side road I can turn on, and that takes me to my house (short cut).  I have driven this road almost everyday.  Apparently on this night I was in for awakening.   As I turned left on this road, I continued driving right until I got to the bottom of the curve.  There are two cow fields on both sides of this road.  While driving I seen a cloak or mirage of color's in the sky.  Never seen anything like this before.   So I stopped my car and got out to observe what I was seeing.  My first thought was, maybe someone is shooting fireworks.  (Then I thought about it.  It's the night before the 4th of July who would do that).  Also, there was not a sound.   As I continued looking at the ! merge of colors the whole time all of these colors where moving in the sky side by side. It was moving east to west.  As it got closer to where I was standing in the road, I got closer to my car.  Feeling uneasy on what it was.   All of a sudden, a light cut on in the pitched black sky made three movements like it was looking for something and cut off.  After the light cut off in the sky you could see the cloak again continue to move west.  I watched it until it completely vanished in the sky.   I rushed home.  My girlfriend immediately knew something was wrong, when I came in by my body language.  My hair was standing up on my arms, and face.  I did not want to tell her but I did.

He (38 yrs) works for the local school board.  His wife (34 yrs) is in retail management.  Neither of them is a 'believer' in UFOs.  During our dinner they told me of an incident that occurred in mid June. They were sitting by the fire in their yard after dinner.  After some time, the husband noticed in the sky what he described as a 'V'.  He said it looked almost like geese flying, in that the 'V' was so prominent, but that it wasn't geese, because it was way up in the sky, ""at least as high as an airplane would be,"" he said.   He also stated that although he couldn't see a ""back edge"" (completeing the triangle) he could tell it was more than just a ""V"" because he couldn't see the clouds through the area behind the ""V"".  (I hope that makes sense). He and his wife both described the object as being ""at least 10 times bigger than an airplane,"" and ""dead silent"".   He told me that they both sat in their chairs, looking up at the object in disbelief and wonder.  He stated that it appeared to ""bending the atmosphere"".   They both stated that it was moving, but agreed that it was moving far too slowly to be anything they're ever seen before, and that as they sat there watching the object, it went from ""barely moving"" (for 8 - 10 seconds) to flying away faster than anything they'd ever seen, until it was out of sight (1 - 2 seconds). As I stated, neither of them are believers, yet have no guesses as to what they saw.  They didn't say ""maybe a satellite.  Maybe a drone.""  They were just puzzled, and thinking/hoping I might have some answers.  (I'm 'that guy' among our friends/family). My answer for them was to contact the fine folks at NUFORC and file a report, but it was obvious to me that they weren't going to do that.  In fact, me mentioning it to them pretty much ended the discussion.  Stigma, my guess.  You know how it is. So, I thought the least I should do is inform you.  For your records, and such.  I have known the fellow for over 20 years.  He isn't going to lie me about this, or anything else, to be honest.  These are good, honest people.

They didn’t come from the ground, but raised up fanning out and arcing downward in 4 whitish lights which then faded.  This occurred straight in front of me, approx. 1 to 2 miles in front of my line of vision.    They started this pattern 90 deg South (to my left), and each time they repeated the same pattern until the fan of lights (4) were facing me and kept rotating as before moving from my left to my right.  There was an interval of between one or two seconds before each rotation.  It was at that point I decided to turn my camera in an attempt to capture this phenomenon. I was shooting 6 images of the same scene, shooting one f stop apart to later combine them later in a process known as stacking.  The images were shot in raw in which the camera shoots and records the data without any changes or modification.  I used a Canon 5d mark II  which produced images averaging 27 mp each.  I still have the raw images saved in which you can see the 4 yellowish discs in the horizon. As a result of this in the two images included I saw that the pattern had stopped and they were visibly flying in a North/Easterly direction to go over Lake Ontario towards Canada.

As I looked up towards the North West I noticed the 3 objects falling in unison.  I first thought that maybe 2 aircrafts had collided in the sky and these objects were falling debris on fire.  I started to record a video and as doing so the trailing lighted objects proceeded to move along different flight patterns, even turning and changing direction.  The altitude was way too high to be fireworks and the patterns of the lights made me think about potential rockets or missiles.  However, rockets and missiles move at a much larger rate of speed.  I’m a veteran of the U.S. Army that worked in avionics and with the knowledge I have over the Hellfire missile there’s little that relates for it to be classified as such.  There is a lot I still do not know on the subject though.  Nothing as far as I can tell makes any sense. 	I’m an avid reader of science-fiction and do believe in the possibility of many lifeforms in the universe, even intelligent life.  This is the only experience I’ve had first hand. Towards the end of my recording my roommate happens to come out and witness the lights and their maneuvers through the sky as well.  I would describe the lights to have a yellowish tint and large sparking trails following them.  Around the 40 second mark you’ll see the bottom light start to change directions more rapidly than the rest of the video with clear visibility of the trail of light behind it.  Then around the 1:01 mark all 3 lights come back and form a triangular shape in the sky.  Excuse my language in the commentary at this point too. 	Like I have stated this is my first experience with something I believe to be supernatural and I’m not sure if all the information you need is provided.  If there are any questions or need any follow up I’m more than happy to help. I immediately uploaded my video to social media, but for ease of access here is the link to the video I’ve now posted to Youtube.  https://youtu.be/wVpXssN0VK0  	Thank you for your time.

I was the passenger in the rear, and had the whole rear seat to myself so I was actually hogging it up and sitting in the middle of the seat,, and if anyone remembers the original bugs (as we used to call them) the rear window was curved so if you were relaxing like I was and had my head laid back I had a solid clear view of all above me,, back then the street lights weren't the powerful orange street lights we have today and the lights were spread further apart from one another.. so back then one had a pret! ty good look of the sky , even in the center of town,, ,,as we were slowly traveling north to south and I was looking up at the stars,, just thinking of the possibilities,, of life out there,, somehow a split second before it actually happened it actually did,, here is the chain of events..  I was gazing at the night sky looking at the stars ,, when all of the sudden the stars,just started to disappeared and then totally disappeared... and I said wait a minute how can that be ,, a cloudless sky ,, and plenty of stars to see and all of the sudden gone,,  it was about this time, that I realized what was happening,, a massive object I would estimate the size of three , four or more,football fields was traveling West to East very very slowly and very very low, only about 500 feet above the highest building,, so you know this thing was low and big. The edges well as most of the craft of this object were completely black so that explained why the stars looked like they vanished, as the center of the object came into view of the middle of the s! treet th e center of the object came into complete view to me the center of the object (which was concaved) was brightly lit it had lights randomly placed along the inner rounded portion of the ships bottom.  Again the lights were randomly scattered throughout rounded mid section and I could make out very clearly bulkhead doors, also scattered throughout the lit up portion,, as well as windows yes windows the windows were rounded and were themselves illuminated,, as I frantically tried to tell my friends of what i was seeing they just locked the doors as to not let me get out,, saying they were probably saving my life if something was there, nothing whatsoever malfunctioned in the car,, the streetlights also did not malfunctioned so if one was not looking up as this object which made no sound at all one might have never seen it...  I remember it all as if it just happened... as we made the left to main street heading east I caught one last glimpse at the object.  At the time I thought that the only possible explanation was that the object which soon gained altitude and seemed to be back to normal functioning order was having some kind of a malfunction with it's cloaking device..,, I have been visited 3 times by bright angelic type beings in my life..

We looked up and observed 5 very large red round lights, about a mile up in the sky. They were about 3 times larger than a small plane.  We concluded this because as  we watched about 15 minutes into it, we saw a small aircraft racing towards the red crafts.  But they disappeared before the plane could catch up to them. They were silent the entire time, not pulsating but staying bright red and and slowly following in sync formation, from the North West to the North East. There may have been more than 5 red craft but we observed 5 by the time we walked outside and noticed them.  We estimated this line of formation was at least a mile in length.  I used a tree branch as a point of reference and watched them each disappear at the same point when they reached the tree branch. After 20 minutes, they disappeared completely and we all discussed what we just witnessed for about 10 minutes.

It was a fairly large, super-intense white light, circular in shape, moving at an incredible speed, coming from the northwest and moving southeast.  When people count by saying ""1 Mississippi"", this would have been more like ""1 M"" in duration.  The best way I can describe the object is, it looked like a rotating, flat spiral of white light.

The actual UFO looked to be about where Mountain Home, ID, should have been and maybe even beyond that.   I was just around mile marker 70 when I spotted what appeared to be two darker orange glowing objects, both leaving a trail of the same orange streak that seemed to also sort of change to white intermittently.  They were coming from the South and flew next to each other in an arc towards the horizon in a North East direction. The entire episode lasted what I would estimate to be between 2-4 minutes in total.  Initially, I thought they were jets.  Because there is an airfare base in Mountain Home, but these were too colorful (in my opinion) to be jet streams.  They were moving fast enough that I didn't think them to be commercial airliners, but still too slow to be meteorites or shooting stars.  As the two objects came across my peripheral, they seemed to change from orange to white.  Finally, as they were moments from the horizon.  The bigger object (or maybe just the closer one) seemed to burst a green glow from the front of it.  Something that also made it seem to accelerate in a downward motion towards the horizon.  As the flash of green occurred, the smaller object of the two (or maybe just the farther one) seemed to gain momentum and pass the larger object.  As it did so, objects became increasingly brighter (orange/white), and trailing the farther object (which at this point seems to be roughly the same size as the larger) has at least 2 white dots following behind it.  So in a line, the farthest object that now appears to be the same size and ahead of the close one, and behind it a least 2, possibly 3 white dots following behind in it's orange trail.  Close behind is the second original object with it's own trail.  Could not distinguish any objects in the second one's trail...mostly out of excitement.  Seconds after these extra objects were noticed, the whole formation of lights and trails disappeared behind what might have been mountains over the far North East horizon.  I'm not opposed to constructive criticism in any way, so if this sounds like a normal happenstance involving meteorites or something similar please let me know.  I've looked into videos of shooting stars and things but haven't seen anything closely resembling what I experienced this last night driving. ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.

On Wednesday, July 27th, 2016 at approximately 2238 hours, in the City of Buhl, County of Twin Falls and State of Idaho, my husband and I we're at the intersection of Clear Lakes Road and the Highway 30 traffic light. We were facing south preparing to turn eastbound when the light turned green. My husband was driving and I was the frontseat passenger. It was a clear night with lots of stars out.  I happened to look through the trees in front of us, across the road to the south. I believe something caught my eye.  The light turned green, and as we were turning to the left, I noticed the street lights seemed to be moving or trailing lights. Then I realized that the lights weren't moving&#894; it was something right above them or what seemed to be almost parallel with them above them.  I noticed something very low in the sky just above the tree line, that looked kind of like long railroad cars, traveling eastbound with orangish lights at the bottom. This was a huge mass in the sky and I began to verbalize to my husband something like, “what the F*#@ is that!” Fair Street (4100 N 1500 E) was just immediately to the right (south)of us, where you can turn Southbound and the object in the sky looked to be almost landing behind the buildings and the grocery store on Highway 30. It looked to be going behind Ridley’s Market or the Kacy Meadows Apartment complex.  My husband pulled into the grocery store because that was actually where we were headed before going home that night. I told him to keep going east through the parking lot, because the object had become too low and I was searching for a clearing between the buildings to view it.  We pulled in between King's Department Store and the laundromat, which share the same parking lot as Ridley’s Market, onto a little dead end street. We could again see the object heading eastbound so we decided to turn around and follow it. It seemed to already be about a mile east of where we had first witnessed it, but was now higher in the sky.  We got back out onto Highway 30 (4100 N) in front of the buildings and headed Eastbound at 45 miles per hour down ‘Millionaire Row’ out of Buhl. The homes and the tree line on the south side of the road obstructed our view from the object for a short time as we traveled out of Buhl. We could now see the object up in the sky, probably another half mile to the East of us, but now it looked to be in a vertical position instead of horizontal. We turned southbound at approximately 1700 East, just one mile east from where we first saw the object in the City of Buhl.  After traveling approximately one mile southbound, I made my husband pull over and I got out of the truck to see if I could see the object clearer because it was now on the driver’s side of the vehicle and seemed to be hovering or moving really shlow. It looked to be about a half mile off the ground. At this time, I saw a plane circling to land at the Twin Falls airport south of Twin Falls, Idaho. The plane looked to be about a mile or so higher in the sky than the object we were following. For a second, I thought maybe this was a strange aircraft also heading towards the airport, but it wasn’t.  The object looked to still be heading eastbound, slightly curving to the south. We began to drive southbound again, where I knew if we could get onto 3700 North and travel eastbound, we could drive without having stop signs and have clear visibility to keep tracking the object and perhaps get nearer and underneath it.  We headed eastbound on 3700 North at approximately 45 to 50 miles per hour. The object seemed to be hovering now and not moving that much or at a slow rate of speed. I told my husband to turn on the next mile road, turning left, back towards the north. It seemed that at that point, we would be able to get a closer observation and still be able to maneuver in a few directions if the object decided to start off again.  The next mile road was 1800 East. We had traveled approximately 3 miles to the east from first seeing the object.  We parked our truck once again at the side of the road and turned the lights off, so we could get a better view of the object in the sky. I believe we watched the object for approximately 5 minutes when it proceeded to then slowly move back towards Buhl but in a northwest direction instead of straight back to the west. We were afraid we would lose sight of the object because it seemed to be moving at a rapid pace and towards the North and we knew the roads we were traveling on broke up between fields.  I was able to keep tracking the object with the passenger side window down while my husband drove the vehicle westbound on what I believe was 3800 North. The object seemed to be high in the sky and moving quickly in a northwest direction. We then turned northbound on 1700 East and continued northbound until we stopped at Highway 30 (4100 North).  I then told my husband to head West, back into Buhl and to try to navigate to the Buhl Cemetery area (1574 E 4150N), where I knew there would be no city lights and a clearing, where we could view the object in the sky.  We then turned Northbound taking a right on 1600 East and traveled a half mile to the cemetery Road and then continued a short length afterwards and again parked the vehicle at the side of the road and turned off all the lights.  The object that I'd been tracking seemed to be a couple miles west of Buhl. I gauged it over some irrigation pipeline for reference, so my husband could find it in the sky when he got out of the vehicle. After a short time watching the object we had tracked, three more lights came to the area where the original object was located in the sky&#894; 2 from the south and 1 from the north. They looked to be in formation with the object we had tracked, approximately a half a mile apart from each other object. I pointed these lights out to my husband. (texted my daughter at 2302 & 2304 hours) I called my youngest daughter (2307 hours) to tell her what we had been seeing. She called back (2308 hours) and told her I wasn't sure who to contact in order to see if these were military aircraft&#894; knowing that the military base near Mountain Home, Idaho would be having a three week drill coming up this next month.  The 4 lights seemed to be moving slower towards the west&#894; but still slightly visible to the eye. My husband decided that since the lights were now too far away to view, and our cell phones were not capable of taking good video or images, that we would go home and he would try to locate the objects in the sky with his field glasses.  When we got home, located approximately 2 miles south of our Cemetery location, we were out in the front of our driveway and we did not see anything in the sky right away. Within a couple of minutes, I saw a light appear again in the west. It got brighter as it moved east. There was a regular type of aircraft circling low in the sky, that seemed to stay on the outskirts of this ufo object&#894; as if it was tracking it.  The object came from the West, low in the sky (vertically), and headed Northeast at a slow pace. My husband had his field glasses and said that the object looked like a Christmas tree shape. The object was low in the sky. As it traveled further to the east, it was harder to tell if it was traveling vertically or horizontally. There was no way to tell if this object was the same one that we had initially tracked or a different object&#894; however, it was the same shape and size as the object we had seen when we had tracked it east of Buhl and had parked at the roadside to make observation.  I went inside the house and got online to see if our local newspaper or news channel had anything posted&#894; which they didn’t. I then went to the UFO report website to find the instructions on how to report this. During our tracking of this ufo, I had tried calling and texted the City of Buhl on-duty officers&#894; my coworkers.  I had also called and talked to my daughter to see if she could get online and see if anything was being reported. By morning the next day, it was reported that it was space debris or meteors&#894; but what we tracked could not have been. ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.

"Baraboo, IW, 3 red / orange objects east of town",Baraboo,WI,2016-07-03T22:05:00,oval,5 minutes,"Occurred : 7/3/2016 22:05  (Entered as : 07/03/16 22:05) Reported: 7/4/2016 11:52:16 AM 11:52 Posted: 7/8/2016 Location: Baraboo, WI Shape: Oval Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/128/S128248.html,"Baraboo, IW, 3 red / orange objects east of town At around 10:05 pm, (July 3, 2016) two people, who were star gazing witnessed three UFO’s just east of Baraboo, WI, USA.  The first was perceived as a dim red, roughly triangular light, point down, about 5° above the northern horizon moving SSW. Inspection with binoculars confirmed that this was not an aircraft, although it sometimes ‘shined’ as if there were navigation lights or a rotating beacon of some sort.  This wasn’t the case as, none were present when examined with the glasses.  While the first continued toward the SW, another came up fast from the SE, heading NNW from behind a bluff (long, hills about 500 feet high, the couple were on the north base of a bluff east of Baraboo).  The object continued to the NE (about thirty seconds to a minute or so from about 45° south from zenith until it passed into the earth’s shadow). 	The second object was a glowing red/orange shape, roughly triangular (point downward) until you looked at it through binoculars, when it showed as a bright yellowish light with a soft aura around it to the front and diminishing behind.  Oddly, the red orange triangular shape was not observed.  The light was rather oval in shape. When this second one neared the northern horizon, it faded and one observer realized it had passed into the earth’s penumbra.  This was evident because a black oval continued to travel without any light around it, suggesting this was a solid object that had been illuminated by the sun, rather than a self-illuminated object that had ‘faded’.  While it traveled this way, the first object faded and was lost to view, about 20° from true north.  As far as the observers could guess, it continued on a southwestern heading. 	After about five minutes, a third object followed the path of the second where it had appeared over the bluff. It looked exactly the same and faded in the same place near the horizon as the second had, but could not be observed after ‘vanishing’ due to light conditions.  It is not impossible for this to have been the first object that was sighted moving SW, having regained altitude and followed the second’s path. 	Other observations:  No sound, no deviation in course.   ""Altitude and size are unknown, but a little simple math applying the altitude of the earth’s penumbra at 22:05 on July 3, 2016, for Baraboo at 43.4711°N by 89.7443°W would give at least the altitude for when they entered the shadow.  Observers assume that this would indicate a descent from a high altitude.  Relative size was approximately ¼ of a thumb nail when observed with the naked eye from the ground.  Overall shape or form is unknown. Although the object was observed in silhouette through 20 power binoculars, the ‘oval’ observed is far from conclusive as far as any structure is concerned. 	One witness is a former airport employee and military / combat zone veteran who has a very WIDE visual lexicon from fixed and rotary winged aircraft, flares, bombs, missiles and such. This was NOT a phenomenon of this type, nor did it seem naturally occurring.  There were no navigation lights on the object when it passed into the shadow and was observed for an additional thirty seconds until it blended in with the atmosphere. 	No conclusions to what the object was have been drawn. It was ‘unidentified’.",2016-07-08T00:00:00,43.4807,-89.7399

Flashing light high above Sequoia National Park on July 4th weekend.,Kings Canyon National Parks,CA,2016-07-02T22:30:00,flash,5 minutes,"Occurred : 7/2/2016 22:30  (Entered as : 07/02/16 22:30) Reported: 7/9/2016 1:56:54 PM 13:56 Posted: 7/15/2016 Location: Kings Canyon National Parks, CA Shape: Flash Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/128/S128378.html,"Flashing light high above Sequoia National Park on July 4th weekend. Our family took a recent trip to Sequoia National Forest/Kings Canyon to have some fun on the weekend of the July 4th holiday.  The 4 of us (my parents, my wife and myself) stayed at the Montecito Lodge off of the 198 General’s Highway.  We only stayed one night--the night of July 2nd. The lodge grounds have several summer-camp style buildings, each with their own amenities.  We stayed in the main lodge building which includes the check-in and hospitality desk, kitchen and dining areas, recreation room, lodging and a patio on the southeast outside area for dining and lounging. Around 10PM on the night of July 2nd, my wife, my mother and myself wanted to get a look at the night sky. My father had already gone to sleep.  At an elevation of 7,400 feet and a very clear mountain night, we thought we’d take the opportunity to see the stars. We went outside and onto the back patio area of the main lodge:  it faces southeast down the canyon, with a clear view far into the High Sierra’s, with Mt. Whitney hidden off to the left, and the 198 Highway winding down directly ahead, and more of Sequoia down below and stretching far off to the South. At night, the view off the back patio was incredible -- completely unobstructed view of a huge area of night sky, with little to absolutely no local light pollution.  We counted 2 orbiting satellites and a few aircraft at cruising altitude (though the air traffic was far away, not passing directly overhead) and hundreds of thousands of stars.  You could clearly see the Milky Way with your own eyes. My wife left to go up to the lodge room around 10:25PM, but my mother and I stayed out for just a few more minutes.  We were both looking directly Southeast, in the lower 25% of our viewing area above the horizon when we noticed one small burst of white light.  We continued watching, as our first idea was that it was possibly aircraft beacon.  But it then flashed again, with similar intensity but not identical. We both said to each other, “did you see that?”  We kept our eyes focused on the area of sky -- we noticed an extremely dim almost pin-point light drifting upward when it flashed again twice, maybe three times, with in-consistent intensity.  We were both unnerved and were at this point asking each other, “what the hell is that thing?”  After flashing, the pin-point dim light would drift, up then down, left then right and stop -- flash, flash -- and then drift more.  This went on for roughly 5 minutes, and eventually it stopped -- appearing to have completely diminished.  It was just one sole source of light that seemed to be emitting the flashes, then drifting, to flash again before disappearing. The flashes of light were pure white, and very bright.  The flashes expanded to nearly the size of a pencil eraser head held out at arm’s length.  We realize that it was July 4th weekend, but this was not anything like fireworks.  It was also not civilian aircraft or satellite activity, as we had clearly spotted those aircraft earlier in the evening.  The altitude of the light appeared to be 50k feet or higher -- upper atmospheric, possibly--from our perception and location. To our knowledge, nobody else witnessed this, as the campgrounds were very quiet, and most people had turned in for the night at this time.  It was clearly something strange, and we both continued to talk about it for the rest of our trip, knowing we’d witnessed possibly something paranormal or extraterrestrial.

This email was received by Missouri MUFON Assistant State Director through our website and I thought it would be of interest to you since it is similar to other reports you received: ""My friend and I were house sitting at an older, 1 bedroom house in the middle of nowhere outside Sarcoxie, night before last.  Neither of us has ever spent the night there before and the house isn't particularly nice, or clean and has the portable kind of air conditioner, with 2 large hoses that you have to wedge in the window.   We had moved it to the bedroom and at 3 a.m., very bright lights came in through the area where the curtain was pulled up and to the side because of the a.c. hoses.  It lit up a straight line, going up until reaching the ceiling, about a foot thick.  This continued, line after line, almost like the lights under a scanner.   When we looked out the corner, the lights were so large and bright, it almost looked and sounded like some type of large farm machinery, and there are 2 big fields behind and beside the house.  On the right side there is type of metal barn, then the tree line begins.  It would be near impossible to even fit something like that next to the house, much less turn to go to the back.   After several minutes after ""scanning"" the entire room, it moved to each room in the house, doing the same thing, but not in the front, which faces the highway.  This was during a thunderstorm and the rain quit above the house the whole time this went on, which was for 2 hours.  The thunder and lightning never stopped and the thunder was louder than any I've ever heard.  Almost immediately after the lights left, the rain returned.  It was not a drone or farm equipment.  The closest neighbors didn't see it, so I'm thankful my friend did, or I might worry I'm going crazy.  I don't know what to do or who to call, but I am absolutely terrified.  Please contact me as soon as possible, at any time.""  The event occurred at 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. in the early morning hours of July 4, 2016.   ASD contacted the witness by phone and obtained further information.  The witness went back to the house with her boyfriend the next night (actually later the same night July 4) and again the lights appeared but at the earlier time of 10:30 p.m.  The witness was afraid and called her parents to come pick her up immediately, leaving her boyfriend behind. He texted her at 12:30 a.m and said that the lights had finally gone.  The witness and her boyfriend searched the exterior grounds during the day but found no evidence of a landing or damages to vegetation or to the house. The witness contacted me through an email from our missourimufon.org website. I included her entire email in the above initial report.  I spoke with her for over an hour on the phone. The witness seemed genuinely upset about this event.  There was no UFO sighted, however, the strange lights observed for over two hours are a mystery.  The witness said she was awakened by bright lights coming into the bedroom with a beam of light seeming to scan the entire room very slowly, then moving on to the next room and so on until the entire house had been ""scanned.""  She stated that the driveway alarm did not go off, which would have indicated that a vehicle had entered the property.  This event continued for two full hours until 5:00 a.m., then stopped.   During the time that the lights were going around the house, no rain fell on the house even though they were in the middle of a thunderstorm.  After the lights quit, rain began to fall on the house.  This would indicate that some type of craft was possibly hovering above the house during the event.  Also, since the driveway alarm did not activate, this would indicate that this was an airborne vehicle. Oddly, the lights returned the next night and the witness called her parents to come pick her up since she was afraid.  They did so, but her boyfriend, who remained in the house, texted her and said the lights were there from 10:30 pm to 12:30 am the next morning. Her father is a retired psychologist, and is a UFO investigator.  He could not explain the event. Her brother served in the military. The witness seems very credible. Conclusion:  Likely a drone or UFO, but I'm marking this as Unknown Other since we just don't know what it was.

It was a white light that was oval in shape and it intermittently pulsated.  It continued to move left and began to descend.  There is nothing out where I was.

This photo was taken by me at 10:16 p.m., June 23, 2016, in the backyard of my next-door neighbor.  We were enjoying dinner on her patio and using a star gazing app on my phone to identify stars and planets.  Below is a description I wrote down shortly after the event to preserve the details.   The first object traveled from the southeast toward my neighbor's house, in a northwesterly direction.  The light on the right appeared first.  I noticed it because i first thought it was a star.  When it moved I thought it was a plane.  It was some distance away (mile or more, so distant it looked like a small dot).  It started coming toward us.  I looked at it a couple of times and continued to notice it coming in our direction, still thinking it was just a plane.  I looked away again, but then a few minutes later, it was close to the roof line of the house at the end of the street (four houses away) and it didn't move any closer.  It just hovered.  The light got much brighter.  My neighbor's 9-year-old grand daughter was with me and said she saw it changing colors. Then I checked my flight radar app and saw there were no planes in the area.  When I looked up again, there was a second one (one on the left) but it was much dimmer than the one on the right.  They were spaced slightly further apart but then the dimmer one approached the larger one.  I snapped this photo just as they became about the same brightness.  They continued to hover there, the one on the left occasionally going behind the roof line of the house.  Altogether it was just a few minutes.   Then I looked away to say goodbye to one of my neighbors.  I helped my other neighbor, whose house I was at, clean up our dinner plates.  We went inside her house.  I didn't say anything to her about the lights because I knew she would be frightened by them.  When I went outside again a few minutes later and looked up, they were gone.  I wish I could have continued watching, but I didn't get to see where they went or how quickly they left. Please note that I live within 30 minutes of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, but as stated above, my radar app showed no planes in the immediate area, and the objects were too close to the roof line to have been planes.  They also traveled too great a distance to have been recreational drones, as I believe they would not have been within eye sight of any operator.  They made no sound.

The road for this cemetery is on a dirt road in the middle of the woods.  We turned down the road and proceeded to the cemetery.   Coming around a corner there was a massive object hovering directly over the trees shooting some sort of light into the woods next to us.  The object was in the shape of a disk, it had a radius of about id say 35ft.  It had multiple colored lights of blue, green, red, and yellow arohnd the whole craft, the color of the beam it projected into the woods was yellow. We were all in absolute awe, and not to mention scared out of our minds.

I also watch them fly over all the time on their way to other locations. In my backyard that day as I was watching an airplane that clearly was not landing in Boise because it was I would guess about a half a mile away in the sky.  I was watching this airplane fly over and away from me and I always watch the vapor trail dissipate as I was doing on this day. As the trail broke up into clumps and evaporated one of the clumps did not evaporate and was in fact a perfectly round white ball.  It looked like a giant ping-pong ball hanging there.  I thought that was odd that it was so round and did not evaporate like the rest of the trail.  As I stood there watching it I was trying to figure out what it could be, I have never seen anything like that and I had a light bulb moment and got excited because I was thinking oh cool I’m seeing a weather balloon. However, as I kept staring at this object it did not ascend, or descend it literally just stayed in one spot so I ruled out weather balloon.  I stood there watching it for about another couple of minutes and then it just was gone.  It just disappeared instantly.  It was a clear, sunny day and there was nothing around this object after the trail evaporated.  It was very interesting, so I thought I would share. I am a stay at home mom and a student currently studying for my degree in education.  I am a down to Earth person and do not go around looking for spooks and such.  I thought what I saw was very strange and I could not identify what it was, not only that but the fact that it just stayed there and appeared out of the vapor trail of the airplane gave me pause.

My family and I were taking a vacation to Bay Head and were on the beach most of the morning.  At approx. 1:30 PM we notice something reflecting and flickering up in the sky over the Atlantic  (At least a few miles off).  We watched it for almost a 1/2 hour, I took a picture of it with my cell phone, poor quality, but it moved slowly, then stopped and hovered, as if it was observing the beach or something in the ocean beneath it.  It was silver/white, no sound. I wondered at first if it wasn't a satellite, space station or debris, but it didn't move.  (I've watched the space station go overhead at night and it moves pretty fast, this was stationary)  The moon was also visible that afternoon and it was to my left of the moon.  I thought maybe a star or a planet, but then at that hour of that it would have to be something pretty damn big/bright.  It was too high and flicking too fast to be Mylar Balloons.  What struck me most was that I had watched a TV show about the origin of Crop Circles in England the day before.  (How they think a majority of them are hoaxed with boards and ropes, but how some of them seem have damage to the ""nodes"" in the crops themselves, which shows excessive heat/radiation exposure etc.) Anyway, there was a video man and his girlfriend took, while sitting on a hill of the valley below, a crop circle, and a farmer working his field (Approx. 1 mile below). A light flickered through the video, to the crop circle, made a 90 Deg. turn and went over the farmer, who didn't notice it, then the light disappeared. The flickering light we all witnessed on the beach that day, looked A LOT like that silver flickering light the man in England had video taped.  Coincidence, I honestly don't know but, I quietly made the connection in my mind the minute I saw it.  Shortly after we saw it, we left the beach to head home for the rest of the day.  There was a pod of dolphin  (They call it the 2 PM Dolphin Show, in Bay Head) and we stopped to watch.  I looked up in the direction of the light again, and it was gone.  We went to Point Pleasant the second day and I didn't see it.  If you zoom in on the photo, the shape is distorted, so it's hard to tell what it is really.

It appeared from behind a cluster of trees and passed over my neighbors' house, before then disappearing  behind a wooded area on the opposite side. There were no trees behind the house, so I had a good visibility.  The house was roughly 80 yards from my porch.  The distance between the two clusters of trees would be roughly about 100 yards.  It was flying slightly below tree level, which I would guess to be about 30-40 ft.  I lost sight of the object after it disappeared behind the trees, and out of my view. The object appeared to be a basketball size sphere, with a silver glow to it.  It also left a trail behind it, also silver, that I estimated to extend roughly 7-8 ft behind the object.  It wasn’t extremely bright, more dimly lit I would say.  It did not illuminate the trees or the ground it passed over.  It was also moving very quickly.  If I would have blinked, I might have missed it.  I would say it cleared 100 yards in about 3-4 seconds.  I also did not notice any noise coming from the object. After the sighting, I was in shock over what I had just witnessed.  What shocked me the most is how low  to the ground it was flying.  I hope someone may be able to shed some light as to what this object was.",2016-07-22T00:00:00,40.06,-85.8344

My band was setting up for a weekend gig at a club named Joses at around 9pm and on a return trip to get a load out of our trailer I noticed lights moving North to South almost driectly above us at approx the height single engine planes usually fly (2-3000 ft?) they were brightly lit spherical objects - white upper half / red bottom half like a fishing bobber; slowly moving individually in tight yet seemingly random formations and they never got closer or further away from each other or deviated in altitude.  They were not connected to each other either- we could see stars between them as the passed us.  As they passed our position they would disappear quickly.  The craziest thing about it was that we saw wave after wave of these objects go by; 12 to 15 object waves at a time and actually had to quit watching them so we could continue setting up our! band equipment.  I got on top of the club in attempt to see better (looking for a plane or something dropping flares) but only saw more and more coming towards us.  One of the club owners was on the ground and hollered out, ""I'm up to 50 now"" as he was counting them.  Major WTF moment. There were 7 of us that saw these things and unfortunately cell phones weren't good enough to get video of them, although we tried.  They were not flares....I've looked at lots of flare videos.  I'm not saying we saw alien ships but don't have a clue what they were.  And for the record-we had just arrived at the club and no drinking had taken place yet! I would say I personally saw well over a hundred pass over at about 1 o'clock position above us.  The long trail of them HAD to be crossing over I-40.

It was some sort of object flying silently above us, and honestly my friend and I thought it was a bat at first, however I noticed 3 lights on it.  She did not believe me, and dismissed it as a bat.  I just agreed with her, until, it flew back over us for a second time, a bit closer.  You could clearly see the triangle object, it looked the size of a small car.  You couldn't make out details, but there were three lights in a triangle pattern.   We got out of the hot tub and walked around watching it for a while, it was flying fairly evenly, but would occasionally hover.  At one point, a dog noticed and started barking like crazy!

It had a metallic looking appearance and on the side that I was looking at it looked to me like there were part concave or convex areas to it.  I was looking at it facing north, looking up over my house. There were no propellers, so it could not have been a drone, and no sound.

Size:  100 Yards across!  Very clear details. Map coordinates of UFO location: N37 46.199’W12210.448   I have seen several UFOs over the past 20 years, but most of those (except one) were smaller lighted objects at a long distance away.  Erratic flight patterns and high speeds always told me that these were UFO’s.  But the sighting I am reporting in this report is a game-changer for me!  It was the diameter of at least 100 yard across…and at a much closer range!   I was driving my minivan across the San Mateo bridge heading east on the night of April 11, 2015.  Time was 11:55 PM.  The bridge traffic was completely deadlocked at a near standstill due to a highway construction crew of several trucks and men with jack hammers making repairs on the pavement of the number 2 and 3 lanes lanes.  This construction zone stretched for a distance of several hundred yards from the approach to the bridge, and all the way up to the highest arch point of the bridge a mile later.  The traffic was so dense, it took me about 40 minutes to drive the 1 mile distance to finally clear all the construction crews and bright work lights. I had one male passenger, seated on the bench seat behind me.  He was from Ukraine and he did not speak English.  We could not communicate with a single word.  I had hired him that night to be a sound man and photographer for a murder mystery show that other actors and myself had performed at a San Francisco restaurant.  One of my actresses is Russian and she made all the arrangements for me to hire him for our show.  During this long wait on the bridge, this passenger had his head buried in his texting device talking to his wife during the whole time I was driving. As soon as the traffic bottle neck cleared at the highest point of the bridge arch, I hit the accelerator and quickly gained speed going straight downhill.  At this point, we were out in the middle of San Francisco Bay and the weather was very clear with stars in the sky.  We had another three miles to drive East before hitting land in Hayward. THE SIGHTING!  I was traveling over 70 miles an hour for only about 10 seconds when the interior of my entire van was blasted with a blinding green light!  It came directly from the ride side of my van, but the light was so intense, I couldn’t even see my dashboard or out the front windshield.  In a split second, I cursed the construction work crew for using excessive lights that made driving unsafe.  But in the split second I thought this, I hit the brakes and hoped no other cars were close behind me.  Then, I looked out my window to find the source of the green light and I saw a GIGANTIC UFO saucer traveling parallel with me at the same exact speed and about 500 feet above the water.  The entire size looked to be well over the length of a football field and the distance from me seemed like about a quarter mile away. The bottom of the saucer was the source of the bright green glowing light, and it quickly twisted to a more upright position where the green underside of the saucer was completely visible and tilted towards me.  But, the tilt angle was enough to cover the top side of the UFO and I could not see what the top half looked like. UFO DESIGN:  To instantly memorize all the details of this UFO, I used a highly trained technique I have developed over the years.  I call it the “SNAPSHOT” effect. My eyes and brain soak up as many details as possible in the shortest amount of time. I am a trained investigator and I am well known for having a better-than-average memory recall of live incidents and events.  The main details I remembered are permanently etched into my memory just as clearly today as the moment I first saw them:  1.  	The saucer’s perimeter was lit up with two concentric circle rings of light that were the source of the bright fluorescent green light.  The looked identical to a giant ring of neon light tubing attached to the outer rim of the bottom side of the space ship.  A second ring was inside of the first ring with a small space between the two 2.	  Both rings had some sort of thin, dark separation strap that broke them into 5 segments each.  (See attached photo shop picture of UFO reconstruction). 3.	  The whole bottom half of the UFO looked identical to a computer motherboard. It had a massive cluster of pipes and tubes and flat looking designs that intersected each other and overlapped each other across the whole surface like a road map. The color of this whole underside radiated a green color, but I believe this was merely reflected light emitted from the outer rings. It seemed like the whole motherboard underside was probably more of a white or light gray color. 4.	  Across this network of pipes and circuits were about 3 or 4 major square areas of a denser concentration of pipes. The re-created drawing I have made clearly shows these more defined areas. THE PORTAL:  The UFO imitated my direction and speed as we both moved East for another 5 seconds. And then, the entire craft slipped into an invisible black slot in the night sky where it completely disappeared!  The speed of the UFO had slowed down quite a bit for this last maneuver.  It was almost as if it was a car pulling carefully into a garage.  This space craft did not dissolve gradually, nor did sip away into the outer space at a high speed.  It simply glided smoothly behind the equivalent of a giant black door with a vertical hard edge.  For all the thousands of UFO’s that witnesses have seen over the years, I realized that witnessing the ACTUAL PORTAL action of the crafts disappearance into another dimension was probably a rare sight, indeed!  I quickly looked into my rear view mirror and noticed that ALL THE CARS on the bridge behind me had either stopped completely, or were traveling extremely slow since seeing the whole night sky lit up with the green UFO.  I checked my speedometer and I had been cruising at  40 miles per hour during the sighting. I was in the middle lane of 3 lanes, and I breathed a sigh of relief that I had not been rear-ended by another vehicle. MY PASSENGER MISSED THE ENTIRE SIGHTING:  The second after the sky turned black and the UFO left, I yelled out over my shoulder to the passenger in the back seat:  “HOLY SH_T! Look at this!”  But he couldn't figure out what I was saying because of our language barrier.  The best I could do was point my forefinger up in the air and spun it around in one foot circles while making a high-pitched (cartoonish) flying saucer noise.  I was trying to convey it was a UFO without words.  He nodded his head excitedly, then went down to his language dictionary on his mobile device.  He then found something and lifted up his tablet to show me what it was.  He had found a merry-go-round  amusement ride. I shook my head “NO” and realized I would have to wait until the next day to call his Russian friend who would have to give him my UFO report second hand.  This Ukrainian gentlemen lost the sighting of a lifetime just by keeping his eyes buried on his stupid texting device the whole time. When I returned home about 25 minutes later, I called the California Highway Patrol and tried to make a report.  The pretty much shined me on and thought I was coo-coo for Coco Puffs. The next day, I checked all the news reports on the internet and local media the next day. For a UFO of that it actually made me feel great that I had just witnessed a very REAL UFO, but with more detail than I have ever heard anyone describe before.  I was excited, but scared at the same time. So, I have kept this a secret for the entire past year. About 3 months after this encounter, I entered a key word search on the internet for ""green UFO San Francisco Bay April 11, 2015"". I found a hit from another website that originates out of Florida. There was a report entered by another resident from Union City (near Hayward) who had seen a large green UFO on that same day, but early in the morning (05:20) as he drove to work.  It was located above the SF Bay, EXACTLY WHERE I SAW IT late that same night!  I am an artist and I immediately made a Photoshop drawing of exactly what I witnessed - including all the minute details. (Note:  I am a 65 year-old retired  homicide detective and graduate of the Alameda County Sheriff’s Academy).  I am trained to soak in a lot of details and info in a short span of time.  The photo composite I have created is an identical facsimile of exactly what I saw.  I have been inspired to finally report this sighting after one full year because April 11th is TODAY, and tonight I plan on camping out along the shore of the San Francisco Bay, I will aim my video and digital cameras at the coordinates that match the location of last year’s UFO sighting.  It’s a longshot chance that history might repeat exactly one year later!",2016-04-15T00:00:00,37.6502901369863,-122.07600547945205

I'd actually race outside and stand watching, then thrill to see those giants overhead. So, I was watching that quadrant of the sky (no idea what direction... I was directionally impaired all those years in CA, but WA is easy somehow!).  I noticed a star... in broad daylight!  It was far away, as I could feel my eyes focusing on distance.  I'd heard that some had seen stars during the day, but this was my first.  I had a ""bead"" on it with the telephone wires, and stood gazing at the stationary object, tickled to have seen a star in the day!  Still awaiting the B36.  When suddenly the star took off like a shot heading left and out of sight. I just thought it was interesting.  It was years before I understood what I had seen.

They were glowing a perfect white that was nearly bluish, and weren’t flashing, only had that strange flickering as though the air between us was moving their light.  The center sphere stood perfectly still, as did the one at 7-o’clock but the other 2 had a strange way that they were moving towards each other:  one second they were motionless, then they disappeared and then one second later were glowing again, only they were barely closer together.  They continued to flash closer like this for a minute or so.  I pointed them out to the husband, was like “huh… do you see that? What the hell are they.”  He said, “huh!” as well, but we honestly didn’t think too much about them, just made our right onto Chapel Hill Rd., and went for our drive.

About 20' long, 15' from wing tip to wing tip, about 5' in width, all white, no lights, and no sound.   When I saw the object flying toward my house, I noticed that on each side of the nose of the craft, there was what I can only describe as a gray, blurry effect, where two jet engines would be on a normal plane.  (Like a TV station does when showing a news scene and blurring out faces so the people cannot be recognized)   At about 100 feet from my house, the craft suddenly made a slight turn away and flew directly over the steeple of the Methodist Church next door to me, at a height of about 250 feet.  I would guess the speed at about 300 MPH.  It then gained altitude and as it flew away from me,I noticed the back of the object had a rectangle shape, about 10' X 5', all black, with four white nozzles in a row, but with no exhaust gasses coming out of them.  The craft than accelerated and disappeared into billowy white clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2016-04-15T00:00:00,42.8306,-78.6262

I get home from work around 3am and sometimes when the weather is nice, I'll grab a beer and just sit out by my fire pit and enjoy the peace & quiet, and the stars. On this particular night is was quiet and the skies were crystal clear when I caught a small moving blue light out of the corner of my eye.  My first thought was a satellite (which are a fairly common sights on clear nights at 3am) but the instant my eyes fully focused it was obviously not a satellite.  It was a small glowing blue orb and it couldn't have been more than 2-3000 ft off the ground.  It came from the west and was flying due east & moving fast but it wasn't making a sound...it was flying in total silence. As I watched it pass over my house, I no more got the words, ((profanity deleted)) out of my mouth, when I heard a loud jet engine, followed by a second loud jet engine.   I turned my focus back to the west, and that's when I saw the beacon lights of two fighter jets flying in formation, and they were on the same heading, and altitude, as the blue orb.  I suppose the fighters were trying to chase it, but the orb was flying twice as fast as they were.  I then turned my attention back at the orb, and watched it fly out of sight then did the same with the fighters.   Once they were gone, I just sat down and was in awe at what I just saw. What the blue orb was, I do not know, which strictly means I couldn't ID it, thus the UFO designation.  It could have been an alien craft, or it could have been a highly advanced military aircraft, although we only have a couple small military air reserve units in the area, and nothing more as far as I know.  So I doubt top secret aircraft are being developed and test flown at or near our small air guard units in central Illinois...but who knows. So in summary, a strange blue glowing orb, with no beacon lights & no sound flew at high speed over my house in complete silence at 2-3000 ft and it was being chased by two fighter jets at 3am in the morning.  Things like this don't happen in my town at any time of the day or night let alone at 3am.  Once they were all gone, I finished my beer then went to bed wondering what I had seen and if it was aliens I wondered what in the hell an alien could have possibly found interesting in Central Illinois.

Total time 1min. I was doing a late night stroll on 8/14/16.  I noticed off to my left an orange/red ball of light in the sky.  It was well above the tree and house lines on the opposite side of the street and there was nothing to obstruct my view.  It was 1:56am and I was looking in southern direction.  Towards Portland, Oregon, from Vancouver, Washington. Right away, I noticed something different about the light.  It was it's glow.  It was like a light orange at the center and grew a bit darker moving from center to outer edges.  Where it was more of a redish color.  There was also a blinking, or some kind of flashing.  It was rhythmic in sequence, but it was of the same color as the orb.  The light did not illuminate any distinguishable features.  The light was large.  Imagine holding a match head at arms length, that's about how big it looked to me.  I would roughly estimate it being 5 to 10 miles away. It was moving in a flat, arc like pattern.  From the west to east, then finally heading south. After it was heading what looked like south, for about 3 seconds.  It grew dim real fast then blinked out of existence.  For a moment, I thought it might be a plane. Because of its flight pattern and the fact that the Portland airport lies just south west from where I saw it.  Yet, there were no other light markers on it.  No green and white flashing lights.  No landing/takeoff lights or the tall tale pattern of said lights.  This glowin, orange ball had no defining mark or any light source. At 1:57 I texted my friend to see if he was awake....nope. At 1:59 it re appeared. This time I had phone in hand and got some video. During it's second run. The light just appeared out of nowhere.  It moved from east to west. Then quickly back in the easterly direction. Where it stopped in mid flight and mid air. It danced around a bit. It popped up, then down, then it jutted to the west and slowly moved back to its original spot.  At this time, it looked as though it was moving south again. Because after a couple of seconds it dimmed in brightness rather fast, then blinked 2 or 3 times like before and gone!  There was no chance of it being a helicopter.  Like the plane, there were no external light markers.  It moved to fast and too random for it to be a helicopter.  Not to mention the whole orange glow as well as it appearing out of nowhere. I have also given thought to its departures. With the whole light dimming, then blinking out. No plane or helicopter could move so fast that you would loose sight of it. Especially one as bright as the ball I witnessed. It would take minutes for it to gradually fade from sgh. This ball went from a big, bright, glowing orb to nothing in 3 seconds.....two times did this. Unfortunately, like all lowlight/nighttime video, it came out not showing much. You can see what looks like a star, a white dwarf. The camera could not pick up its orange glow and without it, it was considerably smaller. Yet, it was much larger and brighter than the North Star. But the camera was having a hard time focusing on it. Something else I noticed,  it was the difference in shape between what I saw with the naked eye and what the camera was able to detect. With the naked eye, the object (or shape of the glow if you will) was not necessarily round. It was more cylindrical, a shape more like a soda can. There was no source to the glow, nor did that glow cast anylight upon itself. That being said, any defining details like silhouette, shadows, outlines, etc; were not present. I have no explanation for the shape it had with what I just said. It just had one. Now, looking through the eye of a camera, you see a perfectly round object. It was bright white in color. Not pure white, but a few shades off. It also flickered like a star. I can't be sure what was causing the flicker. Sometimes it looked like something on the object was pulsating. Sometimes it looked like it could be distortion caused by heat or gasses in the atmosphere. I have described this sighting the best I could. I have mulled over it for a bit , let it sink into my brain, chewed on it for a while and analyzed it from every angle.  I tend to believe nothing of what I hear and only half of what I see.  I have tried to debunk the video the best I could.  I have ruled out helicopters and any fixed wing aircraft.  A drone of sorts is possible, but unlikely. I hope this information is helpful.  Because I'm only a skeptic when it comes to finding the truth.",2016-08-16T00:00:00,45.65808015267176,-122.58490839694656

It started 2 nights ago, on 08/20/16,  my brother was driving home at about 10:15 PM when he saw the object flying in the air.  It was a single glowing red-orange light floating about 150 feet in the air, irregularly pulsating.  He immediately could tell it wasn’t a plane or helicopter, as he came closer to the neighborhood he said that the light grew in intensity and brightness before flashing and exploding in what he described as looking like “sparks and drops of liquid metal”. I was at home at the time, I was organizing some papers when I heard a loud explosion, I couldn’t tell if it was a gunshot or fireworks but didn’t think too much of it.  When my brother arrived home he told me to come outside and check out the strange light.  It definitely wasn’t a plane or helicopter, my first thought was a quadcopter drone.  But those are often loud and usually have red and green lights, if any.  This was a single orange light that was floating silently from southwest to northeast.  I was only able to see it for about 5 minutes before it just suddenly vanished.  Frustratingly, it disappeared before I could get any pictures. It happened a second time tonight (08/22/16).  It was about 2:40 AM, I was staying up late doing some reading and I heard an extremely loud and percussive boom from outside, it sounded like a grenade went off across the street.  It was echoing off of nearby hills it was so loud. I ran outside to see what was happening, dogs were barking all around the neighborhood because of the sound.  I thought about the light from 2 nights ago and started looking up to see if it was there, sure enough, the same glowing orange light was silently floating above my neighborhood, this time it was much higher in altitude, maybe 500-1000 feet.  Again, it  was floating from southwest to northeast, irregularly pulsing in a red-orange hue.  A bit redder than a campfire usually is.  This time though, it kept moving until it suddenly stopped moving and was stationary in the sky.  I was able to get an old telescope out to get a better look, but I couldn’t see any definite features.  Even in the telescope it ! was just an orange light.  To the naked eye it looked completely stationary, but in the telescope you see it slowing moving around, hovering in place.  It slowly faded away until it disappeared about 20 minutes after I started watching it.  This time I was able to capture a few pictures of it on my cellphone, which doesn’t show much other than a dot in the sky, but it does show up.  Very weird experiences.

In one photo (shutter speed 1 sec), the airplane is still in the frame and appears like a blurred, slightly elongated light, as would be expected.  I took 16 photos.  I chose the photo that showed Mars and Saturn at its clearest.  Then I did post-processing to improve contrast and saturate the colors, so that Mars's redness was fully evoked. As I began the post-processing, I noticed a streak in the upper left.  I cleaned my computer screen, but the streak was still there and moved with the photo.  I then feared I must have a scratch on my lens. I checked the other 15 photos--no streak.  Then I enlarged the photo to see a disk-like object with six lights--3 pairs of lights that are reddish.  The shutter speed was 4 seconds for that shot, so the object was not moving since it is very clear with no movement blur.  I compared it to the photo that shows the airplane leaving the frame--no resemblance.  The UFO is a disk with six lights and crystal clear.  I also looked up pictures of satellites photographed from Earth--no resemblance.  I have no idea what the object is, and I can't speculate. I am sending you the photo with the saturated colors.

While near completion of the report, my wife called me outside to observe 2 objects. She told me 1st object was moving very rapidly across the sky while the 2nd object was moving more slowly.  By the time I got outside I couldn't find the 1st object but I did see the 2nd object. It was moving from west to east, was reddish/white in color, and was a little larger than a star.  I ran back inside the house grabbing my Sony 8mm night vision camcorder.  I was able to record approximately 2:50 of footage of the object.  My camera did have difficulty focusing on the object so it does go in/out of focus; however, I did manage some good footage of it.  The footage appears black/white/greenish due the night vision mode so the colors we observed will not be visible.  I converted the 8mm tape to a digital format so that it can be available for online viewing and uploading. Eventually, it disappeared into the night sky as it continued eastward. We did not hear any noise during the entire observation.  My family has observed similar objects near our residence the past few months.

On Thursday, July 7th, 2016, two friends and I were leaving the Star Pass Resort in the Tucson Mountains, west of Tucson, at about 9:30 or so.  After having dinner there, we walked out the east side of the resort headed to the parking lot.  We looked up into the northeastern sky to see a group of “stars” all of moderate intensity among thin wispy clouds centered about 40 degrees above the horizon line.  Because the night was partly cloudy, there were very few stars visible and I found it quite odd to see so many visible “stars” of similar intensity grouped equidistant from one another.  I thought there were about 14-16 lights. One of my two friends believed there were more than 20. He then exclaimed that they were slowly moving.  I looked closer, comparing the relative proximity of two of the lights and was amazed to find he was correct. At that moment, a bright blue light, the brightness of a significant meteorite and much brighter than the other lights, fell straight down, zig zagging slightly before it disappeared from our line of vision behind a wing of the hotel.  At that moment, two other bright blue lights of similar intensity passed over our heads on parallel paths.  We were swearing in amazement quite a bit at this moment.  They continued steadily across the sky until they met up with the more distant, dimmer lights in the misty cloud bank to the northeast.  This took about 15 seconds.  When they joined the other lights they took on the same level of light intensity.  Then they all faded away simultaneously. I am a native of Tucson, 47 years old with a Master’s degree.  I grew up staring at the stars and have never seen anything like this before.  My friends are 48 and 54 and are also well educated men.",2016-07-15T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

I looked up at the moon and was surprised to see what appeared to be the Big Dipper at first, just to the East of the moon.

We moved to a position where we could see more of the sky, and these lights were in a ""V"" formation, with the point of the v heading West in the direction of travel.

I lived there with my mother, father, grandmother, and siblings.  When I was a kid, whoever was the youngest had to sleep on the sleeping porch of the house.  None of us wanted to sleep there because the ""little people"" would visit and we were all afraid of them.  I remember that my mother and grandmother told stories about the little grey people who visited the farm at night and that the stories were in the family since before the Civil War.  One night in particular, when I was 10 years old, I was laying in bed on the porch and I saw a grey being with big eyes walk up to the window and look inside at me.  I was frozen in fear.  He just kept looking at me.  The next thing I knew, there were three of them, all about 4' tall with no hair, big black eyes, small nose and mouth, and thin, standing next to my bed, and I remember thinking that I had no idea how they got inside.  I was even more afraid and wanted to pull the covers up over my face but couldn't.  I don't know what happened after that.  The next morning I woke up and they were gone.  They never appeared during the day, only at night.  I never saw a craft of any type, but sometimes late at night we would hear a humming sound coming from the low depression area around the pond about 100 feet from the house, but never went to look to see what it was. I think we were afraid to.  We also often saw small white balls of light in the yard and around the farm at dusk and after dusk but never knew what they were.  The lights were about the size of a softball.  The whole family was sure to be inside after dark and we just didn't play outside after dark - the older family members made sure we came inside and as I think back on this it must have been because of the little people who would ""take"" us.  That is the term my mother and grandmot! her used - the would say that the little grey people would take us at night but always brought us back before morning.  It was almost like talking about fairies or something magical that was our little secret.  It was not something we spoke about to other people - we kept it to ourselves and still do to this day. I still see them sometimes, only inside the house where I sleep now.  I see them come in late at night, usually around 3:00 a.m. but for some reason I just fall asleep and don't remember any interaction with them.  I don't let anyone sleep on the porch, though.  My children and grandchildren have also seen the grey people.  We are not so afraid of them anymore, just look at them as being visitors rather than something that will harm us.  I don't want any publicity or anyone to know who I am because they'll think I'm nuts, but I'm not.  I may be old, but I am strong and take care of myself, and have all my faculties""",,37.1467,-90.6722

We left Sacramento at 1:50 pm to our final destination, Tucson, Arizona. I sat next to the window near the wing.  I was looking out the window to view the snow covered mountains below.  The pilot announced that we were approximately 8 miles up and flying at 39,000 feet.  It was approximately 2:25 pm, I noticed in the distance, a very long, thin, black plume of what appeared to be smoke in the relatively clear blue sky.  At first glance, I thought I was looking at black birds flying in formation.  I asked my husband to take a look and asked him what he thought it was.  He said he didn’t know.  I looked again and saw a brilliant, mirror-like chrome, egg shaped object with, seamless, smooth round edges.  It appeared close, possibly within 2500 feet of the plane but due to perspective differences it could have been much further away.  In comparison to the left wing of the plane, the object took up almost three fourths of the wing.  As it moved, the top of the egg shaped object became visible.  The top was a bright white with a luminosity similar to a ! welding arc.  The top area had an extremely bright white luminescence with what appeared to be white flames in the center portion. My husband looked at this and said he did not know what it was, but believed it was not a plane nor a rocket.  He further stated that it was way too close to the plane to be a launched rocket out of a military air base. After approximately 2 to 2.5 minutes, it then disappeared from view. No one else in the plane appeared to observe it, as many were preoccupied—with shades drawn, sleeping, reading, etc.  My husband later looked on the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) site in the incident/accident report section and found no report of such an object or a rocket launch in the vicinity of our flight path.  A drawing of the object will be mailed to the PO Box listed on your internet site. My background is Nursing and Public Health.

Being a clear cool autumn night, I went outside to look at the constellation of Orion (Westerly direction at around 30 Degrees elevation at the time) to see how clear it would be.  I noticed a small commercial aircraft making its way towards Lanseria airport (North Westerly direction from our house). I then looked more to the South to look in the direction of where a neighbour's dog was barking, and noticed a string of faint coppery orange orbs in the West.  These were moving in a boomerang/""loose string of pearls"" formation towards Pretoria (to the North West).  I estimated they would have been directly overhead for the residents of Krugersdorp.  At the beginning of the sighting I estimated the length of the edge of this formation was about the same as holding a 4-inch long object out at an arm's length.  The easterly edge of the boomerang immediately reminded me of the so-called ""Phoenix Lights"" --this was the first thing which went through my head when I saw them - this because the ""string"" looked straight and level relative to the horizon and looked like a picture I had once seen of that phenomena (note:  these objects in this sighting were much closer to one another and there were many more).  This was the closest the formation was to me, thereafter it became smaller as it moved north easterly towards Pretoria. The ""string"" on the Westerly side moved erratically, many simultaneously moving rapidly and overtaking one another, then dropping back.  The same movement happened on the easterly side of the formation but not to the same extent.  The shape remained a ""v"" regardless of the movements of the individual objects.  The formation was moving between the constellation of Orion and Sirius. The closest comparable motion I can think of is a flock of birds flying in a v-formation in very turbulent weather and then the speed of their movements speeded up considerably. The changing of relative positions was almost ""playful,"" but always kept the same distance between the individual objects. As they moved over, the v-shape became more pronounced and less ""flat"" - I could not count them properly but I estimate there were over 20 individual objects, those on the easterly side being marginally brighter than those in the west).  These were individual objects and not part of a single larger object. The colour was slightly darker than the orange hue of the star Betelgeuse, and luminosity around 20% of that star, on the night I called my wife to see the formation, but by the time she was outside, the formation was much fainter than when I had first seen it and was just about to disappear behind the tops of the trees in the north west and she did not see the formation.  At this time the easterly side of the formation went straight again but the westerly side continued to move erratically.  She witnessed a shooting star off to the side of where the formation was. During this time - of only around 10 to 15 seconds at most - I only took my eyes off the formation once when I tried to see if my wife was looking in the right direction. In relation to the airplane mentioned earlier, the formation was moving much faster and seemed much higher in the sky.  To put the speed in perspective, the sighting covered about 3/4 of the sky and was over in the time mentioned earlier.  This reminded me of the speed of a low flying fighter jet.  There was no sound from the formation, and I did not hear engine noise from the airplane either.  By the end of the sighting the airplane had disappeared but admittedly was not the focus of my attention. I expect the only reason why the objects were even visible was because of the position and luminosity of the rising moon - reflecting off the lower surfaces of the objects - much as the sun does off satellites in the early evening.  They did not seem to emit any light themselves - ruling out the typical Chinese Lantern misidentification.  I immediately sketched the sky and the path / formation on my smartphone (attached). I am familiar with aircraft (as we have multiple airports in the vicinity) and have been interested in airplanes and associated technology since an early age.  These objects and their speed, proximity to one another and movements do not fit any aircraft I am aware of. Their movements would have been extremely risky - if impossible - for any formation of aircraft to attempt without colliding.  The acceleration and deceleration of the objects also did not seem physically possible for a object with any weight. Please note this sighting was reported to MUFON (case: 75463) on the morning of 28th March.",2016-04-15T00:00:00,,

The day was a typical post blizzard, beautiful clear, Colorado day.  I had just pulled into the driveway of my parents' home to visit.  I heard the engines of fighter jets above which drew my attention to the sky.  Now jets overhead is a daily occurrence with Buckley Air Force Base minutes away.  I have become a custom to seeing things in the sky having grown up in Aurora, by the AFB.   At the age of 42, I have come to relize that as young teenager along with a neighbor friend, we witnessed a black triangle almost some 30 years ago.  I digress, back to the recent sighting.   As I was looking for the jets, I noticed a formation of about 5 to 7 white triangles moving south to north over the AFB, but at very high altitude.  To me it did not seem as though the jets were after these objects, but obviously I do not know that for sure.   I observed these triangles for about 20 to 30 seconds as they moved across the sky in formation.  In my mind, I can rule out geese or seagulls as, these objects moved in a tight formation.  One triangle that was on the left of the formation did break from the rest, drop to the rear only to rejoin the formation again on the right side.  It was not long after that I lost sight of the objects.  Again, I know what birds in flock look like and this was not that.

When I retrieved my camera and picked up the light. Clearly like I had mentioned before the light was indeed flashing on my photo screen which made it much more clearer to notice.  Now in the photos there are 2 lights you will see in the center of the screen.  The lower one being almost center with the other light just above it and to the right a bit.  The lower light you see is actually some piece of the roof top that is to the north of us which you see in the photo as well.  So the light that is above the one I just mentioned is the one that has me stuck on stupid. The photos were taken one after another.

How have I not seen this planet before?"" - thinking I had just been ""missing"" this planet or star because it was hidden behind a tree from the perspective of my porch. Then it started moving, and then it started making a turn over my general area and I knew at once this was no normal astronomical object.  This object was at least 3x brighter and larger than Jupiter and what it looked like was a pearl-shaped ball of light, or at first it just appeared like a very bright orb of light.  It was moving very fast (compared to conventional things like ""drones"", passenger jets, or Chinese lanterns) - but not as fast as a shooting star.  It made a strangely sharp turn in the sky and then moved silently over my area eastward, out toward rural land near Alden, NY. -- interesting to note that when I checked your website or MUFON's I found it has reports of flying discs/UFOs from that same town). At first it was simply a large point of light, brighter than the planet Jupiter and all the stars (which weren't out yet that night) - its brightness/light quality/size did not change at all regardless of what perspective I was looking at it from (""head on"", in front of it, behind it after it passed over me, from far away, etc) and there were no blinking lights. I see airplanes every night I observe the sky, I'm perfectly familiar with what they look like and I would be able to discern them even at night.  This was no airplane, it didn't blink at all. I thought to myself I should really get my cell phone and take video of it, but I didn't want to leave.  Eventually I made the decision that I couldn't miss the opportunity and I put my faith in the fact it would still be there when I got back, ran inside and grabbed my cell phone and some binoculars I had nearby, and came back out. It was still traveling on it's course through the sky and I tried to take video of it with my cell phone - the video turned out all black on the screen (even though it was not late enough to be an all ""black"" sky, it was more dusk) and I couldn't get my phone to find or zoom in on the object properly, so I gave up that idea and put my binoculars to my eye, this is when I saw the strangest thing.  Inside the orb of light I had been watching was a craft (or something - some type of structured object) - I can't find the right words to describe it's shape but it wasn't normal, and it was a gold colored burnished metal to my eyes. The object continued moving away from me entered some clouds and I was still able to see the light through the cloud -- then it passed out of the cloud and through some open sky, then into another, thicker cloud bank where I completely lost sight of it.I stood around outside thinking about how strange it was and hoping to see it again, wondering if more would be coming or if that was just a one-off strange experience. A few minutes later (maybe 10, not certain) 2 military jets came flying through my area lower than normal commercial planes, these 2 looked like small gray fighter jets and they were traveling quickly as a pair -- they were heading to exactly the direction and area I had last seen my UFO at. I wonder if they were sent up to intercept or look at the object after it was caught on radar somewhere. Strangely, these jets too were silent from where I stood looking at them, even though normally jets going overhead make a ton of noise from a mile away.  Now over the past few months I've seen this type of thing 4 times. The one I typed up above was the most interesting because it included military jets pursuing the UFO, but I've seen similarly strange things like this in the sky. One time I was out for a walk with a family member and they pointed out a particular bright object in the night sky and asked me which planet it was, ""is that Jupiter?"", etc. I noticed it immediately and thought to myself ""huh, what is Jupiter doing over there in the wrong place?"" -- then it started moving! It moved through the sky steadily, then for some reason it ""disappeared into"" another star in the night sky - as if it had decided to jump into ""hyperspace"" at that point or turn off it's light.  In the weeks following I saw the same thing again with the same family member, only this time it just traveled through the sky at high altitude. Again the strange thing was the quality of light, no blinking FAA beacons, no change in brightness based on perspective, and it seemed higher than normal airplane altitudes. It just traveled over my area and I was able to watch it until it disappeared from my vision because of distance. These were all sort of ""spheres"" of light.  My last recent experience took place while I was walking from my car into the local Rite Aid - I happened to look up at the sky (as is my habit as an amateur astronomer) and noticed an unlit, perfectly spherical ""orb"" - or just a sphere hanging there in the sky between a few clouds. It was fairly high up but I saw it clearly, I stood there looking up at it for a few minutes and it didn't move at all. It was like a greyish white color. Eventually some other customers pulled up to the store so I went in because I didn't want to look like a crazy person standing in front of Rite Aid staring  up at the sky. When I came back out the sphere that had been between the moderate cloud cover was nowhere to be found - but it's earlier position was still clear of clouds.

I have been using meditative techniques I learned from Dr. Steven Greer's CE5 initiative and applied it to my own practice.  I've been witnessing many orb like UFO sightings during these meditations and have been able to document lots of high strangeness.  There are far too many experiences and incidents to paint the clearest picture of what is happening in just one report, which is why I felt confused about how to report such a long timeline of events.  Despite all these antidotal words, I have documented what I could via my YouTube channel.  It's very basic, no music, no graphics, and all short and to the point.  It's hard to pick out the best video, but I am posting 2 links here, with the first video being the date and time linked to this report.  As I said, my channel is quite simple and you're more than welcomed to see the rest of my videos at your leisure to help understand how frequent it is.  Most sightings, including the one from this report are from my high rise apartment looking out toward midtown Manhattan.  There's telepathy involved in this experience as well as other phenomena that I don't think is productive going into in a format like this. https://youtu.be/rRzSxESV608  https://youtu.be/cRDKX190ZdM",2016-06-24T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

It appeared to be moving very slowly to the east then stop.  But at the same time there was some clouds coming from the east slowly and stop near the object.   I am assuming the clouds stopped due to the offshore flow coming from the west.  I thought it was too early for Venus or any star to come out with that much light in the sky.   So it seemed awkward for the object to be a star or planet.  At 7:40pm I go inside and comeback out at 7:45pm, the object is still there.

I am the only direct observer that I am aware of, but I did record a video of the entire event as it happened.

Here's the story... With the wash out of the Perseid meteor shower, gave it another chance so set up lawn chairs and waited, saw few streaks but nothing spectacular..... But at approx 4:10 am EDT observed a craft that was directly overhead traveling from south to north, it was shaped like an acute triangle with long sides/thin and had a blue white light on front of it and two rectangular type lights on each side.  The lights were a diff color than the stars and when the craft would go in front of star it would blot it  out ….....I would say this  craft was orbital, for it traveled my field of view in 15-20 secs and was very high in night sky.  Also, it did not shimmer like the stars did, just solid blue/white lights …........ Then to my  surprise, spotted another craft of this type a few mins later (17) but it was to east on a south east to north west track, appox 70 degrees  and moving at same clip as prior one..............   And then, another lighted triangle appeared but it was about 6 secs behind this one, having follow same track but as it drew near it acted in HERKY JERKY MANNER, slowing down and speeding up at times.... Objects  observed were about size of three pencil erasers held at arms length  , and way up in the sky........... Temp was 80 deg hazy hot and humid with a broken cloud cover that would dissipate at times ….........sure looked strange and seeing the ISS station at times these craft looked nothing like that or any other terrestrial craft …......WEIRD!",2016-08-16T00:00:00,40.52146102003643,-74.3571116575592

At about 3:30 a.m.( quite early) in the morning on Sunday, August 14th, 2016, I drove out into the suburbs to a dark field in the countryside to try & observe what I thought might be the last opportunity to catch a glimpse of the last meteorites of the recent ""Perseid Meteor Shower.""   As I drove to the spot were I wanted to stop, I looked up towards the light-colored night clouds & immediately noticed what I ""logically"" thought -might- be someone from the ground using a searchlight machine to shine into the clouds in order to attract viewers to something they were advertising.   As I stopped my car & my eyes got a chance to both adjusted to the darkness & focus more sharply, I saw that what I saw was actually seeing was a glowing white ball of light moving slowly & rhythmically from side-to-side behind the slightly translucent, white, night clouds. It consistently took about 7 seconds for the glowing ball to reach each side (i.e., first the left ! side & then the right).   Needless to say, I was totally shocked to see such a phenomenon, as there was -no- beam nor column of light -beneath- the ball, as you would expect if it indeed were (what I originally suspected it was)__ someone using a searchlight from the ground to advertise something.   As I watched this glowing white ball for about 25 minutes, it became unquestionably clear that it was -not- a searchlight & not controlled by any human being.  It seemed to be some kind of self-driven, ""ionized,"" glowing ball that was energized,& that moved with a consistent timing & in a consistent way.   As the translucent light-colored night clouds began to gradually fade away, so did the mysterious, moving, glowing ball of light.   By the way, there were no ""Perseid"" meterorites for me to see that night_ although I witnessed something else instead that was even more amazing to me.

They were the color of fire, and looked like comets with very oddly shimmery tales.  They were very close inside the atmosphere, like a plane over the horizon.  They were flying near to one another, side by side like two fighter jets might be, on slightly higher.  They were in the sky for maybe 30 seconds then the lights completely went out.  Not more than a couple minutes, and they reappeared in full intensity, and then soon disappeared once more. Another table was watching dumbfounded.  The waiter came by 10 minutes later and as I was relaying the story to him, the two lights appeared again, this time higher up and closer in towards the coast, and again, with the same intensity and appearance.  We all stood there, strangers united by mystery, and had that ""end of the world movie"" type feeling.   Funny side note:  I asked the girl I was with to swear that if it was indeed the end of the world, we would agree to go out with a bang.  But seriously this was weird. I have never seen anything quite as strange as this in the sky; how can one explain this?  Not meteors, nor falling satellites, nor falling earthly space crafts, because they appeared and reappeared and were side by side in uniform.  Not planes because they had this comet like tail.

I worried something was wrong, so I immediately ran outside, as he pointed to the sky.   About a mile away I saw a very prominent red circle or orb like craft.  There could have been a haze around it but unsure if it was my eyes or not.  The orb was definitive and red though.  I observed it and watched it  in the sky as it was hovering.   Then, it very quickly zinged to the right and stopped again.  It turned from red to white, then back to red.  What I couldn't believe was the way it flew to the side and stopped immediately, not a gradual stop or eased stop, but a full on stop, like it hit a barrier and how fast it was moving.   It hovered a minute, then zinged left stopped, and it appeared to gain some elevation as it slowly proceeded to fly to the right and out of view for a few seconds, when I caught a glimpse of it through the houses.   I then observed it zing up into the sky so fast, I couldn't believe it, and it was gone.   I am a well educated professional and I am telling you there is nothing I have ever seen or heard of that:  1.  Is as precise in stopping as that craft was, it defied physics;  2. Could move that fast, and still maintain such control; and 3.  Could maneuver so quietly, no visible propellers or exterior engines were visible and without any vapor trail or exhaust.

At about 40 degrees from the horizon, I noticed a small red light, which was rather intense.  It appeared to be moving slowly to the northwest at about 1000' or so about a mile away.  I stopped to watch it because its intensity sparked my curiosity.  I often see planes as we have a few airports and flight paths in the area.  Small planes often follow the coastline but this was moving inland.   At first I figured it was a fireworks rocket, but it had no arcing trajectory.  As it continued in a straight line, it immediately lost intensity and grew or expanded into an ""orb"". As the intensity dropped, it developed a soft orange glowing center. I saw no other lights of any color and no strobe lights. The ""orb"" then disappeared, fading rapidly and not just blinking off.  I assumed it had passed into a cloud.  It was still light enough to see a cloudy area of sky behind it, but it was much further to the south.

Then on another occasion on the 3rd of July a biplane flew over so I took another photo and again nothing could be seen with the naked eye until I took a look at the photos then saw the same two craft again. And the last sighting was on the 7th July 2016 when I was flying my drone at an altitude of 140m so decided to take a photo which when I did I noticed a white/green circle in my photo & this craft was also in the picture but strangely could not be seen by the human eye. Whilst my drone was hovering at 140m above ground level I placed my controller down to take the photo so with nobody touching the controls my drone started flying forwards & backwards & in circle motion by itself very strange.

My name is ((name deleted)).  I am almost 32 years old and have been a resident of Cape Coral/Pine Island, Florida, for about 28 years now.  I like to think that I know the area very well and I am familiar with most normal flight paths around.  What myself and two other people saw in the night sky on July 8, 2016, was not normal in the least. I was driving home with a friend around 10:00 - 10:30 PM EST on this Friday night when I just happened to glance over to my left.  At first I didn't think much about it.  It was only 4 lights at first.  As I kept looking over to my left, paying closer and closer attention to them, there were suddenly more of them, and they were grouping up with each other somehow.  I immediately pulled over into a gas station parking lot and parked the car facing South toward the lights.  By this time it had been about 4 minutes since I first noticed them. After watching these things for a few minutes just the two of us, another car pulled up next to me, asking if we had any idea what these strange lights were.  He, too, had a cellphone camera out, with no luck in getting any sort of video or picture of them.  Now the 3 of us are watching these things move around and  witnessing their amazing and otherworldly maneuvering capabilities for a good 6-10 minutes until they started to disappear.   They disappeared one at a time over a period of about 4-5 minutes, the first two going straight up into the sky, no sounds or big light trails to note.  Another would start to move more noticeably, a couple of them eventually taking a more normal flight pattern and heading to the South or Southwest, fading away til gone.  The others seemed to just fade away into the dark night sky, again, always one at a time.  After a total of about 15 minutes, they were all gone. THE only video that came out with ANYTHING will prove only that someone else, someone not in the car with us originally, stopped for the same reason we did...  To safely witness what I know was an amazing atmospheric anomaly!  It was an experience that I will never forget and I am more interested in the unknown now than I've ever been.  I WILL know that there is more out there than just us humans.  There must be. Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon!

After watching it for a while it seemed to have flashing lights and be moving very slowly so I monitored it to see if it was a plane or some kind of aircraft.  I grabbed my binoculars out of my car so I could see more clearly.  It looked like some kind of flying craft with multi-colored lights flashing in blue, red, and green.   I went in and got my husband so he could tell me I was crazy and he came out and looked at it.  He said he had no idea what out was, but out was pretty strange looking.  It wasn't a plane because it was moving too slowly and appeared to be hovering and then moving at a slow speed.

For certain it was not after 11PM (I was on the balcony with my father during the sighting, then he left to watch the 11 local news).  That Saturday, I helped my sister packing (she's moving to her new house), and I was very tired.  I didn't come home from my sister before 9-9:30PM so the time I went out on the balcony must have been between 10:30PM and 11PM.    I forgot to mention that the spheres were quite big (my father was able to see them, his vision isn't too good).  Bigger than, let's say, the lights attached to the wings of an airplane. Their size, color and movement had caught my eye. Since that evening I searched the net to see if other people have had similar sightings (red spheres).  I found a couple of video clips, with different dates and locations, only in them the spheres were blinking.  I didn't know about this kind of spheres before I am familiar with the UFO  phenomenon, actually, I had had another sighting many years ago, not in the States.  Mr. Davenport, if you want the exact location/position of the sighting, I can give you my home address.  With Google Earth you can access my street, which has at one end the highway wall (the sighting was above the wall, the spheres appeared from behind the wall, then disappeared only to reappear again, a couple of times).  I hope this helps.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2016-07-22T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

Seven or eight of us then scurried out to the side of the old brick hotel. As we stood there, someone yelled, “Look, flying discs, up in the sky!”  We all looked up, and as I looked up to the sky, I saw five extremely bright round objects in a formation which I can describe as one resembling the discs on the flag of the Olympic games.

This memory has been with me for my whole life.  My cousins, and Aunt and Uncle were saying it was flying discs, which later were referred to as U F O.s.

So a friend of mine with the name of ((girl's name deleted)) and myself were travelling from NJ to DE for a wedding reception for one of her family members next day.  I cannot remember which road we were taking as she was driving but it was one of the main ones as I remember paying toll shortly after.  I believe it had 9 in the number so it was on 495 or 295, but I remember it wasn't 95. So there she was driving and it was past 2:30 am and I reclined the passenger seat and I was trying to get some sleep.  Then she pokes me to wake me up saying:  ""((male name deleted)) wake up there is a UFO next to the car!"" and she had a nervous laughter to her voice and she said that twice.  Now my first impression was that she just wanted to wake me up so I can keep her company so I pretended I was fast asleep till the second poke. I turn to her (as I was sleeping facing my door) and I ask her ok where is it?  Now she used to make fun of my belief in UFOs, so I couldn't have taken anything coming from her about that matter seriously. She points to some lights outside her window that seemed a few miles away at least. They appeared to be a row of round white lights at least 6-7, reminded me of portholes  of a ship with lights shining from inside now that I think about it.  Any ways these lights were many feet above the ground but it's so hard to tell how far they were, we were going through a flat area with no street lights or houses, possibly fields.  I automatically looked for scientific explanation for what we were looking at, I said may be it's a construction tool/crane of some sort or row of lights on a building. But we continued to drive further and we DID NOT leave the lights behind which can only mean they were not stationary and keeping pace with our speed!  I asked her how long has it been since she first saw the lights and she said a few minutes!  I asked her to stop the car and the lights may have just stopped if they were following us.  So now I see the lights stationary/hovering in the air with absolutely no sound and I had this feeling that something intelligent was looking at me while I was looking at it/them.  Few seconds after, the row of lights moved together (which confirmed to me that they were attached to the same object and not individual) from being horizontal to being suspended in the air at about 20 degrees!  The craziest thing I have seen is as it started to tilt from flat to 20 degrees, it ""wobbled"" like it was in water not in air!  Reminds me if you have a bathtub of water and gently drop a plate how it will land at the bottom.  It was bigger than  plane f! or sure but I could not confirm what it looked like, I thought I could see a black silhouette of the body which I thought it was flat but I am not 100% sure.  It was dark with no lights around but these. I had the hairs on my body stand on end and it then hit me that that WAS NOT EARTHLY!  It immediately reminded me of the Phoenix lights which I saw briefly in 1997 on the news with the volume down and never got the whole scoop on it.  I cannot explain to you how it just hit me that I am witnessing something out of this world and how different it was between believing and witnessing!  I had a 35mm camera behind my feet as we wanted to take pictures next day at the reception and I frantically was looking for it under the mess of the empty fast food wrappers and I was about ready to leave the car to take a snap (I thought I will make history and all) she grabs my left arm and said:  ""They will take you with them!"" and until this day I cannot believe what I said in response.. ""I want to go with them!"". Whomever is reading this, at that particular moment I was ready to leave EVERYTHING and EVERYONE on earth to experience for myself that we are not alone, even if I couldn't come back EVER! Any ways I took note of the time on the dashboard which was 2:50 am. I get out of the car go around the back, got the camera ready and this thing tilts and wobbles again just like it did before so now it's at 45 degrees suspended in the air with no sound.  And then.. NOTHING!  It just disappeared!  I thought I may have missed it take off but I am very positive that it just was no longer there!  It was like when you turn off the lights in a room kind of effect!  So here I am on the side of the highway with a camera loaded with film, mouth wide open and looking at nothing!  I went back to the car and looked at the time and there was none missing, we drove further down hoping to find it again if it has just moved further down but there was nothing!  We paid toll and kept on going but there was nothing. Next day, we told her parents and they kinda chuckled, but didn't call us crazy.  It's funny that there is a ufo shaped house in DE we used to often pass and I wonder what's the story behind that?  I am willing to undergo any kind of test to the truth of my encounter and I was not under the influence of any mind altering substance.  I am a doctor by background and I believe in evidence not stories.",2016-05-20T00:00:00,,

As I was driving to my house, which was located far from town out in the country, I noticed three orange colored lights in the shape of a triangle hovering over my house.   When I made it to my driveway and pulled in, I got out of my car and by this point the lights were moving farther away and they were now located over the woods approximately 1 mile from my house.  I should add that when I got out of my car the lights were heading northwest and the shape of the triangle was very small, so I assumed it was a great distance away.   I entered my home shortly after that and made a phone call to my girlfriend at the time to tell her what I saw.  While I was on the phone I was sitting by the window in the front of my house which faces east towards Lake Huron.  Within minutes the lights had reappeared and they were now slowing moving over my house heading east.  This time the distance between the lights had grown a great deal and the triangle shape was very large so it w! as clear this object was much closer to the ground.   When the lights were slowly moving over my house and over my front yard I heard two loud noises upstairs as if something had fallen to the ground.  Mind you, it was in the middle of winter in Michigan, so all of the windows were shut so the wind wouldn't play a factor for knocking something over.   When the noises occurred, my dog ran into the bathroom and jumped into the bathtub trembling as if she was frightened of something, this was completely out of character for her.  I proceeded to walk to the bottom of the stairs and looked up toward the second story.  Being dead silent and dark at the top of the stairs, I was hesitant to check out what the noise was.  This whole time I am on the phone still with my girlfriend, so I told her I was freaked out and I was coming over.  When I got hack over to her house she greeted me at the door and told me that one of her friends had just called and said that she had also spotted three orange lights hovering by her house, which was relatively close to mine.  Having another witness made me feel better so I knew I wasn't imagining things.   After a minute or so of being back at my girlfriends house, her family (mom, dad, brother, and sister) and I went outside to look around the sky to see if we could spot it again.  No more than a minute later we spotted the lights, this time very far away, moving low on the horizon east towards Lake Huron at a great speed.  I know that it was traveling at an unusual speed because I think of when an airplane is 30,000 feet in the air moving at 400mph, from someone watching that airplane in the sky it appears to be moving slow.  The triangle lights were a great distance away and it was moving extremely fast, I would say possibly three or four times the speed of an airplane.  When the lights made it out over the lake they were still clear as day, and then they suddenly disappeared as if they had been shut off all of a sudden.  I want to mention again that not only I saw this object, but six other people witnessed this.  When I returned home later that night, I went immediately upstairs to see what had fallen or to see what could have made the noises from earlier.  When I got upstairs, I thoroughly checked everywhere and there was nothing out of place nor on the ground.  Since this incident I haven't seen it again.

"UFO takes 10 Minuteman ICBMs ""off alert.""",Minot AFB,ND,,cigar,,"Occurred : 9/15/1966   (Entered as : 09/00/1966) Reported: 5/15/2016 12:55:27 PM 12:55 Posted: 5/20/2016 Location: Minot AFB, ND Shape: Cigar Duration:",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/127/S127339.html,"UFO takes 10 Minuteman ICBMs ""off alert."" This incident has previously been documented by UFO Researchers. In 1966, I was involved in an incident while stationed at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota. I was told to never speak of the incident again, and also told that as far as I was concerned, “It Never Happened.”  I was a Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Officer, a First Lieutenant, and a Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander in a two man Launch Crew with my crew commander who held the rank of Major.  I was attached to the Strategic Air Command, and part of the 742nd Strategic Missile Squadron, one of three squadrons of the 455th Strategic Missile Wing based at Minot. I held a Top Secret clearance, which was required for my job. It all began one morning when I was watching TV while having breakfast, and I heard the local news announcer mention that some residents in the town of Mohall had seen strange lights overnight, which they attributed to a UFO. This caught my attention because I was scheduled for duty that morning at a Launch Control Facility, called November Flight, about 3 miles west of Mohall and about 37 miles north of Minot Air Force Base. I lived in the town of Minot at the time, and I drove to the airbase to attend the morning Pre-departure Briefing at Wing Headquarters, where all 15 missile crews would normally meet each day prior to “pulling alert duty” at their respective Launch Control Facilities. During the briefing, it was mentioned that some missiles at November Flight had gone “off alert” during the night, but no further information was provided.  I immediately connected this to the news item that I had heard earlier in the morning regarding a possible UFO sighting near the town of Mohall. When the briefing was over, several of the launch crews seated near me commented about the news item, which they had also heard that morning, and there was speculation about a possible connection with November Flight.  My crew commander had also heard the news item, and we were both anxious and curious about what we might find as we drove out to the Launch Control Facility. The usual procedure upon arrival was to inspect the grounds and building, but this time my commander immediately went to the security section of the building to debrief security personnel and guards.  I entered the facility from the back door and then encountered the Site Manager, a Tech. Sergeant, who immediately took me into the “day room” and asked if I had been briefed on the previous night’s events.  I said I hadn’t. We then proceeded toward the windows on the west side of the day room where he described to me the large object with flashing lights that had been hovering just outside the fence that night, and he spread his arms out in front of him to indicate its size.  Based on his description, I estimated that the object may have been 80 to 100 feet wide and about 100 feet from the building, maybe a bit closer. I immediately asked if it had been a helicopter, and he said that it just hovered with no noise being heard, quite unlike the usual noisy helicopters heard from within the building.  I also asked what the flashing lights were like, but he could not answer.  They were unlike any he had ever seen; they were not like the usual beacon lights on planes, but something like a pulsating glow. He then said that the object, while hovering close to the ground, then glided to the right toward the North end of the building out of sight.  The object then came into view from the security section of the facility, and hovered just behind and slightly to the right of the main gate, concealed partly by the large garage located within the fenced area to the right of the gate.  This location put the object almost directly above the hardened Launch Control Capsule located 60 feet below ground.  This was the Launch Crew Quarters and the Launch Control Center for the ten interconnected nuclear tipped ICBM missiles located 4 to 14 miles in all directions from the facility. Security personnel confirmed everything that the Site Manager had related to me.  My commander and I then proceeded to take the elevator down to the Launch Control Center to relieve the two man officer crew below.  After entering the capsule, our eyes were immediately transfixed on the Launch Control Console, which showed that all missiles were off alert and unlaunchable. The outgoing crew briefed us on the wild events that transpired overnight, and indicated that the missiles malfunctioned at the time the object was hovering directly above the capsule and next to the main gate.  We speculated on the possibility of an EMF pulse that might have created the situation.  We had no doubt, however, that the 10 outlying nuclear tipped missiles of November Flight had been compromised, tampered with, and put out of commission by the object that had paid a visit. Normally, it was quite unusual to have even one missile down, except for maintenance, and Wing Headquarters was very proud of having more than 95% up time for all 150 missiles in the Wing. The following morning, after we had been relieved by a follow-on crew, and we had arrived topside, I attempted to further query the Flight Security Controller who had been on duty at the time of the situation, but he interrupted me and said that he had been instructed to not discuss the incident.  That is when my commander told me that he had received a call while I was on a scheduled rest break below ground, and he was told that we were to never discuss the incident.  When I asked where the directive came from, he said the OSI. With no discussion allowed on this subject, my crew commander and I were left in limbo, and left on our own to conjure in our own minds how other similar situations might unfold and be handled.  This serious lack of follow through by the Air Force was more than bewildering and it served to keep this situation on our minds. Altogether, there were a dozen of us involved with this incident. My commander and I were not there during the encounter, but we had to deal with the ramifications of the incident, and I will never forget the frightened emotion on the faces of topside airmen who were gathered there with me when I was briefed by the Site Manager.  Besides those of us at the Launch Control Facility, there had to be many more personnel involved, including maintenance people who had to retarget and realign the missiles, also additional security personnel to guard and protect the missile Launch Facilities, and who knows how many other concerned people there were on base. Everyone had been silenced.  The incident was never discussed and I never heard a word of any other incident from people that I associated with. I never spoke a word about my incident for almost 40 years, and my wife never knew. After several years of searching the internet, in hopes of finding someone who could give me a clue about my incident, I then found what was described by Captain Robert Salas and I felt an immediate joyous freedom from the haunting memory that I had harbored for so long.  I then quickly informed my wife. Since then, I have run across several missileers from my days at Minot who were there with me in the Wing, and two of them have gone public with their own experiences.  Two others have described their unique experiences to me, but they have pleaded that I not divulge their names.  They fear losing their Air Force pension, or losing their personal integrity in keeping a secret, or of being ridiculed.  I also know of two other officers involved in incidents, but they will not admit to their secret, probably for the same fear. And then there is the late Captain Val Smith of my squadron who was mentioned in official documents released via the Freedom of Information Act. He was interviewed by the late Dr. Allen Hynek of Blue Book fame who wrote an article in the Saturday Evening Post, published on 17 December 1966, which described the incident that Smith was involved with on 25 August 1966. Hynek stated in that article that, “This incident, which was not picked up by the press, is typical of the puzzling cases that I have studied during the 18 years that I have served as the Air Force's scientific consultant on the problem of UFO's.”  Just prior to release of that Post article, the Minot Daily News got wind of it and then published, on 6 December 1966, a front page news item with a major bold headline that read, “Minot Launch Control Center ‘Saucer’ Cited As One Indication of Outer Space Visitors.”  In 1966, when I was at Minot, the evidence was everywhere that something quite unique was happening, but I was embedded in a shell of silence. The Air Force knew the Truth, the Air Force knew that I knew the Truth, and that is the only reason they warned and instructed me that, “It Never Happened.” ((NUFORC Note:  We are well acquainted with the source of this report, and we suspect that he is an excellent witness.

They sped off tho the South-West again.  Amazing!  The second time I saw them, there were two other people watching the lights.  We did not speak. Later that night I saw at least 8 more orange orbs moving though the sky.  They could have been Chinese lanterns, but they were not flickering like there was a flame.

This is a little old. I was camping with a friend at champion lake for the may long weekend of 2014, a small town near creston in the interior of British Columbia Canada.  Funnily enough the night prior to this I thought to myself, ""wouldn't it be funny if I saw a UFO?""   Breaking camp relatively early the next day after the long weekend of camping with my friend, I started the several hour long drive back home.  I had already been driving for about an hour, and at around 10am is the actual sighting.  Just prior to entering from the east side of creston, there's a long straight stretch of highway with nothing around besides clear cut patches on the mountains from logging.  Bored already from the drive I was fiddling with the radio trying to find a station, keeping one eye on the road.  Initially I saw something ""strange"" in front of the mountain roughly half way to two thirds up the mountainside, just off to the right of the highway.  I looked back to the radio and fiddled with the dial for a couple seconds, when what I saw finally processed. Gasping and looking back up, the object was still there.  I let off the gas and started coasting while looking at it as much as I could.  The object was almost identical in appearance to a barbell piercing held at arm's length.  It had the same sort of surgical steel finish (that is to say, polished and bright/reflective steel), only with a very faint blue tinge to the finish (as a welder by trade, it looked similar to the blueing of a heat treatment, or anodising, if done uniformly across a massive craft). The object at that distance, I estimated to be around a hundred metres in length, maybe slightly longer, with two balls on either end connected by a long cylinder. If at a hundred metres in length, each ball would be about 20-25 metres diameter, with the connecting shaft around 40-50 metres long and fifteen or twenty across. The second part I noticed was a slight shimmer or distortion around the craft, like a heat shimmer, but at that distance of several km away such a shimmer shouldn't be apparent. And it shouldn't be more noticeable on the underside of the craft, with less of a shimmer above it if it were heat caused by the sun. I blinked, even shifted my head and angle in case it was debris on the windshield or my glasses/eyes. That made no difference, and I then kept my eyes fixated on it, remembering stories of people looking away and whatever it is ""disappearing"". For roughly five to ten seconds, it was absolutely motionless, and I was considering pulling over to get my DSLR out as fast as I could. But as the thought occurred to me, the craft wavered slightly in place, each end going up and down slightly by a couple degrees, before angling down on the north facing end, and accelerating instantly from a standstill hover, to 1500-2000kph if not doubling that, through the mountains. This was an instant acceleration, if I had blinked, I wouldn't have caught the motion blur of it leaving and would have thought it disappeared. In my car and at that distance, I do not know if there was a sonic boom, but there was absolutely no contrail or exhaust apparent. It passed behind the next mountain and I lost sight of it. Though I didn't stop until getting into town, I checked my phone and by the map, it took an almost directly north route between the mountains without gaining altitude to fly over them. I fumbled in the passenger seat for my sketchbook, and with one hand shakily sketching out what I saw. The proportions are all wrong, but I challenge anyone else to make as coherent a drawing while doing 100kph down a highway with one hand and one eye on the road. I've had my view of it not being a military craft questioned. But I've been to enough American air bases and watched f-18s do maneuvers alongside harriers practising vtol, had some very close fly bys of pilots buzzing campgrounds in iowa, and seen the American Blue Angels as well as the Canadian Snowbirds doing practise maneuvers on multiple occasions over cities I lived in through the years.  Not once have I ever seen a military jet come close to that kind of instant acceleration, overall speed, or seen a craft shaped anything remotely like that in any profile view.  Beyond that, the sheer speed this craft attained was phenomenal, and by comparison it's like watching a vw beetle race a super car.  The speed I estimate to be as high as it is, is because I've seen jets on maneuvers before, and while I've watched military jets reach 500-700kph, this was easily two to three times the speed I've ever seen any military craft so at the same altitude.  By comparison, those jets I've se! en were crawling. For a view of the location, enter these coordinates into Google earth.  I was West bound on this stretch of highway, and you can't miss the mountain directly ahead that I refer to. 49.143181,-116.225440   There was something which happened the night prior to this, but that's somewhat not as reliable or as noteworthy as the bulk of the story which I just related.  If you'd like me to expand on that or any other portion, I can do so if there's interest. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Once you leave Andover, it is nothing but darkness on the roads.  Outside of Augusta about five minutes, there is an airport.  Anyways, as I was driving, I was talking to my friend on the phone.  The Kansas sky was dark like every other day.  It was as clear as could be that night and there was not a cloud in the sky.   As I was getting close to the airport, I seen this big, white light in the sky.  I did not think much because I knew planes were flying at this time.  But as I was looking closer at it, I realized that this object or orbs that I had see! n was not a plane at all.  A big light slowly appeared.  Then another one would appear in front of it.  Then, the orb in the back would slowly diminish and appear in the front of the other one.  It did this about three times as it went across the sky and then it completely went away.  I knew it wasn’t a plane because planes are required to have red and green lights on them.  This had no lights period.  It was just a big light. It is hard to describe.   Anyways, about a minute later, the light appeared back in the same exact spot it went off.  Now, planes don’t disappear in mid air and then appear in the same exact spot.  The light did the same thing. There was a big light, then another one appear in front of that one.  The light behind would slowly disappear and then appear in front of the other.  I tried to capture it on video but I couldn’t because I was driving.   After about two times of appearing and disappearing, the lights disappeared for good.  It just vanished in thin air.  It didn’t speed away, just went off where I last seen it.  I was waiting for it to come back on because it did that before but it did not appear again.  Still till this day, people think I am crazy, but I know what I saw that night and it is something that I cannot describe.  I seen it with my own two eyes and I know for a fact that what I seen was not an aircraft at all.   I wish someone could give me some answers or explanations of what this could be.

At roughly 8:55pm, Friday, April 1st, 2016, I was standing in my backyard looking up at Polaris to the north and Orion to the S/SW, admiring the clear sky and beautiful weather of the evening.  Suddenly, I noticed a very bright and solid light originating from just to the right of the star Saiph, in the Orion constellation.  The direction of travel was S/SW to N/NE. It was travelling quickly enough to be thought of as a low flying plane, only there were no position or navigation lights or even a strobe light to be seen.  Just a perfectly solid bright white light that did not change in shape or luminosity as it changed its position in the sky.  There was no sound at all. Quite surprisingly, it looked as if the light was drifting ever so slightly to the east, in the same way a gliding bird might be moved by wind currents.  This took the object directly above me.  There it slightly paused for about 1 second as it changed direction and moved in a very straight line directly to the East.  I called my wife and we both watched the light, which continued to make no sound and show no other lighting other than the constant bright white light, until it got smaller and smaller and disappeared into the distance. About 10 minutes later, I returned to the backyard with my Sony A7000 fitted with a 55-210 zoom lens, set to maximum zoom.  Within one minute I saw a faint object flying directly South to North, exactly from where the original sighting began by Orion.  I recorded video as I watched the dim object suddenly grow in brightness (and apparent size, but hard to know if this was just a function the increased glow).  The object was constantly in and out of focus, as the Autofocus struggled to keep up. Again, about 10 minutes later, I returned to the backyard…this time with the camera set to manual infinity focus…and I saw a small faint object moving from the North/Northeast toward the Southeast.  I started recording and called my wife to come back out.  I had no tripod with me.  The object all but disappeared and had been blindly pointing the camera, by hand, at the blank sky where I had roughly last seen it…when suddenly, it flashed in brightness and we could see it rapidly “expand” and “contract” after each flash.  Most flashes were very bright, but others were more subtle and undulating.  This did not last long. Perhaps one minute.  This last sighting occurred in the same portion of sky that the initial object had disappeared in to.  I continued to watch and record the sky, but it never flashed again, and I saw no other objects in any other portion of the sky. I have video of the last two sightings.  The last sighting is the best quality due to the manual infinity focus, but they both lacked a tripod so it is unfortunately very shaky.",2016-04-15T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

Reardan Grain Growers Elevators are located straight ahead of us on the right of Highway 2 and we were about 4 city blocks east of the elevators.  The white orb wobbled and seemed almost even with the silhouette of the elevators.  Then shot directly straight down and disappeared.   Startled at what we saw, we took a right and drove around the elevators near the railroad tracks and saw nor heard anything.  When we went back onto Highway 2 to continue west, we saw several cars pulled over on the side of the road.  The driver was talking to the other driver.  We wished we had pulled over and asked if they had seen what we saw but we were in such confusion that it was hard to wrap our brain around it. What was most unusual about this experience was the size of the white orb, how close it was to us, how fast it moved straight down and how silent the whole experience was.

This is more of an experience with the occupants of a craft than a sighting of the craft itself. I became conscious from sleep but was paralyzed completely.  I could feel pressure all over my physical body as if I were being held in place and held down, even on a molecular level. There was a sound all around that was reminiscent of the sound a babies heart makes in its mother's womb... very loud in my ears and it was externally audible.  It felt like my life force was being sucked up, and In my mind's eye I saw 3 figures sitting above me and siphoning my energy somehow.  I became very angry that my free will had been attacked.  I willed myself to fend them off by saying over and over that they had no right and they would be blown to oblivion. (prayer did not help at all, it was only when I made it known that I was the ONLY authority over myself that they stopped and ran away)  All of a sudden, my eyes clicked open and the pressure was relieved.  But then there were heavy footsteps on my roof and the doors of my armoire flew open and some items flew out of it onto the floor.  I heard noise in the tree outside my widow and I went to look outside to see 3 figures heading in the direction of Main street (I lived across from St Margaret's church at the time). Needless to say I was freaked out and could not sleep anymore that night. My brother lived across from Bel Air High School on Heigh and Kenmore and was also paralyzed that night.  The difference in his experience is that his friends broke his door down so they could all go see the ""UFO"" that was over the school.  My brother told me he was paralyzed and could not respond to his friends at the door, who then became alarmed enough to bust it open.  When they enetered his apartment he was able to move again.  They all ran outdoors to see the ship/craft/ufo. The next day I had bruises on my legs and back which were not there the day before and also some small scars on my ankles that had not been there before. I realize this happened 26 years ago.  But I will never forget the feeling and the experience with these beings.  Of course being in between 2 military bases, Bel Air is a perfect place for things like this to happen.

A friend taking me for a drive in a newly purchased car, around the city of Sarnia, revealed  an unusual event.  The sky was nearly cloudless and bright blue at roughly 9pm.   Upon re-entering the city limits, an object flying low, about 500ft, was shining like a mirror as it came directly overhead of us.  My friend and I both wondered what it was and I suggested he stop the car, for a better look.  As we pulled off the road its speed was most noticeable.  I have seen ‘air shows’ and supersonic jets up close, this ‘silver surfer’ was amazingly fast.  A clear to view, pointed cigar shape went streaming bye with no sound but left a con-trail resembling ‘donuts on a rope’ at an even lower altitude from where it came.  The ‘mirror like’ ufo was slightly smaller than an F-16 in length. 	As my friend and I debated what it was, it reflected the setting suns bright pink coloring.  A perfect reflection, as it traveled NNE into darkness, east of Lake Huron.  We suddenly noticed two jet trails coming from Michigan which curved upward like bull horns, from the ground and headed directly over our heads, in a zig-zag pattern of pursuit.  The F-16 and F-15 were carrying weaponry under their wings clearly visible around 800 ft. OVER CANADIAN AIRSPACE. 	At the exact moment the 2 jets were audible, and directly above us, the F-15 broke formation and sped up in a straight pursuit path of the ufo (over country fields out of city). The jets moved like turtles compared to the ‘silver surfer’.  The ‘cigar shaped’ craft had left our view with such speed, it was only viewable for roughly 3 or 4 minutes.  However the jets took several minutes at their travel speed before leaving our view.  The event lasted about 10-15 min’s. 	This “ufo” had no wings, no tail, no windows, no markings, and no sound, yet it left a con-trail that appeared to be ‘sputtering out’ as low as 100ft from the ground.  We followed its con-trails direction of origin (about 1km) to the USA border, we then left the scene.  There were 2 visible con-trails tight together, leaving a series of uneven ‘mushroom puffs’ in its wake.  The ‘donuts on a rope’ contrails on ‘youtube’ appear identical.  However the con-trail appeared to be ‘stalling out’, leaving sections with no trail behind it, as though the ‘engines’ were being repeatedly shut ‘on’ and ‘off’, the entire time.  This was my first ufo sighting of 4 in total, in a 5 year period, each very different. As my friend and I joked of whether or not we were ‘at war’, I felt uneasy knowing 2 armed American fighter jets, were just scrambled from Michgan (Selfrige Air Force Base) and somehow had clearance to fly over Canada air space at the ‘drop of hat’ into the night sky that approached, only to disappear.  If 'they' had reason for such drastic actions in pursuit, to breach Canadian borders, someone (ie. a Canadian) must have given this order or allowed it.  The local papers said nothing about it.  A common occurrence in Sarnia, is to ignore everything that happens in Sarnia Aka Canadas Chemical Valley.  These are not ‘honest companies’ we have here, they’re 'trillionaires' who appear to produce nothing.  I see little activity compared to the scope and scale of this ‘Chemical industry’.  What are they working on?…..  One thing I’m sure of, that ‘silver surfer’ got a very close look at Michigan’s air force base and our chemical valley in 1 fly by.  Nothing stopped it.

These are the things in common with each time:   1)  Colder on the day then previous days. 2)  Not a time I would normally be outside - temps were in the 30's. 3)  Active meteor shower or northern lights at the time.",2016-06-10T00:00:00,44.2247,-95.2694

North of me a couple of miles ahead, I saw what looked like a bright star but it was too early for stars to be that bright in the north.  The sun had set, but the sky was still bright in the west.  As I got closer, I noticed that the light wasn't moving in any direction.  It wasn't blinking like a tower or a plane is required to do because of air traffic.  Then I saw that it was actually two lights right next to each other. I passed it at the intersection of Rt. 45 and Wheat Ave.  There was a line of trees for a distance before I got to that intersection and I struggled to see the lights until I passed the trees almost at the intersection.  The lights were at least 300-400 feet up in the air by my best estimate.  About as high as a tall tower, or wind turbine maybe higher, but not much. They were several feet apart from each other.  My windows were down, I was driving about 40 mph and there was no wind.  It was dead calm other than the wind from my driving and I heard nothing.  No engine noise, no rotor thumping.  And the lights were not moving, nor was there anything blinking. I drove back by the same spot at 8:45-8:50 pm and the lights were gone.   When I got home, I wrote up what I saw and posted on Facebook and a friend of mine said her son saw the same thing about 8:45 as they were also driving north.  He said the lights suddenly ‘took off’ were the words he used, towards Champaign, IL to the south.  When I asked how fast, she said it was pretty quick, because he lost track of it quickly.",2016-08-25T00:00:00,40.3118,-88.1467

At 5:30 AM this morning, I was in my garden with my dog, when I looked up to see a bright red orb moving at great speed. It came to a quick stop, hovered and stayed in the same spot.  It looked to be maybe a mile away but was very distinct in shape and no gas trail or anything surrounding it or following it when it moved. I was unsure what I was witnessing, so I shouted out to my wife to come outside. We then saw the orb move in a straight line to the left,it was moving not as fast as when it first came into view,it then moved quickly to the right,then changed from a bright red glow to a bright white glow then back to red. It then moved left again,and then right,it continued moving right, hovered and then continued as it went out of view. I know some very smart women, and my wife is right up with the best of them. She is a professional lady who has been in high position within her company for several years. When she told me that she had never seen anything move like that in her life, I knew I wasn't crazy!  I myself have never seen anything move as fast,and then stop so quickly in my life. It made no noise whatsoever,but the thing that amazed me is the immediate stopping and acceleration it did.  From a stand still, just hovering, to zipping across in one direction then stopping like it hit a wall, then zipping back in the other direction, multiple times, is impossible to believe.

We were driving towards Whitehall, NY, at the time we saw it we were just outside Whitehall.  I'd say 5 miles or less.   So, I was just driving along, when at the above stated time out of my left side view looking out the windshield of my car I saw a streak of light.  That at first glance looked like a shooting star.  It didn't take me long to realize that that was not what I was looking at.  There was something about the way it was moving that made me look again a little deeper.   Now for context this whole thing lasted just seconds but, you know when you spot something.  Out of the corner of your eye that actually inside you peripheral far enough were you get a good enough look at it.  To the point that I'm driving forward focused on the road but can see the light moving in to my course of vision. that's what happened.  So, I saw this light and it registers after just a second this is peculiar.   So now is when I shift my view or focus out that side of the windshield to actually see this light that was acting funny.. so, this light moves into view, the first thing that didn't jive was the speed at which it was moving.  Much too slow to be a shooting star.  Then, I noticed the streak of light was thicker than it would be if it were a shooting star.  Then, of course, i saw a shape in front of the streak.  This is the hardest thing to describe I can't remember a shape per se as much as the color which was the same bright, white light as the streak but separate from it.  (if I had to say a shape it would be oval or tear drop shaped) so now, the streak came in to view streaked for a few seconds as if slowing down cause then it paused (or stopped dead) for a moment.  This is when I new we had just seen something extraordinary.   The following thing that happened was a flash of light and it vanished. It shot off in some direction so fast I couldn't even see it. and that's when I turned ! to my wi fe and said what the hell was that!?  Did you see that?

I witnessed a bright object that resembled a satellite crossing the sky at a high rate of speed at a very high altitude.  The object suddenly came to a complete stop before scooting off and stopping again in sudden short bursts.  It made several sudden 90 degree turns and twists as it continued to move in short bursts of speed.  It then stopped the erratic movements and sped off at a very high speed across the sky and out of site.

We saw something in the sky we cannot explain.  Started lower than a plane and was definitely on fire.  Moved steadily across our field of view.  Within minutes, it rose and ultimately went completely out of sight. Way too big and fast to be a paper lantern gone awry.  And it moved up, not down, so also not a meteor or anything falling to Earth. My 11 year old son saw it from the couch and pointed it out.  I couldn't see it because of the glare of the inside lights.  He ran to the slider and we went to the balcony.  We live on the open water of Tampa Bay, so we have an unobstructed view of a large area of sky. I yelled to my husband upstairs to look out the window in the sky.  He came downstairs and by then it was already out of sight of our balcony, around the building, but still low.  We all rushed downstairs and out the front door and by then it was already high enough to see over our 3 story building.  Hubby was also puzzled and ran between the buildings to get a better look.  By the time we got there it was really high.  Within 5-10 seconds it had completely disappeared out of sight, moving away and up from us until it was too small to see it, totally gone. It seemed slow passing the house but at the end it had to really be booking to disappear that quickly. It actually freaked son out quite a bit.  His little heart was pounding.  I posted on Facebook directly afterwards and someone recommended I put it on here.",2016-07-15T00:00:00,28.0444,-82.6795

Tonight, 07/17/16, at 8 PM, I walked out onto my porch and sat down on the steps.  The sky was clear, and the only thing in the sky was an airplane with its small contrail about 45 degrees up (halfway), heading on down southwest, as is usual for planes bound for the Memphis airport.   A couple minutes later I got up and walked a few steps in my back yard.  For whatever reason I looked back up in the sky and to my amazement saw a glowing orb of light about halfway up more due west.  That first plane was a bit more south of west when I saw it.  This orb was a yellowish-white in color.  Its size was that of somewhat larger than what the planet Venus looks like in the night sky when it is the closet.  Also, I spotted another airplane a bit more north of west with its small contrail also headed in what I assumed was toward the Memphis airport direction.  This plane seemed headed for this orb, and the orb seemed to move a little going toward the plane.  In my line of sight, I ! was fearful they would collide.  However, the plane never veered off course and went right on. So that tells me they were not near each other; it was just my viewing of it.  The time was about 8:06 PM. I immediately ran into the house to get my binoculars (7X50).  But when I returned nothing was in the sky.  I am very familiar with those things that could make a similar flare of light, but those seem to last longer.  This appeared in those seconds after I saw the first plane and disappeared when that second plane was on away in its path.   Background on me is that I am a 58 year-old female with a BS degree, major in biology and minor in physics.  I consider myself an amateur astronomer, having taken astronomy in college also. I have always had a fascination with the sky, solar system, the universe all my life.

The building was three stories high and we climbed up there to look at the stars and talk about guy stuff.  It was an unusually warm April night so we decided to stay out late and relax a little and enjoy the night. I was the only one who actually saw the craft, as I was the first one up on the roof and subsequently the first one to lie down and look up.  It was an extremely clear night and as I laid their waiting for my buddies to catch up I noticed three stars making out a perfect triangle.  At first I thought nothing of it as my eyes adjusted to the enormous amount of stars in front of me, but suddenly (and silently) all three stars making up the triangle began to move at an accelerated pace. My first reaction was “wow, that plane is flying really low.”  But I immediately realized it was making no sound and there was absolutely no way this was an airplane.  Within the span of no more than four second, the three starts making up the perfect equilateral triangle had moved from the eastern half of the night sky, directly over me, and then into the western half, vanishing simultaneously before ever reaching the western horizon. Over the span of four seconds, three stars, equidistant apart, moved across the entire night sky simultaneously before disappearing instantaneously into the night sky.

I watch sober. Almost every night, a large orange orb in the sky that is located above Craven road off Sunbeam Road in Jacksonville, Florida.  A planet does not move at will nor do stars while this orb does.  I looked at it one night and thought to myself, if this thing is satanic, evil, it has to do what I say, as that is what the bible says.  So, I looked at and “thought clearly”, “Move away from me if you are evil. “Here’s the weird thing; It did just that. It has two orbs below it that blink constantly.  One blinks dark blue and light blue and the other blinks red, white and green.  The red white and green orb has actually moved on its own, much like a drone, but there are no drones that look like it.  This orb has a saucer shape but you can only see an outline as if it is covered in camouflage paint, it blends with the night sky.  Again, there are no drones that are like this.  It is the size of a very large helicopter but completely quiet, not even a whistle sound like a drone would make. They seem very curious about the people in the apartment complexes on Sunbeam Road for some reason as well.  I have observed a figure with only an outline walking by one of the buildings that looked too skinny and small to be a human. Shaped like a grey but, with a smaller head, barely visible.  These orbs seem to enjoy being near the hill located by Sunbeam Road across from the veterinarian hospital but they have moved location, sometimes sitting above the post office in front of the trees.   There is also an isosceles Triangle located above Sunbeam Road that changes locations quite often and has an odd rounded shape at the bottom. I get a very creepy feeling when I look at it, almost like someone is staring at me.  I have made the attempt to create a drone to fly towards the red, white and green orb, I call it Italy, but, I am stuck trying to figure out a good power source to fly that far.  I also do not want it to destroy or take my drone nor assume it to be a hostile attack.

I was walking my dogs on Sunday May 8, 2016, (Clear night with no clouds), when I saw a small flash in the sky just below a star.  I initially thought it was a plane because of the way a plane’s lights blink when flying in the night sky.  However, the flash did immediately occur again.   I continued to gaze in the same direction when about 30 seconds later, I saw a light flash again in the “same spot”.  I thought this was a bit strange.  So I took out my iphone and began to video tape the area I saw this light.  Unfortunately, the iphone camera isn’t the best, especially at night and the distance this thing was.  The light was far away (I think) as you can see on the video.  I filmed for about 4 minutes and then contemplated going back to my house to get a video camera.  I continued to watch and it continued to blink every 30-40 seconds (an estimate) in the same spot.  The light was definitely different from the light from the stars.  I decided to film again with! the iphone and the same occurrence was seen.  It was really strange.  I was pretty excited.  I decided to get home to drop the dogs off and to find my video camera.  I found it, but no battery charge.  I walked back outside to watch again, but I no longer saw the light. When I played the video for the first time, I didn’t even see the light on the camera, even though you can hear me stating “there it goes again”.  I decided to slow the video down with imovie.  In a dark room and watching the video in slomo, you can see the flash of light, but to my surprise, there were other lights that blinked on and then off right after the other one.  Really weird.  I have also zoomed in on the flash of light and it’s completed different from the light zoomed in on a star.  It looks triangular.   I can send the video, because I’m sure you have better software to zoom in, brighten, and slow the video down.  If I had the software I would do this.

These craft seemed very high altitude since planes passed near them and were obviously well underneath the UFO swarm.   The UFO fleet appeared to be made of craft that were somewhat round and seemed to either reflect white light or create their own white light.  Individually, they appeared like points of white light in the clear, bright-blue, early-afternoon, southern California sky.   Also, some of crafts appeared to be larger and brighter than others.  One of the larger craft was observed emitting a smaller/dimmer craft.  Some of the smaller/dimmer craft were in tight formations and created geometric patterns like the three corners of triangles or triangles with an exact center light.   Over about 30 minutes the fleet drifted from the eastern sky towards the West.  The fleet expanded and some ! witness claimed they saw some of them suddenly disappear.

I was driving and my friend was a passenger. I saw them first.  Just before I past the navasota livestock auctionhouse, I noticed a flash in the sky.  It was quick.  At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but then I saw one again in a different area.  I asked my friend if he saw them and he said no.  After a few seconds though, I was able to get him to see what I was seeing.  It was a small white light.  It was as if someone from up high in a mountain was signaling down with a mirror, but there was nothing but bright blue clear sky behind it.  The light would last less than 10 seconds and disappear, then reappear in another spot in the same general area.  They never reappeared in the same spot twice. Sometimes, I felt like I could kinda start to make out something physical attached to the light, but as soon as my eyes would adjust to what I was looking at,  It would blink off again.  It was too! far away for me to make out any details other than the light.  At first I thought they were airplanes but there were so many so close together, I was convinced that the faa would never let that happen.  Then I though it could have been radio towers, but then I noticed a radio tower underneath them and could clearly see that they were easily 5-10x higher than the towers below.  There were no red or green indicator lights that aircraft should have.  After my friend and I exhausted all conceivable possibilities of what it could be, we decided to pull into annie's gas station and get a video.  From annies we could get a better view of them.  I could tell from that location that it seemed like they were originating from south over the Prarieview/Hempstead area.  I was able to catch at least 10+ of these flashes on viedo.

We were coming back from a concert at one in the morning.  As we came into the valley out of a canyon; we could see a light flashing above Utah State University’s experiment farm in the distant.  I asked my friend who was driving “what is that?”  At first he said that it was the radio tower, I told him it was the wrong side of the highway.  Then he said it was a plane but I stated that it wasn’t moving.  So then he said that it was a helicopter and I said that it wasn’t making any noise so he asked what is was and I said was a UFO.  As we got closer, it looked like a submarine in the sky.  It didn’t reflect light. You could tell where it was by what it blacked out in the sky.  In the center of the craft was what looked like a conning tower, like that of a sub.  But on the bottom there was a ring, in which two lights went around. They looked like laser or diode lights.  One was blue the other was red, almost like cop lights.  One would go around the ring until it wo! uld hit the other light then stop.  The other light proceed to do the same until it hit the other light then both would go until they would meet and the process would start over.  On the very bottom there were two more lights.  A strobe light, like what you see on any plane, but probably had it so it would not get hit by one of our planes.  I don’t know just guessing.  The other light was like an incandescent, it put out light that you would see coming off regular soft white lamp.  This light I think it was a camera that was filming the two guys working on tractor in the middle of the night.  The light from the camera was the only light that reflected off the craft and it was a small area.  The craft seemed to be interested in the universities two men working on the tractor. It was hovering about 200ft above the tractor not making any sound. The men didn’t seem to be aware or act like the craft was above them.  This was just about 50ft from the highway where we were driving.  It was about the length of a semi trailer.  As we passed I told ! my frien d to stop because we had just seen a UFO but he kept driving.  I kept looking back and got mad because he wasn’t stopping.  When  I finally looked towards where we were going I looked ahead and saw what I thought was another one hovering right in front of us, and I yelled, “there’s one there”.  To my chagrin it was a milk tanker all stainless steel with lights around it parked looking at the original UFO we saw.   We went back to my apartment and got on my roof with a spotting scope and pointed it toward the where the UFO was.  But it was too far away to see it. The reason I am telling this that the next Sunday a week later I was awaken by what sounded like thunder or a sonic boom.  Then it started to rain about as hard as I had ever experienced.   I was sleeping about 4ft from the window and it still splashed on my face. It didn’t wake me up completely at first. But then I noticed that all of sudden the rain around my apartment stopped but I could still hear the rain elsewhere.! I also remember seeing flashes of light which I thought were lightning, but I didn’t hear the thunder. Then I drifted off to sleep and the rain started up again and that was that, so I thought. Three days later my neighbor comes up and tells me what had happened. He said that he came outside to watch the storm from his porch. He said when the rain stopped above my apartment it was still raining around us but not where I was, above my apartment appeared those same red and blue lights and they hovered as close to my roof as it could get but a power pole and a willow tree prevented it from going lower. He said it hovered for about ten minutes and slowly drifted away towards a school a block away. He said it took him three days to get the courage to tell me. The willow tree branch that stopped them turned yellow and the leaves died, the next few years the leaves on that branch turned yellow and wouldn’t go green.   A few months later, coming down from the mountains from elk hunting we see this light in a low lying cloud, it was flashing.  ! When we got on the other side of the cloud where the flashing was coming from, we saw a UFO.  We all pile out of the truck and start looking at it. It was about a thousand feet off the ground just hovering.  I get out the binoculars and take a good long look at it and I see seven more above it in a V formation.  I was the only one who could see them because of the binoculars. Well the craft which looked like a hubcap, slowly rose about 1000ft then took off slowly to the southwest towards the Powder mountain ski area.",2016-04-29T00:00:00,41.74376212121212,-111.82852424242424

I was driving northeast on SC 277 approaching the Fontaine Road overpass when my attention was distracted by a light overhead, shining through my open sunroof. My first impression was of a jet airliner in trouble; the object was far too low and moving too slowly, and was in an unusual location for a large plane.  I could see no navigation lights (i.e., no belly strobe, tail strobe, wing marker lights nor landing lights) and the tail area was lit by a fairly bright, large gaseous prominence, which I thought at the time was a tail engine on fire.  As I watched it, I continued driving, perhaps erratically, and tried to understand what I was watching. The more I studied it, the less it made sense.  Although my mind persistently tried to turn the object into an airplane, the actual appearance of the object defied explanation.  It was moving roughly northeast parallel to SC 277 in the same direction I was driving.  I estimated that it was at an altitude of approximately 5000 feet, judging from its size and the fact that it was passing through some stratus clouds.  It seemed to be traveling at about 200 mph, since it was leaving my car behind, and it appeared to be moving at about the same speed as a jet airliner approaching an airport runway. Clearly some kind of aircraft, the object was visible as a darker silhouette against the night sky, and the only visible lights were the tail prominence, like a jet fighter's afterburner exhaust, but white, yellow, and orange instead of blue; or like a rocket's exhaust, without the steam and smoke they produce; and a row of small, faint, white lights along the length of the aircraft.  These lights may have been windows lit from inside the aircraft.  The lights were faint as dim stars, and I had to look slightly away from them to see them clearly.  The aircraft appeared to be about the size of a jet airliner (if it was higher than my estimate, it was big), and seemed to cause a thin mist or fog to form around it, as if it were very cold.  It was shaped like an airplane's fuselage, but in spite of my intense study, I could discern neither a tail stabilizer nor any wings.   I watched for the wings to eclipse stars passing behind it, but none did.  It also made no noticeable sou! nd above the sound of my car's engine and the wind noise; an aircraft would have been audible at that altitude.  I watched this object for about two minutes and ultimately lost sight of it ahead of me.  The last view I saw was of a dull orange glowing dot above the northeast horizon.  While I was approaching the I-20 overpass and checking for merging traffic, I lost sight of the orange dot.  It was traveling in the approximate direction of Camden, where someone undoubtedly saw it.  I have read that the object was observed near Pontiac at approximately 9:17 P.M.. This object was sighted earlier in the evening near Aiken, then later by residents near Lake Murray, according to The State Newspaper.  Apparently it maintained its course for at least 80 miles, and I observed no change in its speed or direction.  I have included a map of its extrapolated course based on the known sightings.  I do not have the time of the earliest sighting near Augusta, so I cannot calculate its speed.  The aircraft was very elegant, moved gracefully as a dirigible, but much faster, and it left a vapor trail behind it.  The glowing tail prominence extended behind the craft for about one third of its length, where the light from the beam ended abruptly in a rounded point.  Its vapor trail was visible by reflected city light. In hindsight I wish I had pulled over to the side of the road and used my binoculars to get a more detailed observation.  At the time I thought I was watching an airliner going down, and I wanted to see where it crashed so that I could report its location precisely.  I would like to have had a video camera in the car, but I probably would have forgotten to use it for the same reason. When I arrived home, I wanted to call someone and report what I had seen, but I could not decide whom to call.  Which authorities are responsible for receiving ""UFO"" reports?  I did not have any proof, and the object had already left the area.  I decided that I would hear about it on the news the next day, and since there was nothing more I could do, I prepared for bed.  Too excited to sleep, I called my mother and said ""Mom, I just saw a 'UFO',"" and laughed uncomfortably. The event was apparently traumatic for me, because when I awoke the next morning I had completely forgotten it.  I did not recall the event until four days later when my mother read to me over the phone an article in The State newspaper.  I had completely missed the many radio and television reports about the sightings. The descriptions given by witnesses to the event were obviously of the same object I had observed, but without any detail.  I am sure that dozens (hundreds?) of people must have seen the aircraft and I hoped I would hear more about it. I phoned The State newspaper and was told by an editor that they ""anticipated no further coverage until the next one.""  The only ""authority"" consulted by the newspaper reporter was a USC graduate student at Melton Observatory (who had not seen anything) and he guessed that ""it was probably a meteor.""  I have seen many meteors, but this object was not one of them. I spoke to a friend at the National Weather Service at the airport, and he said they received many calls during the event.  He checked with the control tower personnel and they reported nothing unusual.  I found it odd that when I contacted the airport's public relations office I was told that I was ""the first person who had contacted them about it.""  I have felt very uncomfortable when telling friends about my encounter, although I felt compelled to talk about it.  Most reacted with skepticism (as I would have), but they were patient and sympathetic.  Surprisingly, few have been curious enough to question me further, although this event was probably the most significant thing to occur in Columbia since the city surrendered to General Sherman.  I had always hoped that I would see a ""UFO"" someday, because I knew that I could dismiss it as an airplane, the planet Venus, or something ordinary.  I also thought that one had to be in some remote, unpopulated area, or at least be awake at some odd hour to see a ""UFO"", rather than in a major city at 9:15 in the evening! Some of my friends have tried to be helpful in explaining this event to me: my favorite theory is ""an experimental military aircraft,"" but who would fly an experimental aircraft over a densely populated city?  The F-15s and F-16s from area airbases seldom fly very close to Columbia, although one rarely crashes.  Why would an experimental (presumably secret) military aircraft be flown at twilight at an altitude and speed that would allow so many people to see, and possibly photograph it?  Why would anyone fly any aircraft without navigational lights or radar contact through the busy Charlotte to Columbia airline corridor?  I cannot help believing that the pilot of this aircraft must have known that her ship was being observed. I did not see any routine air traffic in the area during the event, and I do not know if this was an accident or by design.  I do know that the object was an aircraft of a type I have never seen or heard of before or since, except for two similar objects on video tape shown on television about two years after my sighting on one of the ""UFO"" programs: one was in daylight taped by a family preparing to depart on a vacation, the other was taped at night and only the familiar glowing, gaseous tail prominence appeared. At the time of my original writing of this record three weeks after the event, I had accepted that I will probably never know exactly how it flew,  the details of its structure, or who was flying it.  I still feel an indescribable joy and awe at having witnessed something so wonderful and significant.  I know that I shared this experience with many that night, and we all anonymously share a common experience that few can understand.  There is a lonely feeling even after years, which could be soothed only by discussing the incident with another witness.  I chatted by phone with another purported witness shortly after my article appeared in the Point, but he had not seen the same object that night, but a very different kind.  I received a call about a month later from a nice lady who had lost a half hour's memory on a drive to Charleston with a friend several months before, and wanted me to tell her that she had been abducted by aliens.  I assured her that it was unlikely, and! that if she did not remember such an event even vaguely, it was far more likely attributable to her friend's pleasant company than to alien interference.  However, I am no expert on these matters. I will not be terribly disappointed if this aircraft eventually turns out to be of contemporary terrestrial origin, but I really need to know the truth.  It is obvious that the device was created by an advanced technological society, most likely not our own.  It may be of extraterrestrial origin, or created by our terrestrial descendants, which would give me hope that we can survive these tempestuous times.  It may have been piloted by organic life forms or inorganic, artificial life forms.  It may have used an ionic engine to propel itself, or matter - antimatter annihilation and may have interfered directly with the earth's gravitational field.  It apparently had stealth capabilities which rendered it invisible to radar, and possibly could also be visually invisible, but this function was disabled briefly by design or malfunction. It was very large and may have been more than one hundred meters in length.  It was very beautiful for a device.",2016-04-29T00:00:00,34.02910563770795,-80.99284038817005

I was flying from Seoul, South Korea in July of 2007 to Beijing, China.  It was a stop over on the way to Canada.  I thought it was close to landing time or we were landing because I looked out the window and saw a massive cigar shaped object that was silver /metallic in colour.  It was odd because it wasn't moving.  It was staying completely still.  It was huge competed to the jet airliner and quite close.  Closer than I'd ever seen another airplane flying past.  And I have flown quite a bit so it struck me immediatey. Then I thought, well maybe we are landing and it's something in the city of Beijing.  But the captain made an announcement that we had about 200km left until we landed. I was in shock and started looking around to see if other people were noticing the strange sight.  I could barely speak to my friend in the next seat.  I manged to stammer out to look out the window now before the plane passes it completely.  He also saw it.  There was one aircraft (UFO) and was massive as I mentioned.  It had no wings, no lights and didn't appear to be moving at all which struck me as quite odd.  I've never seen anything like it before or after.  I really expected the people on the plane to all see and start a commotion but  no one did.

Sometime in June or July 2012.  It was a Sunday night. Around 10:30p.m. Travelling south on hwy 59. We had stopped to do some shopping in the town of Foley.  About ten miles from the ocean. Very near the intersection of hwy.59 and the Foley Beach Expressway. I was done shopping so I walked out to the car and was waiting for my wife to finish up inside. Just as I sit down in the car, I notice a large glowing redish orange diamond shape ufo descending quickly into a patch of woods sse across from hwy. 59 about 350 yards away.  (It had to of been at least 50' across and maybe 15' high at the center.) I could no longer see the diamond shape, but I could see the orange glow through the trees and brush. Just then my wife opened the car door. Startling me. I pointed across the hwy. She immediately said ""what is that? A fire?"" I had rolled down my window and could not hear anything. Two northbound vehicles went by at about this same time. I never saw brake lights on them. We watched the glow for a minute before my wife started recording on her cell phone. About a minute into recording the glow, the craft slowly rose up into view. As it began moving east over the tree tops it accelerated quickly and was gone. We were both astonished at what we had just witnessed.  There was a service road leading along hwy.59 that we took out of the parking lot.  We were creeping along on it, looking in the direction of where we had seen the craft land. There was no traffic on the highway, so we were just kind of sitting there on the service street. We were starting to continue on our way since nothing was happening. Then I heard the distinct sound of a rifle from the wooded lot.  (Now directly across from the hwy from our position.) Then another shot. A few seconds, later my wife gasped and I looked at her. She was staring (mouth open) about 50 yards down and across the highway. When I looked I saw two, very large men dressed in all black, sprinting across hwy. 59 to the south and west. We were both now almost in shock when all of a sudden another man came running out of the wooded lot, right in front of our headlights.  Directly across the hwy. from is.  Again from the east side of hwy.59. carrying a rifle.  He took one look at me sitting there, looking at him and yelled ""get the hell out of here!"" before proceeding at a dead run west across 59. My wife started yelling, telling me to go! The last man was across the hwy. and running down it to the south. We had pulled out onto the highway (we were both very scared at this time) and was maybe a hundred feet away from the last man. My wife gasped again as she said she saw ( I was driving) a large limb strike the man with the rifle, running south beside hwy. 59, knocking him into the highway and literally knocking the rifle out of his hands. We were luckily in the other lane of hwy. 59  My wife said stop and rolled down her window as we cautiously approached the man trying to get up. The road was still empty. There was another large wooded area here on the west side of the hwy. just south of the business we had just left. She asked him if he was alright. He was breathing hard and still trying to recover from the ground. He said yeah. Then he asked us if we saw it? (We don't know if the man was referring to the other two men or the ufo.) My wife said yes, and asked if he was sure he was ok. He said yea. I asked him if he wanted us to call 911 for him? He laughed and said ""if you want to go ahead"" grabbed up his rifle, removed the limb from the road, turned around and noticeably limped off going back east across the highway from where he had come. It was so surrealistic. Lasting maybe 4 or 5min. One other thing. To this day my wife swears the first two men we saw running out of the wooded lot crossing hwy.59 were ""at least ten feet tall."" She saw them first and got a better look than me. She said the man with the rifle was a big man.  Six foot or so.  She said the two, it appeared he was chasing were at least three or four feet taller than him. The video we shot was Very poor due to very bad timming (she had just turned the video off when the first two men came running out of the woods) and a well lit business next to the lot. As well as billboard lighting close by. And just the excitment catching us up. We both agree on everything except the size of the first two men. They were big guys. I just don't think they were as big as my wife thinks they were. We both agreed to never talk about this again after sharing the story with two other friends of ours from church. I am curious though if the two other cars that went by that night going north may have saw the ufo. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I normally look outside my window to see how the weather looks.  I immediately notice a disc like object behind the tree line. It had a dull, pulsating glow and did not move at first. I ignored the object at first thinking it was a street light or possible star.  I came back a few minutes later and looked out the window and noticed the object moved closer and literally frightened me.   I woke my wife out of her sleep to show her what I was seeing and she was confused and said,""what the hell is that""?  I told her a UFO or something.  I ask her to keep watching and let me know if it moves again as I ran to get the video camera.  I open the window wide to try to get a clear view of the object and began recording.  The object immediately began moving rapidly from left to right.  That frightened my wife and she ran back into the room and ask me to get away from the window.  I was amazed w! hat this thing was doing and I strongly believe it knew we were watching it.  What shocked me is it somehow disturbed my camera and shut it down.  So I pulled out my cellphone began recording and grabbed a flash light thinking I can draw it's attention.  The object stopped, became brighter than its dull appearance and slowly reversed backwards.  I called individuals and was transferred to other individuals and I explained what I was witnessing and if they are picking this object up on radar.  They told me they have no knowledge of anything unusual going on in that area.  They ask if I would leave my name and number and I told them I don't think so and discontinued our conversation.  I wanted a closer look and wanted to go outside to see if what we where witnessing was something extraterrestrial.  My wife demanded me not to go outside saying that we don't know what that thing may do.  Ignoring her demand, I open the door and went to the yard near the tree line and the object shot backwards and was instantly gone.  Later that day I tried telling my co workers and all they did was joke and laugh.  I even showed them what I recorded but it was hard to see or really tell cause the light was dense but, you can see the object's movement.

Summer night.  Red/green blinking light.  No wind.  No sound from object.  Slowly began to move and slowly fly away. Hello. I just wanted to share my story with you.  This happened a long time ago.  I think it was 1985.  I was probably 17 at the time.  I am from a small town in North Dakota called Belfield.  It is in Stark County.   One weekend night I was in a car with a friend.  His brother and my sister were in a car behind us, and there was another car with two people from our town behind them.  So, there were six people that saw this.   We were driving out in the country somewhere south of Belfield, probably about 10pm, and we were looking for a person’s farm, who was having a party.  Outdoor parties were common for us back then.   We were in the lead car and I saw a red and green or red and blue light blinking in the sky.  It just seemed out of place, and the lights were separate not together.  I pointed it out to my friend driving, and he saw it.   We decided we needed to pull over and talk to the others behind us because we did not know how to find this party.  We pulled over and stopped.  Now, we were not on a highway, but on a dirt country road.  We got out and we were almost right underneath these blinking lights.  It was not very high, maybe a hundred feet, but just high enough that we could not see the shape clearly, but it seemed to be 50 ft. wide, judging by the blinking light on each side.  I could be wrong about the size.  There was no radio tower or tall pole with lights on it nearby.  The weird thing is that it was a still summer night, no wind, and this thing was blinking above us, and we did not hear a sound.  No engine.  No propeller, etc., yet it was hovering.   I started waving at it, and I grabbed a flashlight out of the car, and started to flash the light at it.   After about a minute, or so, it began to slowly move kind of around us, and then continued to fly off across country to the south west at a slow rate of speed.   I will never forget that experience and have no idea what it could have been. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As prior MUFON Utah Asst. State Director I was hesitant to report this sighting, being my first credible Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) sighting but now the shoe is on the other foot. To set the stage right, my balcony looks east to the Wasatch Front.  To the north Ben Lomond, Mt Ogden is directly East from my balcony, and then you can see southeast beyond the radar towers on Francis Peak.  My home is right on the flight pattern of Ogden Airport (1/3 mile), Hill Air Force Base (3 Miles), and Salt Lake City Intl. (20 Miles), all as the crow flies. So lights in the sky has been has been a part of my life for nearly 44 years. On 03/11/2016, I woke up at 0505, walked over to the sliding glass door of the dining room, poked my head through the curtains and saw a light 1000 ft. above Mt. Ogden (9505 elevation) at Azimuth 40 degrees N41E.  I first saw Arcturus, and then saw another light off to the left of it, moving slowly up and then NW which triggered my instincts...quite unusual at this time of the morning.  It flashed a brilliant white a couple times and then flashed  a brilliant red.  I knew right away that was not normal.  It then moved upward slowly but noticeably and then very slowly headed WNW toward Ogden.  By this time it has really caught my attention.   I had to put both hands up to the glass door and face to block out the surrounding light on the glass from inside.  The light would flash randomly 2-3 times a pure clean white light in comparison to a strobe light effect and then randomly a pure clean red flash would happen.  The lights were completely independent from of other.  With my 37 years around aircraft and working Safety in the government, this was not in the military inventory. I have always had all of my investigation gear next to the sliding door just in case something like this would occur I would be totally prepared. Unfortunately,  I had been out of town in Nephi the night before on a UAP investigation and had put all of my gear downstairs in the office.  So I hurried to turn off the home security alarm, went downstairs to grab my gear, headed back up to the balcony all along being away from the sighting for approximately one minute.  Fortunately, when I got back it was still there heading towards my westerly direction.  Then It started turned heading NW.   I immediately threw a few shots of my green laser light at its side with no response from the UAP. I could tell that the red flashing light was located below and a little forward of the white flashing light because at one time they flashed almost instantaneously. The UAP is now between Ogden Airport and I-15 heading NW.  Turning again and heading north, in less than 10 seconds you could see that it was starting to lose its flashing brilliance. It faded out and entered a gray misty cloud and completely disappeared into a portal.  The mist dissipated almost immediately following the UAP disappearance. The strangest thing is that this UAP had no outline, structure, and no sound.  It was just the movement and brilliant lights that gave it intelligence.  Had this been a plane you would have seen it still flying out at a much further distance with the lights flashing off of wing tips and tail section.  The other odd part of this sighting is that planes do not have a flight pattern coming straight over Mt. Ogden heading west toward the Ogden Airport and aircraft don't come down in this area doing a fly over at this time of morning. The speed of the object during this whole sighting was that of a small plane.  Ceiling was 10 miles, clear with no wind.  Total time start to finish was approximately 2 minutes or less.  Had this been during the summer with leaves on the trees, I would not have seen the UAP enter and disappear into the portal. There are many lessons for me here! I've played this scenario out in my head 100's of times in case I ever saw a UAP . Take a deep breath or three, always have binoculars/monocular, green laser, night vision, camera/cell phone fully charged and nearby. But the big lesson I learned...why didn't I just grab my phone 25 feet away. I may have had a chance to put it on film with something to show instead of just this witness report and telling my friends, “Well, I saw my first UAP”!  If a recording hadn't shown up on the phone, it would have at least shown that I gave my best shot for visual evidence.  I kick myself everyday saying, “Why did you do that!”  It happens occasionally with witnesses admitting it in their UAP Reports when you see your first UFO…your just not yourself. Remember though, "" Absence on evidence, isn't evidence on absence.""",2016-06-01T00:00:00,41.1787,-112.0493

They starting coming into my yard (about 8 of them) and were zooming from one side of the yard to the other, bouncing into my neighbor’s yard and then across mine again.  I could not believe what I was seeing and just continued to stare out the window.  One of the “things” starting coming straight toward my kitchen window.  It is like it noticed me standing there and came to a stop about 3 feet from the window and took off.  All the other objects left also.  Haven’t seen anything out back again.  However, on May 16 I started noticing lights in the sky in front of my house, across the road, etc.  They are bright white and sometimes reddish.  They ! flicker and change shape.  There are sometimes 4 or 5 and sometimes only 2 or 3, but there almost every night.   Last night, June 7, at about 11 p.m. there about 6 of them in the sky.  One of them zoomed down near the street lamp at the corner of my property and the light immediately went off.  I went to my living room and flipped on my porch lights and the street light immediately came back on, no flickers or anything.

On the 26th of May, 2016, I was driving from the town of Kaikoura to Blenheim on the north-east coast of New Zealand’s South Island.  Heading north on Hwy 1, approaching Lake Grassmere at about 19:45, I noticed a very bright light in the night sky over the range of hills just north of the lake.  The light seemed to be farther out behind the hills, likely over the Cook Strait.  Being somewhat colour blind, I am not sure of the colour of the light, could have been red or orange. I pulled over on the highway (41°44'05.0""S 174°07'43.2""E) to get a better look. It was suspicious as it was much brighter than any stars in the sky or aircraft for that matter.  At first, I wondered if it was the aircraft landing light on a plane taking off from Wellington airport, but it did not move up or down, just stationary. The light sat stationary over the hills for about 5-minutes until precisely 19:49.  It then dimmed to about 25% of its original luminescence, then moved off to the North at a rate of speed I would suggest being 2-3-times faster than normal air traffic in the area. Wellington airport is quite busy at this time, however the airport runway runs North-South, and was northeast to my position with aircraft taking off or landing in North or south direction.  The light was to my north-northeast, several degrees north of the light pollution given off by the city.  Checking some flight apps, I was not able to find a plane that would have been in that position at the time of sighting. It is worth mentioning that 20-min before the sighting, a 4.3 magnitude earthquake was registered in the Cook Strait, in the general area where I had witnessed the light.",2016-06-10T00:00:00,,

On the morning of June 1, I went for one of my weekly walks on Wednesday, and when I got into town, I was going to buy water and turn around and head home.  When I headed into the Harrington shopping center, I happened to glance up and see something odd. The object had pulsating blue, red, and yellow lights.  It was tumbling upward.  Not flying straight like an airplane or hovering like helicopter or drone.  It was tumbling in a way I’d never seen anything move before. I took a picture and a close up of it looks almost like a drone, but a later screen grab from my video has it looking like an orb with a light flashing on the side.  I don’t know what it is, and it really frightened me, so I wanted answers. I shared the video with friends and family.  Some say it was a drone.  The thing is, when I examined the video, there is a part where whatever it was “glitched” and it suddenly was somewhere else.  I didn’t see this with my naked eye at the time, only upon viewing the video.  I’ve never seen a drone move that fast.  Unless there was a problem with my phone during filming.  Anyway, this thing was tumbling and then it suddenly reversed until it was right over me. At that point, I stopped filming because I was startled. I live in a few miles an air base.  That does nothing to answer my questions because as I said, it looked like NOTHING I’d ever seen before.  Whether a civilian or military craft – and I see a lot of both on the regular.  This thing was tumbling, doing summersaults to rise higher in the sky.  I have simply never heard of any aircraft moving in that way to get from Point A to Point B and I just don’t know what to make of what I saw or filmed. Any help or answers would be appreciated.

Then 2 things caught my eye, an airplane (most likely a Cessna 402 ) and a dark red light in the shape of a Sharks Tooth with a single white light in the center.  The Airplane and UFO were in the same vicinity for about 15 seconds…it almost seemed like the Sharks Tooth was following the aircraft.  So the plane was approx. 2-3000 ft and climbing, whilst the Triangle was maybe 2-300 feet below the Airplane.   The Sharks Tooth suddenly accelerated and as the Twin Propeller airplane was climbing slowly, the Dark Red Triangle went from my 5 o’clock (counterclockwise) to my 10 o’clock in about 5 seconds and just disappeared into the early summer night.  And just like that it was gone, but that plane was still climbing, it was kind of funny.  So the craft was a triangle shape, but with long-sides ( k! inda like a sharks tooth).

I was also the director of Flight Standards for ((deleted--aviation entity)) and Chief Check Pilot for ((deleted)) yrs in addition to my 40 some years of flying in the Chicago area. The object appeared to be heading 270 degrees from our perspective, (right to left).  My wife and grandson also observed the object.  No aircraft are vectored into Midway from that direction (to tight of a turn on to the localizer). It was no aircraft, as when I first saw it I ruled out Mars, as it was too low in the sky and much brighter.  Then I did look for position lights, and saw none.   It was at that time I called my wife outside, as I our grandson was already outside with me.   We then observed it for about another 3 minutes when it got to approximately 10 degrees to the right of our house, it went straight up and disappeared.   Distance from out house approximately 1-2 miles.  Drivers eastbound on I-80 and northbound on I-55 would have seen it also. It was awsome.  Glad we were able to observe it.

I never used to believe in UFOs.  But a lot of my friends do and they've convinced me and I do believe it now, although I'm new to this, so please forgive me. I was on the way back from town with my dad, Mom and brother.  We had seen some Paragliders earlier while driving and they are common on the island, but the there were only one or two.   About half an hour later, out my window on the left, I noticed a long, white cylinder in the sky, almost identical to a plane. But it was plane white and had no markings of an airline.  I think it had wings and possibly a tail as a plane would but they they were difficult to work out so I can't be certain.  It also had one or two lights on the bottom in the center.  So I mistook it immediately just for a regular plane.  There is an airport on the island but it is nowhere near and this road was a long stretch surrounded by fields.   I pointed it out to my family as a plane.  But as we drove along the long road, it never moved.  It seemed to hover over the fields, it wasn't moving vertically as far as I could tell but was just stationary in the sky.  A plane wouldn't be capable of this so I quickly said it can't be a plane, because it was hovering and was too low and horizontal to be a plane.  My dad suggested it was a Paraglider, but they were all red or orange and curved, smaller and not at all like this, although white ones may exist I don't think it fitted the profile. We returned home and about 3 hours later, we went out to eat.  I'm on holiday, so I'm not really familiar with the surroundings so I couldn't tell you what road it was exactly by name, but I know where it is.  It was roughly 7pm (19:00), but I'm not sure of the exact time.  I was in the car with my brother and uncle, the rest of my family were in the car behind.  As we drove along the road, I was shocked to see it was still in the exact same position and this is when I realised it definitely wasn't a plane or Paraglider.  I pointed it out to them and they had a minimal response, probably because it didn't look that interesting.  I said it could be a UFO to see if they might tell me it was something they know of to discount that theory.  My uncle lives on the island and is interested in mechanics and engineering and if it had been something he knew of and could give me an explanation for, I'm almost certain he would've.  I had my phone in my hand and went to take a picture.  I zoomed in! and then couldn't find where I was so I zoomed out again but the object was gone.  I looked out the window and it had vanished. When we returned home, it was dark.  The island has little light pollution so there are many visible stars.  As we drove by, I was looking to perhaps see if it had returned but was doubtful I'd see anything because it was dark.  But driving by, there was a light, the size of a small star, lower and dimmer than all the other stars and in the same position (as far as I could tell in the dim light) as the craft had been.  This part of the sighting I can't confirm because it could've been a star for all I know, I'm not certain.  But I definitely saw it in the daylight. The next day, I asked my dad to take me back along the road and there was nothing in the sky.  I haven't seen it since when we've driven along the road but it was in the same position for at least 3 hours.",2016-08-04T00:00:00,,

The pier went south onto the lake and gave us a good look at what we thought were the planets Jupiter and Mars.   The night was perfect to see stars because there were no clouds in the sky and we were miles and miles away from the lights of a big city.   After a few minutes we turned our attention to following satellites slowly moving across the sky.  After following the path of a satellite, my son and I had both ended up looking into the northeastern part of the sky.   As we watched the satellite move, two illuminated objects came in, and out, of view moving at a high rate of speed from the east to the north.  One following exactly behind the other in a perfect line.  Both were the exact same size and shape. 10 times bigger than a star in the sky.  They were shaped like a triangle and seemed to be a yellow/! orange color around the edges.  Each object had perfectly straight sides.   Each object was bright enough to see but they did not light the entire sky up when they passed in and out of view.  It appeared to be more of a glow around them.   Each object came in and out of view within 1-1/2 seconds with 1 second between each object.  Neither object was in the sky at the same time but because I was still looking in the direction of where the first object moved I seemed to have a better view of the second object.   The objects were not directly above us but close enough that it appeared we were seeing the bottom of the objects.  The angle the objects were from us made them seemed like they had a flat bottom.   We stared into the sky for 15-20 minutes longer hoping to catch another look at what had passed over head but we didn’t see anything like that move across the sky again.",2016-08-02T00:00:00,45.9228,-89.4808

We had invited a couple over to have dinner and watch the neighborhood fireworks.  At 9:50 we walked down to our lower field so that trees wouldn't block our view.  After a few minutes I noticed an orange orb gliding across the sky.  All of the others noticed it and we watched trying to guess why it was acting odd.  I thought it might be a parachute from a firework that was on fire and drifting towards us.  As it got closer, we realized realized it wasn't on fire, so we thought it might be a drone.  The problem with that was it was starting to move faster towards our upper field and during a lull in the fireworks it was almost over head and there was no noise.  It was approximately 500 to 800 feet high. We ran to the upper field to watch as it went towards Enumclaw, gaining speed.  It had started from the direction of Orting.  Of course, no one thought of using their cell phones to take pictures.  We were standing around trying to guess what it was, when I noticed that another orb coming from the Sumner direction, heading towards Enumclaw again.  It was about 2 minutes after the first orb.  This time one of us thought to use a cell phone to video it.  Again it moved quietly and fast.  At that point I ran into the house and grabbed my iPad since the phone video didn't come out.  The color was consistently a red-orange with no variation in appearance.  There was no clear outline of structure.  The orbs were below the cloud layer and gained altitude as they headed towards Enumclaw.   3 of the 4 of us had been inspectors for Boeing, and one had been an air traffic controller, our facts are accurate.  We stood around for about 5 minutes scanning the sky.  To hell with fireworks!  Ten minutes later another orb appeared coming from the South Prairie area, heading  towards Enumclaw again.  This one was higher than the previous two.  I was able to get a very short video and several pictures as it came closer to us.  Another orb followed following the same path about 2-3 minutes later.  We stood around waiting and watching and finally gave up on seeing more.  About 50 minutes later, the ex controller spotted another orb, this time coming from the Wilkeson area and heading towards Enumclaw again.  This one was even higher, approx 3000 feet.  Another orb followed the same path about 2 minutes later.  By then, everyone was tired and the couple decided to head for home.  As we went inside to gather things up, my husband came and said we wouldn't believe what he saw.  Another orb had followed the last two at a slightly lower altitude.  The orb stopped and split into two orbs and went into the the cloud layer.  The first sightings started  from the Sumner direction, and ended coming from the Wilkeson area.   The locations are almost in a straight line and approx. 10 miles apart.  The closest air field is privately owned Connley Field in Buckley and there was no air traffic.  This was the best 4th we've had in a long time!",2016-07-08T00:00:00,47.1315,-122.0463

My husband and I were sitting outside on our apartment front porch when I saw a bright orange light coming from behind the trees northwest of us.  As it came from behind the trees it was obvious it was not a plane, drone, or helicopter because of the size, brightness and consistency of the light source, and also how low it was and how fast it was going.  The color of the orb was bright neon orange, and it did not look like head lights, or any other lights I have ever seen before, but it had a glow to it.   I got up and started video recording it, from our point of view it flew south towards the back of our apartment building, but was further past our apartment, then started going east then back south east.  In that process, the light dimmed a little bit then they dimmed even more and within a few seconds it disappeared.  When I say the object starting going different directions, I don’t mean sharp movements, but just slowly turning in those directions.  Also, besides the other factors I mentioned before about it not being a plane I could also tell it was different because of the way it flew it was obvious that the way it was never in seen in a perfect straight course line like planes are seen doing.  My husband as well as my neighbor, the whole incident lasted about a minute to a minute and 5 seconds long.   I do have a video that is 46 seconds long but because it was a cell phone recording you cannot see the orange glow.  If I am able to send please forgive the cussing I was very excited.

The objects spread apart and actually seemed to move in a horizontal plane, while blinking. The lights were on a non-repetitive pattern and of uneven strength. We managed to obtain both still photos and video of the objects, as the illumination was quite bright, especially the green spectrum.

Greetings,   I am writing this statement on an incident that occurred on 10 Jul 2016, at approximately 6:00pm.  This is not a hoax, I am not looking for publicity or any such attention.  I am not sure is what I saw was a legitimate sighting and I am more looking more for answers to help me understand if what I saw was an actual alien being.   So, my friend, her son, and I drove from San Diego to San Francisco for leisure on Friday to Sunday.  On our way back, we were driving on the I-5 Fwy Southbound, towards San Diego.  We were approximately 10 mins south of Los Banos.  The scenery outside was barren, no buildings, structures  or people, just dry grassy hills and dirt roads on the sides of the freeway.   I was actually trying to get some rest when my friend the driver said, “What is that?” and pointed to the right side of the road.  I immediately looked over and saw a tall figure about 6 feet tall in a thick black monk/death looking robe with a big hood.  Now this was very unusual to me since it was about 90 degrees outside and in the middle of nowhere.  Why would somebody be walking around dressed in a thick black hooded robe in this heat.   So as we passed it, I had to get a good look at this person's face, so when I looked at it, it looked back at me.  And what I saw chilled me to the bone.  In this dark heavy hooded robe was a being that looked nothing human.  It had brownish green scales with a short snout and its eyes were large and blackish that glistened in the sun.  It was unmistakable even at about 100 feet away and it looked right at me with no expression.   It wasn’t carrying anything or had any equipment with it and it was walking slow and awkward as if it were looking for something.   I was scared to death, especially when it looked right at me, I thought maybe we should pull over and confront this thing, but honestly I was frozen and we kept driving.  I had asked my friend if she had seen what I had seen and her 12 year old son in the back of the car and they verified the same thing.  Again, I just am looking to see if what I saw could be a reptilian and if that is what other people report seeing.   I really wish I would have pulled over and went back to get some evidence or a picture, but after reading some articles on reptilians, I feel I made a wise choice.  I read that there may be entrances to their habitats in rural areas that may be unseen or hidden from humans.  That may indicate that there may be a entrance by Los Banos off the I-5 fwy going south.  I am not sure if other vehicles traveling down the road with us witnessed this sighting but it did happen and I am willing to swear an oath on it.   I also had unusual experiences that happened when I was a child that I believe was contact with Grey Aliens which is foggy, but I have some clear recollection and memories of some incidences where I may have been abducted and my mother can vouch for that and has some insight on that.  But that is another subject.  This is the first time I have seen a being like this.  Again, I am reporting this to hopefully gain some help to determine if what I saw yesterday could have been the real deal.  And I respectfully ask for discreetness in this matter.  Thank you for your time and I hope you can help me. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness on two occasions, and we were impressed by his eloquence and apparent sincerity.  We suspect that he is a very good witness, and highly reliable.  We have invited his friend and her son to submit additional reports, and we have invited the source of this report to submit an illustration of what the face looked like.  He reports that the creature had a prominent snout, like that of a dog, and that it had scales on its skin.   The witness states that he was formerly a member of the U. S. military.

Quickly disappear. Sudden Appearance of Stripes on the Moon  On July 10, 2016 at 9:11 pm, I was taking pictures of the moon through my 6-inch Dobsonian telescope (Orion Skyquest).  I was using the afocal method, putting an Olympus SZ16 camera up to the eyepiece to photograph what I saw. I was not using my moon filter to dim the brightness of the moon.  (I used it later in the evening, but not at that point.)  I took a series of nine photographs of the moon at that point. I had taken an earlier series before photographing stars and planets, and a later series after photographing more stars and planets.  During this particular series, the striped moon appeared as number #6 of 9 photos at 21:11 and 42 seconds. As I was setting up photo #6 in the series, I had the moon in my sights which I checked by eye. Then I put the camera up against the eyepiece and adjusted it until the moon appeared fully on the LED screen.  I had my finger on the shutter button, when suddenly the top of the moon darkened as I watched.  Two dark spots appeared at the top of the moon, and then streaked at high speed from the top of the moon to the bottom of the moon, not quite the diameter because it was off center.  It left two shadowy stripes that appeared in less than a second. My finger was on the shutter button, I barely hesitated for a fraction of a second, and then I thought, “Branches.”  And then I took the picture. I then looked up at the sky.  The moon was high above the horizon in a clear field of vision. The trees in my backyard and neighboring yards were to the far left and right.  There were no branches obscuring the moon. I would know.  I have taken many artistic pictures of the moon behind branches. The view was clear. It occurred to me that a couple of my long, dark hairs floated through the open aperture of the telescope, which is like a cannon barrel, and landed on the mirror.  That would have been a problem for me with subsequent photos.  The best way to test the situation was to take another picture. Less than two mintues later, at 21:13, I took another picture of the moon.  It was clear.  When you compare the two pictures, you see that the striped moon has a dark area at the top, as if a cloud settled over it.  The stripes have a peculiar jagged aspect, almost like a zipper or a series of stitches. The diameter of the moon is 2158 miles.  The stripes sped across the moon off center. My guess is that the stripes covered about 1500 miles in barely a second.  Travelling at 1500 miles per second comes out to about 90,000 miles per hour. I showed the photo to my husband, who has a PhD in statistics and is very analytical. He said, “It's branches.”  When I discounted that theory, he said, “Two hairs in the aperture.”  I told him the hairs quickly disappeared, and hairs do not start at the top and zip across at high speed.  Then he said, half joking, “It's two spaceships flying at astronomical speed in formation.” I decided to report it. I am enclosing photo #6 in the series, the striped moon, and photo #7, which is the picture that was taken two minutes later. A Dobsonian refractor always shows a mirrored image, so the only post-processing I did was to flip the image so that the moon appears with the lit side on the right, which is how it actually looked in the sky. I know there is probably a logical explanation, but I can't think of one.",2016-07-15T00:00:00,,

The moon was only about half full at this point, but I could not identify a noise source and noticed the pulsing almost seemed to move across me - as of it was something tangible.  Seemed to be eminating from south of my location. This noise was almost intoxicating - I did not want to move.  I walked inside and about thirty minutes had past, but where the time went I do not know.  It felt like less than five minutes from when I woke up to coming back inside, but that was not the case. Upon entering my house my dog (she is a hearty boxer) started backing up very slowly and began a low growl.  I walked up to her and as soon as I touched her she was herself again.  I also have three cats that would not come out of my bedroom until days later. I woke up the next morning with what appeared to be one long hive stretching from my mid thigh all the way up to the back of my ribcage (right side) - I have never had 'hives' before, but I brushed it off - initially.  It has been almost a complete seven days since and the one big hive has not budged - not even itchy.  I can run my hands along it without even realizing I am doing so.  This is the most frightening experience out of the whole sha-bang. No craft was visible to me and I have not heard the pulsing noise since that night. I did bring my phone outside with me and thought I hit 'record' bc I remember hitting the 'stop' button upon entering my house again, but no video was recorded - no sight, no sound, and no time stamps. Ever since hearing this I have been on a mission to find others who might've heard this, as well.  My parents' live about two miles north of me and I asked them both if they had seen or heard anything odd that Tuesday night.  Both said no though my father did state the sky looked different that night than any other.  My father has been sailing the world for over forty years so for him to state this...  It means a lot to me. If anyone else in south Fl heard this, please make yourselves known. Thank you.",2016-05-20T00:00:00,26.70504529494382,-80.13514009831461

Anyhow, I thought it seemed too small to be landing, which it was in the path for Commercial landing, but was not big enough to be one, and was too high up...  Thought it very was strange, it didn't resemble any aircraft I have seen around, wasn't a helicopter, was smaller than some of the private planes I have seen, was similar to a cigar shape, but didn't get a long enough look to say...  I live off Military too, so the small private jets and planes path is over my house, and I usually see one daily, sometimes more..   As I drove further along, I noticed it had stopped and as soon as it stopped, it seemed to have flashed sunlight off of it, and then it was gone, totally just disappeared!  Nowhere in any direction..  I dropped my mouth, knowing I had just seen a UFO...

"Flashes of light outside tent, mechanical whirring noises, and extreme effect of heart rate of witnesses.",Grant,CO,2016-04-03T00:30:00,light,30 minutes,"Occurred : 4/3/2016 00:30  (Entered as : 04/03/16 0:30) Reported: 4/6/2016 5:27:34 AM 05:27 Posted: 4/15/2016 Location: Grant, CO Shape: Light Duration:30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/126/S126744.html,"Flashes of light outside tent, mechanical whirring noises, and extreme effect of heart rate of witnesses. My two best friends and I (and my friend's six year old son) went winter camping in our usual spot at Handcart Campground in Pike National Forest two nights ago.  I will call my friends B & C for sake of anonymity.  B & C and I stayed up until about ten p.m. watching the campfire while B's son had gone to bed in the giant tent we were all sharing. We were drinking a few beers and passing around a whiskey flask, but none of us were drunk...not by a longshot.  The sky was absolutely clear with probably the best view of the stars I've ever seen.  The three of us put out the fire, climbed into the tent, and went to bed.  The wind really picked up shortly after we went to bed. I had a lot of trouble falling asleep, much more than usual when I'm in the woods, but I did eventually doze off.  I'm an experienced camper and not generally afraid of the wilderness, but I had a feeling of unease in my gut. It was odd but I chalked it up to the solitude of being at high elevati! on in the off-season, in an area four miles from the nearest houses and up a road we had to do a lot of rugged four-wheeling to get to. Around eleven thirty I woke up and had to urinate.  My phone said it was 11:30 p.m.  I still felt uneasy, just something in the air, I guess, so I threw on my boots and took my 10mm pistol with me.  It was very cold so I made it quick.  I got out of the tent, did my business, looked around for a moment and climbed back inside.  Something did not feel right out there. Words cannot describe it, but I was not at ease.  Also, the wind was incredibly loud, which made falling back to sleep impossible.  I lay there, restless, for about an hour, until the event happened. An especially brutal blast of wind hit the tent and the rainfly battered the top of the structure.  That's what made me open my eyes. And that was when I witnessed what appeared to be camera flashes going off just above our tent.  Just as the wind hit its peak velocity, those lights went off at the same time and lasted for about seven to ten seconds, covering a specific side of the dome's top in an area visible to me of about three feet by two feet.  At first, I thought it was lightning accompanying the wind, but I knew there were no (and I mean zero) clouds in the sky that night. I blinked a few times and whispered to my friend C, who was sleeping beside me.  There was a muffled response and I asked him if he'd seen that light. I said I thought it might be lightning.  There was no further response and I didn't believe anyone else in the tent had either witnessed the lights or even been awake to see them  (In the morning I found this was not the case.)  For the next ten minutes I s! tared at the roof of the tent, watching, terrified. My heart was racing, and try as I did, I could NOT get it to slow down. I exercise regularly and my heart rate was so fast it felt as if I'd just gotten done with a three-mile run.  And it would not slow down. I tried to close my eyes and will it to slow, but it was impossible.  I am not an overreacting kind of person but I was fairly certain I was at risk of having a heart attack as I lay there.  My left arm even tingled off and on.  I remember checking the clock on my phone but I cannot recall now what time it read. As the wind battered the tent I heard my buddies shuffle in their sleeping bags and I tried to talk to them again, but again I got no response.  So I dug out my hip flask and took a few swigs of whiskey, trying desperately to calm my nerves.  It was then I remembered the earplugs that were still in my coat pocket from when we'd gone out down the hillside to shoot rifles earlier that day. I dug them out and put them! in my ears to block the sound of the wind and the tent skin f! lapping against itself. Then I could really hear my heart and it scared the hell out of me. At that point, I closed my eyes and tried to breathe as slow and deep as I could. I felt like I was calming, but my pulse still raced and I was wide awake. After what I can only guess was about fifteen minutes since the first pulse of light, another giant blast of wind caught the tent, the worst of the whole night, and I opened my eyes again to see another round of lights, this time green and situated at the opposite side of the tent's top, flashing like paparazzi cameras for about five seconds. It was absolutely terrifying and I didn't know what to think.  After that I called out to my friends, not in a whisper, and again I received no response. I could make out their forms in the dark tent so I knew they were there but they didn't respond. I gripped my pistol inside my sleeping bag and felt my shotgun resting right beside the bag. But neither of them brought me comfort. After that second round of lights, the wind died down some. Not completely, but a fair amount. My heart still pounded and I put the foam earplugs back in, trying to drive out all other input but my own thoughts. I don't know how long I lay there, but it felt like probably an hour passed as I tried, unsuccessfully to calm my pulse.  The next thing I knew I was waking up to early morning light.  I had managed to fall asleep at some point and was eternally grateful to see the sunlight playing at the edges of our tent through the trees. My friends all woke up relatively soon after that, and I asked them was if they'd seen the lights. My friend B's face said everything.  And the first thing he said was he thought he was going to have a heart attack.  He repeated an experience that was identical to mine above, including the inability to slow his heart and having pain in his left shoulder associated with it until he finally passed out.  The exception to his story being he also heard a series of shrill mechanical beeps just before the second round of lights (something I decided I must have missed due to the earplugs).  He also said he heard me ask about lightning after the first flashes but never heard anything else from me, possibly because of the noise of the wind.  Our friend C did not witness any of the lights or sounds but said he did not sleep well at all, partly because of the wind, but also partly because he didn't feel right.  The child slept fine and didn't wake up once, despite the wind. We made it back down the mountain and home yesterday morning. We didn't even stick around to make breakfast, which we traditionally always do. I looked around in the snow in the area surrounding our tent but didn't find any tracks, but to be honest, I didn't attempt to look too hard. We broke camp, packed up, and got the hell out of there.  I slept much better in my own bed last night, though thinking of the event still makes me shudder.  I'm still processing it. It terrified me.  And as a lover of camping and the outdoors, it pains me to say that I have no desire to go camping again anytime soon.",2016-04-15T00:00:00,,

I had my phone on the dashboard and i picked it up and took one pic of it.  I looked at it for about 20-30 seconds and it just stood there.  I have never seen anything like it.

Then the traffic started moving and i forgot about it and concentrated on driving.""  That is what he roughly said.  I tried interrogating him but he was one of those live for today types who believes in nothing and has hardly any educational background, a working class van driver basically.  He just kept going off the subject and didn't want to entertain me on my UFO thoughts.  But from his mannerism and the enthusiasm in the way he described the event, it led me to believe he was not lying.  And when he showed me the photo, i was gob smacked. Now, to get the photo, i had to go round his son's house the next day and he pulled it off his dads facebook page, where he uploaded it to.  I say this because the original may be better quality but i cannot be certain, just laying down the facts for your scrutiny.  But i'm sure the original i saw on the phone was a lot clearer and detailed, but that also could be because of a smaller phone screen.

On May 24, 2016, at approximately 21:15 hrs., I noticed in the night sky bright off white lights similar to light bulbs on a fixture bar, the lights were in a slight chevron shape.  When I observed the lights in the north western sky, I noticed they were well above the tree line in the distance, yet very bright.  I saw the lights for about 5 seconds, then called for my husband to look out the front of our house.  I watched the lights for about another 3-5 seconds then moved to my husband’s location about 25 feet from my observation point. The lights were gone by the time I arrived at my husbands’ location. When I saw my husband I said that couldn’t have been a plane, and my husband immediately said that was no plane.  We agreed if it had been a plane as large as what we observed, we would have heard engine noise or something as it passed.  We noted the stillness of the moment, very quiet outside.    We continued to watch the night sky for a minute or two before going inside.   We determined what we saw was not from spot lights projecting in the air or any plane, helicopter or luminaries. My husband has a private pilot’s license, has law enforcement experience, and I am a retired law enforcement Deputy with almost 36 years of service.  My husband and I are familiar with helicopters’ and airplanes; we are night sky watchers and look for the satellites going through the sky.  This is the second time we have seen lights which made no sense to us and felt like it is necessary to file a report. We are located in central Missouri the area we live in is called Lake of the Ozarks, our home is located south of the Camdenton Memorial Airport.  We are in the flight zone for the airport so we are familiar with aircraft landing and taking off.

The lights seemed to be pulsating from right to left the objects was stationary then left the area in a very fast departure after a few seconds.  I estimate what I saw was 5 to 10 miles away and possibly 500 or more feet across, I could not see definitions of top to bottom only left to right.  I am somewhat familiar with identifying objects in the air as I have had flight training and have my private pilots certificate.

Too slow for a normal aircraft to fly without stalling.  It had 2 red lights, which were located on each end of the object.  As the craft moved away from our house, the wind stopped, and it silently moved towards the horizon out of sight.  You could not hear any noise of any kind emitting from it.

It was really low.  Noiseless.   It had a very bright white light in the center that appeared to be perfectly round.  It looked rectangular with lights on each end that seemed duller than the center, but also bright.  I really can't say what color the end lights were because the center light was so dominant.   Because I couldn't identify it, I thought maybe it was a drone.  I've never really seen a drone in person but I was trying to make some kind of identification.   After 15 minutes of following the craft, I decided that I needed to get home.  But as I started to head home, I noticed another car stopped in the middle of the street.  I thought oh gosh, it's the cops and they must have seen me driving crazy trying to follow this thing but it wasn't.  I assumed it was someone else who was watching this low flying craft that was barely moving.   I took two pics out of my car window.  Best I could get.  I'm surprised that all u captured were lights that looked farther away than they were.  I won't speculate as to what it was because I really don't know.

During nightly light show, when a star suddenly moves across the sky, I can see these aircraft red and blue flashing lights,one on each side, coming across the sky in the direction of the moving object, these craft also make fly byes regularly in stealth mode using no lights.  When interacting with the moving stars, a gray cloud will suddenly appear and distort the view moving in a fast circular motion but with a trained eye you can still make out lights moving around behind it.  We don't have equipment for night photography but if we did I could easily prove we are not being told the truth about what's really going on, the lights are every night,  I've reported it to police, local news, and the GSP airport but nobody seems interested???

I actually do not believe in extraterrestrial spacecraft. This is just something flying that was unidentifiable to me. I was out looking at Mars through my telescope.  It was low on the horizon in the southeast, just above the tree line.  I was waiting for Saturn to rise, when I saw a bright red light flying in my direction, from the southeast.  We have a lot of air traffic near our house due to our proximity to Pease.   As it got closer I noticed there were two lights flying staggered.  I thought, this is cool, a couple of military aircraft.  But then I noticed there was no jet or helicopter sound.   As I said, we have a lot of air traffic, but it is always loud.   At the height these were flying, there should have been either a thunderous roar of jet engines or loud thumping of helicopter blades, but they were silent.   They became obscured by a large tree in my yard, so I went into my neighbors yard to keep track of them.  When I got around the tree, one had broken off and headed east, and the other headed northeast.   I pulled out my cell phone and recorded the one heading northeast.  Didn't catch anything viewable, it was too dark.  Not sure what they were.  Maybe afterburners on jets very high up?  But they only seemed a lot lower?  But why would I see bright red as they were heading toward me?   There were no other lights.  No blinking or other colors.  Just solid red.

I was a few miles out of Sulphur Springs when I noticed a craft of some kind in front of and above me (all I had to do was lift my eyes slightly and the craft was right in front of me and maybe just above the trees ).  It appeared to be triangular shaped (the lights were in a triangular shape anyway) and there was one light that rotated up and around the craft the whole time I saw it.  The lights were red, white and a blue one.  I thought it was a helicopter at first but I couldn’t hear any sound when I rolled my window down--for the height and distance from me, I would have heard something had it been a helicopter.  It stayed the same amount of distance above and in front of me as I drove.  I started to become a little concerned about it.  I tested it—I would speed up (over 60) and then really slow (25, 30), and all the while it stayed right there in front of me.  I did it again and the same thing happened.  I thought, oh, geez, this is a dirty trick to play on someone.  I figured that if I went through Sulphur Springs, the object wouldn’t be there when I got out on the other side of the town (the town is lined with street lights).  I was wrong.  The object must have gone higher, since I couldn’t see it at all when I was driving through the town.  Once I got out of town, it was right there in front of me again.  It stayed in my vision, not wavering at all.  I had a turn ahead of me when I would be going north on Route 602.  I figured it wouldn’t follow me.  I was wrong.  I made the turn…and so did it, albeit a wide turn.  It stayed within my vision, a little off to the right, but in front of me.  I was nearing New Washington and really couldn’t wait to get home.

Our family, including wife, myself, son, and grandson enjoy launching model rockets skyward at a suburban area, free from aircraft and people in general.  I video recorded the launchings.  In further review of the videos frame by frame, small bright white to grey-scaled and colorful spherical objects larger than a basketball were found moving east to west and back, near ground level at high speed. Although very bright, we did not notice the object's presence at the time of capture. The subject videos were taken during midday.  While reviewing videos taken in February and March of 2015 at a later time, I noticed objects near or touching launched rocket components at altitude (approximately 1500ft) after parachute deployment.  One video was shown to Terry Ray, a MUFON Field Investigator, in person, at our residence on September 25, 2015. The objects were of several shapes and colors.  All of them were less than two feet in length/diameter.  Some were elongated, while others were bright white, orange, yellow, blue, or neutral in hue. The videos were carefully analyzed, then imaged with a still camera, the same Nikon D5100 and 18-200 mm ED lens used in the original capture.  While advancing frames I noticed extremely fast spherical objects moving east to west to east in front of a tree line located about 100 yards to the south from the launch pad.  There is also a surveyor's marker approximately 3-feet tall located about 100 feet, also south of the pad.  Using the marker to scale the objects close to and in front of it, their size could be roughly determined. From video, I also captured eight objects of uniform size above a small mountain crest to the southwest of the launch pad.  They appear static and in sharp focus. Additionally, a series of images show a fast, diffuse object traveling south-south east in the sky, then in front of a mountain crest, before becomming a static grey metallic orb-like object much larger than the other bright and colorful spheres indicated above. Spherical objects can be seen near the top and in front of the surveyor's marker.  They are white and/or orange in hue.  The only sound heard were rocket launchings and human responses. I recently checked the rocket with a ultraviolet light and did not notice any unusual marks on the rocket components.  Nor were there any marking on the tube, fins, or nosecone. There are many images taken that show in detail all of the above sightings.  I shall return to the launch site for further study with better equipment, including a chair to sit on at the surveyor's marker during launches and after.

August 2, 2016, I was standing in the backyard of my home.  I was looking nearly straight up and facing the northeast watching the stars, looking for satellites and early Perseids Meteors.  I had actually seen two meteors and about 5 satellites.  I had been outside for about an hour, when I got my first really good view of a phenomenon that I have seen on three previous occasions. I was looking into a clear sky with no obstructions, the same as the three previous times, when I saw what looked like a flash bulb going off in the sky above me.  This is the first time that I have seen this clearly.  On the previous occasions, I only saw it out of the corner of my eye and never got a clear view.  In fact, I have seen it so infrequently that I had figured that it must be a trick of the light. I starts in a black, starless area of the sky (about 20 degrees east of Alkaid at the end of the big dipper) a small pin prick of light, like a star, suddenly appears and then seems to explode with a flash that leaves a very faint, momentary, aura around it.  The very bright flash expands out to three or four times the diameter of a star and then it fades to black. It’s almost as if a meteor were coming straight down towards the earth and then quickly burns up in the atmosphere while being directly in line with my line of sight.  Not sure if that’s possible but that seems like a pretty good description of it, except that the color isn’t quite right, it has an almost blue-white hue to it and not the more yellow-white of a shooting star.  More of a cool color look. I have seen plenty of satellites that are rotating in and out of reflection and I am 100% sure that it was not a satellite.  It may have a perfectly simple explanation, but I haven’t seen anything on the internet that ! describes exactly what I saw.

I told my wife, and she saw it too.  We watched it travel south to north for several minutes.   Within a minute we saw 2 more lights flying 1 behind the other, I put my fingers up to try and see how close they were together but even my little finger covered both lights.  We saw them at about a 45 degree angle above the horizon.  When they were directly over head the rear light released two smaller objects, that started traveling 1 east and 1 west, same type of light just a bit dimmer.  Then several seconds later we saw 2 more lights same description and angle of appearance, traveling again south to north. From  2300 to 2315hrs, we counted a total of 10 lights, traveling from the south to north direction.  And 2 lights that came in from the southwest until they were directly over our house and then turned north.  As soon as we lost sight of those 2 lights, out of nowhere, 1 light came out of the north, but at a higher angle, maybe 60 degrees above the horizon, and was traveling south but at a much higher speed then the other lights we had seen. None of the white light objects we saw had any strobe or blinking lights of aircraft.  None of these objects produced any sound either, I spent nearly 3 decades in the military, I am very familiar with military aircraft traveling at high speed and altitude and even they produce sound, and my wife is a very well educated nurse.  I looked online to see if there are any  satellite orbiting are location, from space weather.com nearest orbit in 100 miles to our west.  Jet stream information from intellicast.com shows jet stream traveling across our area from northwest to southeast, so these objects were under there own propulsion, not being pushed by they wind.   We are not sure what we saw, but from are stand point they would fall into the UFO description.  My wife took a video via smart phone of 1 of these lights. We have noticed lights moving in the night sky before.  Two weeks ago, the local news was informed of lights in the sky, and a story was done, due to the volume of calls they had received.  I have also seen similar lights before and had aircraft change course to follow them, do the close proximity of the aircraft and speed they pursued they were without a doubt military.   Last month I thought I saw one of these lights and can  swear it actually dropped an object that looked like it was heading down, but this object I guess was most likely over lake Michigan, off Milwaukee.

My wife and I were about to start a camp fire at the cottage and listen to the C2C podcast on my phone.  I went outside first.  While I was waiting for her I decided to take a look up at the stars to see if I notice anything as I usually do.  Upon gazing for the first minute, I noticed what looked like a very bright star move slowly from right to left across the night sky.  I looked for the blinking lights which would rule out anything but a plane but there were none.   I called for my wife to come out and look but she was busy with the kids at that particular moment.  When she came out I told her what I saw.  She dismissed it as a plane. I decided to keep looking up and about 5 minutes later, this time, TWO, bright glowing, what looked like, stars (but brighter) moving across the sky but this time from left to right and the latter one following the leader in exactly the same path it was on.  If the front one moved slightly down or up, the other would follow to a tee.!  The wife couldn't dismiss this one.  She began to look up with me.  THEN...over Lake Erie we see a glowing orange light stationary over the treeline. It slowly started moving to the left and just as it was about to go out of sight behind a tall tree on the yard, it simply vanished!  Like a bathroom light, it just turned off.  Now the wife is LOSING IT!  As well as myself, ""what did we just see"" we said to each other laughing with excitement.  I was giving her the ""I told you so's"" and decided to walk down the property towards the beach on the lake.  There....again over the horizon across Lake Erie I spot a second glowing orb which looked exactly like the one that just vanished before our eyes.   The wife ran back to the cottage to grab me my phone so I could record what I saw.  I did manage to get some film.  I have attached what I got.

Weather Conditions: Temperature was 85-90F, no clouds, somewhat hazy.   The sun had set at ground level but the sky was quite well illuminated. Sighting:  I was in the company of a man whom I did not know.  I had been inquiring about an automobile he had listed in the newspaper for sale for my daughter who would 16 that following December. This guy kept mentioning that he saw something up in the sky and would say, ""What is it? What is that?""   He was looking to the S-SE while I was standing (talking to him) peering to the East and saw nothing.  Apparently, he thought it might have been a bird perhaps as it appeared in as a dark blob on its approach.   Then I looked straight up, right overhead and there it was!  A perfectly round, flat shaped object moving directly over our heads.   Shape: The object was perfectly circular, at least from my perspective being directly underneath it. Its bottom side appeared to be of a dark colored material, nearly black.  However, later I noted that the underside of silvery (colored) aircraft wings appeared similarly dark when viewed against a brightly lit sky.   As this object passed on over; then past us a short distance, I noticed the sun glinted off its westward side.  This revealed what appeared to be burnt, scorched surfaces on the side of the saucer.  Otherwise it did look to be constructed of some sort of grayish metal.  The small outter areas connecting its upper and lower surfaces appeared to have been a bit convex and not absolutely flat as I remember.     As the craft flew further past us, we were able to see over its upper deck surface which appeared flat like that of its lower surface.  However structure on its top surface quickly became visible.  This included one or perhaps two vertical beams (about 3 to 4 feet high) capped by one horizontal beam which was a bit shorter in length than its overall diameter.  No cupola nor cockpit of any kind was seen by either of us.  By the time the craft was far off in the distance (to our N-NW), it looked not unlike that of a biplane due to its bottom deck and horizontal beam capping the vertical beam(s).   But we knew for sure it was no biplane!  Size: The object was much smaller than that of a full moon at its zenith.  Because it presented such sharp definition, it was obvious the craft was quite low in altitude as it was a bit hazy that evening.  I would guess it flew over us at form 500 to 700 feet altitude.   During the following weekend while attending a 'fly-in' at our airport here,  I took the time to guess the size of this object by looking at aircraft of known wingspan flying at approximately the same altitude.  The one aircraft which appeared to have a similar wingspan was a Pitts S-2.  Its wingspan is around 18 feet whch most resembled the disc’s diameter. WWII trainer aircraft present at the fly-in appeared to have wings longer than the object's diameter at 20 feet.  My Qualification as a Spotter, along with a brief history:  My experience as a spotter/observer of aircraft began at the tender age of of 7 in El Paso, TX.  El Paso was at that time THE ""southern flyway"" for many military aircraft often being ferried from factories on the East coast.  Also, due to the climate of the Southwest which is CAVU most of the year, it was ideal for training pilots and crews of military aircraft.   Therefore I had the opportunity to witness a steady progression of increasing aircraft technology over the years I lived in El Paso, from....... WWII on through the Korean Conflict and beyond. As the weather was usually nice (i.e., clear, warm and such), I spent much of my youth outside.  Many of my school friends enjoyed the 'display' of military aircraft during WWII as did I.  They flew over night and day, many were practicing close formation flying, some flew at differing elevations and so on.  We witnessed everything from smaller trainer aircraft to the large, slow moving Navy blimps being ferried from their factory near Akron, OH to the West Coast.  I continued my interest in aircraft through the cold war of the 1950s.  During these years I saw most navy and Air Force military aircraft in production at the time, including an occasional 'one of a kind' like the XC-99.  It was a cargo version of the B-36 bomber. During those years I never saw anything resembling a UFO.  All sightings could be explained (by myself).  The strangest were weather balloons, usually launched by the Air Force at Biggs AFB. I did however have an acquaintance from college who after his graduation & time in the military, worked for our government on downrange tracking stations in Southern NM.  He let me know that they had seen 'strange blips"" appearing on radar screens from time to time in those days (late 50s through the '60s).    Charles H.

Three objects observed during community fireworks display at downtown park with about 20,000 people in attendance.  The fireworks display was towards the North of park, looking over to the East I seen a pair of green blinking lights just at edge of cloud ceiling (appeared to be hiding within clouds) was moving toward park.  At first I though it was small plane, but then it stopped and was in a stationary position for about 2-minutes after which it flashed a row of red and then a row of yellow lights, alternating quickly back and forth between the two colors for a couple of seconds before returning to two blinking green lights.  Then the object started moving slowly towards the South, and a second later it started traveling at the speed of a military jet, then slowed down to a stop just above the horizon from my point of view.   I then seen another pair of similar green lights flashing just inside the clouds above the crowd that was watching the fireworks, most! people seemed to be paying attention to the fireworks and might not have noticed the objects, or if they did they may have thought they were planes.  The second object was stationed over the park in the clouds, the first object then came back towards the fireworks area and became stationary within the clouds, then a third object with a pair of solid red lights at of front with flashing green lights at rear appeared just south of the park and was stationary just below cloud level through out the fireworks display.  It was interesting to see all three objects floating in the sky as if enjoying the fireworks.  The two object closest to the fireworks display would move slowly then stop and move again from one side of the display to the other etc.  The third object to the south remained in a stationary position throughout.  The objects seem to be communicating by flashing their lights, the blinking lights were not constant, but seemed Morse code like.  After the fireworks displ! ay, one object moved out towards the East and out of sight, an! d one mo ved out of sight toward the south then returned and appeared near another fireworks display five miles away wrapping up over Seattle where it stopped and sat for a minute, then quickly flashed alternating rows of red and yellow lights then resumed to flashing green lights and took off to the south at military jet speed.  I do not know when the object with the solid pair of red lights left after the fireworks display were over because I wasn't paying attention to it at the time.

At that time the military was using these same properties to practice maneuvers, and had been doing so all summer and winter, or for about a year.  They were somewhat in contact with our company, so we would not interfere with each other’s activities. During that period of time, myself and about six friends decided that we would do an early spring campout in the Bear Rocks area of northern Dolly Sods.  The weather was nice and not too cold or windy, but the winter snow was still covering the road on top of the mountain.  We drove up forest road 75, from the Jordan Run Road, and were able to get within 1/3-mile of the mountain top at Bear Rocks.  There is a wide spot where we parked, then proceeded north on foot up through deep snow drifts, to the parking area at the top of the mountain.  The road on top was impassable with deep snow drifts and some bare spots.  From the parking lot we walked northwest 1/3-mile to a spot in a clump spruce trees where we would camp for the night.  This location is latitude N39°04’10” longitude W79°18’20” at an elevation of about 4000 feet. That evening at dusk, members of our party were setting up tents at the southern edge of the spruce trees in the open field.  A friend and I were struggling to get a camp fire started, in the shelter of spruce trees about 50-yards away.  We were having trouble getting the spruce wood to burn, but were making progress and finally had a camp fire going, when members at the southern edge called to come over and take a look.  My friend stayed with the fire and I went down to the others for a better view of what they were looking at. Off in the distance to the south and about 1-mile away, two lights were traveling northeast along forest road 75, towards Bear Rocks.  It looked like two vehicle headlights.  Just a single light each.  We were all discussing “how could this be?” because the road was covered with deep snow drifts.  I thought what I was viewing was four-wheelers, motorcycles or snowmobiles, but something just didn’t seem right.  It was too dark to see the vehicles, but the headlights were very clear.  I could see one pull ahead of the other, then the one in the rear would catch back up.  It looked like two small vehicles, on a clear road and running together at 10 to 25 miles per hour.  The light was as bright as a headlight and looked white and artificial.  As they traveled along the road they came to within about 1/3-mile of our position, but when they came to the parking lot, where the road turns sharply and goes south down off the mountain, they rose up into the air 20 or 30 feet and were ! flying over Bear Rocks.   Now the headlight looked more like a spot light, moving around and illuminating the rocks and vegetation beneath.  The lights continued on a straight northeastern course and went down over the mountain side, not to be seen again.  We were all shocked, without explanation of what we had just seen.  Were they flying the entire time?  My friend back at the fire, covered it with snow, putting it out, so as not to reveal our position to the strange lights.  The entire viewing lasted perhaps 5-minutes, while we observed the lights traveling for about a mile.  No noise was heard at any time. Later back at work, I told my boss about the strange lights we had seen.  He said that he had been told other stories of strange lights in Dolly Sods.  He mentioned it to the military person in charge, whose reply was that the military has some very quiet helicopters. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My house is on Parkhurst Drive near its intersection with Northcliff Drive in northeast Dallas, Texas.  I was outside in my back yard at 10:15 pm CST, on Saturday March 5, 2016.  Most trees were still bare of leaves, affording a good view of the sky.  To my southeast from behind the neighborhood housing, a moving single bright red light suddenly appeared at about 30-degrees elevation.  It was flying level at about 3,000-ft altitude and at about 1-mile horizontal distance from me.  It was traveling northeast, from my right to my left, along a path roughly estimated to follow Garland Road from Casa Linda Plaza to Whiterock Marketplace Shopping Center (Home Depot), where it then turned northward toward Lochwood Park.   At first, I thought it was a small airplane in straight level flight without much variation. Its speed was about 200-mph, too fast to be a helicopter.  I looked for any other lights, specifically white strobes and green navigation lights, but it only had! a steady intense red, visible from its left or port side toward me, proper for navigation.  However, since it is illegal to fly below 10,000-feet without white lights, I quickly inferred that it was not an airplane or other human construct.  No craft silhouette was visible because of the steady bright red light.  I purposely listened intently for an airplane sound, but there was only dead silence.  The craft then swung around from my southeast to my northeast, apparently making a 45-degree left turn, and headed along my northwest, keeping about 1-mile distance from me.  When it was approaching my north, I lost sight of it because of trees.  I watched it travel about 1.6-miles total distance and my sighting lasted about 30-seconds.  It was somewhat low key. I have witnessed several anomalous objects over Dallas within the past three years, but had not paid attention to any before 2013.  The different mindset that was forced upon me by my extremely vivid 2014 sighting has made me recognize that it is equally as important to identify UFOs as to discount them, and to not take a perpetually skeptical position.  It is a much greater crime to see a flying saucer and dismiss it as “swamp gas” than to see swamp gas and label it as a “flying saucer.”  When you see a light in the sky that does not behave like any normal object, it probably is not a normal object.  Therefore, my conclusion is that this particular craft was a machine that is NOT man-made, because – 1.  The lighting was illegal by FAA standards, 2.  There was absolutely no sound at all, 3.  The speed indicated a powered craft, 4.  The large scale ruled out an RC toy, 5.  The clock was late for normal small private airplane operations, 6.  The flight path curved around my position and! was not straight, indicating some ulterior behavior, which made no sense for human piloting over northeast Dallas late at 10:15-pm.",2016-06-16T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

The lights where bright white lights that flashed from the center to the outside in a horizontal fashion.

The lights flashed from the center to the left and then the center to the right and then all lights on.  The lights would flash on and off and would last about 1 second to 2 seconds in the on position.  The lights were stationary and no outline or shape was apparent when the lights were off.

I will attempt to be succinct in order to keep this report brief.  Please call me for additional details.  I am the Owner of UFO Sighting Tours in Sedona, AZ.  I have completed 588 tours with the use of PVS 7, Gen. 3 Military Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).  I was hired by the CITD conference to run their Night Vision Events at this year’s 2016 conference running June 2 thru 6, 2016.  The previous 4 listed reports on this site from Joshua Tree, CA, were from attendees of the Saturday, June 4th event that I led.  I know many additional people that were in attendance who may be contacted for reports/interviews and I may provide phone numbers.   I am a trained observer and a past MUFON investigator.  I was a past member of the Board for MUFON OC, CA. On June 4th well over 100 people were gathered at Orion’s point lookout, a location at the Joshua Tree Retreat Center.  At approx. 10:00 or just prior, most of the attendees witnessed what I am about to describe.  There were 18 pairs of NVGs provided, as well as many individuals privately owned goggles present.  Yet the following were clearly visible with the naked unaided eye and were seen by most present without equipment.  The following sightings lasted approx. 20 minutes total time.  I was busy leading the group and instructing them on a PA system and did not note the time, but many of those present informed me after the fact.  Videos of this event are surfacing and are being gathered.  A professional documentary film crew was present on behalf of CITD and achieved footage of these sightings, but I have not seen it.  I will provide it as soon as it is available. As I witnessed it:  Approaching from the west and flying east across the valley in front of us, and coming low over a hill, were the following large colored lights flying extremely fast.  First to appear was a blue light, then shortly thereafter a red or amber light, and then 2 bright green ones.  After a brief pause of a few minutes came 2 more green ones followed by a single green one, again, flying over the hill at an extremely rapid speed.  This second grouping then slowed way down and came together to form a distinct triangle formation and continued to fly across the valley maintaining this formation traveling all the way in a very slow even pace.  Eventually this formation disappeared from vision right in front of us.  I was not holding NVGs at the time, but those that were said this triangle formation was seen speeding up and shooting up off into space.  Many said that somewhere in this mix was a purple light, but I did not see that.  This was a total thus far of abou! t 7 clearly visible craft. People were yelling out, applauding and very excited during these events.  After a about 5 minutes had passed, Jimmy Church, popular radio talk show host and his wife Rita approached me.  A friend of theirs’s had called them on her cell and told them to come quick!  I informed them they just missed some remarkable sightings.  When suddenly in comes yet another large green light from over the same hill to the west.  And shortly after even another green light.  They witnessed these 2 green lights (naked eye) along with other objects that they saw using the NVGs over the next 10 mins.  Soon after those 2 green ones, a very large amber light came right over us all and very quickly disappeared right above us.  Including this amber one, the total crafts sighted in about 20 minutes was well over 10.  All 10 major sightings were way, way, way too fast to be satellites, completely silent, went from hauling in to slowing down to a snail’s pace immediately, and then completely disappea! red before us.  All of which are things military jets and satellites CAN NOT DO!  We started viewing that night at 8:30 p.m. and didn’t stop till 11:30 p.m. and continued to have sightings on and off the whole while.  I educate everyone on all the various type of planes, shooting stars, and all about satellites in order to be able to rule those out.  Then and only then are we left with unknown or unidentified objects.  All these sightings were clearly unidentified! Also in use were multiple high powered green lasers.  I had brought eight 5-mile, two 10-mile, and one 100-mile visible length of beam lasers and they were distributed throughout the crowd and some people had brought their own.  As these 10 total objects over about 20 minutes were witnessed many people were hitting them with the lasers.  We use the lasers both for pointing out objects and for flashing at them to get possible UFOs to flash back.  This has proven successful on most of my tours.  As these 10 objects were hit by lasers, myself and others realized that while some may have been flashing back in response, that most likely our lasers were hitting actual metallic surfaces and reflecting off of the objects!  Many of the people standing near me, including Jimmy Church, thought this is what we were actually seeing.  This would also mean that these objects were extremely close. The response from the crowd had been overwhelming.  Many people have expressed that this was a paradigm changing event for them.  I’m spoiled.  I get to see real sightings on all my tours.  But this night, same as those, I loved providing that experience for others.  I never get tired of people’s reactions.  For me, it’s always confirmation that UFOs are real and seeing them is truly believing.

The object seemed very close (maybe 100 yards) and pass us horizontally and at the same altitude.  Oddly, the object seemed to pass by very slowly, more slowly than you might expect to pass another flying object going in the opposite direction.  It was clear that the entire object was metallic (chrome-colored) as it reflected against the bright sunlight and was emitting huge plumes of white ""smoke"" similar to an old train steam engine.  From my seat, the object was visible for about 5-10 seconds.  I noticed that there was no vertical wing, no windows, no markings, or any other indication that it was a plane, but I assumed it was a plane given the plumes of smoke coming out of its rear so I didn't give it much thought about it at the time.  Note too that ! there was no indication from any other passengers (except my fiance who was seated at the window and was the one that alerted me to the object)or crew members that they saw anthing unusual.

My wife and I were driving along Kirkwood highway from Newark en route to Wilmington, DE, and were approaching the small town of Elsmere.  We were in the vicinity of the VA hospital, when I noticed three solid white lights (i.e. none of them were blinking on/off) in a completely vertical line (like a column) relatively low in the sky directly in front of us, some distance away (perhaps half a mile).  They appeared to be stationary or moving very slowly towards us, as we continued along the straight road. I watched them for around three or four seconds before saying ""what's that?"" to my wife who was driving the car.  A few minutes later (when we were discussing what we had just witnessed) she said she had also seen them before I drew attention to them vocally.  My wife and I agreed that the lights were attached to a solid object, which was much larger than a conventional plane. After a few more seconds, the lights moved slowly to our right, now forming a triangle formation. I had the impression that we had been observing a triangular object with a solid white light at each corner.  When we first saw it, it was oriented perpendicular to the ground such that the lights formed a column (in other words it appeared that the object was initially on its side).  As we got closer, it banked and assumed a horizontal orientation, such that the three lights were no longer in a vertical column but were in a triangle shape. The light at the apex of the triangle was furthest from our vantage point as I continued to observe (my wife focusing on driving), the other two lights behind the light at the apex.  The object (now in a roughly two o'clock location relative to our car going along the straight section of Kirkwood highway approaching Elsmere) was moving away from us in the direction of the light at the apex. The whole event lasted approximately fifteen seconds. As the object moved to our right, it very quickly became hidden from our view due to the stores and houses at the side of the road.  This was further evidence to us that the object was relatively low in the sky - much too low for a conventional plane.  We heard no sound from whatever we saw. Given the evidence of our senses at the time, we regard the possibility that the three lights were not attached to a very large solid object is very small (much too small to reasonably accept) especially given the revealed geometry we witnessed as the lights moved relative to our car.",2016-05-20T00:00:00,,

It is so specifically green and blue it takes my breath away. This is towards Fairborn/Huber Heights possibly the Wright Patterson Airforce Base?

Meaning that they only made themselves apparent when passing through the clouds.  When they didn’t pass through the clouds there was ZERO trace of them.

Within 15 min we heard a distant grinding sound from above us on the large hill behind us, but we made noting of it at first.  But then the sound seemed to travel over us and then seemingly right in front of us.  The sound was like some sort of grinding noise.  I can only describe it as electrical arcing and whirling metal that pulsed, it came and went eerily.  All of the bugs stopped their chirping, and the light breeze blowing through the area stopped suddenly.  We ran under our tarp loaded our guns and, after a moment to compose ourselves, slowly started walking toward the sound, but as we did it seemed to begin to move quickly away towards Indian Ridge, and soon it was gone. Later, as we were all packed up and leaving, driving down the dirt road back to Cold Creed Rd., I dropped my phone under my seat.  My brother stops the car and I get out to get it.  We then hear the noise again.  It seemed to be on the ground maybe 50-100 ft away; but again we see nothing.  While the noise pulsed we checked the sky for drones, aircraft or anything but saw nothing.  Being a Sunday, no crews were working and the NDOC training facility was closed for the weekend.  There were other shooters, but there gun shots were clear and distinct from the noise, actually there were no gun shots while my brother and I heard this noise. Was this a UFO?  I have no idea, we saw nothing.  All my brother and I heard was the noise.   We thought it creepy because it came towards us, lingered, and when we approached it, it seemed to avoid us.  Has anyone every experienced this before?  Maybe have an audio file I could hear for comparison?  Maybe even audio sounds of commercially available drones?  It might be possibly that some one messed with us, but due to how loud it was and how close it seemed I don't think it was one.",2016-06-24T00:00:00,,

The following photo shows the orb travelling, as well as the following photo.  Then it looks like a ring develops around the orb.  Finally the orb continues on and disappears.

Then when I got to looking at the a few minutes later.  Is when I noticed everyone of the pictures that shows the object with a haze around it.  And as i continue to go through the photos. I came across at least three or four photos where the object seperates and clearly can see two objects.  Also in the photos pick up the object with a purple light.  And in other photos a blue light.  And in others a light blue with green which is very puzzling.  One other thing to mention is normally a light or object is picked up much easier on my phone while recording video opposed to shooting a picture.

On the night of 5/27/16, between the times of 11:05 and 11:11 pm, my co-worker called me out of the home we work at to point out a weird object flying in the sky that was traveling from the west, headed east, and finally came to rest positioned somewhere over or near Selfridge Air Force base.   When the object first appeared it was very blue and very brightly illuminated, the lights weren't flickering or dimming like in typical aircraft.  This was not like any star or planet I have ever seen in the sky before.  The object was slightly bigger in appearance than the North Star, and emitted no sounds, and moved very smoothly, until it came to a complete stop northeast of where we were looking and positioned.   When the object came to a stop about 3 to 4 smaller orb like blue lights came out of the bottom of the object and hovered there for about 1 minute, before the orbs disappeared back into the object and the object turned solid bright vibrant red.  The object remained still in the sky for about another 2 minutes, and then started to lower itself to the ground.  It continued to descend to the ground while remaining bright solid red, until it disappeared out of our visual field.  The whole time the object remained the same size and the lights were always visible to my coworker and me.  This event lasted a total of 6 minutes. The house we are located at is in Eastpointe, Michigan, at 9 Mile Rd., just west of Hayes.  The object was viewed moving just north of us, probably about 8-10 miles away, towards the Harrison Township/Mount Clemens area.  This is the approximate location that Selfridge Air Force Base is situated compared to where we are.  The weather is clear and cloud cover is almost none.  It is not raining and there are hardly any stars visible, so this object really stuck out.   I am not sure the altitude of the object but I do know that while my co-worker and I were viewing this event, the object was positioned between two telephone poles, and was about 3 feet above the wire that crosses between the poles.  My best guess would be that this object was flying at the elevation of about 20,000 feet to 25,000 feet in the air.  It wasn't as high as a plane would normally be seen flying. My co-worker attempted to get video footage while this whole thing was happening.  We don't know if the video came out, or is clear, because it was taken on his smart phone, and the screen is small and marred from overuse.  I am working on transferring the video from his phone to my computer to see it we can upload it to get a better look to see if we were able to catch is even on film.

Surface smooth, & glowing orange-white. I came out to close my garage door when I noticed an orange-white glow directly across the street from my house.  I stepped to the garage doorway and saw a discus-shaped object silently hovering about 60-70 feet AGL.  The object was approx 60 feet in diameter, and 20-25 feet thick from top to bottom, and the body occulted the star field and sky behind it.  The distance to where the object was hovering from my house was approx. 150 feet.  The front door of my house faces south (180 deg.). The glow was not very bright, and appeared to be radiating from the surface of the object.   There were NO other anti-collision or navigation type lights as required by the FAA.  The overall surface texture appeared to be smooth with no observable windows or excrescences, such as antennas, air intakes or engine cowlings. I immediately walked into the house to get a cell phone to shoot video.  I told my girlfriend about the object, as I went to the front door of the house.  The garage and front door are side by side.  I stepped through the door and re-acquired visual on the object, which had not moved.  As I lifted the phone to begin video, the object silently accelerated away to the SW, disappearing in 1.5 seconds.  There was no engine sound or rotor sounds such as a helicopter would make. My longest time observing the object was in the garage, which lasted for 20-25 seconds.  In that time I went through the momentary shock of seeing an object of this size, shape, and lack of engine noise hovering just above the power lines.  Once I grasped what I was observing, I began to look at the details and structure of the object.

I have 2,700 hours time piloting single-engine aircraft with an instrument (IFR) rating.  In my entire experience, I have NEVER observed an aircraft this shape, size, or configuration.  And I have NEVER observed an aircraft silently accelerate from ZERO to what had to be multiple Mach speed and leave no sonic footprint. There were no other aircraft nearby, overhead, or with the object.  The nearest airport is KPGD ( Punta Gorda ) approx. 12 miles away to the SE.

As we turned the slight bend during the elevation drop, we both immediately noticed a bright light orange/white burst of light approximately 60 degrees above the horizon.  I initially thought the object was a commercial aircraft making a maneuver towards Denver International Airport, as this location is in the flight path of the airport. After the initial burst of light, the ‘fireball’ appeared to dim slightly while changing to a yellow color.  At this point the object began to descend and hover lower above the horizon. It then moved in the sky irregularly up and down before regaining a higher altitude.  During the entire sighting the light pattern flickered at an irregular rate with varying intensity.

I ventured outside with my husky following a thunderstorm.  The night sky was filled with stars!  To the south, a town or two away, was lightening in the distant clouds, but no streaks of lightning; no jagged lines or ground contact--just electricity lighting up that section of clouds. Looking in that direction and a bit to the east, in a southerly neighbor’s yard, suddenly a flash of light appeared by the tree top.  Perfectly round, small, bright. At first, I thought it was a firefly, yet it didn’t zigzag like a firefly; it merely blinked for a moment.  Then a second one directly next to it appeared to the right.  The two lights shone simultaneously about a yard apart, in a straight line, then disappeared. I turned and walked a few feet to the west, admiring the planets, and constellations.  Such a clear sky! A couple of planets, and so many stars!  I had a clear view of the big dipper. Within seconds of facing due west, the big dipper to my right and a bit north, a small, round, bright white light appeared much higher in the atmosphere.  It was identical in size and brightness to the first two and seemed to appear from behind a different neighbor’s tree, moving north along the sky, much higher in the atmosphere, silently;. This light appeared like a twinkling star,as did the first two, then disappeared.  Yet it reappeared much further along its straight-lined path to the north, much higher in the Earth's atmosphere.  The light intermittently blinked it’s way across the sky rapidly moving northerly then disappeared out of sight in the northern sky. There were no sounds for any of the lights; no plane noises nearby.  None of the lights moved as comets would, or planes, or fireflies. The experience felt soothing, magical, and precious.",2016-06-10T00:00:00,39.127175333333334,-96.55163066666667

They were first seen rising over the top of the house myself and the other observers were gathered at.  We were all positioned in the backyard, looking to the south.   One person pointed them out, then everyone watched for what was ultimately about 20 minutes.  The objects appeared to be completely black, though the large one had what looked to be lighting of some kind on one side, but it was difficult to say definitively, as they were quite a distance away when this was noticed by one observer.   Nobody filmed them, though I don't know if it would have mattered anyway - on footage they would have just looked like black specs.  The movements of the craft were strange.  They didn't float away like a balloon, but rather they appeared to rise in a slow, deliberate manner, in a fixed direction to the south, with their distance increasing simultaneously with their height.   There was no sound associated with the craft that we noticed.  At first there were two smaller objects, one positioned somewhat close below, and the other just below the that.  The third, lowest of the three, seemed to move off to the East, and was quickly lost sight of.   The other two, however, remained in view of myself and the other witness for quite some time.  The craft stayed the same distance from each other for the duration of their movements, and never seemed to deviate.   Eventually the objects rose so high that it was not possible to see them anymore, and everyone went back to what they were doing.

I was ten years of age.  I was outside of a shoe store where my parents were shopping.  There was a young woman that was with me.  We were talking, and the two of us turned to see a hovering disc about one hundred yards away.  There was no mistaking what we were witnessing, and the two of us were enthusiastic about the experience.  There were no other people in the area to my knowledge.  There was no sound that was emanating from the object whatsoever, or other sensory attributes.  The disk was a dark silver in color, and there did not seem to be any portals or windows.  I told the girl that I was with to go into the store and to tell everyone to come out and see this.  After she departed, the disk advanced towards me.  It then stopped completely, hovered for a moment, and then exited the sky to my left in non-ballistic motion.  No one else was witness to the sighting to my knowledge.  The man behind the counter that also might have owned the shoe store groaned at the prospect of feeling compromised to have to explain this to anyone that might inquire of him.  In their generation to have believed in the existence of Unidentified flying Objects was to have a lost contact with reality.  It required so long for me to report this sighting, forty six years, because the relevance of it only became of import recently.  These alien beings knew what I needed to know more than I did.  It required time to respect that process.   Both of my parents were ministers that hailed from prestigious backgrounds at Ivy League institutions.  My father was from Harvard, my mother from Andover Newton Theological Seminary.  They were involved with the psychic, Edgar Cayce, and personally worked with him directly.  My father was the author of several books on the subject of psychic phenomenon at the Association for Research and Enlightenment in Virginia Beach.  In retrospect, after this long of a time I did not give the matter of the sighting much thought. I just considered it to be outside of my comprehension to know how to interpret.  In the month of June in the year 1984, I found myself next to Hilo International Airport in Hawaii in a grass field one night about two weeks after I moved there to Hawaii Island (also known as The Big Island) after being made destitute by my family. There was an event one evening over the airspace of the Air National Guard.  Three dirigibles that were surrounded by what appeared to be a white mist appeared overhead.  The sighting lasted for about five minutes.  It was of interest to me that one of the dirigibles lightly collided with one of the other ones.  At the time I did not make a correlation between the sighting in Vermont, and this attempt to confuse the issue with me about the interpretation of the actual sighting.  To have seen extraterrestrial phenomenon can also draw the animosity from people that have not.  There was a huge display of wealth to shift a control over the purpose for that sighting in 1970 back to the other members of my family.  Apparently I was supposed to attribute all of this commotion to my personal sense of worth.  No one else in my family has seen extraterrestrial phenomenon.  The reason that I made no effort to report that sighting in Hawaii as well should have served as an indication that there were factors involved that precluded a personal initiative.  It just occurred to me over the past few days that I had never once wondered what the alien beings were like in appearance that were in that U.F.O., how many of them there were, where they were from, and the knowledge of specific identity.  If this had been imparted to me by those alien beings in 1970, then the attempt to confuse the issue in 1984 would have been more elaborate in any investigative function.  The most important concept with me right now was the knowledge from those alien beings themselves of the intention for that sighting in 1970:  The answer was that what I do not know means that I cannot be remotely interrogated for it.  These extraterrestrials pointed out an elaborate conspiracy to me in the upper levels of the government to control information access, and what one can expect in resistance to control the interpretation of a sighting in the existing channels of the government databases. In answer to the question as to why I did not report either of the sightings, it was due to my speculation that a number of other people that have seen alien phenomenon with a similar experience that had also been compromised.  I left the matter to these alien beings themselves to coordinate a mediation with those other innocent men and women to determine when the time was right without trying to influence the end result.  The knowledge of the specific identities of these other people is not something that I was trying to ascertain, and was not disclosed to me.  The suggestion that I could have been extended an investigation of these circumstances if I had reported that U.F.O. in 1970 that would have afforded recognition by government intelligence analysts does not take into account that some of these same personnel were responsible for the conspiracy out of a respect for the reputation of the family.  This was reflected in the incident in 1984.  I conformed to what was necessary, and the persecution that I have endured from the lack of professional oversight by the government that could have limited reprisals and exploitation by those with a hidden agenda is rather beside the point as the actuality.  The coverup is immense.  This sighting in 1970 was also recently reported to MUFON (70308). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I rode into a valley that has waterfalls and a lookout up some steps from the bottom of the trail beside the bluff.  I left my bike against the stair and walked up to the lookout that viewed west to the small hamlet of Springbank, Alberta and the Rocky Mountains beyond. As I glanced I blinked what I thought was Venus, really bright in the sky, where it was at that time in the SW Sky only in February here.  I blinked at the same time I noticed it and it wasn't there. Not a speck, just the lighter stars of the night. I said meh, that was my eyes and the lights messing with me and COMPLETELY disregarded it.  Went home and forgot it. The next night it was training time again.  I left my home near same time 8pm and rode the exact route I did as the night before, timing myself as I trained.  When I arrived at the bottom of the steps the light (Venus) that I had literally completely forgotten came to mind.  So I shut my helmet light off, which I had done as I reached the top step and noticed Venus the night before. And there was Venus! Bright and almost shimmering in purples and greens and whites and then with a flash I clearly remember, it streaked up into the sky leaving a streak and was gone is a millisecond. I literally SCREAMED at it I SAW THAT!! I was alone. It was almost like it realized I was seeing it.  I'll never know. But I rode home amazed and life changed because I can never unsee that.  (It was a dejaVu when I saw the Jerusalem Temple Mount event.  Exactly like that video. If it's hoaxed , they did it exactly like I saw alone that night. The story got even more strange when the next week, the RCMP reported a brutal sick horse mutilation on a ranch in Springbank Alberta, directly below where spotted the ""orb"" as I would describe it. The week prior and they were looking for some sick individuals. The story was on the CFCN local television news.  I tried to find the story but I cannot locate it in their archives but with some resources this could be verified.

It was a cold summer night on hawk mountain and I was still up late.  A few of my friends were up with me and they wanted to go lay in a field to look at the stars.  I stayed behind because I needed to go to sleep.  I remember coming out of my tent to go to the bathroom, and since it’s the middle of the woods on a boy scout reservation why not right outside the tent.  I remember looking down at the tree’s shadows because the moon was very bright that night.   All of the sudden the shadows started to shift sideways, or move as if the moon was setting really fast.  Using logic, I realized the moon cannot be moving that fast and looked up.  I saw a triangular object fly over really close to the tree line, completely silent, with lights similar to Christmas lights surrounding it.  It didn’t look like an entire triangle as I got a pretty close glimpse of the craft.  It looked more like a boomerang, but of course flying straight and not like a boomerang.

At approximately 11:00 PM on August 21st, 2010, I was stargazing on my back porch with my father when I noticed what appeared to be an unusually bright star. For some reason, I felt compelled to stare at it.  It looked unnatural to me.  My father said that he asked me what I was staring at, and that I did not answer him.  He said that I continued to stare blankly at the sky and that I did not react to any of his questions.  I do not remember him talking to me at all. When he looked back up at the sky, the star began pulsating.  It would surge brightly once every 3 seconds.  Several other lights which had appeared to be normal looking stars then began to migrate from random points in the sky and collect and circle around the larger star.  A halo of approximately 12 stars slowly made 3 full rotations around the larger pulsing star until one by one, each of the lesser stars were absorbed into the large one.  When the last star ! had been absorbed into the light of the large star, a blinding yellow flash lit up the sky.  I would describe the sensation as similar to having the flash of a camera go off a few inches away from my eyes.  When the flash went off, our 3 dogs that were inside the house started barking.  All the lights had completely disappeared by the time my eyes readjusted 10 seconds later.  I believe that the event lasted approximately 5 minutes.  However, my father insists that the episode was closer to 10 minutes long.  I may have lost time during this event.  I remember that afterwards,  I felt extremely tired both physically and mentally, and that I went to bed shortly after.

I was walking towards my house with my headphones in and my coat hood up, when something in me told me to look up and take my headphones out.  Amazingly I was facing a black triangle, hovering a few meters above some houses, regularly changing in shape and size. When I first saw it, it was roughly the size of half a football pitch, it was so terrifyingly large that it knocked the breath out of me.  I rang my father and described what I was seeing, during this I started hysterically crying and laughing, because I totally could not believe what I was seeing. It started as an irregular triangle, with the tip pointing diagonally down towards the houses, it's surface was parallel to me so I was able to see a light in each corner, these pulsated between being as dim as stars and as bright as floodlights. Over the course of 30 minutes of standing at the end of the road watching it, it slowly moved up and down in the sky, sometimes dropping so low that it disappeared behind the houses.  It also changed between irregular and equilateral, also changing in size from its largest being roughly 34m in length to its smallest - the length of a small car. I decided to continue on my way as I had already been there a good while, once I reached my house (15 minutes later) I looked back and it was still there, in total I watched it for 45 minutes.  It made no noise, put out no other light except the three on its corners, and managed to remain completely stationary in the air. That, paired with the constant feeling of pressure on my ears, assures me that this was something other than a man-made object.  I also noticed that no other aircraft passed over during the entire duration, over which is normally an incredibly busy air traffic route. I'm was still shaken for a few hours after this, from excitement and fear.  But now I think about how lucky I was to see it, truly a humbling experience.",2016-04-01T00:00:00,,

I got out of the car to listen and look at the lights and I could not hear any noise. We looked again and saw a lot more of the light moving in the same line, North East to South West.  I got out of the car and looked and listened and could not hear anything.  I got my phone and used the camera and started taking a movie of the lights.  We would watch a group of 10 to 15 lights go by when another line of lights would appear.  It looked like the lights would disappear when they got on passed us in the same place.  This lasted around 20 minutes.  Finally the lights stopped and we went on our way. It looked like they were coming from Cape Canaveral which was north of us and I estimated the lights where about 1000 to 2000 feet high.   Patrick AFB does not have that many aircraft assigned to the base so I don’t believe they came from the base.  Most of the time when I am out at the base I might see a couple of helicopters and two to three C-130s. I don’t know what the lights where.

I went to bed at or around 11:00 PM.  I have a sliding glass door covered with a white curtain right next to my bed.   I turned off the lights and got into bed and glanced at the sliding glass door.  I noticed that there were lights shining on the lower portion of the curtain. I thought that someone was outside with a flashlight pointing it towards my sliding glass door.  I was alone and so I was too  scared to look out through the glass to see who was out there.  Even though I was scared I went right to sleep.  I woke up at or around 5:30 AM.  The thing that woke me up, was that my left hand was freezing cold.  I wondered how my hand could be so cold when it was under the blankets.  I got up and went to the bathroom and when I got up I saw that the light had grown and that my entire window was now lit up with the light shining towards it.  This scared me more and I didn’t dare look out through the sliding glass door.  By the way, the sliding glass door leads to the back yard and there is no houses behind it and no streets facing that side of the house. I went into the adjacent room and looked out the window.  This window faced the side of the house and just around the corner from it is the back of my house.  The area was lit up as if there was lights on outside.  It was not coming from the next door neighbor’s house because no one lives there and there is no sensor lights on that house.   I then looked out the other window which faces the street.  I saw that it was dark across the street.  The lights on the house across the street were turned on as if they were up getting ready for work.  The houses next to that house were dark.  The house that had the lights on did not have a lit up yard as I did, the yard was lit but dim.   I then saw a light shining towards my house from the street and it looked like a car was coming.  I turned to see who it was and I saw a round light that was probably 6-8 feet diameter travelling toward the cul-de-sac.  The light was about 5 feet or so off of the ground and was so bright that it was blinding.   I waited for it to pass because I wanted to see what kind of truck it was.  When it passed my house, it disappeared.  At the same time the lights in the yard went out and it became dark.  I was left dumb founded and I couldn’t figure out if it disappeared because I was so blinded by the light or if it a new kind of truck with only one light. I couldn’t go back to sleep and nor could I make sense of what happened.  Later that day I asked the neighbors if they saw anything.  No one saw a thing and they all suggested that it might have been a UFO.   After thinking about it, I concluded that they might be correct.  I thought about it and remembered that UFOs have a lot of energy and concluded that if it was a UFO my Toyota Prius that is electric would have improved gas mileage.  Because my Prius measures mileage continuously, there was a record of mileage on the car.  I looked and saw that my highest mileage ever was 49 miles per gallon.  I took a day trip of 189 miles after this incident and my mileage was recorded at 75 miles per gallon.",2016-04-01T00:00:00,38.3856,-120.6434

I thought it was the clouds fading out Venus in the Western sky but then the two planes that were flying in that direction got in view and the bright white light disappeared it wasn't Venus I saw in the Western sky and it sure wasn't a reflection of some plain headlight because it was way too big I thought it was the planet Venus, but I think I just saw a UFO it was a white bright orb and it disappear just like that !!!!!!!!!!!!",2016-04-01T00:00:00,42.30922619808307,-83.4868319488818

At this point I was in front of the hospital and observed a diamond shaped craft flying in circles above the hospital.  On each side of the craft there were lights a red one and a green on. In the middle it appeared to have the white light.  None of the lights were blinking but steady.  There was no noise, which I could hear, coming from the object. As I passed the hospital I saw the object continuing to fly in circles.   I did not observe it land or fly in any other direction.

"6 ""Strobing"" Lights in Formation + 2 Large Orbs + 1 Slow-moving Red Light.

Wow! I stepped out onto my second-floor porch, facing 260 degrees West, at approximately 10:20 p.m. ET.  Just to my right, I noticed 6 small, but bright lights, like “strobes”, the brightness of LED-type white lights.  They were lined up one behind the other, not in a straight line, but in a broken pattern, still flashing quickly.  I assume this was due to deviation in altitude or alignment on one side or the other.  If you picture a straight line, then they would look like one above, one below, etc.  They were not in a tight formation.  There was some distance between them.  I would estimate that they were no more than a quarter mile in front of me and an approximate altitude of 2,500 feet, give or take.  (This is a little harder for me to establish.)  They were moving from North to South, at a steady pace.   After observing for about 20 seconds, and questioning myself as to what they were, I opened the door and called for my friend to come outside.  He came straight out and the last two were just to my left, and no longer right in front of me.  All told, about 45 seconds.  We watched them continue about 177-180 degrees South, toward the beach.  It is about a .2-mile walk to the water‘s edge.  (This island, the next to last on the southern NC coast is no more than one-half mile wide at any point, and actually runs East-West.  It is less than 20 miles above the NC/SC state line and probably less, as the crow flies.)  We watched them until they could no longer be seen from our vantage point.  The street is lined with two and three-story houses on both sides and some with palms out front.  I must add that the western atmosphere was completely clear, no clouds whatsoever.  There is a street light outside, and, although the artificial lights do not allow the beauty of all the evening stars, it did not interfere with what we observed.  It was about 63 degrees and the wind was approximately 10 mph, S to N/NW.  We then went through the house to the back porch, facing East, but turning our attention South.  My friend went down the back staircase to the seawall and stood about 35 feet away  from where I was standing on the steps.  Within a minute we began to see the lights again, as they were now moving West to East.  We did not have a great vantage point though, as they were emerging from behind rooftops and there was a slight cloud cover looking South.  Now their appearance was in a “soup”.  However, we continued to watch and in another minute or two, there appeared a large and somewhat muted yellow-orange orb or light, I expect due to the cloud cover.  This was at approximately 160 degrees South and high above the rooftops.  It wasn’t completely round…almost like a fat tear-drop…lighter, pale yellow, at the top and more of a light orange around the bottom.  It was illuminated for about 2 - 2.5 seconds.  In about 5 - 7 seconds, another one appeared to the right, but was somewh! at smaller, and appeared for about 2 seconds.  About 30 seconds later, my friend could see only 3 of the lights, now moving West, still in formation.  The houses along the beach blocked his view.  He then walked through the yard to the front and stood in the street.  Still, the houses blocked his view.  He stated that they were at a lower altitude.  I continued to watch toward the South, but nothing.  However, within about 3-4 minutes, a red light appeared from that area (about 140 degrees SE), from behind the cloud cover, and turned Southeast to North.  It was at a higher altitude, and farther away.  It was traveling very slow.  I could not detect any other color than red.  My friend had come back through the house to the back and I pointed out the red light that had appeared.  I watched it off-and-on for at least 6-8 minutes.  Nothing else happened.  It was still traveling on a northern path when I came inside about 10:45 - 10:50 p.m. ET.  At that point the red light was at about 30 degrees North.  (My back door face 80 degrees East.)",2016-04-01T00:00:00,33.9259,-78.4498
