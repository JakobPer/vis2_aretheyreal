It went from horizon to horizon traveling from west to east - the exact opposite direction from which the anticipated Leonid Meteor Shower was to occur. I did not actually time it, but I believe that it was visible between a minute and a half and two minutes--long enough for me to study it as it traversed the sky. As the fireball crossed the sky, it gave off several very bright colors that appeared to be a metallic disintegration or burning. It was glowing predominantly white on the leading edge with blue just behind the white. In my mind, the blue indicated that a copper compound or copper substance was involved. There was some red and yellow as well, and as I observed it, I could clearly see chunks coming off it and burning up in the same manner as the main fireball. It left a smoke trail, but I did not hear a sonic boom as I expected that I might. My first thought was that I was witnessing the reentry of the MIR space station, or something similar in nature. It did NOT appear to be an intelligently controlled craft--unless it was a craft in great distress. It would be difficult to say exactly what I saw.

An orange tail stretched out behind the fireball to a length of approx. 1 1/2 to 2 fists when held at arms length. It arched across the night sky in front of me from the left of my windshield to my right passenger window and appeared to break into 4 large pieces, (now yellow) and drop behind the trees to my right. It appeared very low in the sky and most remarkably, it seemed to move in slow motion for a metiorite. To illustrate just how long it was in the sky, about 1/2 way through its flight, I had time to slow the car down and remove my seat belt to watch it. Just then I saw the headlights of another car approaching from the other direction and since this was a winding country road, I thought I had better pay more attention to my driving and proceeded to drive past this approaching car and when I pulled off the road to see if I could still see the tail, I was shocked to see it still traveling above the tree line over my right shoulder.                            I am a photographer, 41 years old, 20-10 vision, and have watched the Persius metiorite shower every year for the last 18 years from a beach in North Carolina. I have seen metiorites impact in the ocean and have seen them so close that my wife and I could hear them breaking up. None have ever lasted for more than a few seconds. This reminded me of the film of the re-entry of the U.S. space station over Australia many years ago. This was the most impressive event I have ever seen. Most of the city saw the object and the radio, (700 WLW) talked about it for the rest of! the nig ht. Reports included the 5 air traffic controllers at Greater Cincinnati Airport saying that they were ""frozen"" by the sight of this and that they had never seen anything like it in their 15 years in the tower. When asked if it appeared on radar one replied, (sic) No, I think it was was too fast for the radar to pick up, but when pressed he replied that he was too busy watching it out the window to look at the radar scope. I wonder if they will review the tapes. Tim Headrick, the weatherman on our Chanel 12 WKRC-TV said that he also saw the object and it appeared to him to be at least the size of a semi tractor-trailer. He commented that it could be one of three things; 1) Leonid metiorite shower 2) Re-entering ""Space Junk"" 3) ""Something else"" infering a UFO You might like to talk to him.",1999-11-17T00:00:00,39.17450311744155,-84.48136299381886

The lights were horizontal when we first saw them. I held my hand at arm's length and opened my hand as far as I could.  Then I held my hand up to the lights and they spanned longer than the distance between the tips of my thumb and index finger.  It passed over my subdivision as it continued in it's path. It took approximately 10 seconds for it to travel from one end of my subdivision to the other (about one mile), but the lights spanned over at least 1/4 of that mile.)  It was very long. We heard no noise, but it was traveling at a low altitude -- lower than the airplanes fly over the subdivision as they ready to come in for a landing. We could not make out a form of the object it could have been cigar shaped or disc shaped (assuming that the lights were positioned on the outside edge of the object.)  As it moved, it passed behind some clouds and then reappeared.  Then the string began to slowly aim downward at approximately a 45 degree angle to the earth.  It continued downward and I could guestimate that if it were to hit the earth, it would hit somewhere in Flint, which is 10 miles NE of Swartz Creek. At that point, we could no longer see it. (I was expecitng to see it either ascend and reappear or to see some flash or something to indicate that it crashed).  We did not see it again.    I felt that the object was at least 5 miles away when it began to tilt downward. The distance between each light remained constant throughout the sighting. Fint's Bishop airport is about 4 miles from Swartz Creek.  There were no planes near the object at the time, but I could see about 4 planes much higher in the sky and much further away.

At this time it appeared that there were in fact three lights on the object.  It seems possible that the lights were on the wing tips and the front landing gear of an aircraft.   There were a few strange things: 1. absolutely silent, no noise of any kind, not even when the object passed by and was leaving our area.  We appeared to be directly behind the object (usually you will hear some sort of ""rumble"" after a plane leaves.)  2. The object was not moving for a number of minutes (I realize that an airplane coming straight towards you does not appear to be moving).  3.

These ""stars"" were so bright I thought I had lost my bearing and was seeing double on  a planet.  Just then, the other driver said, ""Do you see what I see ahead?""  I said, ""Yeah, they were never there before""  We both were watching them and these very intense lights began to fade.  This was weird because unlike a light bulb going out they faded slowly for a good 5 to 6 seconds into the darkness.  There was no movement and no clouds to dissapear into if this were a plane.  We talked among ourselves and concluded, based on the landing lights of aircraft in the area that these lights were far too bright, too far apart and too motionless to be that of conventional aircraft.  We both decided that I should report this to you.  Thank you.",1999-11-23T00:00:00,,

Then my eye was drawn to an other object which was flying below, also in a northwesterly direction(this craft was heading more north than west)however,this object was flying at a great rate of speed and traveling at a much lower altitude. The object looked ""completely black"" and traveling ""without lights"". It seemed to be traveling without sound as well,however,there was noise from the conventional aircraft flying at a much higher altitude above,so maybe the one craft masked the sound of the other.

I observed them moving under independant control! They seemed to be able to lengthten or shorten the contrail emission. I also observed jet aircraft flying toward these objects. The objects would change postions when the aircraft was remotely near them. One object seemed to park in a postion facing the setting sun. The other was further west from the sun and was also parked for a good bit of the time. A jet flew toward its postion at a higher altitude. It took off from its stationary position in a 90o angle to the south west. Then it accellerated leaving a long dark colored contrail( all other contrails were white) behind it.

One craft or three I don't know. This is an addendum to a report I made approx 16 hours ago concerning a craft of unknown identity spotted in Austin TX. Craft Size: It was between a quarter and half-dollar held at arm's length. Of course that is an estimation and I cannot give it any weight. I can say that the circle / lights were distanced 1 1/2 circle / light  diameters apart and if linked would from an equilatoral triangle. An imaginary cicle periphery drawn around the three lights would be 2.5 times the size of each light. The craft proceeded north triangle point leading. The lights had depth to them and appeared as shallow domes of light. The effect was something like viewing a tent with a lightsource inside. You don't see the source but its interaction with the tent material. So too were these lights. They appeared to softly luminesce these shallow domes in a very off orange color. As I mentioned somewhere between subdued peach and burnt ocher. During and immediately after the incident I recorded other visible activity in the sky and this consisted of three other, conventional, aircraft. None interacted with the object and appeared to be normal air traffic. The closest was at least 3-5 kilometers away and the farthest between 8 and 12. Two were generally northeast and one (the farthest) was west. Austin-Bergstrom international airport lies east southeast approx 5 miles away. I hope this comletes this report accurately for you. If I can clarify anything further please let me know. A copy of my initial report is enclosed below. My wife and I were returning to work after a lunch break. I stepped outside and looked up to see the moon. Instead what I saw were three dome shaped lights that were moving north at a constant rate of travel. All three lights were the same color something between a subdued peach & burnt ocher. They did not blink or flash. The lights were either three individual craft moving in perfect triangular formation, or they were attached to one indistinguishable craft. All moved exactly in unison! The craft covered about 40 degrees of sky in less than ten seconds and maintained a constant velocity. No noise accompanied this sighting. I shouted over and over at my wife to ""Look at this! Look at this!"" She was closing the door behind me and turned and observed the craft for about seven seconds. After continuing across the sky in a straight line the UFO disappeared seemingly winking to nothing as it went into the night. My wife was extrememly shaken. I too felt this, but I also felt excitement. Disbelief. Never have I seen anything even close. I am an Army veteran and am trained in aircraft identification. This was absolutely not a conventional powered aircraft. Nor is it anything I have ever been instructed to watch for.

There was no visible source on the craft as to where the light was coming from. The object was noticed as mirror like due to the fact that the ground was being reflected off of it when the light would activate. Unknown on the exact distance of the craft but it was fairly close. I pulled onto the shoulder where I could observe the object better. The object was moving southbound very slowly. The light would activate randomly and had no particular pattern. The light was no particular color and you could detect movement by the reflection off of the object while the light was on. When there was no light from the craft you could barely see it due to the fog but you could make out faintly the outline of the top portion. Traffic was sparse and other cars/trucks passed but no one had stopped. After a few minutes the passenger of my vehicle rolled down his window. We could hear no sounds but could still see the object.

It traveled at the speed a blue angel would travel during an air show in a dive toward the ground. It's speed was not as fast as the meterors I have watched. It was also huge in comparison to the meterors I have seen. Unlike the meterors, there was no trail of debris behind it. The passenger described the light as having a metallic look after it dimmed and thought it was some sort of craft which accelerated away from us but I can't confirm that observation as I was also watching for cattle on the open range; having previously come upon a group of cattle standing in the middle of the road.

I'm a woman, age 54 and a life long resident of Brighton Township. I've been seeing about four UFOs per year in recent years although, my first sighting occurred during the 60's, though, this is only the second sighting I've ever reported. My first reported sighting was of a black triangle, on 12/09/00 about a mile from this sighting. I've seen about 20 UFOs in my lifetime and all of them have occurred within this two mile radius. I've begun to noticing that these UFOs tend to ""wink-out"" at similar points in the sky and I think that these similar locations might indicate some sort of flight path or ""entrance-exit doorway of some kind."" I really don't like seeing them. They baffle my mind quite a bit. Anyway, I drew this image at a friend's request and thought I might as well send it to the UFORC, too. :-) My report : At 6:25 PM, from my kitchen window, on December, 15th, 2000, I noticed a large, intensely, bright, bluish-white strobing light flying north from the Beaver or Vanport area of western Pennsylvania . Its speed seemed normal but it flew unusually low and close to my house and was perhaps, only 200 feet away from me for 5 seconds or so. This wasn't a normal flight path. As the strobe flashed, about once per second, it  illuminated the craft's body, momentarily and, I could then, see that this craft was oblong, wingless, disk-like and of a dull, dark, brownish-gray color. There were also a few areas of very hazy, dimly lit, multi-colored light, of red and yellow-green, around the right side of the craft which,  seemed like windows but with no apparent structural definition or frame work around them. These window-like areas seemed to merge with the surface of the craft's outer surface. The disk seemed to be about15 feet wide as, it passed just behind a tall tree in my yard.  I heard no noise from this craft at this close grange nor at any other time. Immediately after this craft passing by my window, it made a sharp 45 degree, westerly turn, towards an open field and hovered about 100 feet above the ground. about 75 yards from my window. This dark craft had no other lights. At this angle, the disk looked very black except for the small surface area being illuminated by its flashing strobe.  Although, the outer countours of the craft were  barely distinguishable from the darkness of the surrounding landscape, the craft's slight drifting movements provided  me with some indication of its disk-like shape. The strobe was located at the tip of a short, thin appendage, about three or four feet in length, along the center portion of the disk's side.  As the craft moving very slowly  westerly while low in the field and about100 feet from the ground, I noticed that its strobing light seemed to be rotating, clockwise about a fourth of the way around the side of the disk. But perhaps, there is another was of viewing this apparent rotation. I noticed, too, that this strobe light was always pointing towards the north, even though, this craft was in the process of making a sharp, 45 degree turn towards the west and the strobe light was always pointing north, in spite of the disk's varying flight path . This fixed, northernly directed pointing of the strobe's appendage  remained consistent throughout my sighting or at least, during the time that I could  see the craft clearly before, it departed far into the west.  When the strobe was at it closest, low over the field, I could see this strobe's appendage wavering, back and forth, a few feet CW then, CCW, every three seconds or so as it hovering. This slight wavering or gliding back and forth movement of the appendage sort of reminded me of the subtle wavering of a compass needle. These wavering movements were quite obvious though, not perfectly rhythmic or uniform in the length or duration of each swing. This disk then, stopped and hovered, a seconds time, about 250 to 300 feet above ground and about 150 yards away.  The strobe no longer at this disk's front end, as it had been during its approach towards my house from the south, was now casting enough light upon the craft's surface to illuminate and reveal its very dull, dark brownish-gray color, very faintly. This color resembled that of a darkened, tarnished penny though the craft, itself, always looked very black in the areas not being illuminated by the strobe. I observed this craft for about one minute before it continued on westward, at a slightly higher altitude and speed than that of an airliner. As this craft gradually faded out of sight in the distant western sky, it didn't visually descend towards the horizon but rather remained high in the mid-sky.  The sky was very heavily over-cast at that time and no stars were visible. As the craft headed west, I sighted smaller crafts following it. These crafts flew passed, one by one, about one minute apart, over a period of about ten mintues. Each followed the disk's path, though, none of these smaller crafts flew in close to my house and hovered there.  All of these smaller crafts flew directly in the direction of the departing disk.  These crafts, also, flew slightly faster than airliners and they did make engine noise. One flew close enough that I could see its underside with binoculars (I hadn't had time to grab them when I really needed them for viewing the disk) With binoculars, I could see two bright, bluish-white, flashing lights, one on each of its wing tips. These bluish-white, alternatingly, flashing lights seemed to create the illusion of a blue line running from wing tip to wing tip, on the underside of the plane.   Or perhaps, I was actually seeing a single light that moving rapidly from one wing tip to the other, in a manner similar to how I might draw long lines of light in the air by waving or writing in the air with a hand held flashlight. When viewing the closest of these approaching small planes, its bright flashing bluish-white lights would reflect back upon the underside of its wings which seemed to be unusually broad and of a similar color to that of the disk, itself. Towards the rear on its underbelly were two broad clusters of non-blinking, dimly lit lights. One cluster was red and the other amber. In side view, from a distance, these crafts displayed what appeared as a single small, yet, very bright, flashing light that alternating between rhythmic flashes of jerky pink and white light.  The disk's strobing light, on the other hand, seemed to more in a straighter, smooth line without this visual jerky motion. I noticed no electrical disturbances during my sighting.",2000-12-20T00:00:00,40.6974,-80.3735

First of all let me say this.  I love to watch those UFO shown on Discovery and TLC.  But I do so for entertainment purposes.  I think, or thought, the whole UFO thing was a bunch of bunk. But last night I saw something that was truly unknown to me.  I was standing outside a ham radio friend's house and we were talking about amateur satellites.  There were four of us in this group. A kid in the group started pointing out constelations.  When I started looking at what he was pointing out, I noticed what I thought was a satellite.  It appeared to be a star which was moving from south to north, and it tracked almost straight overhead. It looked just like a low orbit satellite (I've seen many of those before) but it was moving much too fast.  A low orbit satellite would take about 10 minutes to track across the night sky.  This object took under a minute. There were no flashing lights or sounds associated with this object.  In fact, I told the others it was probably a satellite, but I later decided that it couldn't have been.  Then I thought it could have been a piece of space junk entering the earth's atmosphere, but this object left no trail or flaming debris. I have ruled out in my mind all the possibilities.  As much as I hate to admit it, I have seen an Unidentified Flying Object. If you guys know what this light could have been, I would love to hear back from you.  I'm all out of explanations.

There is no such airport for at least 25 miles, which is just a rural airstrip, with the ground lights activated via keying the radio mike (no need for landing lights). The craft had strobes that did flash, HOWEVER there were two things unusual about this.  First, the strobes were white (there were two strobes for sure, but possibly a third, they blinked so erratically that it was hard to tell), not normal for Canadian aircraft (standard is red and blue), second, they did not blink at normal intervals, they blinked randomly. (note: it is possible the pilot was flying without his nav strobes and was blinking landing lights, but they seemed of the strobe nature, not of aircaft landing lights.)  The lights passed over the road in an east-southeast direction, being nearly directly above my vehicle as it passed over the road.  Believe me, it scared me half silly.  It is worthy to note that two years (this summer) within 4 miles of spotting these lights there was a suspected cattle mutilation.  Of that I do have pictures which I took myself.  If you so desire I could get them to you within a couple weeks (I'm away at University right now, but will be going home in a couple weeks and could scan them.)",2001-03-16T00:00:00,,
A bright object followed the deputy sheriff's patrol boat for approximately seven miles.,Fort Collins,CO,,cigar,10 minutes,"Occurred : 6/10/1963 03:00  (Entered as : 06/10/63 0300) Reported: 3/10/2001 12:27 Posted: 3/16/2001 Location: Fort Collins, CO Shape: Cigar Duration:10 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16772.html,"((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We are grateful to the gentleman who submitted the report.  PD)) A bright object followed the deputy sheriff's patrol boat for approximately seven miles. I was a deputy sheriff and a boat warden at Horsetooth Reservoir.  Horsetooth Reservoir is located approximately 5 miles west of Fort Collins, CO.  It lies between two small hills, one to the east and one to the west.  The laske itself is probably 3 quarters of a miles in width and seven miles long.  The length of the lake is north and south.  At approximately 3:00 A.M. I received a call at home from the sheriff's office notifying me that there was some sort of a light flashing in the water at the very north end of the lake.  I notified ((name deleted)) who was in charge of the Lalrimer County Recreation District.  He said he would meet me at the docks at the south-west side of Horsetooth where I was going to board the patrol boat.  We got in the boat, headed out at Thompson's Cove and into the main body of the lake.  It was an extremely dark night.  I drove the patrol boat north at a reasonable but safe speed, considering the darkness.  When we got to the north end of the lake, we discovered the flashing light in the water that was reported as a possible distress signal, was actually a bouy that had been placed in the water to mark temperature sensing equipment.  A bouy with a flashing light on it had been placed in the water by the State Game and Fish Department.  Realizing there was no real emergency, we were getting ready to head back south when, all of a sudden, a huge, bright object appeared just to our east and just above the hills on that side of the lake.  I could not make out a structure.  It was a very large, oblong-shaped, brilliant white light.  We commented on it and couldn't imagine what it was.  I started moving south in the patrol boat when ((name deleted))  said, ""((name deleted)), this thing is moving with us.""  I stopped the patrol boat and the object continued just a little farther south along the ridge and then it stopped.  We started south again in the patrol boat, the object continued to parallel us.  When we got near the south end of the reservoir, the object was still with us and directly to our east.  It loo! ked like it was a little lower above the top of the ridge.  It made the top of the ridge appear as if it was almost daylight.  We could see the entire makeup of the hillside, even shadows.  At this point the object started giving ((name deleted)) and me a bad case of the ""creeps"".  I stopped the patrol boat and we both sat and looked at the object.  I told ((name deleted)), ""This is getting too creepy.""  So I shut of the patrol boat and turned off the running lights.  We sat in the boat quietly and just observed this extremely brilliant light.  After maybe 30 or 40 seconds the object left the area of the lake and in a split second headed north and became a tiny object someplace over Wyoming.  We watched the entire disappearance of the object.  The acceleration of the object was absolutely phenomenal and there was no sound whatsoever from the object.  I started up the patrol boat and turned on the running lights.  ((name deleted))  and I just kind of sat there and looked at each other trying to understand what happened.  When ((name deleted))  said, ""Do you need the publicity.""  I said, ""No"".  ((name deleted)) looked at me and said, ""Let's go home.""  I turned the patrol boat into Thompson's Cove, tied it up to the dock and we went home.  This entire situation really shook us up a lot and I honestly don't believe we ever talked about it to each other again.  I think ((name deleted)) is now deceased and since I'm now 68 years old, I think it is a good time to get this incident recorded.  At the time I did not want to talk to newspapers, radio stations, etc. and be in a position to answer any number of questions and opinions from all kinds of people.  When you are in public service the last thing you want to happen is to be caught in the middle of some kind of a controversy.  That possibility is bad enough when you are able to prove how, what, when, where, why, etc.  It would be a nightmare when, in the case of this bright object, all your proof disappeared in a split second into the night and was somewhere over Wyoming or who knows where?",,40.55069822812846,-105.07729501661129

Here is my story: On the morning of January 31, 2001, as I was about to leave for work, something caught my attention in the sky that didn't look like anything that I was familiar with. As I observed for a few moments I realized it was definitely nothing conventional, so I ran back in the house, grabbed my Sony camcorder, and took an amazing video of several strange objects. There were two actual sightings that morning. The first sighting was of a single object that appeared circular with a highly reflective surface or blinking light, and possible rotation. Estimated altitude was above 10,000 feet. The object was in motion from west to east most of the time and blinking or reflecting sunlight at intervals, but did stop momentarily at one point, changed direction in a slow pace, hovered for several minutes, and then changed direction once again gaining altitude where it eventually disappeared behind a cloud. The second sighting occurred about 10 minutes after the first sighting ended. This sighting was of two different looking objects moving in tandem from north to south at a slow pace and appeared to have originated in the same general area of the sky where I lost sight of the first object. These objects appeared higher in altitude, possibly 20,000 feet or higher. The two objects were different in color from each other. Leading object was white with gray accents and some noteable structure, and the trailing object appeared black in color with a tinge of white reflection. At one point the leading object moves up and over the top of the trailing object and takes a position just behind it. After about 5 minutes I lose sight of them in the glare of the morning sun. After reviewing the tape I decided that it needed further study, so I sent a copy to Tom King for his expert opinion. His findings including stills and downloadable video clips of my footage can be accessed from his Skynet web site at www.ufovideo.com Later I sent a copy to Chris Miller of www.ufofootage.com. He was able to generate some great enhanced stills and video clips from the raw footage. One interesting characteristic of the first object that Chris discovered was a powerful light source emitting from the object. Only by slowing the footage down and viewing it frame by frame can you see a distinct blue to red color pattern of this light. I recently received a letter from Jeff Sainio of MUFON with results of his analysis of my video. His findings were inconclusive as he was unable to determine in any capacity what the objects are or are not. My story as well Chris Miller's comments and pictures on it can be viewed at: http://home1.gte.net/res0cs5f/ufo-1/ufo-1.htm ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC rarely allows either names or URL addresses to appear in this portion of a report on our website, but we will make an exception in this case.

We have had less exposure to the work of Chris Miller, but his website does have an analysis of the footage alluded to in this report, and it appears to be carefully prepared.

My parents were gone camping and their neighbors to the right were on vacation, across the street were on vacation and the house to the left was empty, so the neighborbood was unusually dark and quiet.  I brought my clothes in the house and some other luggage through the back door, which is seldom used, because I wanted to a have a cigarrette on the back deck.  I brought everything through the back door and sat on the couch and turned the televsion on.  I sat their for a couple of minutes flipping through the channels when I realized that I was going to have a smoke.  I jumped up and quickly walked to back door which has a window beside it that faces the living room I was sitting in.  I opened the door, stepped out onto the deck, turned to my left, and saw something hovering about three feet away from me, apparently looking in the window.  It was a small, clear, long and thin object.  It kind of looked like a beaker with a yellow light in the center that had a steady, rythmic yellow flash and didn't make a sound.  When I saw it and it had seen me, it floated away from the window and a little closer to me.  I wanted to reach out and grab it, but I was a little scared.  Plus it kind of looked like it may be hot or even sharp or anything that could cause sever pain.  I hovered there and kind of checked me out for about 15 to 20 seconds, then slowly flew toward a large pine tree in our neighbors yard.  It looked like it was trying to hide from me behind the tree, but I could still see it's steadily blinking yellowish light through the branches.  Every once in a while it would come out from behind the tree a little ways, see me, then hide back behind the branches.  After a minute or so, it slowly rose into the sky.  It went higher and higher until I lost sight of it what seemed like about a mile up in ! the sky. After I stood and looked closer, I could see a yellow light flashing way the hell up in the sky and I thought it might be an airplane.  After a few seconds, however, it flew across the sky very, very fast, hovered up there for a while, then slowly lowered itself until it was on the other side of the neighbors house, exactly where they had window facing South.  After about 10 seconds, I saw it again hovering just over the neighbors house, then it slowly floated back off into the neighborhood and disappeared.  I went inside shut the windows, locked the doors and didn't leave until the next morning when I went up the mountain to tell my parents what I had seen.",2001-04-28T00:00:00,44.2195,-106.6002

I would like to add additional info. that was not listed.  When first seeing the moving lights(several in the trees next to barn about 100ft away from me) I thought it was helicopters, but there was no sound. After opening the gate, I looked up the balls of light morphasized into a boomerang shaped craft and was sitting on top of my barn with wings overlapping both sides of the barn(150 ft wide)and just 15 ft above my head.  It was of unusual texture, almost like a shark, did not reflect light and was boomerang in shape. I was not afraid at all. The really strange part of the story was after opening the gate for my husband to drive in.(He always waits for me to close gate and get back in the car)This time he drove right passed me and did not stop. Somehow I got to the entrance of the barn before he did and was there when he got out of the car.(I can not get this point off of my mind and I wonder if we were abducted) There did seem to be some time lapse of 30 to 45 minutes.   We both watched the UFO disappear over the barn. It seemed to go invisable and we could see stars through it. Over a year later we were informed by ISUR that a neighbor(in his seventies) had seen so many lights over and around our barn that he had bought a Video Camero in hopes of video taping the lights.  This makes over 5 people other that my husband and myself that had seen ufo type objects over our farm. The following is the case study by ISUR At approx. 11:30 pm on a weekday evening during the first week of March 1997 (*there is some uncertainty as to the exact day), Mr. and Mrs. Doe (pseudonyms) were returning to their home, located east of the city of Canton, in unincorporated Cherokee County GA. The Does run a horse farm, utilizing a large industrial-type building (which they call a""barn"") located some 200-300 feet off the highway. As they got up to the fence gate at the end of the driveway, Mrs. Doe noticed a large, lighted object up above and to the right, above some very tall pine trees. From the car, both witnesses then observed the object begin to descend, moving toward a position above their barn, in a series of jerky, stop-and-go motions. Mrs.Doe got out of the car to open the gate, and both continued to observe the object while Mr. Doe pulled the car forward to the front of the barn. The witnesses state that the object was hovering only a slight distance (perhaps 10-20 feet) above the barn. Meanwhile, Mrs. Doe walked forward to a point at the corner of the building, where she could clearly see the object directly above her. About the time Mr. Doe got out of the car, the object vanished. The two are not sure whether the disappearance was by ""blinking off like a lightbulb"" (Mr. Doe' impression), or by near-instantaneous acceleration and flying away (Mrs. Doe's impression). Total time of the sighting was estimated, with difficulty, as 3-5 minutes. The object was described as triangular or boomerang-shaped, and very dark, ""darker than shadow,"" ""darker than black."" There was one ""dull red"" light at each (side) end of the object, while the other corner was unlit. It appeared to be as wide as the building (approximately 120 feet). Mr. Doe said that the area between the ""arms"" of the ""V"" was difficult to see and may have been either solid (making it a triangle) or not really filled in (making it more like a boomerang shape). Finally, even though the farm houses about 50 horses as well as geese, cats and dogs, both witnesses noted a total, complete silence throughout the event, a silence the witnesses felt was very strange. Mrs. Doe states that she was not going to report the sighting until a property developer working on a nearby parcel of land came to her home, introduced himself, and said that some men working for him had seen a football-field-sized object above the Doe's property. After the encounter described here, Mrs. Doe then found ISUR's website. An onsite interview and walk-through was conducted by ISUR investigator  and myself on 6/12/97. The two witness' accounts matched up well, although not perfectly, which does not support the idea of a preplanned deception. Mr. Doe could not verify his wife's first impression of a more-lighted object when she initially saw it, although he says that from the drivers' seat he was not in position to see it well. Driving onto the driveway at a later time, I judged that this makes sense; and also, I noted that the driveway lacks enough angle to put a car's headlights up enough to have struck an object hovering above the barn, so there is no logical discrepancy there. Mr. Doe is an amateur astronomer and states that he is very familiar with the night sky, and had recently spent considerable time viewing comet Hale-Bopp. ((NUFORC Note:  ""Mr. and Mrs. Doe"" appear to be pseudonyms.

A large triangular shaped craft then appeared on the horizon over Monterey bay; I thought it was three separate aircraft flying low over the water when first sighted. As it approached us-(I was with one of my daughters)- I realized with shock that it was one aircraft-not three. It had very bright lights at each corner( I mistook these for conventional  aircraft approach lights.)This aircraft was huge and made no sound as it passed directly over us. It was black and very scary- I was afraid for our safety. The triangle flew over us and disappeared like the others before it. While my daughter and I ran for the car a group (7-10) of the orange spheres came in low over us, seeming to follow the big triangle. They flew off in different directions and made a ""whooshing"" sound as they darted off at an extremely high rate of speed. They all vanished like the others before they got very far away.",,36.38391818181818,-121.84402222222222

The passenger in my car was able to get a good look at it and described it as being diamond shaped, like a kite, with white lights on the points. It did not make any noise. It was completely silent. It then moved across the valley going east, flying low, and so smoothly, not real fast, but it was out of sight in a matter of seconds. It was probably going fast, but gave us an illusion of going slower, because it was like gliding over the valley away from us and it didn't make any noise. It really freaked us out.

One incident was a firework display ona city beach the objects were observed by hundreds of people and hardly even commented on. They travelled slowly across the night sky, formed a triangle and then some manouvres then disappeared. They were also seen by my sister and many other people that we spoke to. Each time the behaviour was similar. The glowing golden objects travelled ina perfectly spaced file across the sky out over the sea. They would then manouver into traiangles and other shapes and then either disapear or rocket off at a great speed. On the local radio a man confessed to having released hundreds of orange garbage bag fire powered devices off at various localities. What a psycho - he must have spent a fortune and to what avail? I myself saw on separate occasions, examples of both types of objects. The pyro devices were erratic in behaviour and it was quite obvious to any viewer as to what they were as they flickered and drifted rising and falling. I saw the latter objects on the night of the lunar eclipse. The other orbs travelled in lines straight and at a constant speed not in any erratic fashion at all. We all think that the orbs were some kind of military test. The amazing thing was how blase people were about them. ""Oh UFOS maybe?"" Just thought you might be interested.

It was as though there was a giant lightbulb in the air.  From my point of view, the light was as big as a large tire.  It was so bright that it lit up every inch of the tree that it was near. The air was just so still and unmoving, there was no wind.  There was no sound, it was an uncanny silence.  Something wasn't right. There was also a vibration that seemed to be shooting down upon my house with such a force that the cement floor beneath me vibrated.  The area was suddenly cast with a red glow and then it was gone.  Everything was back to normal.  What I had thought had only been a few minutes, turned out to be almost a half hour.  That spooked me.  The next day when I awoke, I thought it was just a vivid dream.  I walked outside and was throwing out birdseed for the birds, I noticed little droplets of metallics in the backyard.  Not one or two droplets but 5-6.  Stuff like that would never be in our backyard, and no one knew where they had came from.

I was bringing in the groceries when out of the corner of my eye I noticed a very bright, stationary light in the Northern sky about 30 - 45 degrees off the horizon. I turned to look at it - it was extremely bright, high in the sky and about the size to my eye of about 3 or 4 bright stars combined. As I watched it, another smaller, but just as bright light, came flying at an incredible speed out of the east, intersected with the larger light and they both moved flew up and away, again at incredible speed, and were quickly out of sight. I called to my husband when I noticed the first light, but by the time he got outside they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,41.0161,-95.2184

While there on a cloudless night a triangular shaped object sped across the sky from horizon to horizon at incredible speed.  There was no sonic boom, no vapor trail we could see; no noise at all.  We couldn't see the object itself, only three bright lights of different colors, maybe green and blue, which defined the shape as a very large triangle.  There had been reports of an expected meteor shower that night, and at first we wondered if that is what we were seeing.  But it flew to low to be meteors and there was no streaking affect like you usually see with those. Also, the color of the lights didn't change.  We were speechless for we knew we had witnessed something highly unusual.  For many years we talked about it.  My father died in 1995.  He had been in the military and was quite knowledgeable about planes.  He was absolutely sure it was no terrestial aircraft, partly because of the color pattern he was. I am not quite sure of the year.  It might have been a year or two sooner.  I know I wasn't in high school yet.  But I wanted to leave a record of this on file so at least someone would know it happened.  The most important aspect of the sighting was the speed and size of the object.

Navy, and they may be part of the ""N.O.S.S."" satellite system.    We doubt that the phenomenon is caused by a ""stealth blimp,"" as the witness suggests.  PD)) Formation of three silent lights traveling in a large perfectly unison traingle as if all apart of one single object Was staring south upward at the sky watching shooting stars + meteors when suddenly I noticed that a perfect triangular formation of three bright seeming ""stars"" were moving in unison  southward at a very steady pace like an airplane, only completely silent,  and descending in elevation. Being that I live in a second floor condo and the light formation that was incredibly large (as far as the point to point distance of each of these lights at each corner of the triangle object were) , and very bright, -it quickly disappeared from my balcony view... so I ran downstairs and to the back of my building into open space, but the object had already disappeared in less than a minute from when I had originally spotted it. I've seen satelites before and this was much much too large to be a sattelite of any kind. I also checked to make sure the ISS was not scheduled to make any orbits over the Denver area this eve. Dear Ms. ((deleted)),   Thank you very much for the interesting report! We would like to know what the apparent size of each of the three lights was, relative, for example, to the size of a star, please. Also, are you certain that they were traveling due south, or could the formation have been moving to the southeast, perhaps? Finally, how did the objects disappear from your sighting, please?  Did they go over the horizon and disappear from sight, suddenly, or what??   Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center!  We think we know what you saw tonight, but the answers to our questions above will help us reach some kind of tentative conclusion. Cordially, Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) Dear Mr. Davenport: Thankyou for contacting me. In regards to the question of the triangle form I saw this eve 05/13/01 @ aprox 10:30 pm mtn time. Yes, it did appear to be moving slightly South/eastwardly. Basically what I saw was three points of light in a perfect triangular form. I saw no object within these three points , albeit the perfect unison movement of the lights together and the steady pace they traveled at suggested the three corner lights that formed the perfect triangle were the corners of an object I simply could not see with my naked eye.  Each of these three  lights were no bigger than the star dots one sees with their naked eye when staring up at the night sky, however the vast distance between each point was tremendous, much larger than any sattelite  or space shuttle could be and the brightness of each dot of ""seeming"" star light was comparable to the shine reflect of a planet being viewed in the night sky with little more than a pair of binnoculars. The departure from my sight was due as follows: As it moved away in its south eastward direction-  The roof of my balcony blocked my view.. by the time I raced downstairs and made my way to the back of my condo into open space it was already gone. However, please note: That although to my naked eye it appeared to move at a steady pace (much like one sees an airplane in the night sky moving at a steady pace),... It took me aprox only 60 seconds or less to reach that open space in the back of my condo. Now, Considering the apparant largeness of this triangular formation, for it to have disappeared from view altogether or be out of my eyes range in this short period of time, I can only imagine it was in fact traveling at a much greater speed than my eyes originally perceived.  I read some of the reports at the sightings web site about a ?stealth blimp?.. in the shape of an enormous triangle and am currently surfing around the web to see if I can dig up some info on it to see if it perhaps was due to fly over the Denver area this eve...  Albeit, if you have any ideas on what this particular object was.. I do hope you might email me back when you get a chance to let me know. After reading some of the other recent reports filed, apparently others in this area of the west have seen similar triangle point objects as well, that have yet to be explained. Thanks,  ((name deleted)) ((END FIRST RESPONSE)) ((SECOND RESPONSE)) Dear Mr. Davenport: In my follow up web investigation for info about my 5/13/01 unexplained ighting, I learned that according to skunk works at Lockeed, reported in an article by ((author deleted)) @ ((publication deleted)) site:  http:((URL deleted))  What I saw fits the perfect description given for the Stealth Blimp, which apparently has the ability to elude radar and be virtually invisible to the eye in the night sky - so that all one sees are three triangle blips of seeming star light. It is reported that this blimp is also aprox 1,000 feet long!  However, apparently the project is top secret so the public is not allowed to know when it makes its test runs or operations or where. So am betting this is EXACTLY! what I saw tonight..-And- what others have been reporting over the past month or two. If you know of any possible way of obtaining a possible confirmation of this, I'd sure appreciate it if ya'd let me know! :-) Thanks,  ((name deleted))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,39.615879827400214,-104.88518732470335

I was out surfing in the Monterey Bay at a surf spot called ""sharks"" which is near where 41st avenue run from Hiway 1 to the Monterey Bay.  We; myself and 3 or 4 other surfers heard an aircraft overhead and we spotted at about 750 to 1,000 ft. a triangular craft pure black no markings and very thin approximately 3 ft. thick. It was silent.  What we heard was above it a twin engine civilian craft that looked as though it was ""checking out"" the triangle.  The triangle was the shape of a hang-glider but rigid wings and had two small approx 2ft. propellers at the trailing edge of the triangle about 2-3 feet from each of the two points at the rear.  As the triangle was only going about 40 mph the twin engine overtook it quickly and as the triangle went inland over the land without a change in altitude the twin engine that was about 750 ft. above the triangle banked off.  The triangle kept going inland. It went right over our heads and was flying level and was not gliding.  It was under power as proven by its level and slow flight for a long time.  It was not an equalateral triangle but had a trailing edge that was smaller than the leading edges.  It looked unmanned as it was very thin and if a man had been lying down inside of it it would have been very cramped as the total thickness looked to me about 2 feet.  I mentioned the sighting to the other surfers out there with me and I said what the heck was that? One replied a ""stealth"" obviously referring to the stealth bomber or the stealth fighter of which I have seen both in flight doing a couple of fly bys at a Stockton, CA airshow a few years ago.  This was way smaller than the stealth bomber and fighter and was very small.  I spoke to a family relative who worked at Lockheed Missiles and space in LA at the skunk works for several years and he said that the drones they were working on had wooden propellers 2 ft. long made by a local civilian.  The question is why would the military fly a craft over civilians in mid-day at such a low altitude and go over su! rfers a known surfing spot and then go over land?  There was no attempt to hide it. I reported it to the FAA at the Monterey airport and the air traffic controller said to me that if I spotted it again to please let him know.

As I was looking out the window, a very bright light appeared, even with our Northwest airline, and about 1/4 mile away, to the north. At first, I did not know what to think. It was circular, and bright white, and if I had to guess, it looked to be about 50 feet diameter. I began to wonder more about it when it kept pace with the jet, and then it suddenly slowed or stopped, as we kept going. It then came imediately back even with us, and closer, and I then could see the most brilliant, flourescent, pink light around the bright white light, and then a very brilliant, flourescent purple l! ight around the most outer area. the only round part was the white center. The pink and purple were surrounding the sides, and this made it appear to be football shaped, but with deffinate edges, and that is why I call it diamond shape. This whole thing lasted about 45 seconds. The craft made a few sudden direction changes, and then left very fast and was gone. I told friends about this at the time, but did not know where to report it.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,45.6119,-121.58660000000002
My friend and me were coming down the mountain into the valley when I spotted it in the clouds just sitting there as clouds went by it.,Alamosa,CO,1999-07-24T19:50:00,disk,~1 hour,"Occurred : 7/24/1999 19:50  (Entered as : 07/24/99 19:50) Reported: 7/26/1999 14:55 Posted: 8/5/2001 Location: Alamosa (east of, on Hwy 160), CO Shape: Disk Duration:~1 hour",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/008/S08554.html,"My friend and me were coming down the mountain into the valley when I spotted it in the clouds just sitting there as clouds went by it.  I could see it through my binoculars, as well as with the naked eye.  The camera was in the trunk, so I told my friend as soon as we get down to the valley..stop so I can get the camera out.  It took us about 25 minutes to get to where we could pull over.  When we did I got some video of it.  And then we were chasing it, but it was overcast and we lost it in some clouds. On Sat. July, 1999, me and a friend went from Colorado Springs to a barbecue in Cuchara, CO.  And from there we were going to Alamosa to stay the night, because I had seen an episode of ""Sightings"", and they talked about that area having had alot of sightings and weird things in the sky.  So we went to the barbecue, and left for Alamosa around 7 PM. We were in the mountains on highway 160 east, just heading down to go into the valley.  I was looking with my binoculars off and on seeing planes, high flying birds, when something caught my eye about 7:50 PM. It looked like a plane with no wings or tail, just the body. And it was just sitting there!  Clouds were going by, but it just stayed.  It was white, but reflecting the suns rays.  When a cloud would block the sun from it, it would get darker in color.   The camera I had brought was in the trunk and there was no place to stop.  So I told my friend, as soon as we get into the valley lets stop and see if we can get it on video. So, about 25 minutes later we got to flat land.   By now it had gotten ahead of us by about 50 miles or so.  When we had first saw it, it was almost right above us in the car. We stopped and I took some video of it.  There were no stars in the sky, and it was now 8:20 PM.  It was going, it seemed, east to west.  Because that is the way we were traveling.  Unfortunately, after I first filmed it, and by the time we got to Alamosa, it had gone behind some dark clouds.  But that is not all.   The next day, we drove up highway 17 north to Salida, to a place called ""E.T.'s Landing"".  My brother had told me about it, and he said that the owner, back in 95, had video taped two seperate encounters.  So I thought it would be fun to go have lunch at the restaurant.   When we got there they were just opening up, and I asked the waitress kiddingly, ""Have you had any sightings lately?"", and she surprisingly said, ""Well, by the way, the owner said he had got some calls last night and that the ""saucer"" is flying again, around Alamosa.""  What a weekend!   I listen to Art Bell alot, and I have heard Peter on the show many times.  I never thought I would be giving an experience in a report.  But I am glad to have a forum such as this to do so.   Thank you!",2001-08-05T00:00:00,37.46284615384615,-105.783

I&#8217;ve been reluctant to tell the story because I would have a hard time believing it if I heard it from someone else. Here it goes: It was the summer of 99. We were on a remote rural area in eastern Venezuela. It was about one month after we arrived in the area and on a very clear and moonless night. While my friends stayed inside the house having dinner I came out to get something out of the truck, it was very dark and I had to use a flashlight to go outside. While I walked to the truck I noticed that there was a light coming from above, I immediately looked up and saw a round shape object about 200ft wide hovering right on top of the house. It made no sound. I could tell that is was circular because it was covering the stars that were very visible that night. It had a reddish light in the meddle. I immediately called my friends out and we all watched amazed at the craft. One of the girls in the group turned a flash light on and started to make signals to toward the UFO while some others panicked and ran inside, about 10 minutes later the light in the middle became a beam of light that landed right on top of the house, and then a human shaped being floated up and down the beam and seemed to be looking at us, it was impossible to see any details like mouth, nose, etc. because the light was engulfing it, it was also impossible to tell what color it was (it looked dark gray).  After a few minutes it slowly left. The next day we drove in the direction where we thought it had gone and we took a few people from the nearby town so they could guide us trough the very rough terrain. We finally found a large round area where all the grass had died, it wasn't burned, and it was just flat on the ground and dead.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

Object was two to three times the size of the aircraft and left no contrail. I am a truck driver for a large freight company. I drive mostly at night, But at times, get delayed and do not finish my route until late in the morning. On the morning of 1/29/99 while en-route to Santa Maria, Ca from Bakersfield, Ca. on Hwy. 166 just west of Maricopa approx. 3 to 4 miles. Hwy. 166 west of Maricopa turns into a long steep grade which drops the speed of loaded semi trucks down to a crawl. The reduced speed gives me a great opportunity to gaze at the beauty of the San Jaquin Valley below. It also gives me the chance to watch the commercial airlines fly into & out of the Los Angeles area over the mountain range to the south of Hwy. 166. The temperature of the morning of 1/29/99 was down in the mid to low thirties. The aircraft that would fly north over the Grapevine would leave long, thick contrails as they entered the San Jaquin Valley. After listening to Art Bell's discussion a few nights earlier about aircraft leaving strange contrails is what drew my attention to these aircraft and there contrails. As I was watching one airplane and it's contrail I noticed an object just to the left rear of the contrail and the aircraft. It appeared to be about two to three times larger than the size of the commercial airliner. It also seemed to be at the same altitude. This object was unlike any thing I ever seen before. Being bit of a skeptic on UFO's I at first dismissed it as another plane. But then, This object in a matter of a few seconds darted over to a plane that was headed north and followed it for about a minute or two. This got my curiosity up, So at the first turn out I pulled over and got out my binoculars and started watching this object. It would follow one plane for two to three minutes. Then, In a matter of seconds, It would zoom across the sky and start following another airplane. It always stayed just to the rear and left of the plane and it's contrail. The odd thing about this object was that it appeared to be transparent at times, Then solid. The shape of this object would be like! if you put two coffee cup saucers together. One upside down from the other. On top this object had a small dome like shape, But with sharp angles. On the bottom, It had a smaller, More rounded dome shape that ran almost the length of the object. The object had a grey,silver color to it. No lights nor windows were visible any where on this object. Nor were there any type of numbers, letter's or any other identifying marks visible. The other odd thing about this object was the fact that every airplane that flew in the San Jaquin Valley area left a contrail.

This report is being told in all honesty, and even though these two events happened long ago, they have stuck fresh in mind to this day. Here is the report I had given to another organization not too long ago. I was asked in the reporting form to describe the lights if I had seen any, and that is where I started my report at: ""There were many round lights and they were all green. They were not blinding and could make out the pattern of the lights as well as the shapes of the lights very well. Object seemed to be round by the way the lights were set up. Green lights were round in shape and the center row seemed to go around the object. Also remember there were more or just one more light near the top of the center row and one near the bottom of the center row of lights."" The next question in the report form I was filling out, asked to give as much information about the sighting as possible: ""It was a close sighting and lights were seen well. Object was just below the tops of the trees and behind one set of tree line. I was driving home on a road at night where there are at times very little traffic, sometimes no traffic late at night. A road where there are woods on both sides (Alot pine trees) and not many homes built. I think these woods that go along this long stretch of road (which is Rt. 539) are reserved by the McGuire Air Force Base, since they usually have trucks (hummers, etc) travel to and from these dirt roads that come off of this particular road. It was around the time of 1:30 to 2:15 a.m., was so long ago, do not remember the exact time. I was traveling north on Rt. 539. As I came around one bend I noticed a green light to the left side of the road in the woods near the tops of the trees that were closest to the road, up ahead of me. When I got closer, I slowed down to a crawl, while looking upwards towards the top of the tree line, I eventually stopped the car and rolled down the window. I stared at it in puzzlement. I could see the tree branches silhouetted in front of the many green lights of the round object. This is where the most shock kicked in. After I had stopped the car and was looking at it, I started to realize that this object was actually getting lower and was 'very slowly' moving downwards behind the set of trees. I was directly across from the object that was lowering from behind the set of trees. Panic set in and I said to myself **** ****!! Please excuse the language, but it could not be helped. And I slammed my foot onto the gas pedal to leave as quick as possible, I could not drive well, my arms and whole body were shaking. As I was making my way down the road away from where the object was, I looked in my drivers side door mirror, and I saw car headlights coming from around the bend, just before where I was stopped at, and also saw that the object with green lights was no longer there. I did not see the lights any where. Sorry this is so long. And I kept this and another event to myself for so long because I did not know there were so many others seeing u.f.o's until years later when I started to read up about so many other events that others had witnessed. Never knew of all of the ufo sightings by others until I got a computer and was able to read up on sightings information. This is being told in absolute truth. (I did some searching on the about.com website on ufo sightings for in my state, and found a report posted by another lady who seemed to have seen the same object with all green lights at night in 1996.) 2 years later on another night, the same 'exact' object with green lights appeared again in June. In the same area but not in the exact spot, maybe 1 mile further from the first time. This time I was going to head on over to a friends house, I took the same road but heading north this time on rt. 539, but for some reason I decided that maybe I'd go visit my friend another time, and decided to turn off onto another back road to 'turn around'. Well this weird feeling came over me, I don't know why, (I'm in amazement as I write this still now.) As I was slowing down on this other road to get ready to make my u-turn which has no street lights on it, I looked into my passengers side door mirror (I usually had this mirror turned up a little to keep any car's headlights that were behind me from shining into my eyes), I almost had me heart failure, I caught a glimps of green lights, this time higher in the night sky and the moon was almost full this night. I slowed down on the road and turned my head back to quickly look through the back window of the truck I was driving and was able to see this object better. The object was again stationary in one spot maybe 2 tree lengths up above the tree line. This object and the moon were not that far apart, but also not real close to each other, I remember seeing the moon to the right as I was looking above the trees and the object with green lights farther to the left. Once again, I was the only one on these roads at the time. This time I was thinking ""Oh my God, Oh my God, I don't believe this!"" and ""It's back again!!"", and of course panic set in again, and I quickly pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to make a quick u-turn to go back to the road I had come off of. Which means I was turning around to head some what towards the object, because it was the only way I knew of to get back home. Again, I had slammed on the gas pedal after I made the sharp u-turn and was driving quickly. After I made the u-turn in panic, I got myself to look up (to the left side now, above the trees), and saw no green object, only saw the moon. A second after looking again and not seeing the object I saw car headlights up ahead coming from the road I was heading back to get onto. I made it back home and said to myself, 'why when I'm on that road and that thing has to show up are there no other cars around, but when another car was coming around the object would disappear or it's lights would go out...' I did'nt take that road again for a long time, I changed my route. I would also like to ad, that both times that the object was seen, it was motionless in the sky, completely still, except for the first time where it seemed to start lowering after it was remaining still. There also was no sound whats so ever. Today I am now a professional photographer, I do alot of nature photography, but I wish I was then and wish I had a camera on me during these two events. I would prefer being contacted through email if questions and a follow up were needed, but would consider being contacted by phone as well, even though I would'nt have an easy time at all discussing these two events.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,40.0804,-74.4581

Changed direction and dissapeared upwards. I am a BA Honours Graduate and have always been reasonably bright at school.  I had no interest in UFO's at the time I made my sighting and was a run of the mill schoolboy living in a typical street in York. When I had this sighting I was around 11 years old.  I am not sure of the exact date but I am aware that it was sometime in the summer holidays as I was not at school and it was a bright sunny day. We lived in an estate of semi detached houses at the time.  Our garden was small and there is a small drive that seperates our house from the house to the right of us.  The house is located in the suburbs of York. The incident happened very quickly but I am clear in my mind of what I saw, how it behaved and what it looked like.  Although the incident happened a long time ago I was so taken back by what I saw that it has left a clear imprint on my memory. I was standing at my patio doors (which were closed) and looking into the garden.  My mother was hoovering the living room behind me. As I was looking into the garden 1 Object entered my vision from the right. A small cylinder shaped object floated over the fence on the right of the garden.  Its trajectory showed it had come between the houses and it was only 1 or 2 feet away from the corner of the house as it passed over the fence. The trajectory was a slow curve as it seemed to have risen up to avoid the fence and then continued downward after clearing the fence.  (the downward curve took the object from about 8 feet in the air to 6 feet and the object was travelling between 5-10mph).  As I first seen the object it was rising though, so i am sure that it had risen over the fence and dropped again into the garden. At this time it was travelling away from me but coming across my vision.  I was only around 10 feet away from the object at this time.  It then curved sharply upwards and at this point I grabbed my mother who was hoovering behind me. ""whats that"" I said and pointed.  She looked at it for a good few seconds and we both watched it dissapear out of view.  It floated almost like a balloon but rose at such a pace that it was soon out of site.  It also clearly moved in several directions before its steep climb, which shows it was not being blown by the wind. The object was of a grey black colour, of a cylinder shape and very small.  (One of my first thoughts was that it was a balloon but it was the wrong shape,too small and made at least three clear changes in direction.  The object cannot have been more than 5-10 cm from top to bottom and 2-3 cm diameter.  I could not make out any detail on the object so you could say that it was smooth. I heard no noise. Although I was a little intrigued, the fact that this was such an unremarkable and small object made me put it out of my mind.  The only thing that really intrigued me is the way that it moved.  It was totally unexplainable how an object this small could be capable of self powered flight.  One further thing to mention is that the cylinder remianed upright throughout flight and did not spin or wobble, as would be excepted from an object floating in the wind. I realise how easy it is to discredit stories like these and I admit that moments after I had seen the object I began to look for a 'rational' explanation.  I could not think of one.  Perhaps other people have seen similar things or could shed some light on a possible rational explantion.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

I turned around just to see if any of our freinds might have been walking behind us. There weren't any. When I turned around I couldn't help noticing a huge triangular object in the sky kind of comming up behind us. I yelled at mt freind in awe and said something like ""LOOK""! He said, what is it? I said something in the terms of, It's gotta be a UFO!! The object was ""huge"", atleast one hundred feet or more tip to tip. It made no sound what so ever and was fairly evenly lit by a bright light on each corner. It hoovered above us as we watch it for quite a while and we decided to leave. It went in the same direction as we did so we ran to get home. I lived near the spot where we saw it. My freind went home the long way to avoid the object. When I got home, my mother asked why I was home so late and I said I didn't know. About 10 minutes later, my brother came in the door. He was at his girlfreinds house up the street. He said look, we saw this earlier. He and his girlfreind were laying in her yard just watching the stars and whatever else and he said a huge triangular object went right over them. High in the sky, of course. He described the exact same thing that I saw and he had a picture that he drew and it was, the exact same thing I saw. It was in the news papers the very next day. A lot of other people saw it too. My freind never remembered the incident when I saw him a couple of weeks later. I had night mares for years of being in a totaly white room with no corners, and a dark object would come closer and closer to me towards my face and then I would wake up. I was stressed for a long time for some reason and for years I was convinced it was from seeing the craft. I had a small round scar on my left legg that I could never explain. It looks like a vaccination mark now. I had my throat checked once for a problem I was having. The doctor went through my nose with a scope to go down to see my throat. He asked me through the course of the check up what did I get opporated on for in my nose. I said I never got an opperation in my nose. He said you had to and I replied, I would know if I did. I had my nose courtorized when I was a child but never an opporation. That was the end of the conversation. I'm not saying I was abducted, but with all the things that happened to me, I sure thought about it. If I had the money, I'd get a whole body scan just to check it out. I would like to say that I and other people I know and talk to, beleive in u.f.o.'s. This is the reason I do. Also, about two years ago, I ran into! an old employer of mine at a store. We were looking for a good ufo movie and my old boss replied, I shouldn't tell you this, but I saw a u.f.o. years ago. Around 1970. He described the ""EXACT"" same thing we saw. And best of all, the same time frame. He lived behind the mountain where the school was located. He and his father saw the same one we did. Everything I mentioned here is 100% true. I'm 47 now and was 16 then, I recall everything I mentioned as if it happened last night. There is no forgetting. You can watch all the movies you want, but you just can't comprehend the feeling, of seeing something so large so quiet just floating in the sky abouve you, unless you saw it yourself.

The UFO was circular with a yellowish color, about the size of a full moon and was completely silent.  I could not make out any surface details.  The object seemed to be just a circular light.  It flew westward until it disappeared from sight, appearing to fly over Calexico, California, which is a border town next to Mexicali.  The object was not moving too fast.  Also, there was 2 or three (I can't remember) jet airplanes ""tailing"" it. The sighting was so spectacular that we kept checking the television & radio for any mention of the event, but we never caught any mention of it.  Strangely, we were not in an isolated part of the city and still none of the neigbors mentioned anything.  It was summer and lots of people were usually outdoors.

The first event I remember occurred in either the summer of 1975 or 1976.  My husband (at the time)and I shared a common interest in things like weather-watching, storm-chasing and skywatching in general.  We had driven to a remote area Southwest of Odessa, Texas to a place on the Caprock that was an excellent skywatching spot.  There are many radio, and television transmitters strung for miles along this caprock.  We had driven to a spot where the line of towers was behind us by probably 5 miles at most.  We were in his small convertible sports car.....an old, tiny mid-engine Porsche.........and we were sitting on the tops of our seats where they met with the frame of the car.  There was no back seat to this car, and it was like a T-top.  I don't remember how long we had been watching the sky, when one of us spotted what at first looked like it might be a satellite...........reminded me of a moving star.  No blinking or twinkling to speak of, no changes in intensity.  We first noticed it in the northwest, and it was moving slowly but steadily. across the sky towards the Southwest.  We became convinced it was a satellite within about 30 seconds, and at this point, it was in the center of our field of vision (almost due West).  If you think in terms of inches, it was about 12 inches above the horizon at that point we came aware of another identical light moving from the Southeast along the same horizontal plane.  We both then began to scan the entire sky almost instinctively, and immediately became aware that there were numerous lights coming from several directions, including directly overhead .  I remember at this point I was extremely excited and we were both shouting expletives and I was saying over and over, Whaat is going on, now.............come on, what the hell is happening and him saying Wait, wait, look over here and oh crap there's another one.  They finally had us convinced that they were going to collide and I remember how intense the feeling was that we were about to witness an explosion of! some ki nd...........but instead, as they got closer to each other, they slowed a bit, all at the same rate, and all stopped instantly, where then you saw what was either six or eight spots of light in a circle, equidistant from each other.  Then they began to flash independently but in an organized sequence that then gave an impression of an octagon or six-pointed star.  It was like if you drew dots on a piece of paper and then connected the dots so that the shape was revealed.  However,  It seemed that the area within the dots was not obscured.  You could see the night sky within the area formed by the dots.  After about maybe 30 seconds to a minute (I have never been sure about how much time went by) they stopped flashing, one at a time, as if each had to complete a sequence, then they were gone for a couple of seconds, then all lit up at once, and began to increase in brightness, and then began to glow red, and then streaked off in all 6 or eight directions, leaving trails that reminded me of meteors on fast-forward  but disappeared before traveling halfway across the sky.  As we sat there with our mouths hanging open, I was crying in wonder more that fear.  About 10 seconds maybe, after they disappeared, we heard what sounded like a sonic boom and a flash that lit up the whole sky for a split second, brightest at the horizon.  Only in retrospect can a say that the flash reminds me of what I have seen in films of nuclear bombs.......the first flash.  I can remember us jumping off the car and each lighting cigarettes and just standing there smoking and looking at the sky and not speaking, me crying.  Then we put the top back on the car and headed home.  I remember the drive from our location to the highway, but I don't remember anything else about getting home.  My next memory was going to work the next day and telling my boss and co-workers about it, and being ridiculed about it for weeks afterward. My ex-husband and I stayed friends and had other skywatching adventures, but only eclipses and meteor showers. I cannot remember us talking about it to each other in anything but a round-about way, except for a couple of times, between the event and when I moved to Tulsa in 1980.  I had very little contact with him from then until 1985, when I had been back in West Texas about a year.  I attempted to ask him about the subject, and he said he didn't remember the details very well.  I sensed an even greater reluctance to discuss it when we talked again about 3 years ago.",,31.869177391304348,-102.36950956521738

Large UFO thunders over Houston neighborhood at TREE-TOP level!,Houston,TX,,unknown,Ended by 19:01,"Occurred :  18:58  (Entered as : 1988-89 18:58) Reported: 11/15/2000 19:53 Posted: 8/5/2001 Location: Houston (17 miles W. of), TX Shape: Unknown Duration:Ended by 19:01",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14929.html,"Large UFO thunders over Houston neighborhood at TREE-TOP level! The incident occurred in a neighborhood called ""Forestview,"" 17 miles West of the city of Houston. Forestview lays directly South of Baker's Reservoir and within that reservior was a military air base. They trained para-troopers and practiced flying helos out there all the time. The neighborhood was used to seeing para-troopers training within the confines of the reservior, but occassionally, a helo or two would circle over the neighborhood at a pretty low level. No one was bothered, however, and I remember the whole neighborhood just being used to the military presense. Also, the neighborhood, in particularly my house, laid in the flight path of a small airport in Sugarland, miles to the South. The small aircraft would usually fly South over the neighborhood and over my house to land down there in the small little airport. So, this is the setting of which my encounter took place. I don't remember the year because I was only 9 or 10 at the time, and I wasn't really too interested in UFOs either. I do remember the exact time, though, because of what I was doing. I was watching the local NBC affliate and I remember that some boring sit-com had just gone off. The ending credits were now on the screen and the exciting Prime Time shows were next. I looked at the clock. 6:58pm. Just a few more minutes and something good would come on. Bored, I tuned out and listened the noises within the house. I was in the bedroom watching tv, while my parents were in the livingroom watching something different. I could hear a loud and annoying commercial playing on theirs. I also heard something else, something I was used to but I would always notice it. It was the low steady sound of an approaching plane. Not wanting to watch the stupid commercials on tv, I got up and went to look out the window. It was night outside, as I looked North through my backyard, and cloudy too, low clouds. As I listened, the noise got louder and louder. Louder and louder, louder and louder still, until I realized that this sounding bigger than what I was used to hearing. I looked up in the direction of the approaching ""plane"" and waited for it to appear over my house. I didn't think I would actually see it in the darkness and through the clouds, but at least I thought I'd be able to see the lights. Eventually, as the steady hum built into a rolling, thundering roar, the aircraft suddenly appeared and what I saw scared the living hell out of me. Upon seeing it, I instinctively hit the ground and braced myself. To me, at that moment, I thought I was about to see a plane crash into my neighborhood. In that flash of a terrifying instant, I saw a solid metalic underbelly of a large aircraft appear through my trees and it was so low it appeared to be flying at tree-top level! What didn't make sense, but I didn't have time to think about as I ducked for cover, was that this thing was huge. The curved underside of it was at least three houses wide. Nothing that big ever flew over the neighborhood, not at that level anyways. And, it had absolutely no lights. None. The only reason I was able to see it... was that the streetlights behind my house reflected off the bottom of the craft. THAT'S how low it was. Well, I waited. Curled up in a frieghtened little ball, I waited and listened as the sound gradually died away. I braced myself for an explosion, as I imagined that the ""plane"" would surely crash. It didn't. After it finally died away. I stood up and contemplated everything I just experienced. Thinking back on what it looked like, it wasn't until after the experience that I realized I had seen a UFO. I ran into the livingroom, all excited. ""Mom! Dad! Did you hear it?! Did you see it?!"" They just looked at me, puzzled. I couldn't believe it. They HADN'T heard it. But, to me, it sounded so incredibly loud. I was frustrated. How could they not have heard something as loud as that. They knew that I was not prone to over-reacting or letting my imagination run THAT wild. They listened to my experience with interest, but they said they truthfully didn't notice anything. Discouraged and confused, I stayed up the rest of the night, even watched the evening news. I watched the entire broadcast, waiting to see if they mentioned anything about a UFO or at least a plane making an emergency landing down in Sugarland. Nothing, but I did take note of something I thought might lead to a possible answer. If it didn't come from that air-base, which I still believe it did, then I thought it might have something to do with the jet-stream, which was exactly over the city of Houston at the time. Sorry, for such a long post, but hopefully I've provided enough details about my experience that you may be able to draw up some conclusions, thoughts, or ideas.",,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

This person was a member of an elite, secret, military airplane crash team in the 1940's. The team investigated several airplane crashes. Then, about 6 months before the Roswell event, this crash team was ordered to race by land to a crash scene in a mountain wilderness area. The team had to force hike into the crash site.  The hike consumed the better part of 11/2 days since it was extremely difficult to find the crash site. Once discovered, it was quickly obvious that something had slammed into the top side of the mountain, and %100 exploded into thousands of palm sized pieces which were strewn all over the forest floor. My witness picked up a sample and conducted simple field tests on the strange object. The tests defied the known laws of engineering and physics. ((NUFORC Note:  Original report Description follows: 1940's secret, elite military crash team member  reveals  another UFO crash  event  months  before  Roswell My witness is a former crew chief who in the 1940's was in charge of a team that  repaired military fighter airplane engines at a famous military airbase. The crew specialized in fast engine repair. My witness was also a member of a secret military airplane crash team. This elite crash team was always on alert to speed to a disaster either by air of ground. The team was composed of civilians, enlisted men and officers. My witness became experienced in airplane crashes. He knew what to expect, what to look for, what to do upon arrival at a crash scene. At this particular crash, it was quite obvious that the craft had slammed into the side of a forested mountain and blew up into thousands of small objects scattered over a large area. Field tests revealed startling results. A shroud of secrecy settled. After that came Roswell. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; location is unknown.  We have spoken with the individual who submitted the report, and he seems to us to be serious-minded.  We have requested that he attempt to establish the exact date, if that is possible.  We have assigned an arbitrary date here, in order that the report will be sorted to the 1940's era.  We suspect that the alleged event occurred after 1941, since it seems unlikely to us that the U.

On a Sunday in July we had gone to Brown's Orchard nearby and got a bushel of pie cherries to can. We had just finished cleanin the fruit and I took the dishpan of waste to throw it out in the barrow pit behind the trailer. I just happened to look down the road about a quarter of a mile and tere was this huge,silver,Saucer shaped vehicle  about 200 feet in the air,just slowly gliding along as if sightseeing, It was going West. It made no noise and the sky was clear of all clouds, I stood there and thought--""It cannot be a plane. It cannot be a balloon because if it was, it would be going East as the wind was blowing briskly,as the Sparrow nests were being blown out of the Locust trees that lined the pasture fence and the adult sparrows were having spasms.So what is it?""(I felt almost hypnotized) Finally I shook my body and went to the door and called my relatives to""come and see what I see""!) We watched it for just a minute or so and then it took off like a whiz and was out of sight for a seconds,then it came back into view about 10 miles away and then in a few more seconds it was gone out of sight (to the West).Never thought much about it until 2 years later I was in a grocery store in Gooding,Idaho, and was turning a stand full of ""Pocket Books"" and here was a book""Flying Saucers Are Real""by Donald Keyhoe.

Myself and several other children were getting ready to enjoy our play peroid during our lunch hour at school outside when I spotted a beutiful, silver disk, sitting in the blue sky, about a thousand feet off the ground.(guessing) It wasn't very close to us but could be seen quite clearly if directed to the area of the sky.  I immediately pointed this out to the other kids who were also amazed.  We kids had never heard of the term ""UFO"" and I was just puzzled, wondering how it was able to stay in one spot without falling to the ground.  When I saw several teachers coming out of our school house to watch the kids, I went over to them and told them about the silver disk and pointed it out to them.  At the time, we kids thought it was really neat to have seen something like that but got kind of tired watching it do nothing but hover in that one spot so we went on to playing on the school playground equipment.  After several minutes had passed by, I looked over at the teachers to see if they were still watching that disk and I noticed that the teachers acted kind of upset and concerned.  That also puzzled me.  After our lunch period was ended, we started back into the school house and I looked over to that portion of the sky(southwest) where the silver disk had been and it was gone.  I was dissappointed. This is the first time I've ever reported this sighting but I've always known since that time that UFOs are real, but, I've never been much of a UFO buff.

The officer taking our report indicated that an object of the same description had been sighted at their location about 3 minutes earlier, it was traveling North. It's shape was well defined against a fairly black winter night sky. Some air glow was present but planets and stars were visible. Both of the observers were highschool students who had signed up to be Ground Observers and were on their normal shift. Although we felt there was little chance of us seeing a foriegn military plane at our location, we did keep good track of all civilian aircraft in and out of the airport some 8 miles to the East of our location. During the week and during the previous week there had been several reports by ranchers of cattle mutilations so we were especially watchfull for non aircraft in the skys. It was reported on the local radio station that theres on the North edge of town had also seen the object about the same time as we had seen it a few miles South of their location. Thgis sighting was near the end of a week long series of sightings around the state.",,45.481386567164186,-98.50580597014925

I am not sure if it was 1956 or 57 as I was only 9 or 10 at the time.  We had left my grandfathers farm a mile west of the martelle just over the Linn county line and were going north on highway 1. We were going to my aunts farm near Anamosa with my mother in the back pass side and my grandmother in the front. My Grandfather was driving and I was in the back on his side.  We were were 2 or 3 miles north of Martelle when the radio on the car stopped playing music and had nothing but static.  The car then started to stall and my grandfather  pulled off the right side of the road.  Just as he stoped it became like daylight out as a vary bright cigar shapped object appeared to the west of the car over a field. All I can remember is that it looked huge and was so bright that I was able to see all the picked corn rows in the field. It was a bright orange and with what looked like large port holes that were bright orange.  This may have been for 20 or 30 sec. and the next thing that I remember  is it being dark and that  I rolled down the window and stuck my head out looking up and seeing all the stars as it was a clear night.  We all said what happened and then just looked at each other.  My grandfather started the car and the radio came on and we went on to my aunts farm.  When we got there they wanted to know where we had been as we then realized that it was 22:00.   I have always wondered about this but as my mother is the only one  still living and she never wants to talk about it  I have never told enyone else about this event.  If anyone might have also seen this event I would be interested in what they saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)),,42.0236,-91.3436

In early 1963 I was in Navy boot camp at Great Lakes Illinois.  While stand watch one night a craft of considerable size appeared over the base.  It was moving very slowly and completely silent.  It's hard to estimate size but I would guess 200 Ft. in diameter and at less than 2000 Ft. altitude.  It had rectangular ""windows"" on the outer circumference which glowed with a red-orange light as the craft slowly revolved.  I don't recall anything about the actual shape other than it was round. I think I was so transfixed by the lights that I never tried to make out anything else.  Or perhaps it was just such a dark night that the outline couldn't be seen.  I don't really know.  The craft moved slowly toward the far end of the base.  There were probably hundreds of trainees looking out the barrick windows.  As I stood there dumbstruck a base security truck pulled up to the gate I was guarding and ordered me to get it open and fast.  I did so even though my orders were that no one, not even the C.O.  was to be allowed to use that gate.  After my watch was over the sentry from across the highway which divided the two parts of the base and was in my company came over and asked me, with his mouth hanging open, if I had seen that.  Everyone saw it.  I never heard another word from anyone about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  If anyone else who saw the same event, we would welcome any additional reports.

Occasionally I would spot a satellite just after dark. Satellites were easily recognized by their steady, fast paced bright light. On this occasion, I spotted a satellite moving south to north in the eastern sky. When I trained my binoculars on the light, the magnification revealed that instead of one light, there were two, one following another. I watched for about ten to fifteen seconds as the two lights moved along the same path. Then, suddenly the rear light instantaneously changed direction and speed and faded to black as it zoomed off in an abrupt turn.  Through my binoculars looking toward the northeast, the two objects were moving from a two o'clock position toward an eight o'clock position. The rear obect then turned toward a one o'clock position. It seemed to do so without any hesitation whatsoever. It was many years later that I realized that what I had seen might be a UFO following a terrestrial satellite.

I do not usually talk about this experience (Most people would think I'm Crazy)...and have pretty much blocked it out of my mind until recently. It was late evening - early morning on the night of March 31-April 1, 1966. (This is a date I will always remember) A friend of mine and I had picked up another friend from work who worked the afternoon shift at an auto plant and were returning to the driver of the vehicles home in Dearborn, Michigan.  I was 19 at the time. My two friends were 17 and 24. We were heading north on Monroe street.  We had just drove past Outer Drive when I had a very strange feeling. About a block past Outer Drive, Monroe makes about a 45% turn to the left. It is just past that point when we all spotted a ""Space Craft"" hovering over a Public swimming pool/playground located at an elementary school off to our left.  I use the word Space Craft, because it was NOT a UFO as we saw it VERY clear.  It was about 200 feet from us at about 50-75 feet in the air. We saw it so clear that we could see the partitions that seperated the crafts lit up windows.  It was boomerang shaped with a row of large bright white windows. It was about 75 feet wide.  The craft had a red glowing light on it underside with smaller lights on it left and right side. It made no sounds.  The only unusual sounds were a static noise on the radio in the car we were in when we were near the craft. As we stopped to watch it, my friend who was driving, blinked the cars head lights at it.  This is when it started to move slowly. The rest of the details of that night are not clear except that I remember we followed it (were led by it) for about 10 minutes and that it seemed to land it a wooded area West of Telegraph road at an area that was then known as Crowley Park. This is when the rest of the nights becomes cloudy in my memory...until sometime after when we went running into a all night Hamburger diner on Telegraph Road.  There were two persons in the diner that also saw the craft as it was flying away from the area. All three of us had (and I still do) a lump in our ear lobe after the encounter.  I have not seen the other two that were with me in several years, so I can not say if they still have the lump or not.  I have been haunted by VERY BAD dreams and odd things happening to me from that night on.  It was just recently that I remembered another encounter some seven or eight years later with a HUGE craft. All the details of that encounter are slim in my mind. I hope to some day be hypnotised to bring all of the memories out...and to have the lump under my ear lobe removed and studied. ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) Please refer to my report I reported to you 6/7/2001 and you posted on 8/5/2001.  Anyway, do you know of any doctor that would remove the lump from my earlobe to see what it is. I would really like to have it removed as I know it is a part of that evening of March 31, 1966.   Please do not post my name as I am a business professional. ((END))",,42.317738992042436,-83.21002201591511

It then took off and flew away.  Myself (age 17 in 1966) and my brother (age 15) arrived at home at suppertime and were told about the UFO.  We believed what the kids said.  We went to the creek bed to see the landing site.  I walked directly to the site. My brother rode his horse but the horse would not approach the site...he had to also walk to the site.  The weeds/brush were flattened in a circular shape as if something about 30-40 feet in diameter had crushed them.  There was no evidence of fire or heat, and no major indentations other than the crushed weeds/brush.  I walked back to the house and called the Midland/Odessa airport control tower (about 120 miles away) to ask about radar observations or unusual aircraft and they reported that they saw nothing out of the ordinary.  We occasionally discuss this UFO at family gatherings.  To this day the three (now adults) who actually saw the UFO swear that this event happened, and my brother and I did see the spot where the UFO landed and took off.

It was smooth and shiny without any surface features that I could see. However, the metallic nature of the surface was very apparent against the blue sky with sunlight reflecting off of it.. As I watched, it began to turn slowly end-over-end, accelerated vertically at a great speed, and then disappeared. The entire duration of the event was approximately 10 seconds. It was not possible to guage the size or the altitude of the object, since I had nothing to reference it to. My subjective impression is that it was about the size of an automobile, a couple thousand feet up. From the time I first noticed it, the object stayed motionless for about 5 seconds. It then rotated in a ""wobbly"" end-over-end manner  3 or 4 times and began to accelerate upward very fast.

The object was initially a pinpoint in the distance. Within 20 seconds it moved into our area and slowed down to a low speed. It was dark and we could see only the lights but I estimate it to have been 300 feet in diameter (a perfectly round disk or squat cylinder with slightly domed top) and perhaps 50 feet tall.   It had a band of lights around the perimeter through which lights pulsated in a teardrop pattern (a band of teardrops moving head to tail around the perimeter of the object).  The faster the ship moved, the faster the light pattern went around the perimeter.  The lights were white.   The reason I surmise it had a domed top is because there was a blue light on top that moved around in a semi-spherical motion.  The object was utterly silent and incredibly swift.  If you did not look, you would not have known it was there.   There were other witnesses but no one spoke of it.  The object disappeared over a hill behind us and did not reappear. ((NUFORC Note:  The following message is submitted on July 10, 2001, by the individual who submitted the report above.)) I am one of the two people who have reported the disk in Hickory NC in June 1966.  The other reported sighting corroborates exactly what I saw but they reported seeing it about 2 days after I saw it, ...it has been a long time...  I have also seen a report elsewhere on a very similar craft around the same time in Venice, California.  It could also be the craft of Hingham, Mass., sighting of 4/1/66.   There was also a similar craft illustrated on a UFO documentary a few years ago (it looked like the craft I saw, with the teardrop shaped lights rotating in a band around the perimeter but was much smaller than the craft I saw).  My question is, how best can I research this particular craft at that time?  It was quite large, probably 300' diameter and 50' thick.  It had a pattern of large white teardrop shaped lights rotating in a band around the perimeter of the disk.  There was a blue light either above or below.  Other than that there were no visible features, except that it blocked out the! stars as it flew over.

With regard to researching the events, there is probably no better way than going to local newspapers.  If even just a small group of people witnessed the object, newspaper reports might have been generated in the local publications.  Since UFO materials usually get front page coverage in local papers, you can usually scan just the front page of every issue, and that will tell you whether you are looking at the correct edition. If you have had sightings that you have not submitted to our Online Report Form, I would welcome such reports.  If you could take just a few minutes to generate a description of each sighting and submit it, using that form, that will preserve the sighting, and make it available to others to read. Also, if you would like to submit an illustration of the objects you have witnessed, we will scan them, and post them with your report in the future. Thank you very much for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport ((END JULY 10, 2001, REPLY)) ((SECOND CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF REPORT)) This is a correction for a sighting that I posted several years ago.

We noticed a bright light (about double the brightness of Venus) streaking from the south to north.  It appeared to be very high in the sky.  Just as it got nearly overhead, the (light) divided into two lights and each turned abruptly, one east, the other west.  The turn was immediate, not in a slow arc as you would expect.  Each object then disappeared over the horizon...one east the other west.  We knew we had seen something, but didn't understand what it could have been.

Approached until object overhead as wide as road and ditch. Bright lights, Turned head to find object in horizon. in horizon. On Labor Day, 1966 we were travelling to Saskatchewan for the holiday on Hwy 16 E about 30 miles out of town. My husband, myself, son almost two and I was pregnant.  Ahead we saw bright lights.  Since the road was straight, it was unusual.  We thought maybe a helecopter.  We slowed down and approached the lights.  As we got closer, we realized this object was very large and could not be anything we recognized.  We were going very slow as we approached this object.  It was very large.  It was as wide as a two lane highway with a curb and the ditch as well.  There were three rows of lights, the red being the most prominant.  We were calm and not frightned by this.  I was sitting up and looking up through the wind shield right under it and it was huge.  I told my husband to stop the car which he did.  I jumped out of the car, looked up and it was gone, and I could barely see it in the horizon.  The colors of the lights are vague, perhaps yellow or white, and green or blue.  The only sure color was red, for it seemed to be pulsing.  There were maybe 6 to 8 ports with lights in each color and 3 rows.  Less Rows on top to make the shape.  The lights were the only thing that gave it shape.  Like an upside down bowl. We continued on to Saskatchewan and mentioned it to my father and he had just read a book on UFO's and said it sounded like one.  I had never heard of such a thing.  Upon returning home to Alberta we ceased to talk about it, not to anyone, until one night a few months later, we had company, and we both realized that we had not told a sole.  So, we did.  Not long after this, both my husband and I were awoke in the middle of the night by a white light.  The house was light up like a flourescent light.  We lived by Half Moon Lake, and looked out to see what it could be.  There was a full moon that night, and the moon was reflecting on the lake.  The reflection of the moon was clear because it was a bit yellow, but there was another reflection, coming from where???  We phoned the Planitorium the next day to see if there had been a meterorite that night and they said no.  It was a frightning night!  After that, we basically left the experience alone.  I was due to have my baby in January, and while I was having her, I had a dream where I went some where.  It was so clear. There was someone talking to me and telling me why I had to go back. The doctors thought I may have had a near death experience, but I some- times wonder if it may have been from that experience.  I did go to a doctor and went under Hypnosis but nothing.  I always had the feeling that there had been more to this sighting that just seeing it. Myself and my two children all have Auto Immune diseases, myself, Multiple Sclerosis, My son, Chrones Disease and my Daughter a very serious Ulcerative Colitis. My daughter is a teacher, my son an Instrumentation Engineer and have done well academically.  I am unable to work.  This experience has never left my mind, and I am now living in the country and am always scared.  Jokingly I will say to my husband that I am sure in a good place for them to come at any time and check me out.  From my childhood, I have a good memory of an incident where I thought a ""Piece fell out of the Sky"" I wrote it down on a piece of paper and said I would retrieve it when I was a big girl and then people would believe me.  This is the first time I have told the Story and thought that it should be recorded some where.  I have since been divorced from the person driving the car, and have checked with him on different occasions to verify that it really did happen.  Another interesting thought was that at the time of the siting, we were not afraid at all. Also, when we were under it, I had my window opened, and there was not a sound.",,53.52298881322957,-113.5039614461738

School went into recess for a month to allow students to participate in the potato harvest (in the northeastern tip of Maine).  My best friend and I were ""picking potatoes"" one afternoon and as I was taking a breather I noticed a silver disk slowly skimming across the top of a narrow strip of trees about one-eighth of a mile away.  I didn't hear any noise at all and did not observe any lights. It was not rotating. I said to my friend, ""Look at that!""  It continued on its path just above the swath of trees until we could no longer see it.  I observed this object for about 10 seconds.  My friend and I both decided to do an oral English report on our sighting, but he backed out and I ended up doing it alone.  I got the whole spectrum of reactions. Loring Air Force Base was in the immediate vicinity, about 5 miles away.  I grew up watching all kinds of planes fly through our rural skies (including B-52s).  This thing was nothing like what we were used to seeing flying out of Loring.  I've always felt that it was extraterrestrial.  That was the strong impression I had at the time.  I have come to believe that this craft was scoping out Loring A.F.B.  There was an incident, called ""The Loring Incident"" which occurred in 1975 wherein discs of unknown origin hovered over Loring's nuclear weapons depot unchallenged, 5 feet off the ground; it resulted in about a dozen more Air Force Bases nationwide being put on a heightened state of alert. I had another sighting in July 1972 in the same general area.  I was laying on my back on the high-dive of a camp pool on a cloudless Maine night.  The stars are so clear and thick on these Maine nights that you feel you can reach out your hand and scoop out a bunch of them with your hand.  Zero urban light interference. What I saw was a medium-bright ""star"" in the night sky that zig-zagged down the horizon, paused, and then retraced its path to where I had first seen it move.  Then it faded to black and that was the end of it.  This lasted about 15 minutes.  Again, this UFO was, in effect, if not in actuality, directly over Loring A.F.B. Loring A.F.B. was the SECOND air force base to store atomic warheads. (The first was in New Mexico where the bomb was developed.) I had a third sighting in West New York, New Jersey, in March, 1997 (across the Hudson River from New York City).  At sunset I looked out a window facing south and saw a bar of bright light suspended in the sky; it did not move.  I looked at it through my 10-power binoculars.  It looked like pure energy.  No surface or texture of any kind was visible, just this blazing cylinder of golden-white light.  It was beautiful. It was three times as long as it was wide.  It was hanging in the sky at an angle, not straight up and down. I watched it for about 30 minutes and then had to get some sleep before going to work that night.  When I woke up later it had gone.

Sometime around the year 1968 I was visiting my Grandparents in Scottsville, Kentucky, for a while.  We would go outside and sit on my Grandparents porch practically every night to just talk and so on.   This particular night my Grandmother and I were sitting out on their front porch as usual talking.  Let me tell you that the night was totally dark--not a star in the sky.  I dedided to go out in the front yard to look at the sky (I have always been facinated with the sky and stars etc.).  When I got out in the yard, I looked up and saw a huge disk hovering directly over my Grandparents house.  The perfect outline of a disk could be seen, and the disk had lots of lights all over it.  This object made no noise what so ever.   I yelled out for my Grandmother to come and see this ""thing"" for herself-which she did.  We were both astonished and amazed at what we were witnessing.  She then called out for my Grandfather (who was inside the house) to come out in a hurry to see this object for himself.  He too came outside and witnessed this disk.  It just kept hovering over their house for five to ten minutes.   Then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone.  It had to have taken off at a very great speed.   As I recall, their were several reports from all over Allen County that night of people witnessing the same type of crafts.  Several were seen by a friend of mine-and he said one landed in their field.  It was possibly on our local news the next day also.  We were told that what we witnessed was a meteorite.  As I recall, meteorites do not hover over a house (or anywhere) for five to ten minutes, and then fly away.   I am a Christian and have an open mind about many things, but this incident-I cannot explain it.  This story is true-we DID see this object.  We saw no ""little green men etc.,"" but we did see something somehow beyond human comprehension. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate; source is anonymous.

While traveling north on LaBrea Avenue, coming down the hill toward Coliseum Ave, I saw very bright lights, resembling lights in a stadium, but they appeared to be too high up to be from a stadium (there was no stadium in that area.) These lights seemed odd so the driver of the car decided to investigate.  We went in their direction into a residential area that was on the north west side of Rodeo Rd and LaBrea Avenue. I'm not possitive of the exact location because I was new to Los Angeles at that time and didn't know the area well.  I did, however, know LaBrea and Rodeo Rd intersection. When we approached the area that seemed to be the source of the lights we traveled down a residential street that had a ""T"" intersection.  As we approached this intersection, and turned right, our car headlights turned toward a very large object hovering above the tree tops and electric wire poles. As our lights turned toward this object, it flashed two lights back at us as if signaling back in response to our headlights shining toward it.  This object was at the corner of this intersection and was large enough to cover the full width of the street as well as part of the house nearest that corner.  We immediately drove under it, which enabled me to see the bottom. The bottom was a light color that appeared to be either sand color or a light beige and it had the appearance of a wheel with a hub and spokes radiating from it, so my assumption is that it was disc shaped.  These ""spokes"" appeared to be dimensional rather than painted and at the center was a light that was red when we passed under.  I couldn't determine the actual shape of the top because it was very dark outside, and I couldn't see the outline due to the bright lights that flashed back at us. I assumed that the lights were on the front of the vehicle but cannot say if there were other lights. This object made absolutely no sound and was completely motionless when we encountered it. We drove under it, pulled over to the side of the street just beyond it, at which time the driver of the car became hysterical because she recoginzed it to be a UFO. I wanted to get out to have a better look but the passenger side of the door was jammed due to a previous accident and wouldn't open. I could not get the driver to move to let me out. By the time she pulled herself together, started the car engine and made a U-turn to head back in the direction of the UFO, it was gone.  It made no sound when it moved off.  I don't know whether it moved sideways or straight up but it must have taken off at a fast speed because the whole episode seemed to be very brief.  When we reached the corner where it had been hovering, I tried to look in the sky and spot it.  I did see lights in the far distance, west of our location, and at the time I assumed these lights could have been the object.  In retrospect I cannot say for certain.  It may have moved sidways, up or it may have vanished.  I don't know. About a week or two after this event, while returning home from evening school in downtown Los Angeles, I was a passenger riding on the Santa Monica Freeway, heading west of downtown.  Needless to say, I was watching the skys trying to see this object again.  I did see a bright stationary light in the sky, to the left of the freeway in the area of Normandie or Western Avenue and south of the freeway.  As I looked at it, wondering if this was the same UFO, the light ""winked out.""  It was like someone turning off a light and then there was nothing. The day after my initial sighting, the driver of the car and I called several places, including Goodyear just to confirm it was not a blimp we had seen, although we knew it wasn't. Also, it was not a helicopter, as you can hear them a mile away. Goodyear confirmed that no blimps had been in the air at all because of the wind conditions. The car driver called an office of the Air Force and was told they knew nothing.  Upon making further calls she was told this was a vehicle being tested by Hughes Aircraft, and that the neighborhood had been notified. This was 1970 and to my knowledge we had no vehicles that were shaped like this or that could perform in this manner.  To date, we still don't unless they are really more secret than some of the black projects.  I got a pretty good look at the bottom side of this UFO as we drove under and there were no wings or apendages that I could see and it was totally silent and motionless until it moved away from the area.

I looked out the passenger window into a field and saw a large glowing light, moving silently throught the field, pacing the car.  I asked, ""Mom, what's that?"" At such a young age, I was merely curious, completely unafraid.  I had no idea what a UFO was.  When my mother looked over at the field and saw the object, she was visibly frightened, and punched the accelerator of the car.  I remember looking at the speedometer and noticing we were driving 85 m.ph., which confused me.  Seeing my mother frightened began to make me feel a bit scared, too, and I kept looking at this glowing object as it stayed with us, approximately 100 yards into the field.  As I was so young, and all of this is a bit foggy in my memory, I can only give rough estimates.  I would say that the object was perhaps 50-60 feet long, it was difficult to see how wide it was.  It glowed brightly, and made no sound.  After a bit, i seem to have fallen asleep, I really can't remember how it all ended.  All I know is that we arrived home safely, and whenever I have asked my mother about the incident, she is reluctant to talk about the sighting, usually dismissing it as swamp gas.  As an adult looking back at what I saw, I find it hard to believe that we witnessed swamp gas glwong and pacing our car at 85 m.p.h.  Somebody regress me!!!! I want to know what I saw!!

We had crossed the boarder of Wyoming, headed in a westerly direction through Montana.  We'd approached some foothills, exited off the I, and had taken a scenic, two lane road, bordered by trees on both sides.  It was approaching dusk, still bright, but the sun beginning to recede.  I was in the passenger seat with the window down, staring at the scenery.  Suddenly, a fireball rose up from behind the tree line on the right side of the road, lolled over the hood of the car, and disappeared behind the tree line on the right, as if to crash. It made a nearly perfect arc over the road and our car hood, directly in front of us.  I believe I managed to count to four as the fireball appeared and disappeared, but my friend stated it was closer to three seconds in total sighting.  To all remaining details we agree.  The fireball was orange, regular flame color on top, but was a striking green on its underside and at the edges toward the front of the object.  It looked almost as though the fireball ""housed"" a hard object; as though something the size of a VW Bug had been enveloped in flame and catapulted across the road.  If one dipped a wadded piece of paper in gas, lit it, and swung it on a string in a slow circle, you'd approach the effect.  It moved so slowly there was very little if any trail. The track it took would have made a perfect circle if one used the center line of the road as circle's center; the fireball entering our view seeming from directly behind the tree line, and descending directly behind the opposing tree line.  It sputtered as well.  The effect was similar to grinding a piece of pitted metal on a wheel.  Sudden bursts of flame and sparks jettisoned from it.  From its appearance and close proximity, we would have expected the fireball to make a noise like an approaching express train, yet the was none.  Part of the oddness of the event was the fact there was no sound whatever.  We could hear ourselves gasping at the sight. My friend immediately pulled the car to the ditch, and we tensed, waiting for the sound of a crash or explosion.  There was complete silence; not even a sound of birds or crickets.  It was as eerie a silence as you could imagine.  We debated on whether to leave the car parked on the highway and hike into the brush toward the fireball's point of decent, but decided not to.  Equally odd, we discussed it for a few minutes, shook our heads, and promptly forgot about the event until five or six years ago. I have since scoured the web and books for pictures of entering meteors that looked similar to what we saw.  Nothing even approaches it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke by telephone with this witness and found him to be quite credible.  We suspect the event is accurately portrayed, although the date may be approximate.

(Story): A school friend and i camped outside(after the last day of high-school exams) in the backyard at his parents place...my friend was listening to a recorded tape of a football game from the previous afternoon.  I didn't care to listen to it so i positioned myself so that half of me was outside the tent(laying down on my back). I folded my hands behind my head and looked upward's into the clear night sky to look at the stars(amazingly... at that time in Edmonton... one could still see the stars at night).  After a short while(30 to 60 minutes)... i saw something very odd and striking directly above me... very high in the sky. It was very Black...very clearly Triangular...with rounded edges, not sharp or pointed edges. Because i could make out evenly spaced lights all around the triangular circumference of the object, i could see that it had rounded edges... and interspersed within its shape was a limited assortement of lights with no pattern or organization. All the lights were white(no-colors)...and perhap's a little less brighter than the star-light( it blended almost perfectly into the black starry sky).  Like the other witness said... if he hadn't been directly looking at that exact position in the sky he probably would have missed it...this was the same for me... i was afraid that if i took my eyes off of it... that i might lose sight of it( the lights of the ship blended with the stars making it hard to see). It indeed was stealthy and hard to keep track of visually. It was without any sound at all!. At that moment my friend's dog which was inside the tent with him went absolutelely berserk...barking like mad...(the dog was quiet all evening)...I quickley got up off the ground to stand up to track it as it moved at a startling speed(no jet travels that fast...ever!) from the ! north-we st to the south-east in a straight line towards the horizion where the very 1st indications of the next morning's sunrise glow was just barely dicernable. As i got up i had only enough time to call out my friend's name 3-4 times to get him to come out of the tent to see the object with me before it was gone altogether!. He didn't even have a chance to come out... this whole scenario was over with in less than 10 second's... his dog returned to his normal quiet self!. Correctly or Incorrectly i evaluated this object as being very large... i thought that it must be approximately a half a mile to a mile long... it did not look like it was small at all!.

In Octber of 1972 while I was a student I was driving with a friend on a Sunday night returning home from a double date via a country road. We both noticed a bright white light moving slowly from left to right circling a large hill.  We thought that it was a ranger plane and drove on without interest until we noticed that it seemed to be following us.  We could see it sometimes in front and sometimes behind us.  By this time we were driving from 40 to 50 MPH, depending upon the curvature of the road, trying to keep the opject in sight.  Thinking of the height of a broadcast antenna, the object may have been 1000 feet above ground and seemed to be the size of a small fingernail held at arms length.  We also noticed that the FM car radio was being affected by unusual static.  After several minutes of driving during which I either increased or decreased speed trying to view the object better, it finally veered off toward a large empty field and stopped at what looked to be only a few yards off the ground.  I stopped my car and asked my friend to get out with me.  My friend, a large, burly ""country boy"" at first would not leave the car, but later consented to do so.  We observed the object for several minutes until we noticed that it was moving.  We watched in awe as this object slowly soared into the air moving upward at a 45 degree angle.  It looked like a ""chevron"" or ""boomerang"", with the pointed edge at the front.  The two ends were both squared off, not pointed or rounded.  We saw four bluish-white lights on each leading edge.  The object moved slowly, perhaps 20-25 MPH and was possibly 250 feet above the ground and about 500 feet away.  At that height and distance I probably could have obscured most of the object with my open palm held at arms length.  We could clearly see the outline of the main body of the object, which was dark, against the night sky (the moon was almost full), and it was absolutely plain that there was nothing between the two sides of the ""chevron"" - so we could clearly tell that it was not an airplane.  The object made a steady humming sound, not a droning or cyclic sound, like a generator. The sound was not very loud - my friend and I talked as it passed by us - and the sound faded as the object became more distant from us.  The object moved across the road to a distance of several hundred yards where again it looked like only a single light as when we first noticed it, and stopped.  My friend and I got back in the car and moved forward on the road trying to keep the object in sight.  The object began to move and gain altitude and once again a sort of chase resumed, where the object would be either in front of or behind us as we tried to keep pace with it.  The object suddenly stopped at an altitude of perhaps 500 feet, and we stopped directly below it, watching it from inside the car.  The object remained motionless for about 3-4 minutes, and then suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.  Since that occurance I have retired from a career in the military, where I was exposed to all types of airborne craft.  I have never seen or heard any type of jet, plane, or helicopter that even remotely resembles what I observed that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The date is based on a similar report I read about in Kevin Randle's _The UFO Casebook_(p. 141). My mother, grandmother, and I had stopped for dinner in El Centro, CA, and were westbound on I-8 when we observed a very bright, orange light to the north. Soon, the object began to emit a cloud of smoke or vapor, which was greyish- white. The light ""blinked out"" and then came back on several times during the sighting (I don't remember exactly how many times), leaving the cloud hanging. The light was stationary (yet it seemed to ""move with us"" as we travelled down the freeway) and was approx. 20 degrees above the horizon. My mother and grandmother were panicking, I was was very scared at one point and hiding my eyes; it was then that I heard them exclaiming that several smaller lights were emerging from the light, flew around it, then returned to it. Unfortunately, I myself did not witness this.  Finally, the light went out permanently and the cloud dissipated. One strange feature of this event was that our car was being tailgated by a semi during the duration of the sighting, rather relentlessly (I remember we were in the slow lane the whole time, but don't recall if my grandmother, who was driving, tried to ""shake"" the tailgater at any point by changing lanes). I'm posting this primarily to find out if anyone else was a witness to this, even though it was long ago.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,32.77397551020408,-115.60140204081631

It was a spring day in the middle of the afternoon on a mostly clear day.  It was probably 65 to 70 degrees.  I believe it was in 1974 although I'm not sure of the month, and I was 11 years old.  I was returning home after school let out.  Close to home where I came into a clearing between 6-story apartment buildings, I was looking up facing south, and between about 60 and 75 degrees above the horizon, a small disc-shaped, grayish or silvery object caught my eye as soon as it emerged over the top of a building to my right.  It was travelling east (from my right to left) and was about to fly over, by my best estimate, John F. Kennedy International Airport.  It was probably between one half and one mile high and seemed fairly small...my guess would be about 10 feet in diameter.  It had no distinguishing characteristics.  I saw no smoke trail, heard no noise, and felt no strange vibes other than my own nervousness.  I don't think it was more than a half a mile away horizontally.  It never made any erratic movement and was moving at a quick pace...I'm guessing about 150 mph.  A few seconds before it disappeared over the top of the building to my left, it had begun a smooth right turn toward the southeast and appeared to be climbing.  No wings were visible, and at this point it looked more like a cigar with a reflecting metal surface.  Then it was gone.  I was able to see this object clearly as my eyesight was perfect then, and I knew I'd never seen anything like it before.  I remembered feeling shocked, perplexed and concerned, for I had no idea the source of what I'd seen.  I was also annoyed that there was nobody else around for me to call attention to it.  Not wanting to risk embarrassment, it was several years before I'd told anyone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,40.6593,-73.8448

I called all of my brothers and sisters to watch, figuring it would have to take back off again.  While waiting, I ran inside to get my mother, but she dismissed me as a child making up a story and did not care to come see for herself.

My sister and I saw this one evening while I was baby sitting her when my parents where working that evening.  I'm a bit worried because I reported this when we saw it, and was warned off saying anything else about the event.  Being quite young I of course followed orders - I was somewhat scared of these people.  However, I recently moved elsewhere in the UK and in this area there was a UFO flap during January -March.  I saw a couple of the light shows recently, and called the local coastal radar station to ask what these low flying lights might be, and through the phone call had a visit from the MOD. It seems I'm on file even after all this time, and I do not like the idea of being considered public property by certain government departments. I wouldn't mind so much if I had led an unusual or eventful life, but I'm just a middle aged house wife who seems to have a file with the government? We were sat in the living room of my mothers home which has windows over looking both the rear and front gardens.  I'm sure of the time because we had just finished watching a TV program that finished at 8.30.  My sister saw a strange light in the back that she described as like a glittering ball of light a bit bigger than a tennis ball.  She saw this in our neighbours garden and it seemed to be hopping around the plants and hedges.  (I got the full description after the event I am about to relate.) My sister told me she'd seen something odd in our neighbours garden, and she thought that perhaps his hedge was on fire.  I got up to go to the window to take a closer look, and i couldn't see what she had seen, but as we stood together a huge cluster of lights descended from the sky towards us. The lights were a blue/green in colour and looked like a cross section of a craft.  The lights came towards us a tremendous speed. We ran from the house thinking some kind of aircraft was about to crash on us, and as we stood on the front path wondering why we were still alive a black triangular shaped craft covered in a multitude of different coloured lights flew slowy over us.

It would move vertically, then stop and remain stationary for a few moments, then move horizontally, and stop, and it repeated that cycle a number of times. Then, in an instant, it disappeared by accelerating extremely quickly. It must have taken it less than .1-.2 of a second to disappear. A few points I'd like to make. First, when it was moving slowly and turning at what appeared bo be exact right angles, and starting and stopping, it did not appear to accelerate. This is what initially caught my eye. In other words, it moved without accelerating; it moved at a precise and steady speed and motion. Second, when it finally did 'take off' into the sky and disappear, it DID seem to accelerate, but at a phenomenal rate. Years later I was teaching in Taiwan. We had a discussion in class about UFOs. I asked my students if any of them had ever seen one. After a period of silence, one young man shared his story of having seen a UFO in Taiwan, I believe it was in the early or mid 80's. As he described what he had seen, I got goose bumps. He described exactly what I had seen in Ohio years ago. His description included elements such as turning at right angles, moving and stopping, then taking off ... it was uncanny. He was describing exactly what I had seen. Thank you.

It was at night, around 9:30 pm, and I was driving me and my boyfriend to a Bowling Alley in the neighboring town of Wyandotte.There were railroad tracks we had to cross, but a train was on the track, so I waited there in the distance for the train to end. My car was parked perpendicular to the train,normally,the cars would be facing the train, but since I saw it coming before I reached the tracks,I just stopped at the  street corner before the tracks.There was an empty field directly across from me, so I could watch the train go by over my left shoulder. We each commented on how long this train was.Then suddenly we saw 3 bright white lights following the train in the same direction as it was heading.We thought they were helicopters,but quick movements and darting about made us suspicion they were something else.It was as if these ""lights"" were playing a game of chicken with the train. We watched in awe when just as suddenly, 2 of the lights sharply turned upwards at a right angle and disappeared in a matter of seconds.Then only one light was left, which continued to follow above the train, turn, then loop back and forth.This last ""light"" was flying much lower now, and we could see that it was not a helicopter.Imagine our shock, when this ""light"" seemed to discover my car, all alone, waiting by the roadside.It stopped following the train, and promptly flew over to the field which my car was facing.It was hovering so low, we were able to get a perfect look at the ""light"", which wasn't just a light, but a triangular shaped craft,dull silver in color.It sat in the air silently as we stared in amazement. None of the weeds in the field even moved.It was silent and almost perfectly flat.We were frantically searching for an engine, a cockpit window, or anything that would make sense and make it recognizable, but nothing could be found.Whatever was piloting this craft could not be seen.In front, which was facing us, was the bright white light we had seen chasing the train.On the other 2 points of the triangle,there were red lights,as if tailights on a car.This is where my sighting gets unusual.My boyfriend suggested I flash my headlights at this craft.Being directly across from me and approximately",2001-08-05T00:00:00,42.19499999999999,-83.165

My future wife & i would sit and talk late into the night hours in her Chevy Vega at my parent's house. There were large old maple trees to the west, toward Saint Joseph, Mo. She worked second shift so we were usually up late into the night, sitting in the driveway. I grew up in the country, watching the night skies, used to the stars and their positions, i noticed a star directly to the north that'd never been there. Then it was gone. Then it was back. As if it was turning a light on and off every minute or so. Then there appeared two bright lights behind the maple trees, to the west. Brighter than venus, i knew they must be airships of some sort, yet they didn't move. There is an airport across the river so at first i didn't think much of it. Then the ""light"" on the left, or south, began moving south while the other remained stationary. We passed it off as airplanes or something. Two nights later the same scenerio occured. I laughed as i got out of her Vega jokingly saying ""i'm going up on the hill and see if something is there"". There was. A ball of light was there as i walked out from behind an apple tree. About twenty feet up and about eighteen inches in diameter it stood perfectly still about eighty feet from me. It seemed at the time that i'd suprised it. It sped off so fast that it disappeared nearly instantaneously to the west. I thought it'd gone behind a tree limb. It seemed to me it ""knew"" i was there. It was aware. For several weeks i saw many ""lights"". They hid behind trees. They imitated planes. They followed tree limbs as i watched them through binoculars. Everyone thought i was crazy. I can't forget it. Ten years went by and i was talking about it with my wife and she'd forgotten it. She won't talk about it. She said she dosn't remember anything about it, yet she was there. The second time we saw the bright lights behind the trees, i felt we were being hypnotised and i actually covered her eyes with my hand saying ""don't look!"", just an instinct, i guess...My father saw them one night and said it was just an airplane, but i'd been watching them for a half hour and just before he spotted them, one of them turned on a flashing light and impersonated an airplane. It was very frustrating. I can't say how many ""lights"" i saw, or when, or if it ended.... ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,
Three globular lights in a tight triangular formation passed east to west at low altitude,Weekapaug,RI,1976-08-15T22:30:00,formation,5 seconds,"Occurred : 8/15/1976 22:30  (Entered as : 08/15/76 22:30) Reported: 5/6/2001 20:01 Posted: 8/5/2001 Location: Weekapaug, RI Shape: Formation Duration:5 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17535.html,"Three globular lights in a tight triangular formation passed east to west at low altitude An old report for the record.  This sighting took place a long time ago, but I remember it very clearly.  I&#8217;m estimating the date by the age I believe I was at the time (16) and by the month we always vacationed.  Weekapaug is a small town on the south shore of Rhode Island.  There are a series of large tidal ponds along this shore that are connected to the ocean by channels about 100' wide.  The Weekapaug channel has stone jetties on either side that stick out about 100' from the beach.   On this night I was sitting on the tip of the eastern wall at about 10:30pm looking at stars.  The sky was clear overhead, but there was a heavy mist over the water to an altitude of about 30'.  As I sat there facing the sea, and due south, I noticed three dim, translucent, globular lights move by from east to west in a tight triangle formation.  The light was a pale white.  I'd estimate the speed at 50mph, the altitude at 75 to 100 feet above the water and the distance from me between 100 and 200 yards.  I watched them from about 160 degrees to about 225 degrees at which point they faded in the mist. My first thought was that they were the lights from a car's headlights hitting thicker fog out over the water, but the following observations seen to conflict with that theory. 1) The lights were well defined.  Each one looked like a frosted globe light you might see in front of someone's house, only a little more translucent and defused.  I don't know whether the lights were that way by nature or if the mist was defusing the light.  2) There were three lights that held the exact pattern, which was one light in the lead with the other two trailing at an equal distance.  3) The lights maintained a straight course and steady speed.  If they were the projection of car lights, the car would have to be making a tight turn to move the beams left to right so fast.  In such a scenario, you would expect the lights to either swing in an arc around the source, or, if they were shining on the straight edge of a fog bank just offshore, to diffuse and move away faster as the source beams swung to an orientation more parallel to the surface they were shining on.  These lights maintained a distinct shape and straight course, a very steady speed and perspective that changed in what seemed an appropriate way for an object traveling in a straight line.  In other words, as the object moved away, the two rear lights became more face-on to me than they were when it was straight out.  4) The closest a car could have been was about 200 yards behind me and the beams would have had to come right over me.  I looked around very quickly, but saw no car, nor did I see any sign of beams passing by.  Afterwards, I tried to identify a spot where a car could have made such a turn while maintaining line-of-sight with the full range in which I saw these lights and I couldn't ID such a spot. The lights struck me as a source themselves and not a reflection, and although the lights were diffused I had the distinct impression they were 3-dimensional.  I've thought about whether they might have been from a boat passing by, but there was no sound with these lights and it was a quiet night.  Several of the points above seem to conflict with this theory as well, not to mention the speed.  They definitely were not the promotional spots that you often see in the night sky.  If they were something other than projections, they could have been three independent lights in a tight formation, or part of one craft.  I'd estimate the apparent size of each of them at about the size of a thumbnail at arms length.  I would not go so far as to say these lights were extraterrestrial, but for me they were certainly UFO's in the sense that I have been unable to associate them with a rational explanation despite years of trying. Also, knew a guy who was swimming on Weekapaug's Inn Beach late one afternoon in the summer of 1978 and swears he saw a ""flying saucer"" come in off the water, fly straight overhead at a relatively low altitude and proceed inland.  That's all I know of that sighting. I was 16 at the time of my sighting and was not on drugs or drinking.  I was into astronomy at the time and enjoyed stargazing, hence my reason for being out on the dark tip of the jetty at night away from distracting lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We were at a campground west of the lake on a rise. We viewed small aircraft landing at the airport, east of the lake. The sun was behind us and near setting as we watched. The aircraft were landing from south to north, or right to left. With the telescope we could make out the N numbers on the planes. I noticed a few clouds, but the sky was generally clear. The aircraft seemed to be landing in front of a stationary object at some distance to the east. The object was below ten degrees above the horizon. Perhaps four or five planes landed in front of this object, which could have been miles further away. Two other people viewed the object. The object was a long cigar shape. While watching, the object suddenly changed attitude, like a disk tipping and the ""cigar"" appearance became an oval. It then moved away from us and was gone in under a few seconds. It made the impression of a thin metallic disk, seen in profile as a cigar while stationary, and then being seen more rounded as it tipped away from us.

I ran upstairs, to find her looking out of our bedroom window, ran over to the window myself, to discover a saucer-shaped object approximately 45-50 feet hovering behind our backyard, outside our fence toward the canyon. The saucer was dark, but it's outline was really defined, and the bottom of the it was silver like in color with rotating flashing lights.  Anyway, the object began to give us a show. It continued to hover over the outskirts of our yard, and it's lights began to change, first blue to red, red to white, then white to orange, and it continued doing this.  Then all of the sudden, the object disappered, then reappeared, but this time in another form.  The object looked like the letter ""T"" lying on it's side.  Actually it's reminded me somewhat of a the little twisty key like object on a container of corned beef or spam, the kind attached to the container, used to open it; I hope this makes sense.  In any case, this ""T"" shaped object was dark, but very defined as well, and then it disappered, and the saucer-shaped object reappeared. The saucer continued to rotate it's lights a little while longer, going from red to blue, white to orange, and then it started to move, swaying side to side, going west. The craft contined going west, swaying side to side, until my sister and I could no longer see it, and then it was gone.  Realizing it had been there for a while, I looked at the clock after it left, and it was 8:55pm. How we ended up seeing the object in the first place, is that my sister saw this blue flash of light coming over the hill, east of our house (which is behind my parents' home). My sister mentioned two years ago--the first time we've discussed this matter in years, that when she first saw it coming over the hill, she immediately ran to lock the front door, then called me upstairs, which explains the fear in her voice when she yelled my name.

My son's interest in this phenomenon rekindled my memory of the incident (which was reported to UFORIC the day after the event). I was around 15 at the time.  My friends and I were camping out in my backyard which is adjacent to a golf course.  As I lay in the tent (my friends were hanging out in the front yard...Hey..I was tired), I noticed a bright electric blue light coming from the golf course area.  Opening the tent, I noticed an object resembling a half dome with a small protusion coming from the top of the dome.  It was oriented like a half moon in a verticle position rather than flat/horizonal.  There also appeared to be a base to the dome, cylindical in shape, attached to the flat side of the dome.  Its diameter was less than that of the dome and was, perhaps, a 1/16 of the overall size of the object (which I estimate was maybe 40-60 ft in diameter). The object moved from east to west over the fairway when I lost site of it at the far end o the fairway. A few minutes later, my friends joined me in the tent and I asked them if they saw it.  They hadn't as the were in the front yard and their view was obstructed (they also weren't paying attention). We all went to sleep. Around 02:00, I remember awakening to relieve myself.  As I climbed out of the tent, I noticed a faint blue glow from the west.  Then, the beam from my flashlight struck something no more than about 20 feet away.  Took me a second to realize I was staring at a person or being.  It stood about 5 feet tall and motionless about 20 feet away just on the other side of a small hedge.  Skin was grayish in color and the eyes were a burnt yellow color.  If it were clothed, it must have been close to the same color as the being. I stood staring at this being for maybe another 10 seconds absolutely stunned.  It then seemed to dive on the ground and I didn't see it get up again.  Thinking my friends were playing a joke, I went to check on them.  They were all asleep in their sleeping bags. I immediately awakened them, and we all got out of the tent, but we did not see the being again. In the morning, we went to see where the faint blue light was coming from.  Not far from my home, there is another golf course that also had an old abandoned iron quarry.  This quarry was, maybe 500 yards from my house.  In the grass of the old quarry, we found evidence that something had flattened the grass and weeds in the old quarry.  I don't recall seeing any indentations (like from landing gear), but the long grass had definitely been packed down in a circular shape. Back in my yard, we noticed something else as well.  Where I said that the being dove on the ground, there was a rough outline of a person in the grass...browned grass when the surrounding grass was green.  The grass was also packed down, slightly, as if something had been there. I told my father what I had seen and he called, I believe, UFORIC.  They dispatched an investigator who took my story, a few photographs of the area, and radiation measurements of where I said the being dove on the ground.  He also used some sort of visual dosimeter as well.  The investigator told us that there were elevated radiation levels in the area of question.  He did not go to where I believe was the landing site. After filing my report, I never heard from the investigator again and pretty much put the event out of my until recently when my oldest son took an interest in ""aliens"" and asked me if I ever saw one (or even a spaceship).  I'm not even sure UFORIC still exists. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,40.1134,-75.1861

When I asked him if he was okay, he just looked at me with a terrifying gaze and said...do you see those lights?  I was in the front passenger seat and hadn't noticed them because of the color of the lights in his vehicle reflecting off the inside of the glass anyway.  To our left (south) through the trees we could see a grouping of lights (about 20) moving along with us at the same speed we were traveling, about 30 feet off the ground.  There is a mountain ridge also to our south, and the lights were below the ridgeline, between us and the ridge, and appeared to be about 300-500 yards away.  The lights were all blue and randomly scattered about the object.  The color could best be described as a cold electric blue.  They didn't flash or rotate.  We stopped the vehicle about a mile down the road and the object also stopped.  It span of the lights were about 100 feet and were about 20-30 feet high.  We could see the lights very well through the trees.  It just stayed there as we got out (and got a soda).  There was no sound.  When we left a couple of minutes later...it continued to ""follow"" us until we went through a cut in the hill.  When we came out the other side (the valley opens wider), the object burst out from behind the hill into the open and immediately flew over the south ridge.  We never saw it again.  We knew ""what"" we had seen and it still gives me chillbumps to think about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,38.4061,-82.063

I realized it was flying over downtown Berkley, by the college. What aroused my curiosity was that it would dart up and down, right to left very fast and just suddenly stop. I got a friend of mine to take a look and he also thought this was very strange. We drove to downtown towards the college, didn't see anything. Took a right turn on a side street and I spotted it flying over buildings (I was not driving) like it was trying to race with us for about 40 seconds. All of a sudden it was gone, so I told my friend to pull over and park. We walked to the next street over which is Telegraph. Their were a few people standing at a bus stop. My friend asked them if they saw the object. They gave us a look like we were crazy. We jogged down the street and back, didn't see anything and decided to give up. On our way back to the car between Telegraph and the street we parked on, I was on one side of the srteet and my friend on the other side.

I had my 8 month old son with me and got very afraid and ran to the car, it followed to the main street. That was last I saw of it.

It was late at night and we were going a little over the speed limit.  When I noticed a object flying in front of me, just off the road.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, then I noted that it wasn't making any sound and the lights on the aircraft were unconventional in that they rotated around the craft instead of flashing in place.  There were three colors of lights, I remember blue and green with either red or white lights.  They were rotating from my left to my right on the vehicle, which appeared as a dark shadow against the night sky.  The object was within a hundred yards of me and was cigar shaped, roughtly 20 feet wide and 8 feet with no wings or any appendages.  It was flying about 20 feet off the ground  In an attempt to get closer I speeded up to 90 miles an hour and the craft stayed in relative position to me.  Suddenly, the ship instantly speeded off to the nort!h and disappeared over a hill.  It moved with incredible speed.Suddenly my head lights went out.  I took my foot off the gas pedal and started breaking my vehicle.  I pressed the pedal a few times when the headlights came on again.  I was going to excelerate when they went off again.  I continued to break and the lights came on again.  They came on again and I noticed a  field access road off the highway and not wanting to break down on the road turned into it.

My friend and I were sitting on the driveway, leaning against the garage door talking, and I happened to look up at the sky, when something unusual caught my attention, and we're talking about WAY up in the sky. This huge, I mean really HUGE object was moving across the sky at a very slow speed.  The object was not only enormous in size, but it was white, very bright, and shaped like a dome.  It reminded me of the Captiol dome, yet lying on it's side, with this white foggy type of mist trailing out of it. My friend both sat quietly and stared at this object moving across the sky, and then it disappeared.  Afterward, my friend and I turned to one another in amazement and that was that.

My father and I saw a glowing disk in the sky about 20 years ago. I was probably about 11 years old at the time. We were in Bandon, OR, visiting my grandparents, probably during summer vacation. It was probably not before 1978 and not after 1984. At the time there was an empty field behind (SW of) the house where my father and I were laying on a blanket watching a meteor shower, probably the Perseids, so it probably occurred on the night of August 11 or 12. It was perhaps an hour or two after sunset, around 10:00PM PDT. I think there was no moon, so I'm guessing that the year was 1980 based on star charts. It was breezy, and there were some low clouds to the S and SE, but most of the rest of the sky was clear. No precipitation. We saw what appeared to be a searchlight turn on, illuminating the clouds to the S, between 15 and 30 degrees above the horizon. No beam was visible. The illumination was moving N toward us, following a smooth arc toward the W. By the time the light reached the edge of the clouds it had slowed down slightly and was travelling approximately W. This was about 3 or 4 seconds after I had first noticed it. It was somewhere between 50 and 70 degrees above the horizon. At this point I was surprised (and very frightened!) to see a featureless glowing white disk emerge from the clouds. Apparently the clouds had been illuminated by this disk flying through or slightly above them, rather than by a ground-based searchlight. Not sure how high it was. The light had appeared slightly fuzzy as it moved through the clouds, but against the clear sky it was a definite disk with sharply defined edges. Not quite as bright as the full moon, and slightly smaller than two moons side by side. It looked solid (opaque). It continued on its smooth arc and flew off toward the SW, gaining speed and diminishing in brightness. The elapsed time from when it emerged from the clouds until it was no longer visible was about 2 or 3 seconds. We jumped up, hurried indoors and told our other family members about it. I was too scared to go outside again. There was no sound, no blinking. I don't recall any other air traffic in the area. There was nothing in the local paper the next day. I considered reporting it to MUFON at the time, but didn't, since we had no photos. Now I wish I had at least written it down because it's hard to remember details that long ago. Now my father only remembers ""seeing something strange"" that we were both ""pretty excited about."" I remember more detail than he does, maybe because I was so scared and because I considered reporting it and thought about how I would describe it. I'm finally reporting it to you now because I recently saw something else strange (reported to you 3/11/01), and was pleased to see 3 other reports of the same thing on your site. Better late than never, I hope! Background of the observers: I'm now a 32 year old software engineer with a B.S. in computer science and electrical engineering. My father has an M.S. in electrical engineering and is recently retired from the semiconductor manufacturing industry. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,43.0596,-124.368

I have told few people of what I saw but brush it off as a experimental out of nearby Moffet Field.  I can see it vividly still and can draw its shape.. As I get older I still wonder what it was. I can still see the square lights that were attached to the wings. They were so strong and backlit the craft shape.

Coming down Old Hillsboro Rd., in the winter of 1980, I saw a very brilliant light. It was low to the ground, sort of shadowing the top of the trees. In other words the craft was following the contour of the landscape. As it got closer the light divided into two lights of which they appeared to be some type of flood light. It also looked like shafts of light the farther away it got. It proceeded to come in and the closer it came to the road the lower it got. I was so amazed with the sight that I stopped the car and got out, my wife was in the car with me. I had completely cut the motor of the vehicle off. This craft was flying soundlessly over the road and us.  It was shaped like a rectangular box, with a slanted plexiglass looking windshield. It was moving very slowly, and my wife was telling me to get into the car and lets go. It was a full moon night and we both saw the ufo very plainly. Not like some kind of light in the sky, we saw the entire vehicle. And I have not been the same until this very day. My wife and I are not mental patients and have never been.

I went up into a space craft. Two beings greeted me with open arms. They showed me secrets of the world such as cold fusion, splitting the atom, and the advancement of computers. They were not threatening in any way and actually tried to comfort me. They put peaceful thoughts in my head. They also showed me what would happen if we did not stop nuclear weapons. I was feeling very sad at that time. I then blacked out or something. Only to find myself as a new born baby. I can remember being born. I know it sounds crazy but it is very true. I just recently explained my birth to my mother who was dumfounded and speechless. I have always had the feeling that I am supposed to find my original self and I have been searching ever since.

Knowing by now my memory of the event will not be totally accurate I have not wished to report it. However, the memory of something very out of the ordinary remains and particular parts of the memory remain clearly as if it only happened yesterday. I remember even to this day what I was doing just before the event and I remember my dog had been with me at the time that I was sitting outside my house in my yard. I don't remember seeing the object come closer to me, so that I can't verify that for its been too long. However, I remember seeing the object either a little higher or a little lower than the telephone line than runs through my backyard and wasn't more than 150 yards in distance from where I had been sitting when I remember seeing it. This object was a classic saucer shape. It still seems like it just suddenly appeared and I remember being unsure of what it was I was seeing. My parents didn't allow me to see scary movies, in fact I had no idea what a ""UFO"" was until I picked up a book in the school library at 6 or 7 years old, recognizing the picture on the front -- suddenly realizing I had seen that same thing. I remember the object hovering over the yard in the far corner, and the noise I heard is what I remember the most...a drowning repetitive sound that never changed in pitch. The moment I felt fear struck me when this object unknown to me at the time to what it could possibly be, overtook me when the lights from the object fell to the ground, like a spotlight. I can't say for sure what colors they were except that I believe it was possibly 3 colors, either red, white, and green, or red white, and blue. I'm not even sure anymore how those colors actually formed on the ground other than it formed a circle below the object. My instinct even at that young of age took over, and I ran (luckily my door wasn't very far from where I had been sitting) straight into the house with my dog ! right be hind me. My Mom recounts the incident, still remembering me coming inside screaming and saying there was something in the sky. She says my dog was very upset and spooked, and acted like she was nervous. When my Mom went to look outside to see what I could have been possibly talking about, it had disappeared without a trace. My Mom also says she remembers me mentioning the noise and she questioned me, asking if it was a helicopter. I told her no, and described the noise to her. She remembers me walking out in the yard to show her where I had seen it -- in approximately the corner of my yard. For many years now I have tried to tell myself that if I saw anything it had to be something the military made. However I have never gotten over that feeling of complete fear when those lights hit the ground...as if whatever was in that object, knew I was there. I am a student of psychology, I know that the mind recreates memories, however there are three things I know I couldn't have make up -- the fear I felt -- that sound I heard and the fact it hovered without any wobbling. Recently, I have begun to accept my memory of the event and have done some research and that is why now I can share it with someone who might find the report useful in some way. I'm not afraid that someone might think I was crazy, because I pondered the thought myself for many years and truthfully at one time I preferred that thought over the thought of it really being something unknown.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,40.1703733197556,-105.08544969450101

We watched each other's houses to prevent crime.  I don't remember the date, or even the year.  I thought it was perhaps in the summer time because it was clear outside.  I was looking at the surrounding houses and happened to look up in the sky.  I was looking between two neighbor's houses.  In the sky I saw a triangle of 3 red lights.  The triangle seemed to remain in place for a period of time.  Then, in the blink of an eye, it moved from one place to another.  It didn't drift from one place to another like a balloon or a plane would do.  The lights weren't like an airplane's lights.

I thought at first it was a stealth fighter not having seen one at this time.  However, this craft was dull silver metallic in color and was shaped similar to a heart with all rounded contours. It had a small rounded nose like a pencil eraser that extended out from where the point of the heart would be.

It was approximately 00:30 on a summer evening in 1982.  We were heading south on Rte 495.  There was a normal amount of light traffic for this area and time of evening.  We both saw an unusual light in the sky, far off.  It was obviously not a star (too large and too yellow) and not a street or highway lamp (we could see others) and it was moving towards us.  I believe it was in the sky on the driver's side of the car.  It was not alarming, but continued observation for several minutes piqued our curiosity, because it was clearly moving, becoming larger in our sight.  It was kind of a feeling like, ""what the hell *is* that?"" I remember that we reached a point of wanting to stop the car and observe it for a while.  It moved to a position where it was too high over us for me to see and I began looking for an exit to get off the highway so we observe.  My friend, during this time, had been craning his neck to look up through the windshield to keep track of the thing.  Finally, he leaned way out of the window and looked over the car.  He was in this position when I took the next exit, which I believe took us to a little-traveled portion of Rte 110.  I heard him exclaiming like, ""whoah!"" out the window.  Almost immediately, I stopped the car on the side of the road and we got out.  I remember that it was extraordinarily, strangely quiet -- I mean, no other cars, no activity evident in the nearby houses.  I looked up, and the thing was right above us.  I'm bad a judging size and distance, but it was an enormous platform-looking thing to me with lights (I don't remember the color or if there was any flashing) on the bottom, mainly around the perimeter, I think -- I vaguely remember seeing the edges as darker than the light-polluted sky.  Because it was a good 200 to 600 feet up (I really don't know), the rest of it was dark, and the sky was dark, I got the impression, from the lights, that it was rectangular, although my friend later said t! hat he t hought it was diamond shaped.  Anyway, the thing appeared to be immense, like the size of a football field, or maybe 75% of that, I don't know.  A feeling of shocklike amazement hit me immediately, because something like this simply was not in my experience, which may help explain why I couldn't judge its size or height in better than the general terms given.  I felt transfixed (not by any outside force, but by surprise and emotion).  I glanced around, expecting to see cars stopped on the road and people hanging out of every window, gazing in awe and perhaps panicking at the sight of this thing, but there was no one, no disturbance whatsoever, no cars passing on the nearby tressel.  The object made no sound at all.  I remember standing there, staring up at it with my friend, just staring for another ten or twenty seconds, and it started to move away from us, just a bit, slowly -- then suddenly it accelerrated at an alarming speed (I don't know if it was an ""impossible"" speed, but it was not like anything I'd ever seen), I mean, it just zipped away.  We seemed to be able to continue to observe it as an indistinct light, as we had seen it at first, for a while, but then it was gone.  We were left stunned.  One of the most amazing parts of the experience was that I felt no real desire to speak to anyone about it the next day or thereafter.  My friend told me he had felt the same.  Even now, when I mention it, feeling that I had told so-and-so about it before, long ago, they say I didn't.  It's a bit weird.  My friend and I discussed it only once or twice thereafter -- this is how I found out that he thought it was diamond shaped, while I had thought it was rectangular.  He concurred with my ""football-field-sized"" description, to my recollection.  Very, very strange.  I've never seen anything like it since, and I am unaware of other UFO reports like it.  I have no doubt that it happened, though.  I have never used drugs, by the way, and have never in my life been drunk.  Although I had thought once or twice ! about do ing so in the past, I have never reported this to anyone unknown to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It vaguely had the shape of a giant iol rig, but had no clearly discernible surface despite the arc-bright lights.  A deafening sound of an electric generator, at possibly 90 decibels, with extreme low bass wave undertones was heard, but no down drafts, wind, jet blast or discernable means of levitation (moving wind) was observ The 150 ft tall, 30 ft wide craft, vaguely resembling an extremely brightly lit, vertically flying oil rig or wide-width broad cast tower, flew over our house at 364 Garret Circle, at 2:30 Am Nov 7, 1984, 6 miles west of Carrollton, Georgia. Initially the object rose up from a forest 100 yeards to the north of our house, and was spinning head over heels vertically in the air, making deafening rumbling and electrical generator sounds.  It was the deafening waves of sound and the bright lights that woke both me and my wife up.  I am a fairly prominent political scientist in my field, a two-time Fulbright scholar, a Ph.D. with long interests in astronomy, and my wife has a Masters in public administration.  I am a Scout leader, and a responsible college administrator now (1997).  My wife and I instantly woke up, flew to the front yard ard, and observed the craft cease spinning and it floated towards us 25 to 30 feet above the ground in a VERTICAL flying position.  You must imagine it is unreasonable to think that aerodynamics allow such a huge object to fly without wings, moving air, jet-blast, or any discernible means of propulsion, to fly vertically in position, but move horizontally at 1 to 2 miles an hour.  We watched for 10 to 12 minutes as the craft approached, passed over our pecan tree and house, clearing it by 8 to 10 feet, and floating south-southwest, it slowly disappeared over the horizon.  The craft was followed within about 100 ft by two approx 10 to 15 ft in diameter, red translucent and free-floating globes.  The large craft had immensely bright lights (as bright as an arc welders light), none of which were directional. The craft passed slowly over our front yard, from the forest across the street north, above our pecan tree, and our one story home, passing approximately 1 to 15 ft above the! house.  I could walk along with the craft across our yard slowly and keep up with it, until I hit our back fence line 70 yards behind the house.  I could easily see for several minutes the craft from no more than 20 feet below it.  As hard as I tried, I could not see past the bright lights to a surface of the craft.  This was extremely weird, since a street light illuminates the surface of it's pole, but these immensely bright lights would not illuminate the surface of the craft, which appeared as black mat invisible.  The lights were randomly distributed, with maybe 3 dozen lights, 5% red-colored.  I stress that the craft had NO WIND DRAFTS,  no down drafts, no jet stream or sound, no discernible flying mechanism -- just a 90 decibel level sound of electric whine as with a giant generator, and waves and waves of deep bass undertones.  The translucent globes had no discernible content inside, and were randomly floating behind the large craft, following it but not gaining on i! t, nor attached to each other or the large craft in any way.  They floated like directionally motivated soap bubbles, following the craft.  The craft was so near me I could have lobbed an apple upwards with a hand and hit it.  I recall being extremely intense about observing the environment, watching how the craft flew almost over our pecan tree, and cast moving shadows through it but did not disturb its branches in any way -- all to verify the physical reality of the observation.  My wife observed it with me, but for 1 minute moved into the house to flash lights from the porches at it to see if it would respond, to no avail.  She immediately came back out to observe it with me again as we moved to the backyard.  We kept confirming to each other we were awake verbally, but we agreed not to describe it to each other until we independently wrote a description up, with drawings -- without conversation -- and traded the descriptions to check each others observations.  The only dis! crepancy I can remember in our descriptions is that she thought there were a different number of red globes than I (I remember two, I think she recalled three, or one, but not two).  We were up discussing our reports to each other until one half hour later, we heard the drone of helicopter and airplan engines outside.  We went outside and coul clearly see that 1/2 mile to the east two black and low-flying military tyope helicopters, with forward looking light beams, were accompanying a low- and slow flying two engine plane.  They circled around our territory in a radius of about 1 mile, and criss-crossed once going from north to south and followed the trajectory of the crafts which had vanished.  We advertised in the Carrollton paper about a week later for other potential observers, but got no takers.  We interviewed neighbors, one of which was a pilot immediately to the north of us, but noone reported any perceptions or sightings.  We called the local sherrif's office, and th! e Carrollton police that morning to ask if anyone reported anything to them, and they said no reports were turned in.  At one point we gave an interview to someone who may have been connected to Mufon -- at least he was a friend of a friend who said he had connections with some reporting organization, but we never heard anything back from him.  We possibly could trace back who that person was, as he was a son of an elderly woman in our faith, who is now deceased.  We simply had NOONE to report the information to in those days of no internet or organized reporting networks.  I have read sporadically in the UFO literature, but have never run across a similar description.  I would be grateful to know of similar descriptions in a sighting.  The only ones that vaguely resemble ours are two reports in Alien Update by Tim Good by two UK couples in the early 1990s, but their sighting was of an orange colored rectangular (vertical) craft, and the description was not too close, or clear! ly written.  That night was slightly hazy if I remember correctly, with no winds.  We aver very curious to this day as to the purpose behind the military recon helicopters and plane.  I would like to request public anonymity, but I would talk to a researcher, as I am sure my wife would.  I attempted to use a camera, but I had no film in it at the time, to my regret. ((Name and number deleted)).  Sincere thanks.  Again, I WILL talk to a researcher, but I'd prefer at this time that my name not be used, until I am convinced of the credentials of a researcher.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,33.57161942446043,-85.09630359712231

If my memory serves me correctly, it was Thanksgiving night. We were playing behind the house on our uncle's two-acre property. I looked up for some reason and a fireball seemed to descend at a slight arc directly into my face. The fireball was changing with reds, oranges, and yellows moveing about and actually looked as if it was on-fire. From my prospective, it changed from the size of a golf ball to totally engulfing my whole line of sight. It only took about 2 seconds for it to descend to me and it was not a direct path, but instead slightly arcing. Startled, I looked at my cousin who also seemed surprised. We briefly discussed the occurrence with great excitement, as children do, and ran back to the house. I can't remember the exact reaction from any of our adult relatives, but I do recall that no notice was paid to our story. To this day, my cousin and I remember and occasionally discuss our experience. The hair on my neck stands up every time.

Perhaps, above the remote area of Coperopolis, California. The meteor did not touch down, however it ignited several thousand acres of grass fires, in the range land around Coperopolis, which burned for weeks following the siteing. The meteror became what appeared to be the landing light of an approaching aircraft, flying staight ahead south, while sweaping east to west.

Please take the time to read it completely. It's honest and true. Almost 16 years ago (11/20/1985) while on route to a Professional Photography Seminar in Indiana, another Professional Photographer and I witnessed something that I still can't explain to this day. Let me go into detail. We were traveling south on Interstate 43 at approximately 4:15 a.m. near Cedar Grove, Wisconsin (approximately 39 miles north of Milwaukee). I remember making a comment about how black and crystal clear the sky is. I am an amateur astronomer and you tend to notice details about the sky such as (where the moon is, sunrise time, constellations, meteors, etc.). My partner, who was driving, let out a yell (and a few choice words) and told me to look at that thing. I said what thing? He told me to look east toward Lake Michigan. I couldn't believe my eyes. We both saw a greenish glowing orb east toward Lake Michigan. We pulled over quickly on the gravel shoulder of I-43. I looked at my watch and it was now 4:18 a.m. We both got out of the car and just stared at the object. The orb or whatever it was, appeared east from our location at an angle of approximately 45 degrees off the eastern horizon. It was impossible to judge distance given that we had nothing to reference it to (the area is extremely dark with few lights.) We were approx. 2 miles west of Lake Michigan. The size of the object was difficult to ascertain given the lack of reference. I, however, did a simple comparison that gave me some sort of repeatable ratio to the object. I held my arm straight out fully extended toward the object and made a tight fist to reference the size of my fist to the object. The object was almost the same size as my closed fist at arm's length. The time that the object remained at this size was about four minutes. During this period of time, the orb didn't seem to move or change in brightness or color. It remained clearly round and had a definite diffused greenish glow to it. After this period of time (approximately 4 minutes), the object did a strange thing. The object began to i! ncrease rapidly in size I did my extended arm test again and this time the object was about the size of an open hand with the fingers fully extended. (At this time, I think we both felt a sense of fear at what we were seeing.) I can only estimate that the object stayed at this size for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. After this time period (approximately 8 minutes from first seeing the object), the object began to decrease in size and became as before, about the size of a closed fist at arm's length. At about this time, my partner grabbed his camera, and fired off a few frames of film. (Unfortunately, he had only daylight portrait film loaded) Because of the low ISO rating, the film was not sensitive enough to record low light without a tripod and long exposure. The next thing that happened was even stranger. While we both observed the object, it seemed to expand outwardly and de-materialize right in front of our eyes. We both observed the object a total of about (10 Minutes) including the time when we saw it de-materialize. The time according to my watch was now 4:30 AM. I know how crazy this probably sounds to you, but as God as my witness, this event is true. We had to be in Indiana at a Professional Seminar by 8:30 AM so we had to continue on our journey. The following day after the sighting, I called The Center For UFO Studies in Chicago. I have to admit I felt awkward and a bit uneasy calling in about a subject such as this. The man who talked to me was pleasant and asked a lot of questions (such as directions, time, location, clouds, etc.). I answered carefully and honestly as best I could. When I had finished describing what we had seen, he told me that the Center For UFO Studies ""had received three separate reports from three commercial airline pilots who had apparently seen something east of my location at approximately the same time and date.""   He; however, wouldn't go into detail. I don't use drugs; never have, and never will. I only have an occasional alcoholic beverage. I have a clean record and have never been in trouble with the law. I have never had any mental problems. What I have said is 100% true and honest. Before this sighting, I would have laughed at people who claim to see UFO's. I no longer laugh at this subject. Many rational people have observed unexplainable things in our skies. I, frankly, don't know what we saw that early morning almost 16 years ago. I do know it was not a normal occurrence or imagination. One important thing we did the next day was to make a tape recording with all the information and details still fresh in our minds. I also made several duplicate tapes and have distributed them. I know this sounds paranoid; however, at the time we took this event very seriously. If you need additional information or would like to contact me by telephone please call me collect. My phone number is (920) ((number deleted)) after 5 PM central time week days. I would appreciate it if you would not use my name in your Sightings Data Base.

My roommate and I were on my our to work one morning.  I can only estimate that it was in the mid to late 1980's since this happened so long ago.  There was a full moon setting as the sun was rising.  While stopped at a red light I commented to my roommate that the moon appeared to have a ""crack"" cut out in the bottom of the moon.  Since the moon was nearing the horizon, I assumed that the visual appearance was caused by a telephone pole or something that we could not see.  After the street light turned green we continued on our way and I really did not think about it untill a couple of minutes later I glanced over and saw that the crack was still there, only bigger now, about 1/4 across the diameter of the moon.  This time I was driving and the horizon was moving along but the notch remained.  We kept watching as we were driving and could see the crack growing.  We really did not know what was happening and thought the moon was splitting in two before our very eyes.  We pulled over in a spot where we had a good view and watched to see what was happening.  (We figured if the moon was really breaking up, why bother going to work because we were probably all going to die?)  We watched as the crack literally went all the way to the top of the moon and gave the appearance of a moon spit into two halves!  We sat waiting for the earth to be destroyed or something, but then the ""crack"" drifted to the right of the moon and off of the surface entirely after about 10 minutes.  When we got to work and explained why we were late, everyone thought we were crazy of course except for one other guy who also saw the event.  I called the newspaper and TV stations but they thought I was crazy too.  The only explanation I can imagine is that somewhere on the earths surface, a rocket was being launched into space and the exhaust trail cast a shadow on the moon.  Is this possible?  Or do you have any other similar repor! ts as th is in your database?  I know the moon did not split in half that day, but I am not making up what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I came out of my home with my mother to visit my aunt up the street.  As we stepped out of the house, we noticed right away in the north sky (direction we were walking towards) a static shiny metallic silver sphere.  It was a clear, sunny day so that this object seemed out of place and as a result there were lots of people on the street pointing and gazing at this object.  My mother and I did not stop walking, and on the way to my aunt's house, my mother ran into a friend, who was also looking at this strange object.  He happened to have a pair of binoculars, and my mother took a look, and so did I.  No more details of the object could be discerned through the binoculars, though it seemed to give certain off colours as light reflected off it, kind of like a disco ball.  Now, after a half hour of looking at this seemingly still object, we went over to my aunt's house.  We walked back home later on that night, and the object was no longer visible.  I had been thinking about this object all day and later on that night we saw a news report on it on TV.  Apparently the same object had been and filmed not only in my home city of Valparaiso, but also in Santiago, Punta Arenas, Buenos Aires and other cities and towns in Chile and Argentina all within one day.  They showed clip of the object, which looked the same as the one I had witnessed.  It was said on the news that it was not a weather balloon as many that had seen the object suspected, and that it had been witnessed by thousands of people.  Nothing else was made of this event, and I never heard of it again.  Even though I was a child at the time, I can still remember the object looming in the north sky, and I'm sure that it could not have been explained by any natural phenomenon.

I thought I saw a small private plane in the distance approaching, so I turned up my camera and set it on bulb, hoping the passing plane and its lights would cause a streak on the film.... anyway, as the craft approached, it was evident that it was flying very low and very slow. When the damn thing passed me overhead... about 60 feet in the air, it wasn't a plane at all, but a rectangular craft about 20 feet wide and about 50 feet long with a series of lights on the bottom lit up in no particular pattern. By the time I arranged my camera it was out of range. I snapped pictures but nothing came out. The craft was totally silent. I contacted the Air Force in nearby Warner Robbins and the tower told me they had no activity on their radar at the time I reported it. I feel especially lucky to have seen not only this craft close up, but another when I was quite young.

We had the news on that night and several others. There was nothing about it. I was a little histerical. The car started ok. We were ok. Nobody else saw it.

At the time of the sighting, I was a California Highway Patrol Officer for 6 years and very good at detail and observation.  A friens and I were driving fron San Jose, CA. to Mazatlan, Mexico over Christmas holidays in Dec. 1988.  It was approximately 3:55 a.m. when my friend kept insisting that I look out the driver's window (he was driving, I was in the passenger's seat).  I was busy talking and kept ignoring his request.  Finally, just to shut him up, I looked out his window.  What I saw made me scream in excitement, not fear.  I told him to immediately pull off the road so I could have a better look.  I sat on the hood of the car for the next 2 hours writing down my observations.  We thought, at first, that what we were looking at was a freak act of nature where a star was unusually close to the earth.  It looked like a partical star at first except that it was 3/4 the size of the full moon that was out that night.  Also, when we were driving, my friend told me that this object he was looking at did not seem to be left in the distance as we were driving, but rather keeping parallel to us.  It was hugh!  If the stars in the sky could be compared to a golf ball, this ufo was the size of a  over-sized basketball!  At first, it was just this white light being eminated from it's center.  There was no solidness to it, just lights being refracted.  The ""star""  slowly floated in several directions ( I wrote it all down as to it's positions) with no rhymm or reason.  Then it changed colors and a red light appeared in the center of this ""star"" horizontally and vertically (like a cross), in it's center.  It still continued to ""float"" from left to right and up and down.  The object continued to change color as the points of the light continued to grow and shrink with a blue color. (It looked like a starburst that was growing and shinking.  At this time, I still thought that it was some unusual astronomical  disturbances until this ""star"" suddenly ""ZOOMED"" in closer to us! .At this time, I became fearful and jumped into the car.  this ""star"" ""ZOMED back and forth without any visible  signs of movement!  My best analogy would be this,  it looked like the opening and closing of a camera lens, (like the aperature of a camera opening and closing.  It was as if this ""star"" ""Zoomed"" in on us to take a better look!  Ithe ""star"" continued to change colors from white with red, to white with red, to white with red and blue.  It contiued to slowly float in various directions and changing shapes.  As the sun was rising,  the other stars in the sky disappeared except for this one.  It was the only object in the sky as the sun rose.  The lights disappeared as the sun was rising and I expected the object to disappear.  Instead, a thin, long silver/gray line in the sky remained.  There was no longer lights, but rather a very bright or very big object remained.  As the sun was high in the sky, this ""star"" slowly drifted higher and higher into the sky until just a pinpoint was visible.  It slowly disappeared. As we arrived in Mazatlan, I quickly bought the newspapers to read of the incident.  No article was written re: a U.F.O that night.  THIS WAS NOT A WEATHER BALLOON OR ANY OTHER MILITARY OR GOVERNMENTAL EXPERIMENT.NOTHING ON THIS EARTH COULD POSSIBLY MOVE AND ""ZOOM"" AS THIS ""STAR DID!",2001-08-05T00:00:00,38.45256501240695,-122.71790012406949

At first, I thought it might have been a helicopter searching for something, but I didn’t hear the sound of the blades cutting through the air. The sky was very dark blue and the stars were out, but when I tried to see where the light was coming from I couldn’t see a thing. I thought at least I would see a silhouette of the thing from where the light came. I called to my nephew, who was about 9 or 10 years old at the time, to come outside.  He yelled back that he was watching something on television. A few minutes later the light went out. This was the strangest experience I ever had and remember it forever.

I arose from the sofa to slip back to bed when a bright reddish orange triangle shaped object caught my attention in the night sky.  The blinds were open on the patio door and the bright light was first visible in the top upper left corner of the door as the bright object became descending toward me.  At first I thought it was a falling airplane but realized it was a UFO.  My glasses were in the bedroom so I turned and started yelling, ""There's something in the sky!""  My husband and I met in the bedroom door and I told him to look out the patio door as I groped around in the dark for my glasses.  When I got back to the den, my granddaughter was on her knees in the playpen looking out the door where my husband was also standing and looking.  The blinds over the double windows on the left wall were also open (we lived in a rural area with few trees and no outside lights).  Through those windows, this huge object, changing colors, making a droning noise, was rolling about 30 ft off the ground and apx 20 ft from the house.  It was spectacular!  I thought it was crashing.  The shape of the object had changed from triangular to cylindrical but was all ablur with the changing colored lights and the rolling motion.  It went directly behind our house and three small white planes enterred it from different directions, very fast like bees.  As it cleared the small hill behind our property, it shot a bright green star at us that got larger as it came closer then seemed to just fade out.  We marveled over the event for a few minutes, and surprisingly enough, went back to bed and to sleep (including the baby) and didn't mention it again for approximately forty hours. This was reported in the Dallas Morning News on December 10, 1990, as a Soviet booster rocket plunging to earth.  However, their archived story is somewhat different from the story that was actually printed in the newspaper. We witnessed the event in Canton, Texas which is fifty-five miles east of Dallas.  The object was first seen in the southwest coming east then turned and headed due west towards Dallas.  It appeared to be propelled and not out of control.

I read with interest your news releases about the sightings in Arizona in March 1997.  My husband and I were traveling to Tucson in February 1991 on a very dark night.  At about 10:00 I noticed a row of lights in the distance.  I thought there must have been a house on a hill with all its lights on.  It looked like it was about a mile or so away.  As we approached it appeared that the brightness of the lights suddenly increased, as if the ""house"" had tilted.  We approached a rest stop, about 20 or 25 miles east of Quartzite, Arizona, where the lights were hovering.  There were about six white lights in a row.  Since it was so dark I thought they were some high antennas over the rest stop.  I could see no object, only the lights.  We had never been there before and were not familiar with the area.  There were also two smaller red lights in the area that seemed to be slowly moving.  Since our car was traveling at about 65 miles per hour, I thought they were also antennas, but !thought it was odd that they seemed to be moving.  As we passed the white lights, I said to my husband, who was driving, ""There are some strange lights up there.""  He only had an opportunity to glance up and see the white lights, but since they were quite high in the sky, perhaps 100 feet, he only saw them momentarily. As we passed, I looked back, and there were the same number of red lights on the other side, which were blinking somewhat randomly, not in any pattern.  We continued on to Tucson, and I asked someone who was familiar with that road if they ever saw any odd lights at that rest stop, and he said he thought he had, so I dismissed them as antennas.  On the way home, we took at good look at that rest stop during the day, and there were no high antennas and no hills or mountains nearby.  We have been on that road several times since then, and once we took a frontage road near that rest stop and noticed there was a power plant about 1/4 mile from there that could not b!e seen from the highway.  Last February my husband and I again traveled to Tucson at night and stopped at that rest stop to get a few hours sleep.  The only lights we saw were some red ones on a low post that were more or less vertical, and definitely much closer to the ground than the ones we had witnessed that night.  We have mentioned the sighting to a few people but never have officially reported it.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

Lights went around it, different colors.  They blinked.  I heard nothing.  It just sat there, over my head as if to let me look at it.  I saw a small square in the bottom, like a door.  The dimensions were hard to tell, I was only 16 at the time.  I do remember though, there was definetly not enough room for an adult to stand up in there.  I was so dumbfounded, as I had always read about UFO's but never really believed.  There I was, a young small town girl, seeing what was the most amazing thing in my life.

I was sitting outside that day.  It was a very clear starry night (which is very usual in our part of the world) when my attention was drawn to a passenger aircraft flying over (I would like to point out that I like watching them fly past,night or day, beause I have a huge interest for Aviation).  We have an International airport in the city, so I guessed Commercial Airlines used it as a waypoint, thus frequently passing overhead.  Anyway, on this occasion, a strange thing happened.  As I stared at the aircraft's strobes flashing away, an object like a star (but without the twinkle) suddenly appeared at some distance behind the aircraft.  This object then suddenly sped up towards the airplane at incredible speed and stopped right behind it, then it started moving from side to side, as if studying the airplane.  It would move back abruptly, then suddenly flash forward, but never overtook the aircraft.  What fascinated me was the irregularity in speed and distance to the airliner.  There was no pattern that would suggest some sort of light reflection or something like that.   Anyway, after trailing the Aircraft for about 20-25 seconds, it changed direction completely to the right, traveled some distance,(to scale with the aircraft, I would say about 10-15 lengths of the wingspan) then simply vanished.  I continued to stare at the airplane until it vanished, thinking it might uccur again but nothing happened. (Sorry about the date. I'm not even sure of the year and month; it was just a wild guess.)

This was in early spring of 1992 or 1993.  I noticed what I believed to be ""flashlights"" in a field directly south of the house I was in.  Activity after dark was not common this time of the year so I went outside to check it out. I quickly realized the lights were not flash lights at all.  The Lights appeared to be multy colored orbs or balls of light that changed color rapidly.  I would say the flashing or color changning was similar to when one is star gazing and the stars seem to flicker in wavelength.  They were brighter and more clear than any light I have seen at that distance. The LITS were SE of my location and moved to the E before the event was over.  The is a local airport approx. 1 mile S of the house.  I tried to rationalize what I was seeing as Chopper's from the airport, but the LITS ducked below and then would reappear randomly and differnt locations.  The wind was not notably strong, but even on windy night I can hear all manner of traffic at the airport.  That night I heard nothing.  The Lights, there had to have at least seven, were continually dropping below the horizon then returning to maybe 10 degrees above the horizon.  The were not connected to each other in any way i.e. moved seprately.  They were moving to quickly verticly and horizontally to be winged aircraft and sometimes would hover in one position.  I observed the craft for 2-3 minutes when I decided to find a witness.  I literally dragged my younger brother out into the back yard to watch.  He saw the same thing I did, but with fewer craft, maybe three.  One craft stayed in a hover the other went below the horizon for a final time.  The one that was hovering by itself flew almost exactly east to west flying directly over our heads.  It was had gained a lot of altitude in a short period and was probably @ or above 10,000 ft.  The lone LITS went from hovering above the eastern horizon to below the houses in about 10-15 seconds.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,38.924561847389555,-94.35537228915663

This is a report of an earlier sighting the exact date I am unsure of due to the tramatic effect it had.I was presently working as a security guard at a condominium on St. Augustine Beach Florida.It was an eerie night and I was standing in the parking lot beginning to get bored so my mind started to wander. I was looking out through space because the night was crystal clear even though there was a lot of heat lightning over the sea.I was listening to my car radio and lying on the hood of my car when I noticed one of the stars ( I was attempting a trial of astral projection)had suddenly left its place in the sky and moved to another location.This upset me a little because I am inteligent and believe that it is perfectly possible for something to travel through space to another planet.So I left my post for a little while and drove a couple of blocks to an all night convenient store for a pack of cigarettes.I was much calmer at this point and was beginning to forget the whole thing when I noticed a sensation of being completely alone as I was driving back to the parking lot.It seemed like I could here the crickets humming from miles away and the sound of my own heartbeat was clearly audible.I parked the car got out and started my patrol around the condo.I was just starting to round the corner when I notised a little fog was visible and I could see the parking lot lights.Suddenly I noticed from my left someting approching at a very slow speed through the light fog.I remember thinking I hope this is a flock of pelicans but unfortunately it was not. I saw a ship at an altitude of about 20 ' traveling less than 30 mph moving across the parking lot.I noticed the design had to be alien because of its overall shape being unlike anything of the earth my experience coming from being in the army and my father who worked for Grumman corp.The cockpit was like anondized metal black and opaque like some kind of energy absorbing substance.I believe the color of the ship was subdued green. The wings were delta shaped and! bent do wnword  away from the fuselage.It was almost past when I noticed engines and ports situated in back and tucked under the wings.Just the a tremendouse muffled blast came out of the engines and I could follow its tightly twisted vapor trail till the object was completely out of site way way out into space in about 10 seconds.THere is much more too be told about ie. its physical effects on myself but I have run out of time for now.,2001-08-05T00:00:00,29.87903129973475,-81.36659177718833

This may or may not intrest you in that it was not recent, but several years ago I saw something. I haven't told this story but to a select few... In the Fall of 1994 two friends and I were driving my car from Glenwood Springs, Colorado to Phoenix.  We got a late start, and did most of the driving well after dark. We passed through Moab, Utah and continued South. I had never been passed Moab, and was surprised when we started passing through some hills on a small two lane highway that was surrounded on both sides of the road by Lodgepole Pines. I recall this distinctly and paid close attention to the sign that read ""Welcome to the White National Forest."" As I came over the crest of a large hill, I noticed in the high distant sky what appeared to be three yellowish-white lights that formed a triangle. I thought it was VERY strange, and woke my friend up whom was in the passenger seat. I didn't say anything, just poked him. We both sat speachless at a dead stop in the road, and watched as the three still lights started to rotate as if it were one. They rotated round and round for a few seconds and then all of the sudden the three lights shot off in the three oppisite directions that each of the ""points"" of the triangle were pointing towards. That was it... we sat in the middle of the dark desolate highway for a few moments trying to make sense of it. Our third friend asleep in the back never realized what went on while he slept in a car in the middle of the desert. A few years later I lost my breath when I watched the movie ""Fire In The Sky,"" and saw that the story took place in ""The White National Forest."" ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We drove to ""Red Mule"" for ice-cream, then went straight to the friend of my daughter's home to await her mother, and my wife who were shopping in ""Batesville"" 35 miles distant. The girls played in the front yard and I remained in the truck. At approximatly 3:30 PM. A ""B2"" stealth bomber approached my vehicle at a right angle, and would fly directly over my truck. I hurriedly left the truck for an unobstructed view. This was a first and only phisical view of the B2. It was real low, real slow, real large, real black, and almost noiseless. Imagine my thrill as it lazily passed over me. I turned as it went over, and called the girls to look-up. They did, as they lined to my left. At this time,the B2 was maybe a hundred yards past. Then, the corner of my right eye picked-up the site of a ""silver/metalic disc hurtling down crossways, right to left at about 45 degrees. It looked as though it would contact the ""B2"". In seemingly nothing-flat, the ""disc"" which appeared completely circular on its path downward suddenly flattened in a manuever and positioned itself directly over the canopy section (rearward probably of the windscreen)and at once was in perfect sinc with the direction, and knot-speed of the B2.My daughter's friend exclaimed loudly...AND WHAT IS THAT? I answered, DO YOU SEE THAT? She said YEA! as did my daughter. My mouth was dry, and my neck-hair bristled, or crawled. I was totally confused and riveted to this event. The ""disc"" in reality only hovered over the stealth for maybe 4 or 5 seconds and I strained to take it all in. The sky was 3D clear blue, and the sun was behind me, and to my left. The stealth was now directly moving straight away from us and suddenly there was a blinding yellowish/white fuzzy flash and the ""disc"" ! hurtled away at a withering rate of accelleration, and at a level on par with the ""B2"" and at a 20 to 30 degrees ""port"" angle to the ""B2""s dead reckoning. Several more seconds elapsed before I thought to ""count"". I then counted about 5 seconds and the ""disc was gone into and beyond the horizon. I switched my stare back to the stealth and to my amazement, it had not pursued,nor altered its heading, nor differentiated in its rate of velocity. As I have so stated; the ""disc"" was of a silver/metalic nature. I had it in my vision extremely clear. There were no portals of any kind. There were no discernable seams,nor rivits although at that distance of probably five hundred feet or more down the road; these features might'nt be visible to the naked eye. There were no lights, nor markings that I could discern. In short, nothing but the superb showing of the silver/metalic skin, and the shape. It was circular, flat bottomed, with a curved, or arched topside and sloping gently towards the bottom edge, yet extending slightly past then curving tightly downward, and inward,and straightening to the bottom edge. End of story. Beginning of mystery. There is a MUFON chapter somewhere near Batesville, Ark. ? A lady doctor fields the calls. I contacted her after my daughter's friends mother took the MUFON contact number from a T.V. U.F.O. show several weeks after our encounter. I related this same account to her, and she advised me that this was a remarkable event that did not occur often. I no longer have her number. As we talked, she advised me that there would in several weeks time be an international mufon gathering in Silver Springs, Ark. I however did not attend, but maybe you have heard of it, or possibly attended. Let me know if you are able to confirm this with any other information. Thankyou. We have moved once again after 1994.

The incident occurred in Ohio while driving on the highway in a very isolated area.  My husband was driving, and myself, sister and daughter were sound asleep in the car.  My husband said that it had been hovering along side of us in the car for quite a while, and he was stunned by it to the point he couldn't speak to wake me up.  Finally, when he hit me in the leg to wake me, I instantly sat up and saw this thing with bright lights.  If I remember correctly, it was an open isolated area with open fields around it and I would guess that it was hovering along the highway over the field. It was incredible, and I was so excited I wanted to get the camera but it was in the trunk.  I jumped toward the back seat to awaken my sister who sat up to see it.  It was as though once we were all awake and saw it that it moved behind the car over the highway and hovered behind us.  It was as though it knew we were all aware of its presence.  I looked ahead to see an overpass approaching where I wanted to stop so I could get my camera.  When I looked back, it was gone.  My husband said that it flew away in the blink of an eye.  My sister was traumatized by it, and even at 28 years old will start crying when the subject is brought up.  I don't think my daughter remembers it at all. The strange part of it also was that my husband was driving down the highway the entire time fixated on this UFO and not even paying attention to the road, yet he kept the car perfectly straight.  The time was asked above, and I can only say that it was a couple of minutes from when I had been awakened.  My husband on the other hand, said that it had been following him for quite a while...  Even though my sister and myself were sound asleep, it was so incredibly huge and bright that the second we opened our eyes we saw it right there in front of us.  There was no pointing to look at any object, you could not miss it. It had extremely bright lights, but I do not remember it having a ""plasma"" appearance as described in some sightings.  I believe that the pictures that described it that way was a result of the camera or the fact that it was moving very fast that made it appear to look blurry.  It was approximately the size of a football stadium. I called the (800)SIGHTINGS number to report it and left a message, and if they have record of my call you could determine the date that this took place.  They never called me back.  It was a couple of months after our sighting that I reported it. In summary, I have to say that when I was looking for my camera and considering pulling over...that the only other thoughts that were going through my head were if we stop under this bridge so I can get the camera out of the trunk...will they abduct us.  They really were that close that I was starting to get worried and why they were following us like that... FYI...  My cousin, ((name delted)), who sits on the International ((deleted--aviations organization)) (or something like that), referred me to this website to report it after a family gathering where it came up in conversation.

I was visiting Borrego Springs in Desert State Park, CA.  Being from the East Coast, I'd never seen the stars so clearly, so I was staring up at the Milky Way around 10 PM in a garden with a full 360 degree view of the sky.  I had been studying the stars for a few minutes when the leading point of something intruded into my field of vision.  The object was passing from behind me, directly overhead, and continued to slowly pass over for a long time, widening out steadily to a size which appeared large enough to cover the entire town.  There was no sound whatsoever. When the rear of the vessel came into my view I was startled, as I abruptly saw the straight line of stars reappearing behind it.  I did not go inside to get the others in the house because I did not want to lose sight of the craft in the night sky. I continued to keep my eyes on it as it slowly crossed the valley and went over the mountains.  Those mountains are thirty miles from Borrego (facing toward San Diego), and the vessel was still quite large (my thumbnail size at arm's length) as it passed over the mountains and out of sight.  Very impressive and unmistakable UFO sighting.  Quite a first for me!! Thank you very much for creating and maintaining this website.

I saw a saucer shaped ufo about 100ft in diameter, this object was only about 200ft above a house rooftop. Underneath the object, the centre turned in 'like a trumpet'.Around the rim, still underneath there were black square shaped panels evenly spaced. I clearly saw symbols on the side of the object, these were in the shape of triangles. There were 3 triangle smybols. In a line together, the middle triangle was 'upside down' as you looked at it, the ones either side were as you would normally look at a triangle. The strange thing is, 3 years later, I was watching 'Fifteen to one' on channel 4 in England, the presenter of the quiz: showed a card with the same symbols as I had witnessed, to a contestant. The answer was that it represented: Fire and water. There were only 3 black windows on the object. the object was metallic and stationary, it made no sound.

We saw it decend slowly down from a star..and then take a slant upward to the right...as we were going home from Sulpher Springs toward Commerce, Tx...(we had passed the point of the railroad tracks on the way home before the event occured) ..  As it took the slant upward..it appeard to increase in speed and disappear for a short 1 or 2 seconds and then reappear at a higher altitude.  then it went across the sky following the same length of the road we were on...and i fear that even though it was high up in the air...that we can only see it as a dot of light (redish,whitish, and bluish...i don't know if the colors were rotating or what but it appeared to show those colors ) I felt that it (the craft ) had taken pictures of us ..or at least knows that we viewed it.

At 21:24 I noticed a small, bright, diffuse disc in the sky over the ocean seaward of a point of land up the coast from us.  I estimated its elevation with my hand, finding that the disc was just over the tip of my middle finger when my outstretched hand was held vertically at arm's length with the heel of the palm placed on the sealevel horizon: roughly 18 cm at 60 cm distance, or ~.3 radian or ~17-18 degrees. The disc was circular, quite bright and pearly white, with no trace of color that we could see. I'd estimate its total brightness as equal to Venus at its brightest; the sky was still fairly light, and no stars were visible.  The object was definitely extended rather than point-like.  At a guess, it was three resolution-units across: perhaps 6 arc minutes, or a small but significant fraction of the width of the full moon.  No internal detail was noticeable, but there seemed to be some limb darkening. Thinking that the object might be a balloon (many years ago I saw a Skyhook balloon just before sunset, and the appearance was somewhat similar), I stood against a light pole and observed its position relative to another pole.  No movement was perceptible over a period of a few minutes.  We then approached a Spanish family sitting on a bench on the promenade and asked if they knew what the object was.  They didn't, but said that they had been watching it for a while and it hadn't seemed to move. (Nobody around seemed to be more than mildly curious about the object) We watched for a few more minutes until approximately 21:35, during which time the object didn't move or change appearance, and then returned to our room in the Melia. I got my compass from the suitcase, went onto the balcony, and tried to locate the object. By that time, 21:42, at the approximate location of the object (as estimated from its azimuth relative to the point of land mentioned above and elevation measured by the hand-at-arms-length method) there was a bright star-like object redder, fainter, and more point-like than the object we had been watching.  The magnetic bearing read off the compass (which was likely affected to some extent by the steel structure of the hotel) was due east to within a couple of degrees.  My wife, who was helping me make this measurement, was doubtful that the object I was sighting on was the one seen earlier, due to its considerably different appearance.

We has eaten dinner and had gone into the tent. We began to hear a low rumbling sound off towards the desert floor. It continued and became louder. It sounded like a 2 1/2 ton truck approaching. Since the only way to our campsite was the road from the desert which no large truck could take, we went outside to see who was approaching. We looked west towards the desert and then there was a bright flash in the sky - almost like a flashbulb. It lit about 1/3 of the sky. After about four seconds, it flashed again. It continued this strobe light effect all of the time that we observed it. It was a dark night with stars. We never did see an outline of the thing (I guess that our eyes never got a chance to adjust). It moved from the west deseret, overhead, and on up the east canyon and over the ridge. The whole event lasted for about 1 minute. It moved very slowly and rumbled. After it had gone over the ridge, we looked back towards the desert. We saw two sets of lights coming towards us, following the path of the other object. They were moving about as fast as private airplanes move. They didn't make any sound. There was a red light in front and a green light in back (in a straight line). We figured that the lights were on the nose and tail of the crafts. They were flying in staggered formation (about 8 seconds offset). The two sets of lights passed overhead, up the canyon, and disappeared over the eastern ridge. We could never see the shape of these things (not even when they passed overhead). We could only see the lights. One of these things came back over the ridge, made a large sweep over the upper canyon, and returned over the ridge. We looked around for about a minute. We then saw two sets of lights coming from the desert towards us. They were moving fast. As they got over us, we could hear the sound of jet engines back on the desert floor. Their outline was clear. They were two military jets flying in offset formation (one was about 3 seconds behing the other). They went overhead, up the canyon, and over the ridge just like the other craft. About a minute later, we saw a small light (looked just like a star) up in the sky to our southeast. It was moving in straight lines i.e. it would go one way, and then change direction left, right, up, down, in straight lines. It kept in an area of the sky that covered about an inch at arms length. We saw one of the red and green light things come over the ridge and move quickly towards the moving light. When it got almost to the light, the light simply went out. This thing made a circle over the area and then went back over the ridge. That's it - never saw anything else.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,39.2902,-112.56559999999999

I was out back at about 1:00 am, just looking at the stars with my binoculars. There were some light clouds to the south but no moon, so it was fairly dark and quite a few stars were visible, at least for this area. (I live in Colorado Springs, CO, and city lights tend to block the stars.) I was browsing in the area about 5º north of Capella (about 50º above the horizon), when some lights came right through my field of view. There were about seven or eight distinct lights, all the same color, a dim yellow. They were shaped like four-pointed stars, all in the same orientation, but not point-to-point. They were in almost a straight line formation, with the line perpendicular to their direction of travel. Two or three of them near the ends were behind the line. They were quite close together, but not in what looked like a normal flight formation--just a group. They were traveling in a straight line, and fairly quickly. My first thought was that some low-flying object had crossed my field of view and was very out of focus, so I quickly tried to focus on the object, but discovered that it was in fact already in focus, and that the lights were really shaped like that. Also, I have very high-quality binoculars, and when lights are out of focus, they don't become star-shaped, they become blurry dots. Just to confirm this, I studied some real airplanes and stars later, adjusting the focus to both extremes. I could not make them look anything like the lights I saw. Furthermore, when I looked at them naked-eye, I could still see the star-shape. The lights traveled from the northeast to the south-southwest, passing almost directly overhead. They traversed about 90º in about ten seconds, keeping a constant speed, as far as I could tell. Their formation changed slightly; I believe they moved a little closer together, with the ones behind the main line moving a little toward the middle of the line. It's possible, of course, that the apparent change in the formation was just a change in the perspective as they passed, but my impression at the time was that their positions relative to each other did change slightly. I would guess they were no higher than an airliner's cruising altitude, and probably quite a bit lower. I may have the impression they were lower because I could see the shape of the lights (not just pinpoints of light like an airplane), and because they traversed the sky so quickly. If they were higher, they would have been huge and extremely fast. This is possible, of course, but my impression was they were somewhat lower in altitude. On the other hand, I never heard any noise, and if they were a normal aircraft traveling at a normal altitude, I would surely have heard the engines. As they passed overhead, I had to momentarily look down while I turned to face them. Since I knew what to look for and about where they would be in the sky, I found them again naked eye without any trouble. But I realized that they were faint enough that if I had not seen them through the binoculars first, I doubt I would have ever noticed them naked eye. While looking at them naked eye, the line of their formation was about the width of a finger tip at arms length. In trying to figure out what they might have been, I've been trying to eliminate possibilities. I do not believe the light could have been reflected from the sun or earth, because the object or objects were almost directly overhead in the middle of the night. They would have been in Earth's shadow. The moon did not come up for a few more hours, so I don't think they could have been reflecting light from it. It seems they were generating their own light somehow. (Admittedly, though, I may not understand the relative positions of the sun, the moon, and the Earth well enough for these assumptions to be correct.) The lights did not appear to be exhaust from rocket engines because of the star-shape and the fact that they did not leave an exhaust trail. They also left no contrail, even though an airplane that flew over just a couple minutes later left a contrail that could be seen for several minutes. I could not see any vehicle or structure connecting the lights. They looked like separate objects. I did not, however, think to look for stars passing between them. The pattern and color of their lights was clearly not that of a conventional aircraft such as an airplane or helicopter (no wingtip lights, the wrong color, and not blinking). Also, they moved too quickly to be an aircraft, unless it was quite low. If it was that low, I would have been able to both hear it and make out its shape. I don't believe it could have been multiple aircraft, first because of the pattern of lights, and nobody but a precision flying team could have been that close together. If it had been a precision flying team, I also would have heard their engines. If they were high enough so I could not hear their engines, they would have been a much smaller formation, and the lights would have been pinpoints, not star-shaped. It was clearly not either a meteor or satellite. If it was a military craft (which we see a lot of around here), it was not heading toward any of the local military installations. In fact, if it was any conventional aircraft, it was not following any of the usual flight patterns we see here. In short, I have not been able to think of any conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon that this could have been.

About 10 miles west of Syracuse I noticed an object off my left wing.  It was keeping pace with me about 100 feet off the wing.  It was shaped like two convex plates one on top of the other wih the two plates being seperated by a row of bright but not dazzling cobalt bule lights.  The row of lights was about 2 feet tall. the ufo was about 7 to eight feet thick and about 35 feet in diameter.  The skin of the ufo was a metalic silver color.  It was a dull almost brushed steel finish.  At first I thought that is was from Griffiss air force base just north and slightly east of my path of travel. When I called Syracuse airport (the controling agency in that piece of sky) they were showing no traffic near me.  The Ufo then moved directly ahead of me and still kept pace with me.  There was no wake turbulance from the ufo.   I turned off all of my external and internal lights even my instrument panel and radio lights in case it was just some sort of wierd refelection.  The ufo kept position with me and orbited around my plane at a rate of one revoultion every five minutes.   I was handed of to Griffiss control after I was west of syracuse they were not showing any traffic near me either.    Shortly after I was handed over to the Oneida county (Utica NY ) control tower and started to decend the ufo pulled away to about 300 feet from my plane when I reached pattern altitude (1500 feet msl) the ufo departed to the north at an incredable speed.

I'm less interested in getting it into the record than in hearing a plausible explanation, if there is one, so I will accept a collect call.  In case my wife or a child doesn't understand the call, and refuses, please try again.  I'm at home evenings. My wife and two of my children saw the object as much as I did, but my wife is not a native speaker, while my children remember the incident but very little about it.  We were sitting in the back yard.  The sky was clear, except a small cloud formation in the north.  The object flew in a straight line from north to south, at low altitude, apparently, and it was absolutely silent.  I'm hard of hearing, but wife and kids said that it made no sound that they could detect.  What we actually saw was four large luminous disks, all the same size, with an appearance similar to fluorescent lamps behind circular plastic shields.  They were quite bright but not dazzling.  Each was a good deal larger than the full moon.  They were facing downward.  They were in a formation as if they were in the same positions as the engines on a 4-engine airplane with a somewhat swept-back wing, and the distance from the leftmost disk to the rightmost was about the distance from tip of thumb to tip of little finger if the hand is held at arm's length with fingers spread as much as possible.  We did not see a wing, body, or anything other than the disks, and I figured this was because we didn't have the time or presence of mind to see them, but I saw two of the disks shift slightly and quickly relative to each other - wife and kids said later that they didn't see that.  This ""airplane"" flew at a go! od clip from north to south, about what I'd expect of a 4-engine airplane at that altitude; I should say, ""all deliberate speed.""  There were no navigation lights, landing lights, or anything of that nature.  I am sure it wasn't a blimp or dirigible, and I can't see it being a glider, since I have trouble believing that a glider could fly with large disks under its wings, and I'd think such a stunt would be extremely dangerous at night, even if it could fly.  Besides, I've never seen a glider around here.  I really would appreciate it if you could offer me an explanation for what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I WAS ABOUT TO GET OFF WORK AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 HOURS.  IT HAD BEEN COLD AND WINDY ALL DAY, BUT THE SKY WAS CLEAR THAT NIGHT.  I WAS WALKING FROM MY WORKSITE TO MY VEHICLE WHEN I FIRST KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.  THE WIND, WHICH HAD BLOWN ALL DAY SUDDENLY STOPPED.  THERE WAS PLENTY OF LIGHT DUE TO THE CLEAR SKY AND THE MOONLIGHT.  WHEN THE WIND STOPPED BLOWING, EVERYTHING BECAME QUIET.  EVEN THE USUAL INSECT AND BIRD SOUNDS STOPPED.  THEN, I OBSERVED A SHADOW MOVE OVER ME, JUST LIKE WHEN A AIRPLANE FLIES ACROSS THE SUN.  I LOOKED UP AND OBSERVED A TRIANGLE SHAPED OBJECT MOVING ACROSS THE SKY ABOVE ME.  THE OBJECT WAS COMPLETELY BLACK, AND BLOCKED OUT THE STARS AND MOON.  IT MADE NO SOUND AT ALL.  IT SEEMED TO HOVER, THEN MOVE, THEN HOVER, THEN MOVE.  FINALLY, IT TURNED WHILE HOVERING, THEN IT QUIETLY MOVED OUT OF MY FIELD OF VISION.  WHEN IT DISAPPEARED, THE WIND STARTED BLOWING AGAIN, AND ALL THE USUAL NOISES OF THE FORREST RETURNED. I WAS UNABLE TO JUDGE ITS SIZE OR ALTITUDE BECAUSE I HAD NO REFERENCE BY WHICH TO JUDGE IT. HOWEVER, IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO BLOCK OUT SEVERAL STARS AT A TIME, AND CAST A SHADOW ON THE GROUND.

People on the street were screened by the opposite buildings, and people farther inside the room where we were could not seeout over the buildings due to the low overhang of the window.Both of us, at the time, were in the Navy base stationed in San Diego.  Both of us held jobs in navigation. We were usedto using our eyes to identify far off lights. I have heard over the previous four yearsmany stories from veteran sailors, of many instances in the last few decades that ships have actually followed {or been followed)by UFO's on the open sea.  Before this happened, though, I was unsure of the truth to many of the stories.  Whilelooking to the north over the buildings across the street, I noticed two, bright red lights up in the sky.  What caughtattention is that one of them moved back and forth across the sky in an extreme fashion, though the arc of movement wassmall, maybe two or three degrees.  The speed with which the object moved was incredible.  At this time I pointed it out tomy friend  He also looked up and was immediately transfixed.  I am unsure of the exact length of time that we watched the objects, because the event was eleven months ago, but it was probably about sixty seconds.  During that time the two lights would hover for a few moments and then move in formation.  At the end, they both accelerated away at a very high speed. Aftertalking about it for a few days, we soon dexcAfter we witnessed this, we looked around to see if anyone else had been watching.  As mentioned before, we were the only onesthat had a vantage point.  We tried to think of any possible explanation for the sighting. We quickly eliminated jets orhelicopters, celestial bodies, or reflected light.  We had no idea what the lights were.  At the time, I did not really know anybodythat we could tell.  I recently bought a computer.  I soon found this site.  I decided to let you know about the event, albeit late.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

To quickly summerize myself, at the time I was in college and was in the Marines. In the Marines my duties included calling Close Air Support and artillery as a ""spotter"". I have since been able to identify US and NATO aircraft by sight and sometimes sound. I can also identify some ""Eastern Block"" aircraft. (we had flash cards of aircraft in silloette). During the annual Blue Angels Show at Pensacola Beach, I wittnessed a Chrome Sphere hovering over the Santa Rosa Sound, (the body of water the separates Gulf breeze from Pensacola Beach). At the time I was working at the beach as a lifeguard so I had seen the Blue Angels show all week as they practiced. On the final show, (a Saturday), the sky was clear and the beach was crowded. I had ""Dune Duty"", which meant that I was to stand on a tall sand dune next to our ""shack"" in case I had to administer first aid to someone. Now, I'm faceing south, as is the airshow guests as the Blue Angels are flying over the Gulf of Mexico at Pensacola Beach. So keep in mind that people are not generally going to be looking behind them to Santa Rosa Sound to the North. Seeing the Angels all week made me notice that they were ""off a bit' this day. Their Friday show was much cleaner than today. The Diamond formation looked sloppy and other details were picked up by me and the other guards. In the middle of the show the Angels anouncer stated that the show would be delayed because someone was in their airspace. I followed one of the jets with my eye as it broke from the diamond and he went out over ""the sound"". I was now faceing North. Then I saw a glint and it was a chrome sphere hovering over ""the sound."" The F-18 closed on it and came right at the sphere, in a blur the Sphere was gone. It seemed to ""disapear"", but I saw a blur above where it was and think that it must of climbed rapidly in the direction of the blur. Later that day on the evening news, a F-16 was reported to have crashed in a neighborhood in Pensacola. That Neighborhood where the crash occured is close to Escambia Bay. The only thing that separates Escambia Bay from Santa Rosa Sound, is a thin Penensula known as Gulf Breeze. I remember thinking that the F-16 crash, the UFO and the stoppage of the Blue Angels Show, were connected. (an airshow stoppage which I've never seen growing up in Pensacola and having seen the Angels several times). As far as I know I am the only witness. This sighting had the potential for 1000s of witnesses. But I have never heard anyone with a story like this. I may have been the only wittness. I don't have the exact date correct. But I know it was the Blue Angels show at pensacola beach in 1996. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will attempt to confirm the date, which should not be too difficult, given that the date of Blue Angel performances is published.  Also, the date of the F-16 crash should be easy to establish from newspaper records.  If anyone can help with the exact date, we would be grateful.  PD))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

It was a warm evening, and the lake was very calm.  I began my patrol starting in at the east gate, where we - security was ordered, and then continued on thorough the patrol in the company van.  The sky was clear and starry, and I could see where the sun had set beyond the horizon line, northwest of where I was driving along the shoreline road provided.  After I made it past the horseshoe pond on the east end of the plant's outside area, I began heading toward the west end of the plant, checking designated spots along the way.  Once I made it to the west end of the plant near the fence and public park next door, I checked around a bit and saw that nothing was wrong.  At that point, the ufo had not yet appeared.  So after I turned the van around and began to backtrack my route, I came around the west end of the roadway at the sharp turn on the west end of the plant and headed eastward, when a bright light over the lake caught the corner of my eye.  I stopped to see what it was, and there was this weird craft hovering over the water at approximately two hundred yards off shore, and about one hundred and fifty feet or so above the water.  It was super bright white and very quiet, having seven straight pertrusions coming off of the rectangle center of the craft.  Each pertrusion was exactly the same length and thickness, and each one pointed in a different direction.  For a moment, I thought it was someone playing a trick on me, so I got scared and rolled up my window.  Finally, after three minutes of watching this thing do nothing, I began to continue on with my patrol.  So I started moving the van with my foot still on the break.  I moved it about fifteen or twenty feet before I decided to stop and take one last look at the object.  When I did, it was gone!  Then I really got suspicious and began looking around the water and the pier below the cliff that I was driving! along, when I noticed something moving around by the rocks almost near the shoreline.  I saw a long black semi-cylinderical shaped object moving around down there, that turned around showing a bright white football shaped light directly toward me, as if it were looking at me.  Then suddenly, the thing turned around again, pointed upward, and darted off into the northeast sky, vanising into the stars within three seconds after it took off.  It never once made any sound or expelled any streams of fuel gasses.  After that, for about two weeks my mind was in total confusion.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't take my mind off of the thing at all.  Even to this day, I think about it and watch the night skies.  The following year, some friends and I went back to that approximate spot to see if any other alien crafts would come down; but we had no luck.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,41.4969,-82.0176

It hovered over the parking lot in which I was standing and observing.  It seems to bounce vertically. It did not appear to have any solid form, as an object, but was merely a light in a general teardrop shape, or an upside-down candle flame, pointed at the bottom.  I felt that there was something spiritual and serene about the ""thing."" I never reported the event at the time, nor since, but have always wondered about it.  An astrology amateur told me in 1997 that he calculated that the object was likely an early morning sighting of the planet Venus which would have been in the northeast sky on that date. It seems like a possible conclusion, however, my skepticism lies in that it did not resemble at all what I might think of as a planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,41.2501,-81.4577

((NUFORC Note:  Please note that the letter dates from 1860, NOT 1960, as our computer indicates.  A photocopy was sent to us by the grandson, and reads exactly as indicated below.  We believe that the incident is much more characteristic of a meteoritic event, than it is of a UFO sighting.  It is relatively rare that witnesses report sonic booms associated with UFO sightings.   It is interesting that the witnesses felt the heat from the object's incandescence, even though the source, apparently, was tens of miles from their location.   The fact that they heard two sonic booms suggests that the object may have exploded prior to reaching the earth, as many meteors do.

I have not received any intelligence from home, only one letter as yet that I received about 15 days back. I am very anxious to hear from you all at this time. The friends are well as far as I know.  There is some cases of sickness in this country now.  Such as flus [flu] and fever. As to the health here I don't consider it any better than Missouri.  My health has not been very good since I have been here although I have not been confined but a few days.  I feel thankful to the great head of the church that it is as well with me as what it is. I have just passed through a very interesting meeting on Lufty which commenced on last Friday and closed on last night with a general stir.  There was only 2 or 3 conversions during the meeting.  The whole neighborhood pretty much belongs to the church and they seem to get along in harmony.  I have enjoyed my self tolerable well with the brethren here. There is a meeting commences tomorrow at Shoal Creek which I expect to attend and from there to Savanna and then to Locus Oldfields  [don't know if this is a place or a name]  which commences on Friday before the third Lords day in August, then I expect to start for home as soon as possible.  My mind is on home and on my family all the time and my prayers is for the welfare of you all.  I hope the Lord will permit us all to meet again and enjoy each others company and according to my feelings now.  I don't think I shall ever take as long a trip as this from my family while I am permitted to live.  I hope you will all remember that we are only probationers here and prepare for another mode of existence which is eternal.  As for riches in this life it is vanity.  I have tried the things of this world in different ways and have proved them to be vanity and vexation of spirit.  By the grace of God I am determined to serve the Lord while I live; and now my children, companion & friends, if I never see you in this life, take my advice:  if you have set your hearts on any known sin, forsake it immediately and seek forgiveness with a firm resolution to serve the Lord while you live, and the Lord will answer your petitions in mercy. I could write many things on the subject of religion but I hope these few remarks will suffice at present and that you will bear them in mind and make that necessary preparation that if we should never meet in this life that by the grace of God we may all meet in heaven where parting is no more. Last evening about 11 o'clock there was a curious circumstance took place as I was returning from evening meeting.  There was a large comet passed so near that we could plainly feel the heat and in a few minutes after it passed there was two loud cracks, one immediately after the other, and went off with a droll lumbering for several minutes, like unto hot rocks thrown into a barrel of water, which alarmed some of the females very much. I have not heard from Roby Goss since he left.  He was considerable on the mind when he left here.  I have nothing more of importance at present to write only if S. L. Killian hant sold my place I want wheat sowed in good time and fodder taken, etc. Yours affectionately Wm R Killian ((END OF LETTER)) Note to above letter by great grandson--S. L.

The time was approximately 8:30 P. M.. I noticed what I initially thought was a long line of commercial aircraft approaching Sky Harbor International Air Port from the North preparing for a Westerly landing. I remember thinking it odd that they all appeared to be at the same elevation and none were changing position. As we continued on, I-10 turns South heading toward Casa Grande and Tucson. At that time I lost sight and interest  in the lights. We left I-10 at the Riggs Road exit and headed East towards my son's home. I again noticed that the lights were still in the same type of pattern and at the same altitude. They also appeared to be much closer. We arrived at my son's home some 5 minutes later and I went outside to check on the lights while the rest of the family ate dinner. By this time, it was clear that the lights were not separate lights but actually fixed in position relative to each other. They appeared to be part of a structure that was in the shape of a very large v and were moving South and appeared to be over, or very close to, I-10. The lights were on the leading edge of whatever this was. I remember that there were approximately 10 to 13 lights which would appear to extinguish and re-light in no particular sequence. (Could the lights be some form of propulsion?) To say that the object was large is an understatement. It was traveling South approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, moving very slowly and with absolutely no sound. If it was directly over I-10 1 mile to the West, it would be in the range of ½ mile wide. I followed the vehicle for nearly 15 to 20 minutes as it passed through my field of vision from what would be North by North West to South by South West. Using 15 minutes to traverse this roughly 210 degree arc, 1 mile away equates to a an approximate air speed of 15 to 20 mph. The vehicle was obviously solid in nature. As it passed by, the stars in the field of view were not visible behind the vehicle (or whatever it was). As it passed by, the number of lights still visible was reduced as the starboard leading edge was blocked from view. This only served to further substantiate my opinion that the phenomenon was solid. I was located in an area that had very little ambient light so the stars were clearly visible. It passed from view as it traveled toward Casa Grande, 25 miles to the south. It is important to note that the lights I witnessed had nothing to do with the widely reported Phoenix Lights that descended behind South Mountain, West of my position. I did not observe those lights which have been reported, from at least one source, that they were a diversion to draw attention from the vehicle that I saw. Name to be withheld, please.

Ten minutes later the ball of light followed the same pattern, down from the sky (into my view) and off to the upper right. But what really convinced me was the hovering. Flares don't hover, but I guess they can be picked up by the wind. I kinda got freaked out, but I ran outside and waited for about 30 minutes and it never came back.

Capt. handled off-base sightings (they were more fun) and I was stuck with military cases. This occurred at MacDill AFB, Tampa. About 9:30 p.m. one night in Aug. 1952 I received a call from the Base Operations officer (a Lt. Col.)  He was a little miffed to be re- porting to an enlisted man but such are the curiosities of the military. The Captain was out of town. The Lt. Col reported that a UFO was cruising over the base at 40,000 feet, 400 knots.  This was serious; we had A-bombs at MacDill. I de- termined there was no civil traffic within 300 miles. The object was being radar tracked by MacDill, the Navy, and Tampa civil. I de- termined there was a B-29 (ours) on a downwind leg to land. He had 5 hours fuel left. I ordered the pilot to up his gear and take a look-see. At midnight the Pilot reported that he had tried to close with the object. He was at 20,000 feet; the object at 40,000. Of course, the B-29 was woefully slow but as he turned toward the UFO his central fire control system radar-locked on the target, armed itself, and prepared to fire.  At that moment the UFO changed course and left the area at an estimated 4,000 knots. Next morning the pilot reported to my office.  He was a full Colonel, a command pilot with 27,000 hours in the air. One of the top men in SAC.  He gave me his preliminary report and said he would send his waist scanner, a M/Sgt., down to supply details. The whole crew saw it....a bright white oval light. A hard radar target. Since I had no orders to the contrary, I printed the story in the base newspaper and offered it to the Tampa newspaper. Believe it or not they turned it down, refusing to print it because the M/Sgt was black!  A.P.  found out and was furious. Sent a man out to get the datails. Another oddity.  Just before the Colonel came to my office I received a TWX from the Pentagon. From a general. It said: ""Any of our people who see flying saucers have holes in their heads.""  That Colonel yelled ""b((deleted))t"" in the loudests and most authoritative tone I've ever heard. Eventually the Captain wrote a report of the more than 1,800 sightings we handled. A large number (more than 280) were absolute un- knowns. That report stated that ""In our opinion we have no option but to conclude that we are under surveillance by intelligent life of extraterresrial origin,""  I also signed that report. I remember the Captain said: This report will never see the light of day.""  He was right. For the record I served three years in USAF, later worked as a reporter/city editor, and spent 7 years with NBC-TV. I was a reporter/producer of news documentaries and won six national awards including three Emmys.  I'm not a kook. Yet. -((Name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was there for approximately three minutes. If you are looking for a close sighting with lots of witnesses, this is a classic case. I've never seen it discussed before. When I was in Preflight for pilot and observer training in 1953 on Lackland AFB, about three weeks before we went home for Xmas leave, about 500 underclassmen and a few upperclassmen were standing at attention for reveille just after 0400 hours. As officer candidates, when we stood at attention we were not even allowed to move our eyeballs (gaze). Suddenly I heard an upperclassman yell: ""Underclassmen may gaze."" I looked to my left and directly across the narrow street was a small one bedroom house, perhaps used for some kind of communications. Hovering directly over the house, about ten or twenty feet above it, was a very clear view of what I could only describe as a flying saucer. It was the shape of two saucers placed face to face with a ""gondola"" type protrusion below. The gondola had lines of light around it, as if it had a series of portholes but was spinning. There was no actual heat or sound, but thinking about it later, there seemed to be a sensation of heat and sound, as if it were just out of the range of our senses. We watched the saucer for a full two or three minutes, it seemed much longer. It was good long uninterrupted look. We had the distinct impression that it was watching us. Suddenly one of the upperclassmen started across the street toward the house, which scared me, and then the saucer moved from that spot to out of sight over the horizon, soundlessly and rapidly. It was probably out of sight in a half second or a second. We could see a blurry line of light while it was passing. When we got back to the barracks, always pressed for time, we had little time to discuss it, but we did briefly discuss it amongst ourselves. By that afternoon or the next day, I'm not sure which, we were told the upperclassmen had reported the incident. They were told that we were mistaken -- that it was not a UFO -- but also that it was to be considered confidential. Therefore, being on a strictly operating honor system, none of us discussed it after that to my knowledge. It would have meant we washed out. And if someone else mentioned it to us and we didn't report it immediately, it would also have meant we washed out. So I simply formed a habit of not talking about it, and I never told anyone till perhaps thirty  years later. When I was on my way home for Xmas, a man came up to me on the train and asked what the epaulets on my uniform meant. I joked about it meaning I was secret service. He started a conversation with me and eventually began to tell me about the time he'd seen a flying saucer. He kept asking me if I'd ever seen one, and I insisted I hadn't. I didn't think much about that till I got back to base after Xmas. Then some of the cadets from our bay in the barracks never showed up after the leave. I can't remember how many. Maybe two, maybe five out of a bay of 25. Someone said they had washed out on a security violation. Later when five of us were talking, though tiptoeing around without actually ever mentioning the saucer incident, we all remembered being approached by someone who wanted to talk about flying saucers. One said he was approached in a bar by someone who kept asking him if he'd ever seen a UFO. Because I haven't kept track of anyone from from that class, I've never discussed this with any of them. If I could find some of them, I'd really like to talk to them and see if they remember it the way I do. If you wanted to investigate it, it would be easy. It was the J-54 class. Started preflight in 1953, scheduled to graduate 12 months later in 54. Right during the Tony the Tiger program. There was a write up in Look magazine about that class that showed one picture of the whole group about that time. The questions at the bottom of this page are too simplistic for me to answer. For instance, as I mentioned, there was no sound, but there was an impression of sound. There was no real aura or haze, but there was a slight glow because it was somewhat luminous.",,,

At about 2pm, looking south out over the harbor at the south shore of milwaukee on a clear, sunny afternoon on 4/7/97, I noticed what looked like either an extremely relective object or the other alternative would be to describe it as a large ball of sparks descend from the sky, move along the tree line north to the south shore harbor where it descened further, skimmed across the water a short distance and then either descended into the water or simply burned out.     As I was trying to figure out what I had seen, I noticed another object which looked the same, perform almost the exact same manuvuer. Then, in rapid succession I observed 2 or 3 other objects do the same thing. I have NEVER seen anything that looked like or manuvuered like this in my life.

The very odd look of the objects   2.) the way they cruised so closely (almost touching) the tree tops in a very populated area and then go in the water?! The closest explaination I can come up with is,  that possibly they were flares, except for the fact that flares don't manuver over tree tops like that and why would they be shot over a populated area in broad daylight??

It seemed to be rather close, as I could make out the dark edges against the starry background. If I recall correctly, the object had three lights , one on each point of the triangle. The object made no sound. I immediatly called to my friend to ask if he was seeing what I was. He had not seen it, but just then we both saw something. This one was different. It looked only like a point of light, no noticeable shape. We saw several objects of this kind. They were more over head of us, and moved to the west\southwest. Some moved at incredible speeds, zigging and zagging across the sky. While others moved in what appeared to be a formation. First came four in a row, then six then eight. Some even looked as though they split in two. After about 20 min. of this we both spotted a triangle- shaped object, this one right over us, we could see lights on the bottom side. The lights seemed to change  color, from red to orange and white. It was very peculiar. We watched this go on for hours, or necks grew tired from cocking them back to see, so we layed down. I remember the clock was at 4:20 when I went in to bed. This was the third sighting I've experienced. In April of the same year,I watched a trianlgle-shaped craft silently fly across the sky in front of me. It had three lights. I was with a different friend, on the same deck. And once before a couple of years earlier, I would have been 18, so that was 1994. It was in spring, this one was like the triangular ones, but much higher. It moved horizontaly for a moment, before shooting upwards at a fantastic speed until I could no longer see it. Again I heard nothing. Neither I, nor my friend know just what we've seen. Could have been military. Who knows what they were, but they were not like anything I! have ev er seen before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Suddenly accelerates and STREAKS over horizon. I am fairly certain of the year of the incident (1954), although I am guessing at the month, even though I believe the incident occurred during the hot part of the summer of 1954.  I remember the year, because I was sitting in the passenger seat of our family car, a 1953 Studebaker.  I was six years of age at the time of the sighting. My mother, my older brother (10 yrs.), and I (age 6 yrs.) were attending a movie at the Airway Drive-in Theater, situated on the southwest edge of the St. Louis airport (Lambert Field).  The theater used to be located south of the main east-west runway, directly across the airport from McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, approximately where the Missouri Air National Guard building currently sits today.  Suddenly, as the three of us were watching the movie, it came to our attention that some kind of disturbance had begun to brew at the theater.  We didn't know what was taking place, but I seem to recall we could hear people shouting.  I remember looking around to my right side to look at the concession stand, located toward the center rear part of the parking spaces, but could see nothing that appeared unusual. At about the time I looked back toward the screen, people started walking in front of our car, and they were looking, and perhaps pointing, up to our right.  I looked out the right passenger's window, and immediately witnessed a generally oval shape, EXTREMELY brightly luminous, red object hovering virtually motionless in the sky.  I vaguely recall that the object may have been casting a faint red light over the theater and surrounding area. The object's apparent size (from my vantage point) was approximately from 50% to 100% the diameter of the moon, and its long axis appeared to be horizontally oriented.   The object appeared to be moving generally to the north, but almost imperceptibly slowly, perhaps even not at all. It gave the appearance of simply hovering motionless in the sky. Suddenly, the object accelerated to the north, perhaps passing directly over the airport, and disappeared within 2-3 seconds over the horizon to the north!  The object covered approximately 90 degrees of arc, viewed from my vantage point on the ground, in that amount of time, and appeared to fly in a somewhat straight line, perhaps with slight deviation from a perfectly straight-line course. I seem to recall that my father may have viewed the event from the control tower, which prior to June 30, 1956, was located on the north side of the airport. Whenever my family gets together, we always talk about that event.  Our minds seem drawn to it!  My brother, now a physician, remembers it very clearly, as does my mother. That object was BIZARRE!! I am now Director of the National UFO Reporting Center. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the incident is approximate.  I am reasonably certain that the incident occurred during the summer of 1954, but not positive.

We can identify this object as a flying object unknown to mankind. I was seven years of age playing on our front lawn, my mother was out in the side yard hanging up the laundry on a close line. The event that was about to take place at that time is forever etched in my mind. Back in 1962, my mom, dad, little brother and I, lived in northern Manitoba, Canada on a large hobby farm. Our nearest neibour was 1/4 of a mile away. To my knowledge, nobody else in the area seen what my mom and I saw on that warm August afternoon. A slow moving object caught my attention from the corner of my eye. I looked up over the garage located across our front yard and saw a large football shaped flying craft. It was approximately 100 feet away from me, flying approximately 30 feet above the ground. The craft was approximately 20 feet wide and 10 feet high. There was no sound of a motor. This craft seemed to be very high-tech as it had no wings or engine to be seen. The occupants of the craft must have known there was life forms on the ground, namely our family. I believe they said ""Hello!"" with a spectacular display of lights which illuminated there craft in top to bottom (3 foot) strips of blue, green, red, yellow, and other fasinating colors. The craft changed direction as it flew over the garage from north to east. At this point my mother looked up from her cloth line and saw the slow moving craft (traveling at approximately 10 miles per hour) heading in a eastern direction. I seen this object with my own eyes...we are not alone in the universe. Perhaps there are many types of life forms from far away places roaming the sky above and walking among us. Another unexplained encounter happened during the summer of 1975 in the province of British Columbia, Canada. I was walking in a rugged open area 200 feet from the Fraser River when an unusual object caught my attention. There on the ground was a foot long cylinder and about 10 inches around with rounded ends. As I looked down at this object I noticed it's mirror-like appearance. As I looked closer I noticed there wasn't a scratch on the metal-like object. I reached down and picked up the object, it seemed to weight about 5 lbs. From that moment on until I found myself walking away from the area...I have no memory of what happened. I still search my mind today and ask myself what happened to the strange cylinder? I would have never put it back on the ground. I know I would have take! n it wit h me to find out what it was. Today, I believe that what I saw and held in my hands was a landed probe from outer space. Perhaps the same type of probes seen flying over crop circles throughout the world. Whatever I held in my hand could have had a hand in the loss of my memory. I believe it did.",,,

Not sure as to what date now or even the year but I do know that what I witnessed was also verified 50 miles away over Lake Erie by Erie Weather Radar. They could have records,possibly. I was standing outside on  the sidewalk near my friends house waiting for him to come back out.It was dark out and a cloudless sky.I was looking up at the stars when movement caught my eye. Moving across the sky above in a southeast to northwest direction were three triangular objects.They had no lights on them but even though it was dark,I could see them plainly because they ""glowed"" a lumninous ""blue"" color.As I said, they were triangular in shape ,but the corners of each triangle were rounded.They were in a triangular formation also,with one being in front and the other two behind and on each side of the lead craft.I listened and could not hear any sound what-so-ever coming from them .They just seemed to glide across the sky.I made sure that even after they went out of sight I listened in case there was a sound like jets going over and there was none. My friend then came back out to tell me he had to do homework and I quickly told him what I had just seen . I said goodbye to him and told him I was going home to tell my parents what I had witnessed. I was a block from my home at my friends house and I ran the whole way which couldn't have taken more than 5 minutes from the time I saw the objects ,told my friend about and then ran to my house. When I got home ,I ran in and started telling my mother what I had seen .As I was telling her ,a news bulliton came over the local radio station :(my mother was listening to music on the radio) that Erie Weather Radar had just reported tracking ""three unidentified objects"" on their radar moving in a northwest direction over Lake Erie.Thatwas the only time that the incedent was disgussed.I never saw anything on the news or in the newspapers about it. By the way ,Erie is aprox.50 miles northwest of Titusille.                                                      What really amased me was the fact that no more than 10 minutes had passed since I had seen them and already the Erie Weather Radar had reported it to the local radio stations !! I'm sure what they saw and what I did were the same craft.I've always wondered if anyone else had ever seen those same craft. I guess that is why I am finally reporting this.Of course , any time I have ever talked about it to friends ,they look at me like ""Wow, what planet did this guy drop from?"" . I'm sure you know what I mean . But , ever since then , I have made an effort to watch the skies everytime I get a chance and have had 2 other sightings . But they were different than the ones I saw back then. One was a couple years after that when that same friend and I were ""sleeping -out"" in a ballfield on a hill so we could watch the meteor showers and the other was in Elk County in October, 1974 when I and a friend saw 2 craft which were later chased by 3 jets.

It was reported in our local paper and policemen had seen it ect.  Hundreds have seenit but we do live by a Air Force Base and so most of us just figure that it is a new plane or something. Many witnessed it moving from Ogden area to the Layton area , to my area.  I would like to know if anyone else saw this and could explain what it was.

However, it has been reported to NUFORC that there is a laboratory, run by either a university or a company, that frequently uses a high-energy blue-green laser in the night sky.

This sighting is noteworthy because it occurred on the same day that the military  F-117A stealth plane flew by the Syracuse airport, then went to Maryland then crashed. I had the luck of photograhing the F-117 as it flew by the Syracuse airport. The object I am writing about was seen & photographed in North Syracuse, on 9.14.1997, the day of the air show here, & very close to the airport, within 2 miles of the airport. I was about 50' North of a car dealership sign, the object in the sky was southwest of my position, in the sky. I was off of South Bay Rd. in the above mentioned town when the unknown object was seen. My car was parked near the dealership, & the sign when the unknown was seen & later photographed. The object was somewhat boomerang shaped, the middle was more flattened out however, one source has labeled it a flying rod. A hair on a camera lens comes to mind, as does a tree twig, but the object was seen before it was photographed. The object appeared dark in color, the sun was out but there were numerous big white clouds in the sky. The day might be considered a day of filtered sunshine. (?) Beside myself as a witness, I was able to photograph 4 military aircraft flying by. The military planes were flying in a westward direction, as the object was moving past me in the sky in an eastward directn. The object maintained its shape from the time I saw it until I actually photographed it. After I photographed the object, I lost track of it. Note also that I have sent the photographs to Langley, AFB & had received a thank-you letter from the commander at that time, now retired, but no explanation from the military as to what I had photographed. I don't think the object was any cause of the F-117 later crashing, believing the occurence to be something of a coincidence. This unknown was very obvious, but possibly very short lived in terms of duration: I believe nothing has been mentioned in the media about it. However it is almost 4 years later, & I still do not know what the object is. I have a possible suspicion about a 2nd unknown object in the 4 military plane/car dealarship photo. The military, NY MUFON, & NASA have been sent the above mentioned photos. The object I am writing about made no sound. Your organization may email me. Until I know what I have photographed, I would prefer not to give my name out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness has consented to share the photo with NUFORC.  We will attempt to post the illustration here.

The newspaper had not printed a time but if others who phoned the local police and airport saw it about the same time, the sun was going down and it was far from being dark. The paper said one caller with binoculars saw what appeared to be an illuminated crystal shape similar to a snowflake with a dark center and number of red spots darting around it.  A BVPD Sgt.

On the evening of October 29, 1997, I was flying my Cessna 170, at an altitude of 9,500 ft., and a heading of 060 degrees. (N.E.).  I was approx. 70 nautical miles S.W. of the Hobart VOR. on the 240 radial.  At around 1900 CST, I observed what I thought at first was a meteorite, and wondered why it didn't burn up like they usually do.  I remember saying to myself, ""Gosh, I could of made a wish on this one!""  Then I thought it was going to make it all the way to the ground.  When it got to my altitude, it suddenly leveled off, veered slightly to the north, then turned and came directly at me, still at what I, out of lack of a better term, will call ""meteorite speed"".  I was in awe, and remember thinking, ""nothing travels that fast!!!"" After a few seconds in awe, I was terror stricken, as I realized the object was on a direct collision course. My reflex reaction made me bank the plane 90 degrees, and pull back hard to avoid collision. (As if my 120 mph airplane could possibly avoid something that fast!?)  When there was no impact, or wake, or anything else, I turned around to see what it was, but it was gone.  I immediately went for my charts to find the frequency to call ATC on, to see if they had painted a target, but was so upset, and shaking, I couldn't look at my chart and fly the plane at the same time.  As for the size, and relative speed of the object, I can only make an analogy.  I have already compared it to a meteorite.  Assuming a meteorite appears about the size of a kernel of corn, held at arms length, then this object went from that size, when I first observed it, to about the size of a beach ball, held at arms length, when I maneuvered abruptly to ""avoid it"". I am a commercial pilot with ten years, and several thousand flight hours of experience, and am certainly used to seeing lights in the sky, and judging their speed and altitude, for collision avoidance. I live near an Air Force base, and am used to seeing, and sharing the airspace with military aircraft.   I can say with certainty, nothing the military has, goes that fast.      If anyone wants to check the radar tapes, my transponder was on all the way, so there should be a good plot of my course.   I departed Roswell, N. M., at approx. 16:00 mountain time.

Worth (Approaching), TX Shape: Formation Duration:35-45 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02882.html,"Summary : Saw strange lights above high clouds from an American Airlines flight into Dallas-Ft Worth I am writing you because of something I saw (along with a friend) while flying into Dallas Friday evening.  The more I have thought about this the more I knew I should write down what I saw.    I was flying from Seattle to Dallas on Flight 18 Friday Nov. 14th.  At about 6:35-6:45 P.M. Dallas time, about a half hour out of Dallas/Ft Worth we were high above thick cloud cover.  There was a full moon out and the clarity above the clouds was good.  As we looked out ahead and to the east (port side of the aircraft),  I noticed few lights out ahead of us.  I presumed they were other aircraft coming right at us since the lights did not blink like wing lights but as the head lights do at times.  There were two such lights and they looked far off but being at night it was hard to tell just how far.  I watched for a long time watching other aircraft with blinking strobe lights passing in various directions.  These lights (the identifiable aircraft with blinkers) were much smaller in size to the constant lights.  What started to seem strange was the fact that the original two lights which were constant began to appear to be closer the nearer we flew, not farther apart as it should be is! we were approaching them.  Also what seemed strange was the fact that at no point did there appear any other lights such as a green (starboard) or red (port) lights with these two constant lights.  I watched intently as I saw a normally lit and identifiable aircraft fly perpendicular to the main light on my left that I had been watching.  The identifiable aircraft approached extremely close and behind this light.  The light was not a distant star or light on a hill or a beacon as my mind raced to start to explain what I was seeing.    The time span now is maybe 15 full minutes of watching these lights. We were approaching these lights which was apparent since the lights were now directly to the port side of the aircraft and no longer in front of us.  As we continued on, and our approach to Dallas caused as to slightly alter our approach, these lights became directly to port from us and even closer and seemed to rise higher above the cloud layer than before. I had mentioned the lights to my companion several times since I first spotted them when I had described them first as two aircraft with their  headlights on.  At this point I saw a third light low in the cloud cover below these two lights.  This third light was hazy as if slightly in the clouds and also seemed larger and closer to us.  It had shape to it, almost like it was like a soft cube shape (a cube with rounded corners and puffed up sides.  It was not just light). I was seriously questioning that these lights were anything I had seen before.  I had made! several comments to my friend trying to explain what I was seeing since I knew they were not aircraft like ""these have to be beacon lights"" or ""maybe they are power lines"" always to be followed by, ""but we are too high for that"".   I said to my companion that she should look at the lights. Right about then, I leaned back as we passed the lights.  My companion leaned over me and looked now back slightly aft and to port through the windows and said to me ""You mean those lights that look like a triangle?"".  I looked out the window again and now saw that indeed there was three distinct lights, not blinking above the cloud cover in a triangle formation.  The third light had indeed come out and was well above the clouds.    As we continued to move towards Dallas and begin our decent, the lights remained in a triangle formation eventhough we continued make a left turn towards the Dallas/Ft Worth airport. In other words, even thought they were in a triangular formation while we looked at them to port, they remained in a triangular formation as we viewed them to aft.   Within a few minutes we were descending into the clouds and I lost sight of the lights.   I have thought a lot about what I saw and discussed it with my companion who also saw them.  These were stationary lights at our altitude during normal flight approach about 35-45 mins out of Dallas or slightly higher (with the exception to the third light) which would put them at  least 25-35K feet.  The lights were stationary since while we approached they were in front, as we continued they were to the port and then aft of us as we passed.  There were initially two constant lights very far apart when first viewed and only slightly brighter and very much closer to each other 30 minutes later when joined by the third light from the clouds. the lights did not seem to move but were stationary though they must have moved since they were closer to each other after viewing them for 30 minutes than at first.   I am a 42 yr old businessman in Seattle (your town).  I work as a real estate broker.  I was a concert promoter for many many years and have flown hundreds of thousands of miles.  I have a good grasp of astronomy and can identify the moons of Jupiter with my binoculars and Venus along with my favorite constellations.  I grew up with a pilot as y best friend and have logged hundreds of right seat flying in small aircraft so I have an appreciation for what aircraft look like at night and during the day.  Though I do listen to Art Bell and have read many books on Roswell and a few about other UFO's, I am not a ""believer"".  I am a curious observer.  With thousands of hours of staring at the skies, of flying all over this country many times over during night and day, I have never seen anything that wasn't identifiable, at least after 5-10 minutes of viewing.  These objects were viewed by me for nearly 45 minutes non-stop and I have no explanation that meets any test I put to it.  I have replayed the tape in my head over and over.  I keep seeing the aircraft passing behind the main left light.  I keep seeing the two lights far apart and them seeing the triangle shape after the appearance of the third.  I see the third boxy light shrouded ion the clouds then see it clearly in view above the clouds.  These objects had to be moving, but in such a way that they seemed stationary. There were no additional lights associated with these white lights. there were no strobes with these lights.  While other aircraft came and went from Dallas and appeared across the sky, these lights seemed to sit still.    I had to finally admit I saw something strange and unexplainable with my resources. I guess in a way, I wanted to live in denial that I saw anything weird at all, but in the end, had to write this down and send it off as a statement of my very best recollection of what I saw.   My companion is a person who works for the airline, does not wish to be involved but has flown extensively for the last 5 years in her porfession",2001-08-05T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

It was in 1966.  I have hesitated to write about it until now.  No one would have (nor did) take me seriously in 1966.  Perhaps there were other sightings by people who did not think that such things happened in the 1960's.  I was 13 years old.  I had been sleeping soundly in my bed when I awoke for some reason.  My bed was just below the window in my bedroom.  For some reason, I got on my knees and stared out the window.  At the end of the cul-de-sac, directly in front on my window, there was a UFO hovering above the ground.  It was very large, circular in shape, but with many layers to it.  Nothing that looked like the shape of an eye. Many straight edges, and lots of colored lights.  I was on my knees staring at it for the longest time.  I didn't doubt that I was awake as I pinched myself numerous times and in the morning I noticed the welts I myself had inflicted.  My sister was in the room with me but she was sound asleep.  My parents in the next room but I knew I would catch ""heck"" if I awakened them..  It was a working day the next day for the both of them.  I also KNEW that if I uttered a single sound, whoever was in the UFO would hear, and leave.  And I didn't want that just yet.  I watched the object to see if anything was going in or out or if there was any movement at all.  There wasn't.  I was able to see it quite clearly as at the end of the cul-de-sac there was a street lamp.  It gave a little illumination, but the colored lights themselves provided quite a bit.  I was in awe of this object.  It hovered precisely between two houses, on an empty lot that had yet to be developed.  I summoned up enough courage to open the window.  I hung my head out, listening.  Not a single sound.  I mean, not a SINGLE sound.  I pulled my head back in and latched the window.  I continued to watch.  After about 10 minutes, the lights started flickering, and something underneath began to rotate.  The UFO rose very slowly up into the air.  And hovered again.  It then started to move, across the tops of trees, he! ading in a westerly direction.  It moved with the speed of a helicopter, over the tops of many trees, until just as I thought it would move completely out of sight, it took off on a steep angle and climbed to the stars.  There had been no sound at all the entire time.  I marvelled at what I had seen and went back to bed.  The next day I told my story to anyone who would listen and was met with complete skepticism.  I don't tell the tale unless the subject comes up.",,,

We looked up at the sky on a very clear night, when we noticed large cloud like puffs, that seemed to come from out of nowhere.  Then we saw a UFO that looked to be the shape of a disk/saucer.  It came out of the puffs and went directly over the crypto site and stopped abruptly.  The UFO was about 100-200 feet from us and about 100-200 feet above.  It then shot a beam of light of blue, red,orange, and bright white in the shape of rectangles with spaces between each light which followed in sequence and travelled slowly down and looked to be penetrating the concrete and metal surface.  Then the light came out in sequence at around a 45 degree angle rise up a to what seemed a fourth or fifth of the way up to the UFO and then disappear.  It did this for about 5 or 6 minutes but I'm not sure.  The UFO then travelled back into the puffs and shot off like a rocket at an angle of 45-60 degrees and was gone.  The puffs were gone also.

On a clear Fall nite away from city lights, we saw a triangular shaped object approach us from the East traveling at a high rate of speed at about 11 oclock from the horizon.  When it was almost directly overhead at about 5000 ft.(estimated), it stopped dead in its tracks.  We could see that the bottom of the object was silvery and kind of ossilated slowly from green to red to maroon across this silvery ""underbody"" of the object...at the three points of the triangular object where reddish orange lights that sometimes turned to a greenish color.     After sitting motionless and soundless for about a half a minute, it made a slow 180 degree turn leaving a vapor trail.  After making the slow and perfect turn, the object again sat motionless for a few seconds, and then took of straight and level at an icredible speed  ""in a flash"" it reached a point about 15 miles east of us just above the horizon.  Again the object stopped dead for about 10 seconds , then when straight up at incredible speed until it went out of sight.   After this had all taken place, we noticed that the vapor trail was still disapating directly overhead in the atmosphere where the object had made the 180 degree turn around.  This vapor trail seemed identical to that which you see when a high altitude aircraft leaves a vapor trail.  This trail widened, and distorted over a period of about 3 minutes or so.  Our observation was that the original vapor trail formed an absolutely perfect 180 Degree semi circle..  No vapor trail was caused by the craft when it was excelerating away from us or toward us...  Only during the perfect turn...   During all of this there was never any sound coming from the object.. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,44.6849,-92.8849

[Very Close Encounter of 1968] This is an account of a very close encounter that took place in the winter of 1968 in Miami, Florida. It was a few weeks after Christmas (1968). I and my future wife (name deleted) were staying with friends for a few days. Around 10 or 11 PM we both laid down to sleep for the night. Let me describe the house a bit this well mean something later. Our friends had put us up on their living room floor with the usual blanket and pillows. The living room was adorned with a large fireplace (no fire, just for decoration I guess) which was at our head and our feet were placed at the opposite end, which to the right was the front door and to the left an open hallway to the kitchen. There was a dim light left on in the kitchen and the living room was dark except for the faint light from the kitchen.  The front door was made of solid wood and had a couple of small windows in the very top, there was also a glass screen type door on the outside with glass top and bottom, both doors were locked for the night. The rest of the room contained the usual items, carpeted floors, coffee and end tables, chairs, lamps, cabinet type stereo etc. The outside of the house was adorned with large trees (maple I believe but not sure of this) and were much taller than the house and shaded it very well. And now on with the story: We hadn't lain down to long I guess and then it came!  Right through the front door to the right of our feet. A ball of light about the size of a soccer ball or a 10-inch paper plate passed right through the glass door and through the wooden door. It immediately went to the ceiling over our heads paused then broke into 5 equal size pieces, danced back and forth and mixed them selves as they danced and hovered over our heads.  Never getting close, as they stayed tight against the ceiling. I remember saying to ((name deleted)), ""What is that?"" and here reply, ""I don't know.""  After a few seconds or minutes later one of the shapes broke from the others and started along the ceiling towards our feet and then started down the wall like it was searching for something back and forth, up and down. Let me describe the shape because this is the very interesting part. Like I said it was about 10 inches in diameter and glowed with a bright white light. There was no definite shape to the object other than the approximate size and it was circular. There was no body to the object and yet you could not see through it. All 5 of the objects were equal the best I could tell and were of the same light intensity. The strange part as the object entered the room and broke into 5 there was no light emitting from them (the room stayed dimly lit from the light in the kitchen) yet they were bright white and emitted no light. As the one object broke from the group and was on its search (or whatever it was doing) it cast no shadow on anything or lit anything brighter than itself. The light was so bright from the object that you could not see its true shape other than it was circular and spherical. Being 18, full of vinegar and not really thinking about what I was doing. I got up from where we were laying and started toward the light that was dancing on the wall. ((female's name deleted)) stayed were she was for the time being and watched. I followed the light and was within about 2 ft of it at all times and tried to visually see what it was by stretching my head within touching distance (maybe as close as 1ft.). I peered into it and was straining my eyes to see if I could tell what it was then it started down the wall and was going to go behind the stereo. My first thought was that it was going after the electrical outlet. That's when I got brave and reached out to touch it before it was gone. As soon as got with a few inches of the object it shot with amazing speed upward to the ceiling  (I jumped back out of reaction) and watched it shoot through the front door the other 4 followed one by one as if in a procession line. ((femeale's name deleted)) popped up and we both went to the front door to see where they were going. I twisted the knob the door was lock with a dead bolt. I fumbled around and got the door open and then found the glass screen door lock also. Soon we were outside and seen the lights dancing above the roof of the house (approx. 14 foot off the ground) among an opening in the trees.  They soon grouped together as one again and shot straight up, zigzagged a bit and left at an amazing speed.  I remember saying something to ((female's name deleted)) like I have no idea what it was and her reply, ""me neither.""   We went back inside and secured the house and lay back down. For the next 2 hours or so we heard a jet circle the area. You could here it coming closer and listen to it as it faded off in the distance and then hear it reappeared from another location.  It was definitely circling the area for some reason. I figured radar must have picked up the objects we had seen or something perhaps larger where they had went.  Perhaps the plane was just a coincidence and not related at all, this part doesn't really matter. It was just an observance the same night and we fell asleep listening to it fade away and return. The next morning when we woke, ((name deleted)) didn't mention anything about the night before and I got to thinking it could have been a dream and would keep it to myself till she spoke first. I anxiously got the morning paper hoping there would be something in the news about the aircraft that was circling the area or a clue to what had happened the night before. Nothing in there but the usual garbage, so I dismissed the whole thing as a dream since ((name deleted)) did not mention anything about it for the next few days. Well life went on and ((name deleted)) and I were married and eventually moved to Hanover Indiana. Several years later we were on our way home late one evening (after dark about 9pm or so) with the two girls. And we all saw a shooting star (meteorite) as it streaked across the sky. The first words out of ((name deleted)) mouth was, ""Remember that time down in Florida we saw the lights in the house?""  I almost run off the road!  My God it wasn't a dream after all!  It really did happen!  After we got home and got the kids to bed I pumped ((name deleted)) to see what all she remembered and it was exactly as I did right down to the finest detail. It is really strange that we did not discuss this encounter till 8 years later and it took a meteorite streaking across the sky to open her up. I ask her why see never talked about it before and she said she really didn't know. ((name deleted)) and I were divorced a few months later. I saw her about a year ago and it was brought up in our chatting about our past encounter.  She told me she felt it happened for a purpose and really didn't understand what or why it happened but it defiantly did happen. I have been in search from time to time since to find someone with a similar experience and have posted articles on several UFO message areas and was once the MUFO  (Organization for Mutual UFO's) Fidonet coordinator for Indiana, KY and Ohio.  I have yet to find anything really close to this encounter other than Foo lights and there's not to much talk about them anywhere and really just barely related.  I have no idea what it was but it seemed peaceful, seemed to mean us no harm, did not want touched for some reason and was able to pass through solid objects (wooden door and glass). From this day in 1968 and to the present day I 2000 do believe in UFO's and close encounters and contest that all the is written here is pure fact and not fiction in anyway.  It's really hard to discount something you see with your own eye close-up and have a witness to back it up. ((contributer's name deleted))",2000-12-02T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

I will never forget the winter of 1969.  That's when I saw my first ufo or rather I should say it saw me and I'd like to add that I'm not prone to hallucinations nor strong drink. I think my sighting is very unique in that I was pulled over by a ufo. Let me elaborate. I left my house to go to my dads one evening about dark. I didn't have far to go as he only lived about 5 miles from me. As I was about halfway there, I saw revolving blue lights in my rearview mirrow. As I was in the city limits of town, I thought naturally that it was the local police pulling me over for a traffic violation, so I pulled  over and stopped. I looked rearward and was shocked to find no one there. No police car, nothing. I then looked to my immediate right and saw an immense object just sitting there over a citrus grove. I had the distinct impression that it was observing me and I felt like they wanted me to see it. To say that I was apprehensive is a bit of an understatment. Yet, I was fascinated. It was an absolutely beautiful craft. It was huge. (I estimated it to about 50 to 75 yards in diameter.) It was well enveloped in light which didn't seem to radiate outward much if at all.  It appeared to be made of a metal similiar to aluminum.(bright and shiny) There was absolutely no sound whatever. Having read of numerous abductions as I've always had an interest in the ufo enigma, I felt that my best recourse would be to leave. (I was scared stiff) After I left, I looked back and it was gone. I don't know why, but for a long time after that, I couldn't seem to tell anyone about it. Like it wasn't important or something. I didn't have any missing time so I'm quite sure that I wasn't abducted. Another strange thing about this is that the ufo or whatever it was didn't arrive and leave in the conventional matter. It just appeared and then dissapeared. Poof, gone. It was the most vivid scene I've ever saw.I shall never forget it and sometimes I wish I could see it again.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,27.87365806451613,-81.51855806451613

At 1 a.m. as my boyfriend and I were travelling home from the Falls. We were at Chateau Gai Winery and the Ford Econoline Van stalled. I immediately noticed some bright lights about 300 feet in front of us and at first commented ""What is a helicopter doing out here at this time of night?"" As I focussed more closely (my boyfriend was frantically trying to restart the van that has never stalled prior) I realized that it was disc shaped - some kind of bubble on top with white and red lights swirling around the middle. On the bottom was a pulsing green light. I was in awe and wanted to go closer. The petrified boyfriend wouldn't allow me to get out of the vehicle (held my arm tight). A moment later another object joined the first, then another, and another until there were five crafts in all hovering above this old school house. They seemed to steady themselves and then propelled into the sky in a V-formation. My boyfriend again tried to start the van - in hopes of following. It ignited immediately. But within seconds of this the crafts just vanished from sight. It was a cloudless sky - clear, crisp night with lots of stars visible. (New Years Eve) Neither of us had taken anything intoxicating (I was 17 and he was 23). Eleven years later I went back to the sight with a sister and neice to see about the crop circle phenomenon. The old school house was replaced with a Community Centre. Behind it was a barbed wire fence that separated the property from the Hydro Power lines (Sir Adam Beck Generating Station). We hopped the fence and were amazed to discover 5 perfect areas, about 20 feet in diameter, where the grass was growing flat on the ground in a circular fashion.

There was nothing behind our house at the time but woods for about 4 miles. As we began to walk back, a very intense white light hit us from behind. I remember seeing my shadow directly in front of me, so I knew it was behind me, not above me. It only lasted a couple of seconds. By the time I turned around all I saw was the light going out just above the treeline. There was absolutely no sound at all. We got very scared and ran back home. My parents, brother and wife saw what looked like 50 cars in the woods with thier lights on high beam. This made no sense, since there was only woods for about 4 miles.

Then They began to come on back again. ! At this time I thought I would comfirm the siting with others truckers so I got on the c.b. and asked the other trucks to take a look to the west and tell me what they see!. But at the very instant I keyed the mic. the lights dissappeared and this was the end of the sighting(it was like the thing wanted me to notice it but not to allert nobody else(crazy Huh!!)(but there was a car that pulled off the road to observe)before I got off the exit)there was no loud noise that you would associate helicopters with no sound of anything like an engine .",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

It was the summer vacation between my second and third years of law school; at the time I lived in New York City where I was attending Columbia University School of Law. A friend of mine from law school had to get his car back to California before the registration expired; he’d invited me to drive across Canada and down the West Coast.  Thus it was that on August 10, 1972 I was seated in the passenger seat of a car travelling west on the Trans Canada Highway in the western portion of Saskatchewan headed towards the Alberta border, a long and quite-deserted stretch of road. It was the beginning phase of sunset: it was still basically full daylight, but the western sky was already glowing a reddish orange. I was gazing northward out the passenger side window when I noticed a metallic object shaped rather like a long slightly squished football but more pointed on the ends (see”P.P.S.” on last page).  It was approaching or arriving, coming down out of the sky which would have been to the northwest of me (it was in the upper left portion of my passenger side window); however, although it was arriving, I had not seen it do a full entry from the sky -- no starting with a tiny speck getting larger -- it just seemed to show up out of nowhere albeit at a distance from which it then approached.  It came in on a trajectory rather like that of a plane coming in for a landing (except that it wasn’t a plane and had no wings): it curved down and out to the right (east) and leveled off flying eastward parallel to the flat horizon. It was going quite fast, faster certainly than any airplane would have, but the speed wasn’t astonishing or attention-getting at that point. I called my friend’s attention to the bizarre object.  Since he was driving, my friend had less opportunity to watch the object; and since we were on a hard-driving schedule to get the car to California, we never considered stopping.  But as we continued to drive, my friend would pose possible explanations as I, who was observing nonstop, would report back contradications as I saw them.  My friend posited several falling object possiblities, such as meteorites, space debris, etc. beginning when I first called his attention to the object. I remember my reply was “How many meteorites stop dead in their tracks?”, for indeed the object’s approach and fairly fast eastward movement ended abruptly with the vehicle suddenly, and without first slowing down, freezing dead still in the sky! The object stayed stopped in this position, which was at that point either north or northeast of me, appearing to hover.  It then fired what appeared to be a tiny jet or other propulsion off to the right (east) and reversed its direction from its arrival and moved parallel to the ground to the west, moving at what seemed to be a fast yet somehow unrushed speed in that it wasn’t as fast as its initial arrival speed. # It then repeated these maneuvers in reverse:  an instantaneous stop, hovering, then a tiny firing to the left (west) initiated movement in the opposite (this time easterly) direction. The object, which by then I was calling a UFO because of its humanly impossible movements, stopped and hovered for a third time.  Then once AGAIN it fired what appeared to be a propulsion firing, off to the right (east), and reversed its direction a second time, except that this time the propulsion firing was slightly larger and instead of just travelling along the horizon, the UFO swept left (i.e., westward)and away (i.e., a bit northward) and UP, DISAPPEARING ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY up into the sky in the direction from whence it had first come!  The speed of this disappearance flight was mind-boggling -- 1,2,3 and it was gone.  Comparing it to even our most powerful end-of-the-century rockets’ launches, where the rocket is visible for quite some time, this UFO had propulsion man hasn’t begun to come close to.  Ditto on the incredible in-air maneuverability which included fast speeds, fast stops, and hovering apparently at will. To focus on the object itself as opposed to its movements, the object appeared to be metallic and shiny and appeared to be brightly reflecting the reddish-orange of the setting sun. (This would account for the object being called a “fireball” in the next morning’s newspapers, though it definitely was not a fireball -- it was bright fire-colored light reflecting off metal.  This would also account for varying reports as to its color being red, blue, or orange -- the daytime sightings and/or sightings at a different angle would not have picked up the red-orange reflection of the sunset’s light.) I have never hazarded a guess as to the object’s size or its distance from me because I have lousy size and distance estimating skills and because even if I had better skills, there was no size or distance frame of reference out there in that vast, flat, and empty plain.  I can only say that it clearly was neither super close (not on top of us and not close enough for me to have observed any specific features on the vehicle if there were any) nor super far away (not a speck on the horizon -- MUCH more visible and observable). I can’t say whether the UFO made any noise.  I heard none, but I was far enough away that there could have been noise I didn’t hear (plus the car windows were up), although I probably WOULD have heard it if it had been as loud as, say, one of the U.S.’s rocket launches.  What also strikes me after the fact is that despite the incomprehensible speed of the departure, there was no sonic boom.  Humans’ jets moving at a small fraction of the speed make dramatic and highly noticeable sonic booms. I have always been clear that the above-described object clearly was a UFO and was of extra-terrestrial/not-man-on-earth origins.  The various “explanations” offered in the newspapers the next morning (copies of two attached hereto), from meteors to other falling objects to fireballs to sunspots, are laughable and don’t come CLOSE to fitting the facts -- such objects do not stop in midflight, hover, and then zoom back up into the sky from whence they came. And it’s inconceivable that it was a secret government vehicle like the UFO’s that turned out to be tests of the Stealth # plane:  since then we’ve been so thrilled at creating a space shuttle that could return to space -- although it had to be towed back to its launch site and put back on a rocket, and we had our problems getting that technology to work; that doesn’t sound like a government with a vehicle that can return to space instantaneously at will from a standstill in the sky!  Plus I’ve already mentioned the dramatic difference in our rockets’ launch speeds and this UFO’s blinding “launch”/disappearance speed. Plus the lack of a sonic boom. However, some time after the UFO disappeared, my friend and I did observe two other strange events which I’ve always said could have been unrelated to the UFO and could have had unrelated earthly explanations -- but I’ve always wanted to learn more because it was so strange that these next two bizarre events followed so closely on the heels of what was definitely a UFO appearance. After the UFO zipped back up into space and after the sun had set, my friend and I were still driving westward on the Trans Canada Highway, probably pretty much at the Saskatchewan/Alberta border by that time.  It was a VERY dark night and the road was pretty much deserted.  As I had all day, I was gazing out the passenger side window (northward).  Eventually a group of phenomenally bright lights, on the ground, came into view:  at that point the plains had some roll to the land, and coming out from behind one of these rolls, so that I couldn’t see the source, was the most dazzling display of bright white lights that lit up all the land and sky around it.  It wasn’t too far above (i.e., north of) the Trans Canada Highway. It was rather like a huge display of klieg light opening up a gigantic glitzy new shopping mall in Texas, except that the klieg lights I’d previously seen made specific spotlights in the sky and often were moving back and forth or around in circles -- these lights didn’t have that spotlight effect -- it was more of a huge, constant, and unmoving, light display. At the time my two guesses were a government installation or a landed UFO; why else would this city-appropriate light display be out there in the middle of nowhere?  When we finally got to a bigger town, Medicine Hat, where we stayed for the night, we asked numerous citizens about the huge lights out on the plains just east of town and just above the Trans Canada Highway, but nobody had a clue what it was, and everybody was clear it wasn’t any permanent building or installation.  I still totally reserve judgement and work on the assumption that the lights were there by the hand of man. In August 2000 I did learn that the Canadian government was rumored to have at one point had a UFO-attraction experiment out of an air base located just north/northeast of Medicine Hat, which project included trying to attract UFO’s with bright lights (Project Lure, described at www.aufosg.org/kijek/page 90 and page 87).  Although the government claimed to have ceased the project prior to 1972, my current best guess as to the massive klieg light-like display I saw is that perhaps either the government or some other private project was trying to attract back the UFO that had appeared near there earlier that evening.  But it’s an open question, of course.  Nothing so clear as my first event. # Now to the third event, which was TRULY strange.  It happened almost immediately after we’d passed the huge bright lights and once again had our dark sky and deserted road.  I looked out the car’s rear window and saw a small cluster or cloud comprised of tiny dots bigger than the water drops in regular clouds or hazes:  the tiny dots were tiny, glowing, neon or fluorescent green lights.  The cloud was small (though big enough that I couldn’t have gotten my arms around it) and amorphous and slightly changed its contours or overall shape from time to time.  Most of the time the green light cloud was just immediately outside the car -- any closer and it would have been touching the car -- AND IT WAS FOLLOWING THE CAR!  It kept its distance behind the rear car window (and slightly up) constant. We theorized that perhaps the car was throwing up a dust cloud and for some reason the dust around there was glowing and green and fluorescent.  But then the cloud moved around to the side of the car and travelled along with us just outside of my right passenger side window!  (By the way I’m from Minnesota and have canoed in Canada -- I definitely know Northern Lights, and this had nothing to do with Northern Lights.) On my next “observation” I do own that I could have been imagining things, but I definitely had the sense of an intelligence in this green light cloud, and it seemed to be an intelligence evaluating me, perhaps to go with it. Until very recently I’ve almost never mentioned this impression to anybody, including the friend with me in the car, because it just seemed so far-fetched (now it seems less so -- see below). In any event I tried to “send” no-don’t-take-me messages to the cloud just in case.  Then the cloud moved back to its original position just up and behind the car’s rear window and stayed with us until the lights of Medicine Hat started to become visible, at which point the cloud started to hang back more but was still travelling with us.  Then we made the turn off the main road into Me! dicine H at and the cloud pulled way back and up and finally left us -- it seemed not to want to go into the town with us. As with the klieg lights that immediately preceded the green neon light cloud, I’ve always said that there could well be earthly explanations -- I’m certainly not ready to swear to unearthliness on a stack of Bibles the way I would vis-a-vis the first event, the flying object. I am, however, intrigued and amazed by my recent (August 2000) reading of documents concerning a pilot and plane that disappeared in 1978 off the coast of Australia after being harrassed by a UFO very similar to the one I saw in Canada in 1972 and just after the pilot reported seeing a green light while the UFO was hovering above his plane (pilot named Frederick Valentich; documents found at www.bermuda-triangle.org/Investigations/UFO_Incidents/Summary_Report). Also, an October 27, 1966 article in the Saskatoon Star Phoenix reported two different people who said they had been followed in their cars for miles by an object which repeatedly shone a spotlight on their vehicle as it was driving (copy will be attached as soon as I get it).  AND recently in Nevada a UFO was seen to generate a greenish blue “fog” 60 feet away from the vehicle (www.filersfiles.com/files/2000/FilersFiles29). (On August 10, 1972 it was a very dark night, the windows were closed, and I was looking only to the north.  I probably wouldn’t have noticed if anything had approached from # behind -- e.g., I didn’t notice the glowing green light cloud until it was immediately outside the car’s rear window.) The morning after our sighting, August 11, 1972, the newspaper stands were full of many different newspapers, all with headlines or front page stories about the August 10, 1972 UFO.  We couldn’t stay in Medicine Hat to learn more because we had such a pressing deadline to get to California.  I do regret not keeping the various newpaper articles we found that day.  I have recently obtained the August 11, 1972 articles from the Medicine Hat News and the Calgary Herald (copies attached hereto).  These report that the object (which they keep calling a “fireball”) was seen that day in scattered points, first throughout the Western U.S. and then in southeastern British Columbia and Alberta; these sightings were said to include one by “a jet fighter pilot flying over southeastern Washington.”  I haven’t re-found the account yet, but I do also remember reading in one of the newspapers that morning that the same object had also been seen throughout the week or weeks preceding August 10, 1972 throughout the Great Plains of the U.S.  I also remember reading that morning that a U.S. Air Force jet pilot had tried to chase it but couldn’t catch it and that he had clocked the object as going a speed beyond man’s capabilities. ((name and contact information deleted))  P.S. I’ve left my friend’s name out as he was upset about at having to admit he’d really seen a UFO and he didn’t want anyone to know he’d seen it, and I have no idea whether he still feels this way about it.

I have always described the shape of “my” UFO as being a squished football but with more pointed ends.  After seeing photos and sketches of various UFO’s, I realize that what I saw could just as easily have been a disc or classic saucer if tipped slightly away or towards me. # Your form doesn't allow me to paste in the full description that I had already written!

This took place in the summer of 1972, possibly mid-august, in Toronto Canada.  On summer visit to grandmother's house there, I and my best friend (teenagers at the time) noted that the dark kitchen was lit up like daylight at 1 a.m... but it was strange orange light... running to window, we saw enormous orange sphere more than six storeys tall landing in an open ravine area beyond local business district, which was visible from the window there. We watched for some time as the craft settled slowly into the clearing beyond apartment buildings 2 blocks away... no sound, but so bright it lit up the whole neighborhood. When it landed, one could still see the top of it over top of the apt blocks (hence estimation of more than 6 storeys tall when landed)... We had NO fear, wanted to go down there and see up close, but grandmother and aunt woke up in our commotion and forbid us to go. Grandmother (a retired school teacher) and Aunt (a CBC television costume designer) saw craft as well as us. Called my parents in California to get my Dad to aid in keeping us girls in the house, he remembers this call. Aunt suggested I call police. Police operator answered and I suddenly lost my voice, didn't know what to say... stammmered umm umm... she said ""you calling from Forest Hill?""  I said I was.  ""You calling about the flying saucer"" I said I was.  (her words)   ""Can you see it now?"" I said I could. ""Can you see the hi rises from where you are?"" I said I could. She then said ""Everyone in those hi-rises has already called us.""  She went on to tell me that they were telling people to stay in their houses, and that patrol cars were in the area to investigate. We watched for more than another hour, the craft still visible on the ground beyond the hi rises.  Eventually my aunt made us go to bed. We lay on the floor and listened to Toronto all night talk radio, and all the calls were about the sighting. Eventually we fell asleep on the floor in front of the radio, waking at daybreak, at which point we ran down to the area, and found NO signs of anything. No flattened grass, singed ground, nothing.  We tried to call talk radio and got told that  ""they were taking no more calls about flying saucers. Toronto is a busy city and there is lots more important stuff going on."" There was nothing in either newspaper (telegram or star) and we called both newsrooms to be told that reputable papers didn't bother with silly nonsense like flying saucers. We called the police and were told that the night before there were some reports of some sort of prank in our area (Forest Hill Village - an upper class neighborhood in the middle of the city) but that investigating officers had found no signs of anything out of the ordinary. The Sphere was perfectly round, noiseless, and glowed with an amazing shade of pure clear orange light that entirely lit up the neighborhood bright as day.  It took about 20 minutes to land gently in the field beyond the aprtments. The field is still there 20 years later, between Spadina and Bathhurst, this took place just beyond the intersection of Lonsdale and Spadina in the middle of Forest Hill there... After it landed we could still see the top of it over the buildings between it and us, but with no movement and no sound, after a couple of hours we were almost bored, and frustrated that we were not being allowed out of the house for a closer look. The police operator told me that everyone in these hirises (also visible to us) had called them, she seemed to be caught up in it at the moment, I consider the police operator to have verified this sighting to me. I have filed reports of this sighting with a few other researchers and groups over the years, because I can't believe I'm the only witness still around, it had to have been seen by many people, the police operator told me their lines were ringing off the hook... (remember in '72 they didn't have caller ID even at the police station, she ASKED me if I was in Forest Hill) Today I am 41, mother of a teenager, work as the station manager of a local cable company community access television channel here in B.C.'s gulf islands... am college educated, don't drink or smoke... I know what I saw, remember the entire incident vividly. The aunt and grandmother who saw this with me are dead now, but my father is here and alive and remembers the telephone call from my aunt when my friend (who is traceable) and I were so intent to go outside and get a closer look at this ""object""",2000-12-02T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

We were traveling west toward Regina, probably on Canada 1.  (Reason for vagueness noted below.) It was at night -- very dark.  I saw an illuminated cylindrical-shaped object -- the illumination was yellow in color.  There was a red light -- like a cherry -- but I forget if it was on top or on the bottom.  There seemed to be some rotation. The object was north of the highway and paralleled us for several minutes.  It was at a distance.  I forget how it disappeared.  There is no recollection of any missing time or any thing like that. I was in high school at the time.  I did not think I was seeing a UFO at the time.  It was August 1973, and I thought I was seeing Skylab.  (I couldn't explain why Skylab would seem to be paralleling our course, but I thought it might be an effect of the northern atmosphere.)  I no longer think this is the case -- I now doubt such details on Skylab would not be visible from the ground -- and I am certain I was not seeing northern lights.  I suppose it could have been an airport control tower at some distance, but only someone living in the area could tell me that. My recollection is a bit hazy on some details because I was in high school at the time and made not attempt to record any details because, as I mentioned, I did not think it significant at the time.  There were several of us traveling together in a van -- I know a few of us in the back discussed it while it was present in the sky, but I don't know how many people actually saw it.  I have since reconsidered my point of view and since the sighting was so vivid think it is worthing noting in your historical database.  For no reason other than curiosity would be interested in knowing if anyone else had a similar observation at that time and place; however, given how long ago this sighting was I doubt if I can supply any additional information.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,,

On about the 15th of May '74 I was visiting a friend who lived in Lexington, Miss. His cousin was also visiting from Los Angeles. She was taking a late night flight back to L.A. and we took her to the Jackson airport to catch her plane. After we left the airport we drove back to Lexington. We were only a couple of miles or so from the airport when we noticed 3 very bright lights far ahead of us just above tree level. They were so bright that we couldn't see what was behind them. The lights were arranged like the landing lights on a 727, with equal spacing between them, but the center was a few feet higher than the outer two. They were very bright white, like the color of halogen lights. I thought it must be a jet coming into the airport, but they were only a bit above tree level, which puzzled me. My friend, Bill, and I were both puzzled when after a few minutes of driving toward the lights they hadn't moved. We came to a rural intersection where the road we were on ""T'd"" into a larger, divided highway. We stopped at the stop sign at the intersection and just sat there for a few minutes trying to figure what they were. At this point, the lights were directly in front of us, shining directly at us, and they were so bright that we couldn't see what they were mounted on. We were away from any town and  there were no other cars or streelights. We eventually decided to continue on back to Lexington, and to do so we had to turn left onto the divided road. We pulled across the highway and median (which was paved at that point so you could turn left onto the divided road) and stopped on the highway shoulder. The lights were on my right (I was the passenger) and I stared at them out my window, still puzzling about what they could be. We were neither drunk nor stoned, the windows in the car were rolled down, and the radio was off. There was no sound except the idling car engine. Bill took his foot off the brake and let the car idle down the shoulder. At that point, the lights rotated very slowly and with such pr! ecision of movement I've never seen. There was no sound. The lights rotated so that they were pointing directly at the car, and as precisely as they had rotated to stay pointing at the car, they now travelled beside us at the same elevation they had been and not more than about 300 feet away from us. They travelled alongside the car at the same speed we were moving, still idling down the shoulder. I have never been as scared as I was then, because it was clear to me that this craft, which we still couldn't see because of the intensity of the lights shining directly at us was following us. I urged Bill to ""floor"" the car and get the hell out of there, because it was so obvious that this thing was intentionally flying next to us and had responded to our movement. I had no idea what might happen next, but I was so scared that all I wanted to do was flee. Bill eventually accelerated gradually and pulled off the shoulder into the right most lane. The lights still stayed beside us. After a couple of minutes of this the car picked up speed. The lights ceased flying beside us but rotated again so that they always pointed toward the car. Then their altitude decreased and they crossed over the highway at very low altitude, maybe 20-30 feet above the roadway, went directly over the trees on the opposite side of the road and went straight down into the trees and disappeared. At this point, I got my courage up and asked Bill to turn the car around and go back. We came to a crossover in the median, did a U-turn and headed back. We got all the way to the intersection where we had turned originally, but never saw them again. We turned around again and headed toward Lexington. When we eventually came to a gas station that was open we pulled in so I could use the pay phone to call the Jackson Airport FAA. My father worked in radar for the FAA in Texas, and he had told me that they sometimes received calls about sightings but usually just blew them off, so I was prepared for what the controller I spoke with said, which was ""oh it ! was prob ably a helicopter or something."" However, I knew it wasn't any kind of aircraft I'd ever seen because of the incredible precision with which the lights moved and the total silence. I have told some friends and family about this, but I've never reported it because I didn't know who to tell. Last night I heard the 21st century radio program where a gentleman told about his sighting in 1936 in Alaska. This inspired me to dig out an old journal where I had written about this. I got your website from the radio show and I decided to tell this story. I've never had another experience like this, although I've promised myself that if I ever was priveleged to have another I wouldn't panic and try to get away.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,32.326774803149604,-90.19263976377952

I have only been driving for 3 month, I loved to go to my Brother House, It was so much different then my house at mom and dads. so that Day I went to spent the day and night with my brother and his wife and kids. To make you understand I was a mid life Baby, My Brother had kids older then I. My neice was 2 years older then I. so I enjoyed the friendship I had with my neice and nephew , they was close to my age. At around 10:30pm we went to bed, there was only one bed in the kids bedroom so we had to lay across the bed to fit, We had two very large windows went the length of the bed and they where very tall windows, this was very old farm house, and just up the road was a very large hill, it was called Coon Anderson Hill. While we where laying in bed we could not sleep it was August and very hot and no air con, we had the windows open and was looking out the windows at the very bright stars, it was in the country and no street light made it very easy to see the stars. time was now getting to be about 11:15pm. and I noticed a very small light in the sky, bluish in color, kind a like the stars where. I thought it was maybe a light from a slow moving plane it was going from the southeast to northwest. I look over to my neice and said do you see that Light over there up in the Sky, She said no, So I pointed it out to her and my nephew , my neice said it look like a light from a plane or something. All a sudden the light started to zig zag back in forth at a very fast pace, then it really got going, It appeared to us to move across the sky in a split second. at this time we knew it was not a airplane, they cannot do this, so as young kids we got really scared and ran into my brother bed room and told him about it , we all went outside onto the front porch and watch it for about another ten minutes or so. then it came to a stop and it was hard to see it because it blended in with the stars. it started to get larger and larger and it appeared to land or go behind the hill. we all jumped into my brother truck to go up to the hill to see if it did land or not, but we didn't make it, the truck just died and the light went out and would not restart, my Brother said the truck has done that before, he had a weak battery and drove a very old truck that had a generator, and if the battery got low the generator would not put out enough voltage and everything dies he said. but I'm not sure Now if it was that or maybe a magnetic force that did it.. It was very dark and could not see your hand in front of your face, the moon was not out.  Then we notice lights coming from the south and went right over us, it was a helicopter, army one. we also heard jet engine we thought, but no planes in sight, my brother said we need to get out of there and as we was walking back to the house we saw the light it went straight up and went out of sight, the helicopter left to, the next morning my brother went to get his truck that we left and it started right up, guess that old weak battery just charge it self up...

Me and my friend had just gotten back to his house on Ireland Road near route 86 in Hartsgrove from an evening out with some friends.  Instead of turning in for the night we decided to shoot the breeze for a while because the weather was so nice.  So after a while of sitting in my car talking we noticed a strange light in the east sky.  It seemed to be off in the horizon moving steadily closer and higher into the sky.  It was such an odd looking light, it was so bright but it's light seemed so artificial so unlike that of a star.  That is what initially got us out of  my car to go investigate what we were seeing.  As we watched we noticed that it seemed to be moving about the sky in small figure eight configurations all the time while changing the intensity of it's light. After a while of watching the strange light do the same thing over and over again we lost interst and went back to talking.  Then about twenty minutes later in the north sky we noticed a weird looking craft in the sky, it was a rather wide looking object that made no noise, was pitch black in appearance, and only had three lights on it (one red light on each end and a blue light right in the center of it.)  If it was an airplane it was one neither of us had ever seen before.  About ten minutes later there was a huge flash of white light down the center of the sky and the aircraft that was on our left side (south) was now on the right of us.  Other than the fog that had rolled in just before the flash of light it was a perfectly clear night.  So to say the least we were pretty freaked out. Now this is the really freaky part of our night.  We were still in my friend's front yard talking about the weird stuff that was going on, not thinking too much into the events that had all happened within an hour and a half.  Like I said we were in his front yard just talking, we were facing towards each other, and I was looking at the ground kicking at some dandelions.  All of a sudden the ground got brighter like someone was shining a spotlight at us.  When I looked up over my left shoulder into the south sky I saw a perfectly round, perfectly white light floating down out of the sky right at us without giving off a single sound.  It was so bright I had to shield my eyes as I tried to look at it.  I was so stunned all I could do was yell, ""What the hell is that?!"" to my friend.  As I got to ""hell"" the ball of light stopped on a dime not more than forty feet away from us and immediatly shrunk in size, hovered for a brief second, and shot straight up into the sky with such amazing speed.  We watched it as it traveled among the stars until we lost track of it because it was moving so fast and blended in so well with the stars.  It was at that time that I turned to my friend and said, ""I think it's time I go home and go to bed  now.""  And that's it, that was my one of a few strange sightings in Hartsgrove township.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

Suddenly, the light began to fade, made no noise, and before it went completely out, a dim, pale blue light tracked northward away from the source of the brilliant light.  The blue light travelled at roughly the same speed as any high altitude airliner for about 20 seconds, until it too faded out of sight.

At first I thought it was a satellite, but after 5 seconds of watching it, as were my nephew and friend... it became extremly bright ""white"" with a corona around the outside almost as of a burning light completelyt round, almost 10-20 times brighter and it accellerated when it did... for a burst of 3 seconds then it became the small pinlight as in the beginning of the sighting.

Giant 3 foot high spides in my friends back yard This is not necisarly a UFO report but I know that something VERY strang happened in this experience and I have a feeling that Me, my brother and my 2 friends were abducted back when I was the age of 5 and 10. I don't know if your interested in this stroy but I am trying to tell as many people about this because I KNOW that there is something happened on that day. I don't expect a responce from you or anything but maybe this can help some people. I don't know exactly when this happened but sometime between that age of 5 and 10 (I am 30 now) Me, my brother and my 2 friends were sitting in the back yard of the friends house on their swingset. Behind thier house is a small field with a path that ran behind the houses all the way down the street and into the park at the end. After the field was a 4 foot wire fence seperaing the houses from the raliway property. After the fence is a small hill built as a noise protection from the traintracks. It was sometime in the summer I dont' know the day or the month but it was about mid afternoon.  The 4 of us were on my friends swingset just talking and goofing around when along the path in back of the yard came a kid our age. To this day I can swear that I knew who this person was and we all knew him at the time of this story but I canot remember his name or who he was. He came up to us and asked us if we wanted to see some giant spiders. Being kids of course we all did so we followed this kid down the path almost all the way to the park. About 2 or 3 houses before the park he stopped in the path and pointed to the 4 foot wire fence. there on the fence was a GIANT spider. At least I remember it being a spider but the thing is it only had 4 legs that I can remember. And when I say GIANT spider I mean this thing was almost the size of the whole fence!!! So it had to be at LEAST 3' tall. Now you may think I'm crazy or I'm making this up but I remember that spider clear as day and I'll remember it till the day I die. It was colored yellow and black  sort of tiger stipped. It had a big body. The legs of this thing were very long. All four of them. Probably about 18"" to 24"" long each and they were skinny. I do not remember any joints in the legs though. Now you can say someone was probably playing a joke but the year was approximatley 1974 so I doubt you could find anything this realistic looking to play a joke with and not only that I remember one of the spiders moving. Very slowly. That's about all I remember about the insident. I don't remember going home that day and I don't remember ever seeing that kid again, ever. But that's not all. I don't think any of us talked about this insident for a while to each other or to anyone else but when we did start telling people about this Me and my brothers friend always remembered the spiders being 3' tall but my brother and my friend always remembered the spiders being maybe 4 or 5 inches tall (a big spider but not GIANT spiders) I think this disagreement is what caused us to stop talking about this insident altogether. But I still remember certain times growing up when I'd see a big spider (there are yellow and black big spiders in my town and they are big), I'd always say, that's nothing ( size wise) and I'd remember the GIANT spiders. Now years later I started rembering this insident again and I asked my brother about it but he doesn't remember anything about this not even seeing smaller spiders. That's about all for now. I hope this fits into yoru criteria somehow and you can take the time to examine this insident. I thank you for your time and understanding.

This happened a long time ago. Mary Tyler Moore (NOT a re-run) was on TV at the time. It was just past dark, probably in early summer. I think the show ""Canon"" was coming on. These were my favorite TV shows at the time. I lived with my grandparents at the time, and was probably about 18 or 19 years old. I'm 45 now. This would have been about 1975, I guess. My grandma, grandpa, and I were home. Grandpa has passed away now, and Grandma had a severe stroke, so I am the only one who can tell about this incident. We lived in the country, 7 miles from town, so the window curtains were up (we never closed them at night.) The weather was clear and warm. It should be noted that some very high voltage electric lines run across our farm. (We have experienced several strange phenomena besides what I describe here.) I also want to note that we frequently walked around outside the house at night, to feed animals, get things from the car, bring in clothes off the clothes line, and so forth. On really nice nights, we sometimes sat in chairs on the porch and watched the stars. So we were all familiar with the ordinary things you see at night, from our farm. For example, you can see the lights from houses of distant neighbors, and even lights that are probably part of a nearby town. But what we saw on this night was very different. I had my back to the window while watching TV. Grandpa sat across from me, facing me, and grandma was probably in the kitchen. Just then, a bright flash of light appeared outside. It was so bright that I saw it despite having my back to the window. My cousin later told us that she too had seen a bright flash of light outside from my Aunt's house, which is about a mile away. None of us ever thought this was lightening, and there was no thunder -- no sound at all. Grandpa got up and went outside. He thought something on our electrical pole had shorted out. We had been having problems with it for a few days. Grandpa came running back in, looking terrified. ""Strange lights, strange lights!"" He screamed. I had never before nor after seen Grandpa acting like this. He was one of the quietest and most calm people you've ever known. Grandma and I ran outside. In the distance, maybe a quarter mile away, were the lights. There were several rows of red lights, stacked one on top of the other. These appeared to be in a field, about two farms distant from us. They were not in the sky; i.e., this was not a flying object but something on the ground. If I have to describe an overall shape, I would say a cigar, because the ""object,"" if it was one, was much longer than it was tall, from our point of view. If this was an object, it would have to be very large. I would say as much as 40 or 50 feet across. To me it looked as if all the many lights were distinctly separate from one another, in about 3 or 4 rows. A row across the bottom, then another row above, then another above, like well-spaced Christmas tree lights. They appeared to flicker, twinkle, or possibly rotate -- we were far enough away that I couldn't tell for sure. I know that if you stare long enough at a distant light on a dark night, it can appear to twinkle. We watched this thing for a long time, all expressing our views on what it was. Grandma thought a bunch of people had parked their cars, leaving the taillights on. Neither Grandpa nor I thought that was possible. After all, we were way out in the country and that would mean about 30 or 40 cars, all facing the same way, had somehow gained access to the neighbor's private property and left their lights on. We speculated that it might be something on fire, but the lights seemed too evenly spaced for that. In retrospect, it seems weird that none of us thought of calling the Sheriff or anything. I think it was just too bizarre and we were in too small a town and didn't want to be in the news or get laughed at. There had been a recent incident of a light following two girls home, and 16 people witnessed the light. This made the local newspaper. Also, there was a ""cattle mutilation"" in the next town, which also made the news. My grandparents really didn't want to be in the news, I think. But this does show a recent record of strange occurrances. Grandma and Granpa wanted to get in the truck, drive down the road in that direction, and see what this thing was. I myself had read a lot of UFO abduction stories in paperbacks of the time, and I was very frightened to get any closer. I really was a fraidy cat at the time, and I actually pulled them out of the truck and wouldn't let them go. I deeply regret that now, no matter what had happened. So we continued to watch this thing, and then suddenly it just disappeared. Like all the lights had turned off. Throughout this incident, we never heard a noise of any kind. We continued to look over there a while, then gave up and went into the house. ------- I want to add another, totally different incident here. We've had a history of seeing ""strange lights"" on the farm, dating back to the turn of the century. My grandpa grew up there, and he and his brothers used to jump on mules to chase lights that appeared and disappeared in various places.  I heard these stories all my life, but had never witnessed this for myself. In 1984, I saw these lights for myself, along with my brother, sister-in-law, and mother. My brother, sister-in-law, and I were outside at night. Grandpa was having surgery and the family had all gathered. We were outside that night looking at the stars and talking. There were two australian shepherd dogs on the farm, and they suddently went racing off into the nearby pasture, which belongs to a neighbor. Thinking they were chasing the neighbor's cows, I walked over to call them back. I heard a noise like a crying baby. This is also the sound a rabbit makes when it dies. So I stood by the fence, thinking I was hearing a rabbit's death cry. (Let me note that those two dogs were NOT hunting dogs and I had never known them to hurt other animals, so this seemed strange to me.) Anyway, the dogs suddently came charging back towards me, through the fence, and got behind me. I no longer could hear the strange sound. I looked over the fence thinking maybe the neighbor's bull was chasing the dogs back toward me. What I saw was a red light, which rotated slowly. It illuminated everything in its path as it turned -- the trees, grass, etc. were all very clear. It seemed to hover a few feet above the ground, and I could not see anything supporting the light, holding the light, etc. This light was only about 50 feet or so from where I was standing, and though I could see everything the light illuminated, I saw nothing supporting the light itself. The other weird thing was that the dogs were not barking. These were very, extremely aggressive dogs when it came to strangers. One of these dogs had bit several people. The other dog had such a fierce bark that most people were afraid to get out of their cars until you called the dog off. But neither dog was barking or growling. I went to get my brother and sister-in-law and they came over to see this light. We were standing there talking about what it might be, when it went out. We started to walk back toward the house when the light re-appeared, only now it was farther away, down by the barn. At this point, my sister-in-law must have run to get my mother. I walked down towards the barn to get a closer look at this light, when it disappeared again. Very quickly, it re-appeared much further away, way out in the neighbor's field, this time at least 100 to 200 yards from the barn area where we had just seen it. I was so busy watching this light that I didn't realize my mother also saw it, until we discussed it later. Finally, the light disappeared and did not return. We never figured out what could have caused this light. Later, when Grandpa got out of the hospital, we told him about it. He just laughed, shook his head, and said, ""Oh. They're back.""",2000-12-02T00:00:00,30.6448,-97.0448

The object was bobbing around slightly and it surface seemed to be radiating multi-coloured light that was rotating around its perimeter.  The light was of very pure colors of orange, blue, red and white and seemed to be rotating in patches all over its surface.  I stopped to observe it for a few seconds and then began to approach slowly in my vehicle.  I got to within about 60 feet and the object began to rise slightly and move off toward the right side of the street.  It floated behind a tree and between two houses in the direction of the next street over.  I went around the block and once again saw it hovering above the middle of the next street.  This time as I approached slowly, it moved immediately in the same manner and direction without letting me get closer than about 150 feet.

This is something I have only recently been willing to openly talk about.  This happened approx in Oct. 1975.  I was 19 years old.  It was in the middle of the night, I was sleeping - I was suddenly aware that I appeared to be outside of my house and looking down at my house, I remember seeing the roof of my house and the street below me, then I saw a silvery side of a disk shaped classic flying saucer - my condition was not at all what I would call normal, I felt I wasnt simply dreaming - it had a very real aspect yet I was sort of out of touch with what was happening, a good description was I felt like a bystander - which is hard to describe or even understand.  I next recall encountering a man, and United States Air Force officer in full uniform, he had black hair and seemed alittle angry - He spoke as an american english, slighly overweight, and was yelling at 'others' later I think I may have said something to this person and he was mad because I was 'awake'? - I seemed to be floated around inside what appeared to be the outer parimeter of this craft and placed on some sort of operating table.   Then I had the awareness that they were performing some sort of brain operation! - this caused me TONS of mental and spiritual discomfort, anguish and FEAR... I felt that during this time I was outside my body and was watching from behind the 'surgeons' - I was incredulous and shocked at this experience wondering AT THAT TIME was this really real? was it really happening?  I recall hearing their voices, but I dont know what they were saying. That seems to be the extent of it, or at least, it is all that I recalled happening.  I 'awoke' the next day fully aware of what I had just experienced and KNEW that there was NO WAY I could EVER reveal this to ANYONE EVER... It was just too incredible.  I was very scared at the whole experience.  This happened in 1975, October.  Years later, when I read Whitely Striber's Communion, I had a terrible shock that this 'dream' may have not been a dream after all, and could have been a real experience, it was one line he inserted in his book at the end of a chapter he said somthing like: 'they implanted something in my brain!'  THAT realization, that my experience may have been TRUE was almost too much for me to handle... I have since reconciled this and wanted to express this and see if there are any others in the area who had similar experiences at that time?

The object seemed solid, and i couldn't see any details, it was just shiny and black.  It sat there for about a minute or so then started to move East, accoss the valley, and it gained altitude to about 300 feet, as it did so.  The thing that really caught my attention about it was that it made no sound that I could hear.  I've seen plenty of low-flying airplanes in the area and know that the sound they make echos through the valley, no matter how far away they are.  But the object didn't make a noise.  It glided slowly accross the valley and continued to gain altitude until it was above one of the mountain peaks in the distance, my best guess is that the mountain is about 10 miles away from my cabin.  The object then seemed to momentarily stop above the mountain and then shot away at a great speed to the North and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The spots of light hit the steep slopes of the Eastern Sierra on our side of the valley and on the White/Inyo Mountains across the valley. We couldn't see the source of the lights because Crater Mountain was directly between our campsite and the light source. Crater Mountain was four miles south of our location, approximately.

Was reported before but did not get posted.  Was on another short vacation in Colorado in Buena Vista Colorado and stayed at the Rainbow Lake Resort located almost at the top of Cottonwood Pass.  While on a wind down walk with my mother-in-law, we both stopped to view the many stars in the sky that we otherwise could not see where we live in Texas.  While gazing at the stars we both noticed, at the same time, some movement within the milky way star groups.  What appeared to be a star that was stationary began to move and drop out of formation.  We figured it was a star burning out and shooting across space.  With further viewing with the binoculars we both noticed that it slowed down from going north and then started changing colors to blues, purples greens, orange in many revolutions of colors then it fired back into the star group within the milky way.  Strange to see this, we both thought, then the object zapped out of the group again and then with incredible speed zig zagged across the sky like no jet or object of flight the man can build. The directions were qucik and precise and at angles that no airplane we could design. I am ex-Air Force Special OPS and have never seen this display of exact super speed movement.  My mother in law proceeded to ask me what that was, and I advised that we may have just experienced a UFO.  The object continued to change direction back and forth at different angles and of course changing colors in its movement.  The colors seemed to increase in speed with the super fast speed of its directional changes.  Then the object became almost stationary but still showing very slight movement....moving northward.  Then the colors became intense and the objects colors started a revolving movement and it increased in speed faster than any jet I have known of...and proceeded north in the direction of Canada across the sky at very high speeds until it just disappeared. My mother-in-law to this date does not want to talk about what we saw that night.  She i! s a very Christian women and this defied her beliefs.  My understanding of this UFO is that it is not of our world, and if it is our government toy, we stole or enhanced the technology from another world to make this happen.

The storm had ended and we were approaching a plateau where the high school is located.  There is two high objects there on this plateau, the water tower and two grain silos. As we were making the approach, I noticed a light hovering above the grain silo's.  This light was round in shape and looked like the same light as fire.  It hovered above the twin silo's.  My brother then noticed the light and asked me if I saw it too. We didn't know what it was.  As were got within 500 yards, it began to move and did not make any noise.  I began speeding toward the object as if we had scared it.  I approached 85 miles an hour and seemed to catch up to it. It was as if it had not wanted us to get closer.  It began to speed up more quickly. When the object seemed to have the ability to go over the horizon, I began to be disappointed.  I flashed my auto lights and honked the horn.  It seemed to wait at the horizon. My brother and I had to drive down into a valley and up another hill to where this horizon was located.

I apologize for being so vague on the specific date; it's been so long ago.  But the actual experience is still very vivid in my mind and something I will never forget.  To the best of my recollection it was 1977, but may have been 1978.  I do know it was approx. 2:30 in the morning, as I had left my boyfriend's house in Downey and was traveling northbound on the 605 freeway heading for the 210 freeway.  I was not under the influence of any substance.  As I was traveling northbound on the 605, just past Rose Hills Memorial Park, I saw something ahead of me hovering over the freeway.  Being very familiar with that area, I knew the incredibly large object I was approaching did not belong there - had never been there before.  That particular part of the freeway was very desolate - nothing in the way of commercial buildings, etc.  Just a duck farm to the west and Rose Hills to the southeast.It was within close proximity to the 60 freeway as well.  I recall virtually no other traffic at that time as I neared the object.  It was hovering, completely still, maybe about 500 feet above the freeway.  I slowed as I approaced it, looking at it in disbelief.  When I was under it, I came to a complete stop on the freeway and just stared in amazement.  It was incredibly huge - like something from Battlestar Gallactica.  It wasn't shiny, but was metallick with circular indents - like pores - about it.  It was a very peculiar shape-nothing you could describe as a definate rectangle, circle, etc.  It has many configurations.  But the size just overwhelmed me.  I remember not feeling frightened, but just astounded.  I sat there for awhile just staring at this thing, oblivious to my surroundings or the fact that I was sitting still on the freeway.  I couldn't tell you if another car came along or not.  As I slowly began to p! ul away, I kept my eye on it, continually looking back, and then it was gone.  I've always wondered if someone else may have reported a similar experience, or if there was documentation of unusual activity in that vicinity in '77 or '78.  It has disturbed me for more than 20 years (I am now  45), and I was hoping someone could substantiate it for me.  Thank you for allowing me to share this with you.

In October of 1977 I was camping along the Snake River at Hood Park which is right outside of Pasco, Washington. My companion and I had been in town visiting friends that evening and since we were both driving our own vehicles, I headed back to the campsite in my own car ahead of him. When I got to the campsite, our two dogs were frantic because their ropes were all tangled around each other and they wanted to be loose, so I walked over to where they were tied up and set them free. I grabbed some soap and a washcloth from the tent and started walking towards a water faucet that was about 40 yards from our tent. The dogs started racing around me in endless circles which I thought was strange because they were extremely excited and unusually rambuncious, but I just figured in that moment that they were just glad that I had gotten home to set them free. However, they were annoying me because they were getting in my way and I yelled at them to go play somewhere else and they took off in a flash. At that point I looked to my right towards the river and up to the sky. It was a brilliantly clear night, no moon, with lots of shining stars all around. As soon as I looked towards the sky, I stopped dead in my tracks because I was staring at two huge orbs of light that were silently cruising right above the river in front of me. They were not very high in the sky at all and were flying right above the river, about as high as a crop duster plane might fly if it was getting ready to position itself for the next pass over a field. I knew immediately that they were not of this world and I dropped to my knees. My mind started racing.....I was not afraid.....in fact, I began to mentally send my thoughts skyward with a million questions......""who are you? Where are you from? What are you doing here? Are you who I think you are?"" and so on and so forth. These orbs of light were as big and as round as a full moon can sometimes look as it is rising low upon the horizon. I'm talking huge here. They were definitley orbs of light, but as I stared at them I could see a slight outline behind the light that looked to me like an ""H"" shape, an ""H"" that was laying flat and flying. The light itself did not look like the kind of light that we are accustomed to. In other words, the light did not have a neon or artificial kind of quality to it. It seemed to have a life and energy of it's own. In fact, it reminded me of a burning coal....it had the same qualities and color and glow of a burning ember. The orbs of light also sparkled around the outer edges, similar to how a diamond sparkles when hit by rays of light, and they were exceedingly beautiful. So beautiful that my mind was overwhelmed by the greatness of their beauty and I just kept saying mentally ""you are so beautiful!!!"" These orbs of light (or celestial vehicles as I like to call them) were moving very slowly above the water, one in front of the other at exactly the same height in the sky. They made no sound, no sound at all. In fact, I was stunned at how quiet it was. They just flew by, right in front of my eyes, and then slowly made a 90 degree turn and headed towards the town of Pasco, the direction of which was going away from me, not towards me. As they continued to move away from me and away from the river, the orbs of light appeared to become one, but that was because one was right in front of the other and they were at the exact same height in the sky. At this point I was feeling extremely disappointed that they were leaving me behind because they had allowed me to see that they existed and I wanted to know much more about who and what they were. My mind began to cry out to them saying ""please don't leave me now that you have allowed me to see that you exist!""....and then I started to pray, and I said to God, ""please Father, if these orbs of light are in some way connected to you, please give me a sign"". Amazingly, as that thought and prayer left my mind, the two orbs of light, in unison, suddenly sprang into action and zipped through the night sky in an exact movement that left red tracers in the sky in the shape of a huge triangle. I burst into laughter at that point and said to God ""Oh Father!!! Is is too much for this tiny doubting soul to ask to see that one more time?"" and in immediate response to that request, the orbs of light zipped through the night sky again and left the red tracers of a huge triangle in the sky. At that point, they disappeared from view, and I rose up from my knees and started walking back towards my tent, but I swear to you that I did not feel the ground under my feet! I felt like I was walking on air. My companion had just gotten back to our campsite and his back was to me as I walked towards him, but he did not hear my approach, which I thought was strange since the night was quie! t and th ere were leaves all over the ground that should have been crunching as I walked, but even I did not hear the sound of my own footsteps. I walked right up to my companion and tapped him on his shoulder, and as he turned around, quite startled, I found myself trying to tell him what I had just witnessed, but my voice was barely a whisper as I felt as if I was under some kind of magical spell that I did not want to break. Unfortunately, my companion did not believe my story, and his disbelief made me decide to keep this experience to myself and I did not tell anyone about this event for another 10 years. I have only told my closest family members and friends about this and I admit, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would probably have a hard time accepting it as fact. But fact it was and is and even though I cannot prove that this ever happened, I know what I saw and experienced. This was not a vision or a hallucination.....this was a physical manifestation of something beyond this world and it was decidely celestial in origin. Since then I have continued to watch the night sky and have seen quite a bit of activity way up there where the satellites roam, but some of what I've seen leads me to question whether or not it's all just satellite action up there as I have seen 3 to 4 white lights flying side by side going in various directions a number of times. I believe that we are not alone and it remains to be seen how this is all going to turn out. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell my story. I've been carrying it around for a really long time. Take care and God bless....",2000-12-02T00:00:00,46.17882291666667,-119.16297812500001

Perfect 90 degree banks at incredible speed!!! During my days at college, my roomates and i decided to visit, the ((deleted)) temple in moundsville, wv. following an old dirt road through the woods leading us there, i noticed a strange hum coming from outside the car. I pulled over to a place where the dirt road ran beside a small crick. The sky was perfectly clear, and EVERY star was visible. We were at a particular opening in the woods, were you could see a good bit of the sky. At about 10:30 pm I noticed the humming was coming from the sky, and looking up, I saw 5 distinguishable crafts approx. 1,000 ft in the air, i'm not the best judger of distance when it comes to te sky. 1 hovering motionless in the center of the sky, and the other four were flying around it at astonishing speeds. The intriging part about them was, the fact that they were circling the center craft and banking immaculate 90 degree turns without slowing down. I noticed a slight visual disruption directly behind the 4 crafts, as if staring through gasoline fumes where your vision is distorted by waves of exhaust. The crafts appeared to be triangular shaped, distinguished by 3 blue lights at each point, and one larger and brighter white light in the center. They appeared to be holding their position the entire time were there, as if they were spying, or maybe waiting for something. We decided to leave because we all had class early next morning and it was an hour and a half drive back to the school. As we were leaving, headed down this old dirt road barely large enough for a single car, which also I might add, is lucky to be traveled twice a day; we were forced off the road and into the grass by 3 large oncoming vehicles. The first, an undercover state police explorer - as it appeared to be, and the other two were a camoflauged military hummer, and a large transport van also in camo. The van had 2 large sattelite dishes on it and more antennaes than i could count. Go figure/?? If theres anyone else out there, that may have seen the same spectacle in the sky near moundsville around that time, please let me know your out there. I've made an interesting hypothesis about the humming coming from the sky. Have you ever hit a tuning fork or a cymbal from a drum set and placed it extremely close to your ear, and heard the low level hum that the sound waves radiate? It's almost unearthlike, and that is the EXACT sound I heard! I believe that this particular craft uses sound wave generation to either induce motion as in forward or reverse, OR, just as a means of hovering. Sound is measured in decibles, which is basically described sound pressure level. PRESSURE is the key, i believe they can force themselfs in any direction by controlled bursts of sound waves or magnetic waves. The government cannot keep a lid on this any longer, as long as everybody knows whats goin on. Then we'll all know who was directly involved in it for quite some time now; and you probably hear their excuse being: ""We didn't want to create a widespread panic..."" Sure what would happen if everybody suddenly realized there IS other life in the galaxy?? People would revolt against society, taxes wouldn't be paid, people wouldn't go to work, THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY ON YOU!!!! And more importantly; They would no longer be top dogs; let alone even be able to try to cover anything else up. Think about it for a while, sooner or later you'll start to realize what there up to.. Hopefully its not all too late for us when it does become apparent... Thanks for your time, and continue to live free and intelligently! ((pseudonym deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I only seemed to remeber this event about ten years ago...nothing traumatic or special happened at that time in my life. i just remembered. After I told my parent about this story, my father thaught i was going insane.....but my mother seemed to beleive me. After wards she took me aside, and admitted to me that she has seen the craft that nite, in the back feild. She remebers seeing it lanf and seeing people come out of the craft. She does not remember that much about the event. But she distinctivley remebers the event happenning on the same nite .",2000-12-02T00:00:00,47.384572,-68.318684

I was about 11 or 12 years old and I remember still to this day what occured around September, 1978, I am not sure of the exact date.  I was home sick with a cold and not in school.  My brother stayed home as well, because he too did not feel well.  My mother is a housewife, so she was taking care of us.  It was around 3:00 p.m. which is when school lets out my older brother was coming home from school.  I knew that he would be coming home soon.  My brother played the violin so I knew that he would be carrying his violin case with him.  For some reason around 3:10 to 3:15 p.m. I had an urge to want to go out the front door.  So I opened the door and I did!  I began to run down the stairs, my brother followed me out and my mother ran after me to get me back into the house.  At that exact time I saw my older brother coming around the corner of the Street.  He was looking up into the sky and walking really fast.  I noticed that he seemed nervous looking into the sky ever so many seconds.  I later looked up into the sky and noticed that what he was starting at was a large & I mean large object that was bright red and a perfect circle.  My mother stoped pulling on my shirt at that time because I noticed that she noticed it too, and so did my brother.  The object had to be the half size of a house, thats how large it was in the sky.  The bright red object moved as if it was following my brother and my brother at that time started running to the house.  I noticed that then the object came closer and then it just hoovered in a stationary position for about 10 to 12 seconds and then the object took off in a matter of 2 to 3 seconds and it was gone.  The one main thing that caught my attention about this object was that their was no sound, not when it stayed in stationary position and not when it took off.  It was a beautiful bright red, but it didn't blind you.  I saw no patterns of any kind to on the red object to see if it had any form of a design.  Later that evening it came out on channel 7 news and it was ! seen in the entire city of San Francisco.  But they dismissed the object to be a red air balloon.  I may have been 11 and my brother 13 and my older brother 16 and my mother about 49 years old, but I could tell you this the government might want to fool the people, this was no red air balloon.  I have seen lots of red air balloons, and not one of them ever looked like the object that I saw in the sky. Did any one ever see this object, I wanted to find an article that came out in the news paper, but I cannot seem to find one.  If you have this article of the object that was seen around 1977 to 1978, please email me at: ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Hearing this tale broughts me to my knees at the dinner table trembling in tears while my wife and sone sleep the night away not knowing of an encounter I had when I was 17 years of age that I have kept silent all these years for many reasons I am sure you can understand.  I lived in an area that was a fairly quiet suberb of Painesville, ohio it was a 2mile circle of residential homes with duplexes/ town homes in the center.  A very quiet community. On the evening of august 17th, 1979, I was 17 years of age.  It was a quiet evening with clear skies.  you could see all the stars and constilations in the sky with a light breeze.  a very cool evening.  I was living with my mother and step father in a residential home on the outer circle and was walking home after playing the guitar over a freinds house trying to write lyrics for a melody we came up with.  You could hear the crickets in the field as I walk down the road.  I was a bit chilled though, . I did notice that there was absolutely no one outside of their homes all bundled in for the night and scattered far apart there were lamp posts but they were so far apart it was really still pretty dark.  I guess I was too busy trying to keep warm because i didn't wear a coat and i was running the lyrics to my song through my head to take notice that all of a sudden everything was silent.  I didn't hear the crickets anymore, i heard nothing.  dead silence and a wierd sense of being watched and all of a sudden i just stopped walking.  The first thing I did was raise my right hand and look at my wrist watch and the time was 9:37pm.  What I encountered next I really don't know how to explain but I remember looking upwards to the sky that I had just seen stars just moments earlier and I just stood in total awe trying to take in all this information in total awe of the huge amassity of this huge thing that I swear was several football fields in either direction. it was smooth and very flowing in design. it was like a huge mother ship that completely took out the sky above me in every direction.  I remember seeing a huge cylindrical shape in the center that extended down maybe eight feet taht maintained a dark red glowing hugh almost like the black out lights used in the military but it was intense yet at the same time it was not lighting up the area at all.  I also quit vividly remember hearing a very LOW EARTHLY RUMBLING SOUND VERY DEEP IN PITCH LIKE AN EARTH QUAKE BUT VERY LOW AND DEEP IN PITCH.  iT WAS AS IF IT WAS FOLLOWING ME DOWN THE ROAD JUST GLIDING ACROSS THE SKY AT A VERY SLOW SPEED THAT WOULD CAUSE ANY OTHER CRAFT TO CRASH. All of a sudden i noticed three lights begining to strobe like a strobe light blue, red and white lights and I was hit with a solid beam of pure white light.  this all happened in a matter of three minutes topps since I looked at my watch at 9:37pm.  The next thing I remember I was walking back down the road in a very calm and relaxed state as if I came out of surgery just comming off sodium pentithal.  it was just a real peaceful relaxed feeling yet It was very much over shadowed with a very strong sense of being violated and my under arms were stinging bad.  when I got home i removed my shirt to find that my under arms were both bleeding and I was missing flesh.  But I remember that when I found myself walking back down the road in a drug enduced state I remember looking back at my watch and it was exactly 10:05 pm!  approxamately 25 minutes passed that I could not account for because it only seemed to actually have taken place in a matter of three or four minutes.  To this day I have identical scar patterns under both arms and since this tramatic experience that I was put through against my will I will live with this untill the day I die.  I do know that what I saw and experienced was as real as the car I drive and the air that I breath and you are the first to know of my abduction.  I didn't ever say anything to anyone for the fear of becoming someones lab rat!  You can reach me by leaving a message on my e-mail at ((e-address deleted)).COM.  i am now 39 yrs, going on the big 40 January 7th.  I am willing to share my story to the listners on the radio show.  it was because of this show that I decided to come forward.  I do not wish to reveal my last name or address.  To this day, every night I go to bed and.  wonder what was done to me!  All I can say is that we as a people on this planet have great concern to be worried with technologies this advanced.  I was under the impression durring this ordeal that these ships as far as our technology was concerned are totally and completely untouchable, unstopable and indistructable.  We have great cause to be seriously concerned and with the increase of sightings and such close encounters which i fear are deliberate and with purpose, it  will not be far too long before we know the truth.  Do you really think they care if they are seen!  They are obviously getting bolder and bolder all the time.  You see TV shows like Star Gate.  What makes you so certain that things like this really don't exist!  They only appear to be seen when they want.  Just call me matthew be too",2000-12-02T00:00:00,41.6972,-81.1974

I was awoken by a very dull humming noise, although when I awoke I could not hear it at all. I sat bolt upright and there right outside my window was a huge disc shaped object hovering very low. The middle bit where all the windows were seemed to revolve around and I could see people walking around inside. My first reaction was one of immediate fear and then an overwhelming sense of love and security surrounded me and moments later I found myself at the back door trying to find the key to get out and into the backyard to go with them. I actually had the key in the door and the door open when a voice inside my head told me to stop for the sake of my mother. You see she slept in my room as my father used to rape her if she slept in the same bed and I was worried if I was gone in the morning she would get the blame and the beating for it. I closed the door and locked it and raced back to my room to find the craft still in the same position and when I looked out the window at it I could hear them communicating with me in their mind saying don't be frightened we won't hurt you. Come with us. To this I told them that I was afraid for my mother and I said I wanted to get married and have children first and they said that they would come back for me one day. The disc shaped object lifted slightly and noislessly before moving towards the mountains where it seemed to move rapidly and dart sideways. I tried to wake mum to tell her but I couldn't wake her,which is unusual as she is a super light sleeper. I told my sister 15 years later and a few people but no-one really believed me except my sister, and my husband.

We were north of Butte in an area called Elk Park.  We were being very quiet so my co-worker could concentrate on his driving.  While we both watched the road a metallic disc approximately 18 inches across came at us head-on at about 25 m.p.h and about fifteen feet off of the ground and smoothly passed right over us.  This object was completely unaffected by the weather.  My co-worker started shouting and asked if I saw that.  I asked him to describe what he had seen and he descibed the same thing I had saw.  He had never had any interest in this subject and I had always held an objetive curiosity on the subject and had never seen an object such as this.  A friend of my wife's had descibed a similiar object in the same area on the previous Thanksgiving Eve while on a Bus trip from Boulder to Butte.  She was the only person on the bus.  When she pointed it out the Bus driver stopped the bus and they both observed it for several minutes. I have a good understanding of science and aircraft and nothing I know of created by man could have moved the way this object did.  It was absolutely unaffected by the weather and was moving much too slow to generate any kind of lift.  I was also told by a very credible older friend that several years ago he had seen a strange object in the same area and it followed him all the way to Butte.  Since I hunt this area frequently myself I will keep a sharper lookout in this area.  I do not find it a coincidence that all three situations took place in bad winter weather, there was no traffic around, there were two witnesses each time and all took place in the same park.

Appeared hot, again like a burning coal in a fire.  No noise whatsoever.  Trajectory towards the north. Size and speed hard to judge against a perfectly starlit sky, but estimated that it was 20-50 m wide at the triangular base, provided that it was 200-500 m above ground as I estimated.  Could have have been much larger if higher.  I saw it directly overhead, until it disppeared over a small hill. Maybe 10-12 seconds in total, so it appeared to be sub-sonic. I'm a professional field biologist and a so-called ""highly trained observer.""  I also grew up on CDN airforce bases, so am intimately familiar with aircraft of all shapes and sizes.  At the time of the sighting reported, I had NO IDEA what I had seen.  15 years later, I could be convinced that this was an early test of the stealth fighter/bomber, given the similarity in its configuration (delta-winged, triangular shaped with unknown ""stealth"" capacities).  I have no tangible evidence proving this sighting.  I did report it to my wife, who happened to be in the outhouse at the time (even as I as personally shittin bricks!), and missed the whole thing.  As as quasi-professional artist, I painted a full colour picture of the object about 6 months after the sighting, based upon a sketch I did a day or two later.  It took me a long time to get my head around this (and I'm still not sure that I have); I was quite excited about what I had seen, but also quite numbed by it, especially since I didn't have any corroborating evidence.  It was like witnessing a traffic accident, where everything seems sort of like a dream, and yet is burned into the memory receptors permanently, but you're still not entirely sure that it was you who witnessed what you saw.  It's like the brain doesn't quite recognize the input it's recieving as being valid somehow, and then you start to doubt your own eyes.

Fairly low profile compared to the size.  The craft continued to slowly hover south for approximately 45 seconds. It was hard to tell if it was spinning. It then stop for 15 seconds. It rose instantly about 500-1000m straight up. Stop briefly then appeared to take off south and vanish again silently.

(round when viewed from the top; near flat on top and expanding to a wider profile then tapering to a point in the side view) the color was varied from the blue of a royal crown cola can through to the color emitted by a blacklight. it disappeared behind the treeline maybe 100 yards down the shoreline. i stood there stunned for a couple of minutes and was getting ready to walk down the shoreline to see if i could see anything more when i noticed the movement of something coming through the woods. all i will say here about what happened over the next hour is that i communicated through telepathy (i didn't initiate the conversation and just had to think what i wanted to say.) with a blond-nordic. i did not go to the craft and didn't not see it except when it passed in front of me while descending and when it left. (it ascended in reverse of the way it descended.) there was no ""physical examination"". i wa sober and was not tired. i am not subject to hallucinations. i have a measured i.q. that qualified me for membership in ""intertel"". when i was in the military (1968-1971), i was a sergeant and worked as a fire distribution systems crewchief in aadcp's for nike-hercules missile defense syetems and had several ufo sightings on our radar systems both in the united states and korea. these were also seen by the members of my crews. my father and i also saw a cigar-shaped ufo over kansas in the summer of 1964 as we were flying one of the family planes from our home in iowa to the family ranch in oklahoma. my father also had a sighting in 1962 when he was driving from iowa to the family cabin in minnesota. he told me that he spotted something that landed in a field next to the road he was on. he said it was about 1/4 mile away from his car to the spot where it touched down. my father had a pilot's license from 1955 to when he passed away in 1973. he also built his own airplanes and was a groundcrew crewchief in the army air corps in morocco during the war.

Looking ESE towards Naches Pass while stargazing on a ridge above Greenwater, I saw a very bright and quick meteor-type trail, immediately followed by a bright but silent flash, seemingly just behind the next mountain over.  I was the only one to see the trail, though my dad saw the flash. My dad, uncle (both MUFON members) and I were stargazing the night of 22 May.  We were roughly 4 miles east of Greenwater, Washington on what on the maps is called Huckleberry Mountain, at about 3500 feet. From this vantage point we could see from due east (over some mtns. covering lower 20 deg. of sky) to the NW.  The three of us were regularly looking in different directions.  At 23:15, I was looking to the ESE roughly 45 deg. up, when just below this a very bright meteor- like streak quickly shot nearly straight down (to horizon).  I'm not sure if I saw it from start to finish, but it seemed to only begin 10-20 deg. above the horizon to begin with.  What made this event worth mentioning was the immediate 'explosion' after I lost sight of the streak behind a ridge.  I say explosion because it really lit up that part of the sky, enough so that my dad, who was looking in another direction, noticed it as well. Unfortunately my uncle was looking behind us, and did not see any of this.  To me it seemed that this explosion was a double flash, although this did occur in less than a second.  This immediately got all of our attention, and we were silent for a period afterwards in case we could hear a sound from the event, but we never heard anything. After discussing it, we decided that this event was most likely a meteor which either burnt up just before hitting the ground, or perhaps a meteorite which landed in or beyond the Cascades.  The only caveat to this explanation was that I have seen many meteors, though no 'bolides', and this was not the brightest I've seen.  I have heard accounts of bolides which actually left a trail, etc., and this did not occur. As for more exact locations and directions, we were located 47 deg 8' N, 121 deg. 34' W, and the flash and explosion occured at a direction of roughly 90-100 degrees.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

My sister and I observed a disk for about 5 minutes hovering approximately 120 feet away.,Swansboro,NC,1985-10-12T23:45:00,disk,23:45 - 23:50,"Occurred : 10/12/1985 23:45  (Entered as : 10/12/85 23:45) Reported: 10/15/2000 21:24 Posted: 12/2/2000 Location: Swansboro, NC Shape: Disk Duration:23:45 - 23:50",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/014/S14568.html,"My sister and I observed a disk for about 5 minutes hovering approximately 120 feet away. My sister and I were watching the Johnny Carson show and when a commercial came, my sister got up to go to the bathroom which is in the kithchen.  To get to the kitchen from the den, she had to walk right next to a set of sliding glass doors that ran parallel to the White Oak river.  She yelled for me to come into the kitchen to look at something, she had to call several times because she does the same thing at the site of  a cockroach, clearly an overexadurater.  This time however, she had spotted something much bigger than a roach. As I turned and looked through the glass and over the river, I caught my first sight of a black disk that must have been 30 feet in diameter and about 10 feet thick in the middle and tapering to about 3 feet thick equilaterally at the circumference. The craft was hovering about 50 feet above the water and approximately 120 feet from my siter and I.  That put our vantage at just slightly above the craft when I noticed the moon reflecting off of a semi-gloss black finish. We were stunned but not afraid.  We slid the large glass door open and walked out onto the first floor deck and the first strange thing I noticed was the complete absence of noise.  The craft was literally hovering noiselessly in front of me.  That is when the gravity of the situation hit me.  Living between Cherry Point Air Force Base and Camp Lejune Marine Corps base, it was not unusual for aircraft to fly directly over the house.  In fact it seemed that the Marine Corps had mapped a low altitude helicopter route directly over the house.  Helicopters do however make an unmistakable noise which would have been nearly unbearable at the range I was from the noiseless black disk. My sister and I walked across the deck and down the stairs onto the concrete driveway which was littered with shattered hickory nuts that had been run over by my mother's Buick.  The reason that I mention the hickory nuts is because I was bare footed at the time and the only thing that distracted me from the noiseless black disk was the incessant pricking on the bottoms of my feet.  It was for this reason that my sister and I walked off of the driveway onto the grass.  Myself having moved about 90 degrees horizontally, about 20 degrees vertically, and about 30 feet closer, it was fairly clear that the object was taking up 3 dimensional space. From the time that my sister called me to come see the object to the time that we were standing in the grass was a matter of about 2 minutes.  We stood in the grass for about 1 minute which also happens to be the amount of time we watched the craft before it left.  During that 1 minute, things went from being strange to being inexplicable.  The craft began to move slightly more into the bay and away from us, but it wavered a bit horizontally.  After about 30 seconds of that, it moved farther out into the channel.  At this position, it was equidistant from the shore and from the White Oak river bridge (of the two bridges, the bridge on the Swansboro side).  It wavered a bit in this direction as well.  Finally, as it slowly moved toward the bridge, it gained speed so quickly that its path was traced with a streak of light.  As it left, it moved forward much faster than upward, but it did move upward and to the left.  When I say it gained speed quickly, I mean that it was gone in a matter of a tenth of a second. When the last minute of the observation of the craft was over, the first minute of discovering its effect had begun.  Immediately I heard the noise of masses of minnows jumping in the water.  My sister and I walked down onto the dock to investigate the seemingly amplified noise.  What we discovered was a large area of foam.  In fact the water seemed to be boiling.  All around us the minnows were jumping.  Normally minnows swim in schools of about 30-60 which might measure 5 square feet in surface area.  While in a school, each minnow acts as one so that when one is scared the entire school is scared.  I have been in situations where maybe 5 schools of minnows will jump at the same time because I jumped on the dock, but never before and never since have I seen so many minnows jumping.  In retrospect I wish I would have put my toes in the water to see if it was hot, but I didn't.  I've often wondered if the thick foam on top of the water was caused by all of the minnows jumping or if all the minnows were jumping because the water was foamy. At that point, approximately 7 minutes had passed and my mother had come outside.  My sister and I told her what had happened and I guess she was too tired to care.  A few months after the experience I drew what I had seen with crayons for a science teacher, and I bet he still has it somewhere. At the time, my sister was 13 years old and I was 8 years old.  My sister and I haven't talked about it since just after it happened.  During my education at a state supported University, I realized how contradictory what I have seen is to contemporary physics.  The truth is going to be nice.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,34.738,-77.0803

As I watched the objects disappear, the whole mountain over which they had flown or floated was completely bathed in a light that was glowing a reddish-orange color.

I tried to rationalize by convincing myself that these were jets and one of then at least had crashed into the mountains.  No plane crash as far as I can find out was reported and also five jets would not have been flying over Lavendar Mountain as low as this.

Standing by my car I looked directly above me as something caught my eye. A gigantic ""something"" was moving very slowly ( a person on a bicycle could have kept pace with it, or the traffic on nearby I-90 was moving at three times the speed)), heading due west toward the city of Spokane (my location was east of the city by approximately 10 miles in what is known as the Spokane valley). This is the best way to describe the object: take a very sharp, narrow "" V ', lay it on its side so the apex points westward...and making up the 'V' formation were about 25 to 30 perfectly round, whitish disks. The disks were not bright but appeared as any white object would, in the sky at night, reflecting the glow of Interstate 90 and a busy shopping area. It is difficult for me to judge distance according to feet, but if you held your arms above your head and spread them a yard (36"")apart, that was the length of the 'V'. As I observed the object at a distance of about 1/4 of a mile away, about 15 minutes later (described below)it appeared to be as high up as a 30 to 50 story building. There was absolutely never any noise, the object was moving much slower than, say, cars on nearby I-90, there were no lights observed at anytime. The craft was paralelling I-90 with apparently no need to let other flying objects (airplanes---there is a small airport nearby, not the Spokane International Airport) know it was there (flashing lights ect)?? I was, to say the least, dumb-struck, but remained still as I watched it slowly moving westward. At one point a man and his son walked to their vehicle across the parking lot, never looking up or noticing anything because there was no noise. I wish to this day I had spoken up and asked the man to look up. How can something that large move so slowly and not make any noise?? Anyway, the really strange aspect of the object was its BEHAVIOR. Several of the disks appear! ed to be slightly 'fluttering', as leaves on a Tamarac tree would flutter in a breeze. The other disks did not. As I continued watching, the 'fluttering' of some os the disks suddenly stopped and the top string of disks began to lengthen as the bottom string began to get shorter. I stared at the apex of the 'V' formation to see if I could observe each disk from the bottom string ""round the corner of the apex"", so to speak, and that was what was so weird. Each disk from the bottom just grew less in number as the top string grew longer in number, but I couldn't actually see the disks moving to and around the apex. The top string of disks was just growing in length but at no time did any disks appear to disappear, nor did they appear to flash on or off. I hope this isn't confusing. I find it difficult to explain this. I remained standing by my car for several more minutes and before I left I was able to see the actual object, I'd say, a good 1/4 of a mile away towards the west, as it was headed toward the city of Spokane. I was able to see the shape of the object because the city lights/sky glow from Spokane, further west and ahead of the object, provided contrast. What I saw shocked me. If you take two large plates and set one on top of the other so the rims meet, that's what I observed, but it was at least three times larger than the 'V' formation (which was apparently attached under it?)The entire mass was solid black. One more thing, which I think is worth noting; I finally got in my car and returned some rental movies to a business about a mile away and went about my evening. I felt stunned and said nothing to anyone. Three days later I suddenly felt scared over MY behavior, as I could not understand why I didn't at least follow the object(which would have been so like me to do). I had never witnessed anything like this and why had I been so cavalier about the whole thing.... It was as if I suddenly 'woke up' to the realization of what I had witnessed and my very unusual subdued reaction.

Nov. 3, 2000  I just talked to a man who told me about an amazing encounter he had with what sounds like a UFO, or at least a military craft sporting impossible technology.   Here's his account:  In November or December of 1988, a man, who I will identify as Mike (not his real name), was driving along Hwy. 38 in rural eastern Arkansas between the towns of Hickory Plains and DesArc.  He was on his way to join buddies for duck hunting.  As he was driving on a deserted stretch of highway about 4:30 a.m., he became aware of an intense white light shining above the woods about a half mile in the distance.  There was a farm field between the road and the woods. An object appeared to be moving along the timberline at a slow speed, perhaps 5 mph.  The object was dark, and he couldn't discern its shape.  It emitted an intense white light that lit up the ground. ""It was the most intense light I had ever seen then or since, "" he said. Mike slowed his speed so he could look more closely.  His thought at the time was that it was a military aircraft from the Little Rock Air Force base at Jacksonville, about 30 miles away.  The pilot of the craft seemed to be moving along the edge of the woods looking for something.  It was about 100 feet off the ground, about 20 feet higher than the trees.  Mike's impression was that it was military personnel goofing off and shining a spotlight looking for deer.  He rolled his window down to listen, but he could not hear the characteristic sound of a helicopter engine or a noise of any sort. ""I think I'm gonna' get a good look at this,"" Mike recalled telling himself.  He stopped his pickup truck even with the object.  As he watched, the object started moving generally in his direction, which made him nervous. It slowly gained altitude as it moved to a point about a quarter mile in front of his truck and about 2,000 to 3,000 feet in the air. It abruptly made an impossible turn and accelerated and disappeared all ""in the blink of an eye."" He also described it's acceleration like ""a shooting star.""  He turned to look back behind him, but the object was not visible. He heard no sound of any kind.  He said his impression was, ""Whoa, now that's weird!"" He drove on to meet his buddies and told them the story, but he was met with disbelief.  I questioned Mike about missing time. He stated that he was 15 minutes late joining his friends.  He estimated the sighting only lasted 5 minutes.  He noted that he has driven the road many times and can't account for the lost 10 minutes.  Mike has only told the story to five or six people in 12 years.  He continued, for a while, to believe that it was a military craft, but Mike eventually acknowledged that it could have been something that was not manmade.  (Mike is relatively high up in an educational institution and is concerned about his name being used.)

Some friends and I were driving on I-15 from LA to Vegas at a very late hour.  Even though it was fairly late (around 1AM) there are always a good number of cars on the road at that time.  I was driving when my friend, who was sitting in the passenger seat, pointed to a beam of light that was pointing straight down at the highway in front of us. At first I thought it was a helicopter shining a spotlight down, but later I would realize that I was wrong.  The light, which was coming from what seemed to be 100-200ft from above the highway, started drifting off to the right.  In 1-2 minutes, the highway turned and we realized that the light was flying directly over the highway.  Just then, the beam turned off and from where it was shining from, a blue light appeared and sped away at an incredible speed over the horizon. About two seconds after the light sped off, another large bright blue light shot down from what seemed to be outer space to the area that the origional light went to. As we continued along the highway, about five miles down the road we noticed that off to our right, several miles away (in the general viscinity of where the lights earlier flew to), several blue and red balls of light were flying around each other at odd velocities and manuvering like no aircraft we had ever seen.  At this point we figured we would get the best view if we got out of the car to look.  The four of us stood and observed the manuvering craft for a few minutes before all but one blue one flew away over the horizon.  The remaining craft, we realized, was flying towards us!  All four of us began to get nervous about this strange event but we couldn't turn away.  Slowly, the craft flew directly over us, silently, at an unknown altitude.  This gave us the opportunity to see, by the orientation of 9 blue lights on it's leading edge that were flickering like strobe lights, that it was v shaped.  It continued on at this speed until we couldn't see it anymore. We were glad a beam didn't shine on us when it passed directly over us!

Two witnesses observed triangular object made of hazy greenish lights speeding back and forth across the horizon.,Houston,TX,1991-07-15T21:00:00,triangle,45 minutes,"Occurred : 7/15/1991 21:00  (Entered as : 07/15/91 21:00) Reported: 11/25/2000 15:18 Posted: 12/2/2000 Location: Houston, TX Shape: Triangle Duration:45 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/015/S15045.html,"Two witnesses observed triangular object made of hazy greenish lights speeding back and forth across the horizon. It the summer of 1991, before my senior year of high school.  I lived in the suburbs northwest of the city of Houston, TX, which are near FM 1960 (not sure if the road is still called that).  Ambient light in the area was tolerable for skygazing, and there were no military bases in the area. One evening around 9pm CST, I had just come home from eating dinner at a restaurant with my mother.  She had observed an object in the sky after I had already gone inside the house.  She came in and said I should go look outside, that she had just saw something very strange.  At the time I was extremely skeptical of UFOs, but she is a very logically-minded person, and so I indulged her. By that time the object was already gone, but I decided to wait outside for a bit.  Around thirty or forty minutes later, as I was about decided to give up and go inside, I saw a triangle-shaped object rather high in the sky.  The object was comprised of about twenty greenish, hazy lights.  The whole surface of the object was rather nebulous in this fashion;  there were distinct lights, but their coronas blended together to form a unified triangular object.  It was difficult to judge its distance or altitude from me, as the night was clear and there were no reference objects to compare against.  It had to be at least 5,000 feet in the air;  it definitely had the appearance of having a high altitude.  It was probably a mile or two away from me on the x-axis.  Its size between my fingers while at arm's length (i was around 6'0"" at the time) was about 1 inch long and about 3/4ths of an inch wide.  Since I was viewing it from an angle of probably 30 degrees from its side, and it had the shape of a slightly-distorted isosceles (two sides longer than the base) triangle, it was either flying at an angle, or its side was actually triangular. The object moved silently and smoothly across the horizon in a matter of five seconds, and because it appeared to be so high, I found it to be impossible to be a commercial plane or satellite.  And since in the over ten years I had lived in Houston up to that time I had never once seen a military jet fly over, I felt I could safely rule that out, especially given the lack of contrail and running lights.  I have seen military jets in flight though, and this seemed to travel at a speed far in excess of any military craft.  It also could not have been a spotlight since there was no cloud cover to reflect off of, and the pattern was not predictable as a spotlight would be. The object moved back and forth across the horizon about three times before disappearing. The shape of the object reversed when it came back into view travelling the opposite direction (i.e. the triangle was pointing the other direction). I had the distinct feeling that I was being watched or observed.  Given the highly skeptical nature of my mindset at the time about UFOs, I cannot readily attribute this to a sense of UFO ""expectation.""  It was a very primal sensation that registered almost unconsciously.  I went in to discuss the sighting with my mother, and then she and I came out together to look for it, and we saw it once again briefly as it once again glided across the horizon.  Though I waited outside for some time, I did not see it again. As a sidenote, several months later the show ""Unsolved Mysteries"" ran a special on UFO sightings which my mother and I both happened to be watching on separate TVs.  Some amateur footage of this object was shown which matched exactly with what I saw.  We both independently confirmed this. Background of observer:  I consider myself fairly intelligent, educated and fair-minded.  I have a degree in Advertising from a well-respected university, and am a web designer.  My mother is also intelligent, educated and fairly conservative in making ""fanciful leaps.""  She has a Masters degree and teaches.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

It was about nine or so at night, November of 1991, we had been sent to bed for the evening and couldn't sleep. I have always been a 'skywatcher' and had the venetian blinds pulled up. We were on the second story of an apartment duplex, overlooking a man-made 'lake'. About thirty minutes after nine or so (it's hard to be sure of the exact time as I didn't have a watch and there were no clocks in the room) I saw what I at first assumed was a very bright 'star' over the lake. As I watched, it began to speed at an incredible rate toward me. I woke my sister up, and we watched as it came closer and closer. It finally stopped at about five feet from our bedroom window, and was quite small. About the size of a VW beetle, at most. It made no noise as it hung there, and I remember saying over and over again ""Wow...wow...wow..."" neither me or my sister could believe what we were seeing. It might've been saucer-like in shape, but was covered in many bright lights, which made it difficult to ascertain it's real shape. It had two ""appendages"" coming off the sides, which ended in two, very bright, bluish-indigo lights. Along the front it had the brightest yellow-white lights I've ever seen in my life, but it did not hurt to look into them. It also filled me with a sense of incredible joy and awe, and I feel now as if I could've spent the rest of my life just staring at this craft. There was no fear or apprehension whatsoever. About three hours later (by my best estimate) the thing left just as it had appeared- very quickly and suddenly. I felt numbed by the experience, but also deeply content. The reason I assume it was there for three hours was that, shortly after it's departure, my Mother entered our bedroom to check on my sister and I, and was irritated to find us still awake. It felt to have only 'visited' us a few seconds, though, or at the most, minutes.

I was hiking and camping by myself in a generally unhabitated area about 10 miles east of the city of Glamis near the Imperial Sand Dunes/Pichacio State Park (CA).  There is no doubt in my mind that these were unconventional aircraft.  I am reporting this because there must have been alot of people that saw this for there were many snowbirds and others camping out in the area or riding offroad vehicles at the Sand Dunes. On Sunday, February 13, 2000 I was camping out alone about 10 miles east of Glamis, CA.  There were many people in the area however and somebody else must have seen what I saw.  At approximately 6:55 p.m. I observed some kind of craft which at first was simply going in what appeared to be circles.  I thought it might be a Border Patrol airplane or helicopter but then it started to go straight up and then straight down, not very quickly, but very noticeably.  I couldn't figure out what kind of craft it was because of the up and down and circular manuevers it was making. The exact location of where I saw this craft initially was about 20-25 miles West of Yuma, AZ (or Winterhaven, CA right next to it on the CA side) and appeared to be hovering right over Interstate 8 near the Mexican Border.  I was probably about 8 to 10 miles away North of the object (looking directly South).  The longitude it was initially hovering at would be 115 degrees and the latitude about 32.75 degrees (Mexican Border). I could not really tell the shape of it even though I had binoculars. It was not very large though. I could clearly see it emitting a steady white and green light and a flashing red light. The colors seemed to be very similar to airplane lights but it definitely was not a plane. It was probably no bigger than a small airplane. Initially it was circling a specific area.  After about 5 minutes of watching it it started to go up and then go down, not very quickly, but it was noticable.  Sometimes it did seem to accelerate quickly and it was then that knew that this was no Border Patrol or other conventional aircraft.  Sometimes it would go up or down diagonally too.  It seemed to be intent on hovering over a specific area however which had to be viewable for people driving on Interstate 8. About 25 minutes later, at 7:20 p.m., I saw a second craft about a mile Southwest of the first object.  It's light simply seemed to turn on and it became viewable but for only about 10-15 seconds.  It started moving towards the first craft.  The first craft started to move away from it until the second craft's light faded away. There were airplanes flying in the vicinity while this was happening. Whenever an airplane seemed to get to close to this object the object would move away from the airplane and then eventually would go back to the spot it seemed it wanted to hover over.  At one point an airplane seemed to fly right at it at a normal speed.  The craft then started to fly right by it at a lower altitude at about the same speed of the airplane.  With it's flashing red light it probably looked like another airplane to the airplane, but after the airplane passed it, it doubled back and went back to hovering over the 'spot'. At about 7:45 p.m. the lights from the craft dimmed to about half of it's original brightness.  It continued the up and down and around and diagonal movements for about 5 more minutes and then disappeared at approximately 7:55 p.m. I kept looking at the sky waiting to see if one or both of them would return.  At about 8:15 I saw one them (they both had the same colors and size) about 5 miles West of the original sighting location.  It seemed to be hovering in the same manner as described earlier over a specific 'spot'.  I believe that there is a hydroelectric plant over the spot that seemed to be hovering over.  It hovered over this spot for about 15 minutes and then disappeared. About 8:45 one of them reappeared again about another 5 miles west of the previous spot (10 miles from the original spot).  A couple of minutes later the other one reappeared and I could clearly see both of them continuing their up and down manuevers about a mile or two away from each other.  At about 9:00 p.m. one of them slowly disappeared and then about 5 minutes later the other one slowly disappeared. The location of this would be about 5 miles South of Glamis and maybe 10 miles East of Holtville.  The people near Glamis must have seen this if they were looking in the sky.   There is a train that goes right though Glamis from Brawley to Yuma and the craft may have been noticeable to anyone on the train. At about 9:30 p.m. I saw what looked like one of the craft hovering over the Colorado River about 10 miles North of Yuma.  It seemed to be doing the up and down and around and diagonal manuevers over another 'spot' for about 5 minutes and then slowly disappeared at about 9:35 p.m. At about 9:45pm I saw the craft back at the original sighting location but it's light was only about half of it's original amount.  It would alternately dim and disappear only to reappear again.  It seemed to be doing the same manueavers over the original 'spot'.  This stopped altogether at about 10:05pm and I didn't see anything else for the rest of the evening (I went to sleep at about 11:00p.m.). I only other thing I could add would be that at times the flashing red light seemed to change to a flashing white light.  This was the only change of colors that I observed.  I had the feeling that the objects were trying to make themselves noticeable to any onlookers on the ground but they did not want to be noticed by the people in the airplanes. There is a Marine Air Corps Station in Yuma and there is a large AWACS observing station about 15 miles Northeast of Glamis.  This object should have appeared on radar at both locations.  I saw no fighters dispatched from Yuma. That's it. Mark Levy P.S. - I am a computer programmer and longtime resident of California. This was my second sighting.  I did not report the first sighting I had because I wanted to see if history would repeat itself so I could be absolutely sure about what I saw.  Now I am.

It remained in that position motionless for approx. 5 minutes. During this time people from the neighborhood were gathering in the church parking lot looking at the object. Many motorists were also stopping their cars and getting out to look at the object. The object then rotated to the left slightly (silently) (the lead point of the triangle was initially pointing east)and moved slightly forward then rotated again left slightly towards the NE then stopped and then proceeded to move in a NE direction slowly (10 mph?). It's path appeared to take it directly over the Hudson River in a northerly direction. After it cleared the trees and went out of sight, everyone went on their way.

While watching a large airliner (a usual activity of mine as I am a pilot) fly almost directly overhead and to the southeast in a bright, clear and cloudless early afternoon sky, I noticed another jet traveling due east quite a bit higher. This second plane was a smaller business jet, probably a Cessna Citation as the wings were straight out from the body of the plane. It was flying at around twenty-five to thirty throusand feet in altitude. As I watched the small jet for a moment, two non-twinkling objects about the brightness of medium stars and about the same apparent size passed to either side of the small jet in the exact opposite direction. As the two objects continued in a due west direction and just before passing directly overhead, one object (the one that passed on the plane's right, or south side) abruptly turned to the southwest at a forty-five degree angle. The other object continued on a little farther and then turned due north. The turn was immediate, not like an airplane making a banking turn. I continued watching this one and in a few seconds it was joined by two more, one coming in from either side and together they formed a triangle, continueing to fly due north. After a couple more seconds, they moved in what I can only describe as a dance as they moved playfully around each other. Almost immediately they were joined by two more, one coming in from each side again. The five ojbects continued north until I could no longer distinguish them from the bright, blue sky. I have since seen (not without some excitement on my part) a report on T.V., with video no less, of almost exactly what I saw. The objects were described as 'pearls'. They were the same as I witnessed; silent, white and round and did not seem to give off light of their own. The objects on T.V. were also in diamond formations of many more than I saw (up to thirty at a time). Single 'pearls' would even turn away from the others at smooth forty-five degree angles.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,33.60235384615385,-117.65907692307692

I was driving home from college, north on Interstate 29 approximately ten miles from the Onawa off-ramp and the modern rest area, when I cited the object in question.  It was about 7:30 PM, and the sky was mostly sunny with few clouds.  As I was driving I saw what first I thought was a plane, so I ducked my head down so as to view it, since it was just out of my sight as I sat in a semi-rigid driving position.  What I observed was a light, pulsating from orange to blue to yellow to pink, which was slowly streaking across the sky from the west to the east at an angle of 270*.  When the object became perpendicular to the interstate it split apart from one object into three separate objects with the same properties in an equilateral triangular pattern.  The three objects then rapidly accelerated and disappeared from my view.  Once I had witnessed this I continued on the interstate until I reached the rest area just north of Onawa at which I pulled off to see if anyone else had seen what had happened since it occurred less than five minutes beforehand.  When I got out of my car, other people were standing on the sidewalk and from what I overheard it sounded like they were talking about what I had seen.  I walked by them without asking them though since I didn't want to sound crazy, because I wouldn't want someone walking up to me at a rest stop talking about a UFO.  I am a Cadet of the United States Army, and have taken college astronomy courses so I know what I saw was not Mercury, a ""shooting star"", Venus, or any other astronomical body.  What I saw reflected light and emitted light that changed colors, and although the sun was starting to set it was still light enough out that the stars would not be visible, nor was the sun a hindrance since I wasn't looking into the western sky.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,42.0284,-96.1303

First of all, I must say that i am a little confused about the exact date because I have waited approximately one year from date of incident.  I did not know who to report this to until I found this website and thought it important to report it even at this late date.  What I am not confused about, or my two sons, is what we saw.  We saw one night just before dark between the dates May 19 and May 27 2000, approximately May 23 a very strange circular light traveling in the sky at approximately 3000 ft. altitude, from east northeast to west southwest.  This light appeared diffused, but was obviously at a low level altitude.  The light was mostly white to pink in color and very odd.  Having been raised one mile from an airport and an Air National Gaurd airbase, as well as a father with 40 years aircraft mechanic experience and myself as a aircraft mechanic in the airforce, I have seen most every imaginable aircraft known to man.  This craft, or light, was obviously a UFO.  The sky in the backdrop was near dusk and virtualy cloudless.  The flight path that this was on carried it directly overhead.  As it approached I noticed there was no sound whatsoever.  Being alarmed by this I sent my youngest boy running in the house to retrieve a disposable camera that unfortunatly was in my vehicle at my wifes work.  As my child went to retrieve camera my other son and I continued to keep our eyes trained on said craft.  It continued its path diligently without variance.  I followed it with my eyes as far as I could until it dissapeared.  When it dissapeared I immediately went to the middle of the street looking up and down searching for someone else who seen this.  Unfortunately, there was no one.  I will conclude by saying this:  This was a UFO.  Not only to me, but to anyone who would have saw it on this earth.  Also, having lived in this town for 38 years I have learned the flight paths of aircraft in this area.  In my three years living at this house I have never seen an airplane, helicopter, durigable, or any o! ther cra ft fly in this direction.  Especially at that altitude.  For the last year I have dilligently watched the sky looking for a craft flying this direction.  To no avail.  But I gotta tell ya, the no noise thing to this day gives me goosebumps.  Please don't think were crazy, we are really very normal people and have been very hesitant in discusing this with anyone.  Please feel free to contact me anytime and I will discuss this in greater detail if needed.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I screamed for my friends to come out of the house but time did not permitt.  Their is a small single engine plane  airport in area somewhere but I could not understand what flight pattern I was seeing especially as it flew up into atmosphere. It did not disappear into distance (i.e. east or west) but in altitude.

I believe I saw something this morning. I'm not saying what but  they were highly irregular anomalous lights. I live about 1/4 mile north of LAX and have been there over 10 years. I know what types of aircraft are in the sky but more important how they approach and leave the airport and at what time of day. So at 5:45 am this morning I left my apartment for work. I walked out back to the alley which runs parallel to Manchester Bl to get to my car in the carport. Looking due west down the alley, about this time, I noticed a pair of lights, white and blue-green, about 45 deg. above the horizon traveling southwest. It was just before dawn. The air traffic at this time makes its approach from out of the West to land at LAX. So it is very quiet since all the jet noise is over the water. I thought the lights were a helicopter but it turned sharply due South then stopped moving. Helicopters do this but usually at lower altitudes. I would estimate the altitude around 10,000 feet at 2 miles. These lights which seemed to be hovering  had my attention and still I didn't hear any noise. This time of morning you can hear a pin drop and you would never know you where next door to an international airport. No traffic on Manchester either. Silence. Then I noticed the white light grow very bright and begin moving east toward me.  As it moved east, the space around the light began to glow and spread out in a wider diameter from the source in a  truncated cone shape. The light seemed to be moving through some high altitude clouds but there did not appear to be any outside of its beam. In other words, this area of the light seemed to be filled with swirls of vapor. I followed this light until I was looking nearly straight up with my head bent back. Then the light stopped moving. I thought maybe  the light source was slipping behind a fog bank. But that was not the situation. There were no low clouds or fog. The point source of the light  finally just seemed to disappear in the middle of this bright glow which  was left behind to fade in the clear dark sky and spread out in a sharp afterimage looking like high altitude vapor which was being illuminated by the sun still below the horizon. This entire sighting lasted 45-60 seconds.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,33.9454,-118.4398

A friend and I were driving home from a friend's house when I saw a triangulat shaped flying object.  At first glance it looked to be a plane, but as I thought about it, it was flying abnormally low for the location.  It was just above the treeline.  I had my friend stop the car and turn around to get a better look.  We both looked at each other and mentioned that it definitely was NOT a plane.  It wasn't really ""flying"" but more like hovering at a slow pace.  We couldnt really see the object well itself because it was dark, but the lights helped to outline it.  It looked to be triangular, with lights on each point.  Not like a plane would be with lights on the wingspan and tail but more like a stealth bomber would look like.  (I suppose it could have been a stealth bomber aside from the odd location it was in and its slow hovering.)  We watched it untill it dissapeared behind some tall trees and we went home.  I know that helicopters can hover...but I am 100% sure that it was not a helicopter. My friend and I told our friends about what we saw and it was nother really more than a weird story, little thought about afterwards.  Untill around two weeks later, two of my other friends told me that they saw the same object that I had described.  They said that they saw a triangular shaped object hovering abnormally low at about the same time of night (2-3am) and at the exactly same location!  They drove closer to the object for a few minutes observing it more.  As they drove home they said that the object was following them.  They said that they'd drive for awhile, look up, and the object wasnt far from behind them.  Although it prob wasnt actually ""following"" them more than it was just travelling in their general direction. These were the only two sightings of this UFO that I know of.  They occured in about a two week inveral in August of 2000.  I have no idea of the exact dates.  I thought it was definitely strange that two different groups saw the same thing, at the same time of day, at the same location.

Hi I just recently managed to have access to the internet and decided to report our sighting which occured 5 years ago on september the 10th 1995 at 9:12pm.  We were three fisherman that evening fishing in our secret fishing spot on the jauques cartier river by shannon and the military base.  We have never publicly reported this sighting since we fishing on the wrong side of the fence, inotherwords at the first bridge on the military base valcartier.  The great thing is that we were three witnesses that seen this incrideble sighting.  This was the last legal trout fishing day and even though we were fishing on the wrong side of the fence this sighting could of been seen from the shannon side off the fence.  So from my opinion this has nothing to with the military and I claim this because of a different reason which I mention in this report in detail since I was the only one to see this. And I will wait and see if somebody seen something similar inorder to make sure that hoaxters wont use this part of information. Now me and my friend are writing this report together to get the details as accurate as possible.  Our third friend has moved a few years ago, so he is not with us for now.  So at 12 minutes after 9 that night it was a crystall clear night.  There were so many stars out that night and not one single cloud in the sku.  There was absolutely no wind and it was starting to get cold.  All of a sudden my friend shouts out to me and my other friend hey look at that wow. So I looked at the northwesterly direction and there was this very precise white ligtht slightly larger than the north star, bigger than any star in that present night sky full of stars, so there is nothing blurry about this light.   And when I seen this way high up in and coming so incredibly fast the power and speed is just out of this world, I Immediately knew that this is it.  I have worked as a dog handler in west germany for the british of the rhine and I was out for many nights with my dog and I have seen many meterites and have more experience than most people with meterite sightings, and this is why I knew that this is it.  My two friends were afraid a little but I had the instant reaction of looking at my watch for the time and in my head I said that I am not going to blink my eyes once.  Believe me I had tears running down my eyes by the time this was over. So this light came in so fast and slowed down to a complete halt right above our heads, I was so happy inside off me because I instantly knew I was dealing with the real thing.  And it stayed there immobile without moving at all.  this maybe for a good 6 minutes.  If we didn,t see it coming we would of never noticed it because with so many stars out that night it was very well camouflashed in a sense.  But right from the beginning off this whit lights stop I pulled out my bic lighter and was jumping up and down and shouting at it hey come down come, and my friends stopped me because they were really scared at this point.  But I wasn,t  I am the type of guy that would jump right into the saucer with them were this to happen.   I respect all life in the universe, and I believe this is very important and a very evolved way of thinking.  I would like to mention that humankind may not reach this goal with the way we treat our enviroment and wildlife.  Mankind may need another 20,000 years or so of research in order to be technologically adavanced enough to surpass the speed off galactictic expansion. Anyways I respected my two friends, and to be honest I had a little heart beat myself.  The whole time it was in its immobile state I tried to figure out if whether there was any movement whatsoever but from being under neather it there was no movement whatsoever,  it seemed to be descending it hard to tell.  Also with my lighter clicking I was thinking to myself that if this was a saucer it must off seen my clicking, I even held the lighter in front of my nose to make sure to make sure that what ever was up there seen my face. Well all three of us still fixed on this because if I would of looked elsewhere and looked back at it with so many stars out that night I might of lost sight of it, then again maybe not because in a sense it was the biggest star three times the pinpoint size of a normal star. Besides all off a sudden it took off again in the same direction it was going to in the first place but really slow and constant towards the pmq section of the military base valcartier.  I think a tiny plane could off went faster than this ridicoulously slow pace, compared to the full power high speed it came at.  So to recap, it took about five seconds from the complete far horizon since we were standing in an open space to come to a complete halt.  Then it stayed in this camouflashed starlight state for about at least 4 minutes, Then as it was over civilisation well the pmqs. it all of a sudden shout out its light with a double flicker, we are talking milliseconds here,  my two friends didn,t see this shut down electric feeling of the light, but this is where I believe my keeping eyes on it the whole time payed off.  This double flicker electric feeling is hard to explain in writing but I think I am describing this well.  And thats it.  I would also like to mention that there was absolutely no trail and sound whatsoever.  At about 9:40 we could hear a small plane coming from the west and we could hear this so well.   So we packed our bags, and headed back through the woods in a very dark trail towards the shannon bridge. Something very strange happened though.  My two friends were well ahead of me and without giving any information of what I saw amazed up to this day.  All I will say to you is that it is very small and alive, and 1 inch long.  I will never tell anybody what that was because I will wait and see if there is any report that has seen this same thing.  It is a gift for my lighter clicking because even though it is similar to an earth creature, it doesn,t exist in the books, and nobody ever seen something like this.  The last hint I will give is that it came and looked at me straight inbetween the two eyes. So beware to any hoaxters you will have to be very precise in your sighting to match what I saw.  This way I will be sure the day somebody reports something exactly the same, well then I will tell you what this was.  Up to now no one ever has mentioned something similar so we will leave this at that.  I developed a great interest in sightings in the past few years and whenever there are those people with white light sightings I listen very carefully.  I would like to give a final opininion, about this, I don, think that the military has anything to do with this.  I have a very good reason for that. So I am absolutely not ashamed to report this sighting since we are three fisherman that seen this.  I don,t care what anybody says, but If anybody could off seen the tremendous speed and deceleration of this machine, and the sneaky way of camouflashing itself in it immobile state well I think anybody would go nuts.  But what happened after is a payback for the courage of flicking that lighter on and off. I hope this will be well recorded in the history books of the future, even though it is more or less a simple sighting compared to some other sightings.  Maybe there are radar system records archived somewhere inorder to verify this sighting.  I would also like to congratulate the UFO reporting center for thier work in trying to solve the mystery,  I am now positive that humankind will succeed in proving these ufo sightings. So I tried the best I could and as honestly as I could in this report. This sighting terminated at exactly 9:28 PM September the 10th 1995",2000-12-02T00:00:00,,

This all happened when I was on my way back to my parents house from dropping off a rented movie. My parents live outside the city limits.  I was almost all the way home when I drove out of a clearing of trees when I spotted the primary colored lights in the sky.  As I approached the lights I slowed my car to a halt.  I was nearly underneath the lights.  It was a clear and cool evening.  I turned my car engine off to listen for any engine noises. there was no noise coming from the lights which were to my guess about 150 foot up in the sky.  I can judge this by the 50 foot tree that was near.  The lights were very large circular and were in groups of primary colors of red, yellow, and blue.  I left my parking lights on and flashed my headlights at the colored lights and the colored lights began to slowly fade and brighted but in a pattern of the grouping of the colored lights.  I rolled down my window and got out of my car and shut the door.  I continued to flasth the lights for a few more moments.  I was startled when I heard an older couple in a luxury car slowly approach from behind me.  I heard the lady in the passenger seat say to her husband ""What is that?"" and I noticed her red painted fingernair pointing up at what I was seeing.  The couple being frightened drove off rather quickly.  I tried for the life of me to get a shape of a craft of a length or color of one and I could not see any lines or shape.  The lights which were in perfect focus and were not the little twinkly lights a person would see on a plane or helicoper far away were easy to see.  The thing that puzzles me to this day is why I could not make out a shape of a craft.  I looked near the colored lights and far away from them as to see if I was not looking far enough out.  I believe there was only one craft because the lights must have got bored with my light flashing and slowly turned clockwise together and then slowly went in a direction to my right.  Because there were no immidiate roads to chase it I did not chase it.  I then w! ent home which was only a few hundred feet from the sighting and told my parents about it.  They believed me mainly because I was brought up not to cry wolf and they knew I would not do such a thing.

On this February 21/96 evening it was dark (9:05 pm) and a thick overcast of cloud was overhead--the cloud base was at 1,900 feet (because of the sighting--I immediately upon arrival home checked our local weather channel for cloud ceiling data and winds and wrote down the details of what I saw). Anyway, during our walk I looked to the west and saw an unushual glowing object, luminous but not glaring bright, no navigational lights or strobe. We stopped walking and I pointed the object out to my son. Its track would have it fly almost directly overhead. As it approached I said to him that this was weird--no sound, speed about what a small aircraft would fly at, 100 mph or so, but it was relatvely low as it went over--estimate based on known cloud base (1,900 feet) and the object was about one hundred feet below the cloud layer. Though it was night the  overcast was bright because of the glare of city lights but I could not detect wings or any form other than that of a sphere, illuminated in a yellowish-white light (the object was close enough that wings would have been detectable). I figured the object to measure about fifteen feet in diameter. The west to east course was more or less straight (winds were NW - 11 KM/H), it did not weave or change altitude though I thought there to be slight oscilation--I did not sense that it drifted with wind direction. All this seemed odd but it was not until the object had passed overhead and was about 4 miles east of our position that we were amazed. At this distance the cloud changed from a solid defined layer at 1,900 feet to dropping right to the ground. I said to my son that if this were an airplane it would not fly into the cloud at this altitude because there are many mountains less than a mile to the north that rise to 4,000 feet. No aircraft flying IFR would fly this ! course. The object, seconds before entering the cloud dropped what I can only describe as sparkles--just like the flickering white/blue flashes one would see from a halloween sparkler. These sparkles descended from the still illuminated sphere for a time span of about four or five seconds, dropping about 1,000 feet below the craft. We let out a collective ""whooo."" Then twice more it dropped these twinkling bright lights in identicle fashion to the first then immediately entered the cloud and the illuminated sphere went out as if a switch were turned off as opposed to being obscurred by thicking cloud. We were pretty puzzled by what we saw and immediately upon arriving home I jotted down the details, it was only upon listing to your report on the Art Bell show and your invitation to submit both recent and past sightings that I felt compelled to dig out my scrap of paper with the details contained herein.

I crossed the street and approached an officer and said I know what caused this power outage. I pointed at the bright light hovering and he looked up, but at his angle he couldnt see it because of a roof top, he told me to get lost. the light slowly moved across town and fog set in. we watched it for 20 more min then we decided to leave.

I happened to look up into the sky at some point when I noticed a large number of lights moving through the night sky. I saw many such lights over the course of the next several minutes. I saw lights on objects that seemed to be shaped like tops, and I saw lighted cigar-shaped craft. However, since it was dark I assumed these objects were simply normal aircraft (i.e., helicopters or planes) that I couldn't see very well. Then, I clearly saw two craft which immediately caught my attention. I could see them clearly, as they flew low relative to the other objects. They were cone-shaped, with the flat end at a slight angle. The flat ends had several lines of lights on them. These lights were steady (they did not seem to blink or flicker). They seemed to be gray or a dull black in color. The lights were white. One craft followed the other, flying in a straight line through the sky. I could only see them for a short while before I had travelled too far along the road and lost sight of them. They flew ""fat end"" first.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,,

I did have a witness who saw the incident with me, but to date we are the only ones I know of. As we stood talking in the front yard of his Orange Park home one Fall evening, the sky was virtually clear with only a few clouds around (few and far between). I noticed something in the sky that at first came to my mind as two birds flying directly over his house reflecting the light from his front porch. I then realized first off that it was not birds, then, that it was not close enough to the house to be reflecting the light. The objects, themselves were no brighter than the stars around them and they left no discernable trail behind them. They flew side by side, then in a uniform move they crossed paths and continued on in the same direction (East to West) and in what seemed to be the same distance apart that they had been before they crossed paths. They continued on in this formation until they were out of sight over my friends rooftop. The whole incident took only a few seconds, but my mind raced to try to explain to my senses exactly what I was observing. To this day I am not at all sure what it was, but as I said my friend and I were the only ones to date to have seen the sight. I thought also in the few seconds of the occurence that it might be shooting stars but, they did not fade from view and the maneuvers were too precise and calculated. If someone could explain what it was that I saw I would appreciate it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,30.128008631578947,-81.75236315789473

The day before Friday the 13th. We were in our old station wagon. It was a nice and sunny day. We had gotten behind a big rig. It was quite a ways ahead of us. It reached the place where it was to turn off at. It was a left turn and was having to wait for oncoming traffic to pass. I started to slow down and noticed light reflecting in my eyes. For a second, I thought it was the crack in my windshield. It wasn't. We didn't see a u.f.o. It was plain as day. Up in the sky, about 500 feet away, was a flying saucer. Just like the movies. It was solid silver, metallic, and was reflecting the sunlight nicely. It was hovering above the trees, not moving. We couldn't see any windows or anything like that. I don't know if it made any sound or not because of my car engine. It was shaped like two metal pie plates stuck together. It was solid silver. After watching it for about half a minute, it was gone. It didn't fly off. It just vanished. It wasn't a plane, helicopter, blimp or anything like that. We could SEE it. I've seen several odd things in the sky since I've moved here, but nothing like this. I think that the government tests experimental aircraft around these parts. There are just too many odd lights in the night sky. Well, sorry to have wrote so much. I just wanted to share this.

As I was going around towards the back of the building on the access road, I saw what appeared to be a flying canoe go over my Jeep. White bottom, with an alternately blinking white light on the front and rear. As it passed over my windshield from N to S, I rolled down my window for a better look. All I could see was the bottom, and this thing looked like I said- a flying canoe, with the 2 blinking lights. In fact, this thing was so cheezy looking I laughed out loud. It looked like a really piss-poor carnival gimic. The lights looked like 60-watt light bulbs, nothing even remotely resembling modern avionic marker lights- no red or green.And with a strong wind out of the W, this thing was low enough that I could see that it had no wings, and appeared to be unaffected by the wind- no wobbling like small aircraft do with a strong side-wind blowing.

It was ovalish and one end was slightly tilted up.  The thing had a metalic, band through the middle with atleast 3, round, bright windows that did not seem to orbit the craft.  It was very bright but did not seem to light up and trees around it.  The ball of light was bright yellow, with long rays of light coming off of it, like the Rising Sun in the Japanese flag. The metalic band was silver/white, and was slightly brighter then the yellow.  The windows were even brighter and may have been spot lights, they were yellow also.  I had only seen it for a second or two when it started to move slowly twards the South East, it passed behind a few trees then back into the open and into my other nighbors back yard.  It had moved over  about 40 or 50 feet, and had gained about 10 feet in altatude (it was moving diaganaly).  It quickly dimmed, a tiny bit then disapeared giving the impression that it moved faster then the speed of light.  I did not hear anything at that time.

My wife and I while driving back to NH from Topsham Maine on 12/12/2000 at apporx. 3:45 pm to 4:00 pm on I-95 South, between Portland and Kittery when, when we saw three very bright lights in the west south west sky.  These lights from left to right where red, white and green in a triangurlar formation with the white light slightly above the other two, these lights did not flicker or fade or change colors and remained intact and did not devate from it's west south west course.  These lights where very very bright and stood out cleanlly on a bright and sunny day with no clouds in the area at all.  We looked at them for a short time maybe two mins and then each other, at that time we did not know what we saw, but as I looked around behind us I saw 4 high alltitude jets pursuing in the direction of the lights at a high rate of speed with enough alltitude to leave contrails behind them, they criss crossed the sky several times in an attempt to intercept the lights.  As the jets passed over head I remarked to my wife that what ever it was the naval air base at Brunswick Maine had scrambled jets to check it out, as I pointed them out to her she saw exactly what I saw, 4 jets trying to vecter an intercept course with the lights in the west south west sky.  We first noticed the lights some where between Portland and Kittery, The jets as far as we saw did not catch up to the lights. When we crossed the bridge at Kittery heading back into NH our view of the sky changed due to landscape in that area and could no longer see the jets nor the lights. I believe that the lights we saw was not any type of aircrft I've ever seen and most certainlly had to have been seen by many motorist on I-95 So. as the traffic was moderate to heavy that day and it was so Bright that you would need to be blind not to see it, still to this day I've heard of no reports of this sighting and have checked newspapers from NH and Maine from then till now.

An aircraft of some sort appeared suddenly, sped across the sky at an unbelievable rate of speed, and then vanished. My sister was the first to notice the object as she was scanning the sky to see if she could catch a glimpse of the Hale-Bop comet, when she grabbed my arm and told me to look.

It flew slow at first, and I noticed a very bright white light, which looked like it was coming from the side of the craft due to it's direction.  The light flickered very quickly a few times, went out and then came back on.  It was flying quite slow at that time.  Then all of a sudden it accellerated, darted across the sky towards the west and Michigan untill we couldn't see it any more.  It looked to have four light type things, one at the front, back, and the side facing us.  The light at the side was a very bright white light, that looked like it was sort of pointed downward!  It was very loud and sounded like a gigantic jet engine roaring extremely loud.  The lights on the front and on the back were much dimmer, and looked to be green.  Judging by the lights on it, it looked to me like it was sort of round or had very short wings.  What I mean is that all the lights looked as though they were exactly the same distance apart giving it a square or circular looking shape.  As it flew further away from us there looked to be a cluster of about 20 small white lights giving off an enormous glare.  It looked like it was about the same size as a fighter plane would be.   Once whatever it was sped up it moved across the sky faster than anything I've seen and within about 15 seconds was too far away for us to see.  Neither my sister nor I have ever seen what we thought to be an alien craft or anything like that.  Particularly, I am a very logical and scientific person who needs to see something to really believe it.  I recently had an argument with a friend who was trying to convince me that there are such things as bearded ladies.  My arguement to her was that I would never be able to truly believe something like that unless I saw it with my own eyes in person, because how can you really know?  My point is that if I wouldn't have seen it with my own eyes, I never would have believed it.  I am usually very sceptical of UFO sightings and stuff on tv because the stories always have to many holes, and of course I had never seen one.  I have a 156 I.Q. and have always been thought of as very clear minded and mature far beyond my years.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,42.96978578947368,-82.31983842105264

We were hoping to see a clear night so we could later come back and photograph the comet.We drove out to the airport farthest from town. The road going in is dirt, and scary, but he grew up here, where I am from the east coast of the states. To me, it was extremely dark out, even with the clear sky.When we arrived at the final part of the road into the airport, we were facing an south easterly direction. In front of us in the sky, were some objects flying from east to west, as best I could tell.I asked my husband to stop, and we got out and watched them fly just under mars and disappear. Later I discovered he had seen two objects closer to the horizon, flying west to east, and flying in a closer formation than what I saw. They were orange in color, and round in shape, but also very far away.They were also flying to fast to be the usual satellite, and too high up to be a plane.I'd seen a light like that last year while looking up at the comet of 1996, while at a pit stop, so I didn't think much of it.There is a light at the actual airport that didn't give us very good viewing of the comet, so we drove back onto the road where we could see. We looked around, and decided to go back home for the camera as picture taking would be excellent, and saw a car comingtowards us. He started up the car, and we took off to home, when out of my window, facing mars, I saw the light returning from the west...just one. I asked him to stop again, I see it I said. As soon as I said it, the object turned straight towards usand I started to scream to him, oh my God, it's coming at us! They're coming for us! I was so scared, and it seemed to fly from a high altitude to a lower one, at which point I began to get very afraid, and I started to yell at it to go away, that we didn't want it here, and it couldn't take us.By the time he had stopped and turned off the car, the object was already speeding away up into the sky, and as he jumped out of the car, I saw the last of it disappear.It happened so quickly, and I was so afraid that we went home to calm down a bit....he still wanted a picture of the comet, and I wasn't about to stay home alone, so I went with him, and we saw nothing, probably because we were prepared with a camera this time!Just this past weekend, a friend of ours said they saw something similiar flying over Hinton, around three am, when he was driving back from Edmonton.I also note that an earthquake, unusual for this area, happened the morning before our sighting, and was a 4.2 (?) located just southeast of Jasper. I reported this to a an association up here called AUFORA, but I haven't heard anything from them. We also checked the flight log at the airport when we went back, andthere was no flight recorded, although there was a plane landed from out of town, and a few unoccupied cars.My husband and I are 30 and 24 repectively, and lead fairly normal lives. Both of us have art degrees, and are planning our first business venture as I write this.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,52.8833,-118.0833

Over the years I have observed northern lights, meteors, satellites and all kinds of commercial and private aircraft.  Rarely have I seen anything out of the usual until the evening of Tue. May 27, 1997.  Because of engineering studies at university I haven't had time until now to send in this report. What got me interested in getting in touch with the UFO Center was hearing Peter Davenport on the Coast-to-Coast AM radio program on Sat. Feb. 20, 1999 at 1:30 am EST.  I wasn't aware of the UFO reporting center website until that morning.  He had mentioned that some people had reported seeing a large diamond shaped object.  This is something like what I saw. I spotted a brightly lit yellowish orange four-sided diamond shaped object over Welland, Ontario, Canada.  It had well defined edges with the light being more concentrated near its edges.  It approached from the northwest below the Big Dipper at 11:05 pm EDT with no sound.  Its size was about a thumbnail's width at arm's length.  In view for about 15 seconds, it moved across the sky in a straight line and disappeared below the southeast horizon. An estimated altitude was 40,000 feet which gives an approximate width (using trigonometry) of 800 feet across its beam.  In addition, this object moved with its larger interior angles being front to back. I again saw the same object (at least it appeared the same) a week later on Tue. June 3, 1997 at 11:50 pm EDT over Welland and its behaviour was the same as that described above. This eerie looking object was certainly something different as it was too large for a satellite, shuttle-craft or the Mir station, and it was moving extremely fast for its estimated height above ground.  It also didn't have the characteristic port and starboard red and green lights nor the flashing white or red strobe lights associated with known aircraft. I hope that this information will be of interest to you and that it can be used in collaboration with other reported similar sightings.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,42.99599237288136,-79.25332288135594

I live near a military base.  I have seen every kind of military aircraft known, but I have never seen anything like or since what I saw on 6/4/97.  It was approximately 8:30 pm and I went outside to put the windows up on the car.  As I was outside, I looked to the NE sky and noticed something flying low.  It's normal for military aircraft to fly low in this area, but the light pattern was strange.  It had only red lights in the front and a very unusual pattern I've never seen before (that's what caught my attention), and I could see that from the trajectory of the way it was flying that it would come over my head.  During this time, I noticed recognizable military aircraft flying around but keeping distance.  Anyhow, this aircraft came over my head, and I did not hear any engine noise.  It was HUGE!  I could see small white lights on either side which would be at the end of each wing(?).  I was transfixed by this sight and continued to watch.  Then the view changed as the object went over my head and was moving away from me, and there was a plasma white color in the middle of the back, similar to the color of an afterburner on an F-18.  This unknown aircraft was not flying quickly; it was not an F-18.  It continued past me in the opposite direction.  All of a sudden, two red lights shot out from it, and then I saw a triangular pattern of lights--the white light had gone off and was replaced by red.  Then, the top two red lights shot off together and one of the military jets headed in that direction, and then the object lit up the back again, and went the opposite direction, with 2 jets following along behind it.  I stood there wondering what I had just seen and my first idea was maybe the B-2 Stealth at night, but I really couldn't say for sure.  Maybe it was simply some sort of night-time military exercise---which is the impression I got, but what I saw didn't really make sense, and like I say, I've seen all kinds of military aircraft flying (except for the B-2). I know of no aircraft that flies arou! nd here that doesn't make any kind of noise.  This whole incident I had still puzzles me to this day.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,34.9008,-76.8262

I cannot explain what we (my friends and I, and others) are seeing, but it IS real.  Most of the time the object(s) seem to be to my left as I am driving toward Franklin, Kentucky.  The object glows really bright with a red light sometimes appearing at the bottom or center of it.  Then, all of a sudden the light will go out.  At times the light wil zig-zag for a time.   One night as I was going home from Church, I looked up and there it was, glowing like fire on a very dark night.  The object then began to move at a very slow pace and was getting nearer to my automobile.  I was a little concerned to say the least.  Then I looked underneath this object and saw 2 more smaller lights flying faster underneath it.  They were very visable.   As I approached Bowling Green, the fireball light was still there.  As I got closer to the light the object seemed to take on a triangular appearance.  I cannot be sure because the trees were obscuring my view, but it appeared that something was there.   I must mention that one time previously at my friend's house we saw the object, and we took out his binoculars to take a look at it.  The object looked rectangular or diamond shaped, and had a purple glow to it.  There could be a reasonable explaination for this-but I don't know what it could be.

We were standing outside in our backyard observing the stars as it was a perfectly clear warm summers night. We were facing south, and in the background are hills and Mt Wainui and in the foreground are trees to our left and to our right. We noticed a point of light in the sky facing due south at about an angle of 55 degrees. It was the behaviour of this 'point of light' that caught my eye. When I first observed it, it was about the size of the star Canopus. It was only seconds after this that it rapidly expanded in size and brightness to the size of about my fist held straight out in front of me and the suddenly shrunk rapidly back to a small point of light, smaller then what it was to begin with. It then proceeded to peform unbelievable maneuvers, climbing vertically and down again, turning at right angles and moving in a zig-zag fashion at incredible speeds as if intelligently controlled. It eventually disappeared moving at high speed in a SSE direction. I love observing the sky and have been stargazing for years so I can quite confidently say that it was not a plane, helicopter, weather balloon, satellite, planet, shooting star or meteorite. There is a flight path that passes over us from Wellington and a small aerodrome about a kilometer west of us so I'm 100% sure it wasn't a plane, as all planes that pass over are easily identifiable.

There was also a mentally retarded individual that disappeared from a nearby town, who was medically dependent and could not survive long without his medication. He was gone for four days in late October, and then reappeared 100 feet off of this road, unhurt, suffering only from slight dehydration. There is also a federal weather station located near the road. I always wondered if the weather station was a cover for something els. Or perhaps a landmark used by ET life.

We were on the I-5 going south and we realized we had gone to far south of Fresno (where I live) when we hit the 198 going east/west.  Realizing our mistake we got on 198 heading east towards Hanford with the intention of transferring to the 99 Northbound in Hanford and heading back up to Fresno.  However, about halfway there (not far from the Lemoore Airbase, I found out) I saw something out the window that made me do a double take. I saw several pale 'twinkle' lights like those seen on airplanes and helicopters, however they were all white (no red or blue or green) and there were several beams of pale light moving across the ground.  My very first impression was that there were 3 helicopters flying in very tight formation using spotlights to look for something....  my next thought was that maybe it was a crop duster or something doing some sort of night job... but after a few seconds I realized that neither of these were correct.... I pointed it out to  my friend (who was driving) as it was out his window (to the north) and I think maybe less than 100 feet off the ground... and it seemed to be moving very slowly and gracefully.... it then arced upward and turned back towards the freeway (coming south) that we were on and as it passed overhead I managed to see a really faint silhouette against the black night sky... I could barely make out an airplane shape with very long thin wings and large, ellipsoid shaped bulbs at the tips of both wings... and as it flew overhead there was absolutely no sound whatsoever...  it then performed a very graceful but tight turn and flew back over the freeway again (this time heading north) and as it flew over the field to our left I saw again 3 faint, silvery nimbus's of light (almost like searchlights) coming from what looked like the underside of the nose and the 2 ellipsoid shapes at the tip of the wings, and the light app! ared to be sweeping back and forth over the ground.  At this point I was really excited because I had never seen anything like it before. My friend told me to dig the camera out from the backseat and try and take pictures of it... so I dug around in the back really quickly and by the time I got it ready, the object had once again flown over us and was pacing us to the right (south of 198 heading east in the same direction as us) maybe a quarter of a mile out and a hundred or so feet off the ground...  I then attempted to take several pictures... but as the craft was completely dark and there was no real light reflections the only thing I could see were its steady blinking lights... So I tried to time it as best I could to try and capture a picture when the lights were actually on instead of off, but as I write this I don't know how they've turned out...  However I'm pretty sure its not a UFO but some sort of secret plane from the Lemoore Airbase... and I was wondering if I draw a picture of what I think I saw, do you know someone who might be able to tell me what I saw based upon its outline and its behavior...??  My friend thinks it was maybe an A-10 Tank-killer, because what he saw differs from what I saw by a little... however, I don't think this is correct because of the 3 lights and the fact that it made no sound at all... So anyhow, I am trying to find out if the plane is something common or if it is might be one of the top secret ones that you hear about (like the aurora)... ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness.  He seems to have ruled out most possible explanations for the sighting, and he apparently will speak with personnel from Lemoore Air Base in the near future.

I can't believe what I saw! I am still bewildered. I was at a friend's place discussing a future project. About 10:20 PM I left the building to go back home. I got out of the side door and walked across the parking lot. The sky tonight is fairly clear, except a few clouds here and there. Suddenly on top of the clouds I saw what I first thought a cloud moving faily quick towards the North. As it passed the small group of clouds it was actually a group of five circles in some V formation, with 4 of the cricles on the right side, and one on the left. They were, and I noticed, evenly spaced. The color was some sort of light gray, paler than the clouds. I look down then up and it was still there, moving at a nonchalant speed direction North. Wow! Whatever it was it faded in the sky as it moved away (not because it disappeared, but because of the distance). I ran back to  my friend Mike's place and tried to reach him but the intercom was dead (usual). I ran under is porch and yell! ed his name. He and his girlfriend ran down to see what was happening. After telling them and looking for a while (it had been gone for a few minutes by then) I ran upstairs and drew what I saw on an envelop ( 4 frames ). Don't take me wrong, I am not a hardcore disbeliever, but I tend to believe that everything can be explained (especially UFO cases) but this one is a little tougher. It was not a reflection on the clouds, it was on top of them (they were really sparse too). It was not an airplane, it was too high. I called places to find out what the ceiling was but I could not find a place that would report that. I got on the web trying to find something and I got here by curiosity. It was not balloons, it travelled to fast (when I say it, I mean the formation). The formation was going at the same speed throughout the experience. I don't know what it was!

It all started on this warm sunny evening at 6.20pm when my family & I were just finishing our meal in the garden, when for some reason I glanced up at the sky just above the roof of our house, and saw what I thought at first was a cluster of silver balloons of various sizes tethered together high in the sky, they were very high, and as I was trying gather what direction the balloons were travelling, I saw them all moving apart into fixed positions ( see drawing) then move to another, which made me think balloons can't do that so precisely. I said to my family to look up there at these balloons and tell me what do you see, my wife, son of 22 & daughter of 19 looked and said they look like those silver foil balloons, as they were reflecting the suns rays just like a prism does with rainbow colours. Because they kept forming the same positions over and over again, then reforming into a tight group as they drifted over the sky, we became more suspicious of the first thought, and more convinced they were under some control. I must point out we have never seen anything like this before, and we all know what balloons look like in the sky, as I used to sell & fly all kinds of balloons including silver foils, so we have some idea from our experiences over the years what to look for to identify the object and it's distance in relation to other things around.But because it was a cloudless sky that day, there was only a number of gliders around to judge how high they were and the size of them, our opinion through binoculars was that they were very large of various sizes and very high in the sky, we estimated about 40,000 feet or more. After about 20 minutes of taking turns through the binoculars tracking them across the sky, they disappeared out of sight right above us. I also thought as we live near the Atomic Weapon Establishment, these objects seemed to be above that site and moving in a south east direction towards Basingstoke. It must have been about ten minutes after the objects had gone, when we were looking around the sky to see if we could spot them any where else, then suddenly from the north very low in the sky, two silver grey round objects one above the other shot across my line of sight (see sketch 4) it was very amassing to see these objects so close up and moving in tandem together, as if they were letting us see them and moving closer together and apart again, just to show they were under control, both objects seem to have a flash of light surrounding them on one side as if they were spinning, and they were completely quiet,they disappeared as suddenly as they appeared, just if they switched them selves off like a light. They reminded me of two large ball bearings about the size , this is difficult to judge when you have not seen anything like this before, so is the problem of height in the sky, I would hassard a guess and say the objects were about10feet across and about 2-3 thousand feet high. We were all struck by the aura they created within us and to this day we wish someone could explain to us what we had seen and if anyone else has seen something like this. I contacted 'Quest' and they sent me a form to fill in, I described exactly just what I had seen but I have not herd anything from them, which is why I have written this letter to you in the hope you or someone else with knowledge of UFO's can enlighten us to what we had seen. Since writting this account, I have been watching many programmes on TV , and have noticed other people around the world have seen simular objects and in this formation, but no one yet has seen what we saw, two objects close up like that.

The object was in the shape of two wings almost boomerang shape and was beige in colour. the first night the object, soundlessly flew across the sky from N.E. to S.W. at a high altitude. The second night it flew alarmingly low over my back yard. In fact I wrote a letter to our local air force base complaining that it scared me by flying so low as I thought it was an experimental aircraft. We had a lively correspondence and denials not on radar etc. When I sent a sketch the colonel himself phoned me and we had a very interesting discussion.there was no sound and no lights nor any call signs on the object. It went extremely fast and as it was rather high at the first sighting it was difficult to estimate size althiugh it looked much larger than a 747. The second sighting scared the heck out of me as it came without so much a swish over my backyard and the road at the other side of the fence. It could have been 30-50 feet across because I do not know how high up it was. It seemed to me that it cleared the street light by about 20-30ft. I really can not say with any certainty, all I know is that it totally unnerved me to the extent that I ran into the house and locked the door. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I am glad others saw it too. The object had none of the characteristics logged on your list. It was silent and looked like two backswept wings with scalloped edges,plus it had random protuberances on the under side. It scard me. It may have been an experimental aircraft althoiugh this was denied, nor had it,according to the airforce base, been recorded on radar. The base is 60 miles from and i am used to seeing aircraft flying about. They had been flying earlier that night too.I also phoned my local commercial airport about 12 miles away and they had no radar confirmaton of anything like I had seen. It was laughingly suggested that perhaps it was Alien. I did n! ot think it was funny. Incidentally about 60 miles north a crop circle was found the next day and many plants in my yard had mutations.

Hello.   I want to come forward with a complete report of my sightings which occurred on 3/1/01 at 04:50. I am a construction contractor, 43 years old and have lived at ((town deleted)), Oregon all of my life. I spend much time out doors, camping out hiking and star gazing. My home elevation is 1100 feet and I see passenger jets fly over all the time. (and military) I see them fly over in various cloud formations and at night I have studyied them with their fog lights on, rays pointing downwards at the forward angle. The luminance is yellow in the cloud ceiling and one inch long at arms length. During the day, passenger jets average 1/4"" to 1/8"" inch at arms length. The speed of the passenger jets is quite slow. The object I saw that early morning was 2"" inches at arms lenght and was moving fast in the ceiling at about eleven thousand feet. I saw the clouds passing under it and the brightness was like a white sixty watt flourescence with a hue of blue. And a faint red was glowing at the center through the mist. I heard no sound, it was traveling North with one light in the forward position. The three lights were about 3/8"" inch in diameter at arms length. After seeing this thing I immediately went out side with a flash light and saw to my West other lights at an angle of about 30 degrees. They were an odd arrangement of lights, 2"" inches at arms length. Small bright green lights one red, and I saw a white light not flash but pulse only once at the trailing end as it moved behind the tree tops. As it moved North, I heard a faint low rumble. I continued studying the sky and could see the brightest stars shining through the ceiling and there were small breaks in the clouds. I saw a triangle of lights directly over my head, 1 1/4"" inch at arms length, brighter than the other stars and I was suspicious of this and watched them for about 15 seconds when suddenly a bright flash occurred at the center of the triangle. all three lights just blinked out. I studyied the sky for about a half hour after that, but saw no oth! er movin g objects. At day break I noticed the clouds to be at about eleven thousand to thirteen thousand feet above the surrounding mountains. In my back yard, Mt Horeb is directly North of my house at two and a half miles and is 4212' feet high.

On March 8th, 2001, around 5:30 PM, I walked out of my office into the parking lot to look at the ominous cloud formations that had been massing that afternoon. They were kind of unusual, in that they were large, opaque forms that looked like the kind in Maxfield Parrish paintings. Our office is on highway 43, which looks out in a North Easterly direction (Mt. Hood is East of where we are). I looked at the very dark cloud behind the shopping center across the street, and noticed what looked like a huge swarm of birds slowly hovering around in a kind of slow, corkscrew pattern. I watched for 30 seconds or so, and called for a couple of office mates to come see the swarm. Two co-workers came out, and I asked them what they thought we were looking at. We sort of decided that we were looking at 100 or so golden spheres. They moved in the way flocks of birds do in relation to each other (though even more so the way embers from a fire slowly waft skyward.) There appeared to be no visible wings, and they made no particular sound, so only nearby traffic could be heard. The orbs sort of drifted, corkscrew-like, up and down the column-like concentration of orbs that hovered around the ""center"" of the group. The sun was very bright, and not blocked, and the rays fully hit the spheres, making it hard to discern what they actually were. The sun made the cloud behind the orbs particularly dark and smokey-looking, and one could not see through it. This event lasted about 10 minutes, until all the orbs had drifted into cloud cover, and as cloud cover moved over them. Since we couldn't get a photo, I have tried to re-create what I saw in Photoshop. Though I can't produce the intensity of light coming from the sun (right corner of the picture) nor can I accurately reproduce the cloud formations, this ""painting"" pretty much re-creates what we saw. The sky was bright blue, and these huge cloud banks were moving rather swiftly across the sky. The dark clouds had that weird greenish-grey tinge that they get when a tornado is coming (or threatening.) Everything was very brightly lit, as on a cloudless summer day. It was hard to tell exactly how many spheres we were looking at, since it was bright, and all the orbs were drifting around each other. I don't know if this was reported in the media, or even if anyone else saw this grouping. I would love to know if someone else so the orbs actually doing something, or know where they went next. ((NUFORC Note:  An illustration was included with the report.  The cluster of small objects, in our opinion, is reminiscent of a swarm of flying insects.  However, how the flight of insects could be mistaken for the flight of a flock of birds is not clear to us.  We may include the illustration here, and the reader can make his/her own decision on the matter.  No other reports from the Portland for this incident.

At 6:20 pm on March 13, 2001 as I was driving home from work just before dusk and topped a hill facing west I saw a white something dropping fast from high in the sky in the west. At first thought it dropped straight down but after consulting a map that showed my route veered slightly north I realize the craft did, also. At first it was a shape like a flat bottomed cone (tall popcorn bucket- elongated thimble, maybe) with larger part at the top, it had very sharp edges visible and at times while dropping there was an indication of fold or line the length of it from top to bottom (as if rotation presented different view to me). It was very bright white against the palest blue sky. As the highway I was on turned north, I took a side road to the west heading toward the still dropping object, in hopes of keeping it in sight and getting a better look, wondering where it might land assuming it was very large space debris, perhaps even from Mir that might be breaking up already. When I stopped my car I watched it drop to just above the top of tree line about 75 feet ahead of me. At that time while I remained stationary, the object seemed to hesitate and the bottom lifted pointing north. It moved across the sky (18"" at extended arm length) to the north and appeared to stop. There was no sound, scents or other noted effects. I watched a few moments as it seemed to just stay suspended there. This discounted my idea of space debris and I assumed I would be able to check NASA sites to discover what it was. It didn't seem to be in danger of crashing. I turned and went back out to the highway headed north and when I cleared line of woods to my left I saw what I believe to be the same object that had traveled a bit further north than I had. (As it was out of my sight for a period, I can not be absolutely positive it was the same object.) I parked my car across from cleared pasture area (less than 1/2 mile north of first stop) to take more pictures. The object was then seen as a rather vertical jelly bean (cigar) shaped bright yellow ""glow"" sitting barely above tree line in the west less than a quarter mile away. I took another picture and as I watched it seemed to ignite as if exploding and began to ascend. At this point I feel sure it was on fire. The top (front) blazing was bulged out like smushed ice cream cone as it seemed to meet resistence. The back tapered only gradually. This was intense fiery orange, black, yellow, red colors. As it rose, I looked to two guys a hundred feet north on the highway working on their truck and realized they hadn't noticed it. I pulled my car up and just said look. One of these guys immediately said, ""Thats it! That's that space station."" We watched it turn back overhead toward the east and discussed things we knew about Mir coming down for a couple of minutes before the object appeared to burn out. At that time it continued overhead east as a pattern of black debris in various geometic shapes from front to length of previous burning tail. Still all this time no sound or odor of fire. Help had come for the stalled truck and I needed to move my car so I went on toward home, assuming an explanation would be all over the news. After about 3 miles I turned on a highway headed east and looked back with clear view of the burnup area and could see nothing. There were no images of the object in my pictures! Only the treeline! And needless to say, nothing on the news to explain it!

The report described a UFO sighting in San Jose at approximately the same time. I didn't see the object reported in the report, but I think I must have saw our military tracking the UFO. I was driving across the Golden Gate Bridge at 6 pm, on my way into San Francisco for a night class when I just about died. Right before me a black jet fighter crossed very low over the Golden Gate Bridge, during rush hour traffic! I looked around to see if others saw what happened, but eveyone seemed completely unaware. I watched as the jet flew around the Bay, going over to the East Bay then moving South. I was unable to keep track of it after about 10 seconds. I asked if anyone else saw it when I arrived at school. And I watched the news to see if there were any reports. Nothing. I have seen the Blue Angels fly into the Bay many times, so I am familiar with the military aircraft. But, I have never seen anything like this before. This fly over was definately an unusual event. I was very nervous because I thought that maybe a foriegn aircraft may have been in the area, or a pilot had gone crazy and was going to do a fly by for fun.

I am not sure of dates and times. Especially the times. It could be much later. Past midnight. Helicopters have flown over our house at night, on a pretty regular basis, as there are National Guard helicopters at the airport in Decatur. However, over the past few months (I do not know the dates) the house has been shaken quite violently, 3 times. I'd assumed it was helicopters that had, for some reason, started flying lower than usual. (Which I'm assuming is a no-no over residential areas, though I didn't call anyone to complain.) The first extra-loud fly-over (late February or early March) lasted several minutes. The windows rattled for quite some time (more than one but perhaps not 2 full minutes) before the ""helicopter"" was heard. I didn't even think ""helicopter"" until it was over. I cannot actually say that these loud ones are helicopters because of all the extra noise. i.e. I know what a helicopter sounds like as I hear them quite often but the extra noise of the house shaking was so loud that I couldn't swear it was a helicopter that flew over. There have been 2 others, a couple of weeks apart. And the time between when the windows begin to rattle and the source of the vibration is heard is very short. That first one was strange because the house shook and simply kept shaking for no apparent reason. I will definitely pay more attention and record the times, duration and what, if anything, I can see.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,39.8239,-88.4719

On the night in particular we turned off the lights pretending to go to bed but stayed quietly inside observing out the windows. At around 3:30am we began to hear the hum, but then it changed into the sound of a small aircraft. I then observed white lights just above the trees at the side of the house circling over the tree-tops. It made at least 6 circles. We then opened the back door to look at the 'airplane' when it suddenly turned on very bright white lights and slowly moved toward the back behind our home and went down about 2 blocks behind us in the neighborhood. It later appeared to approach our house from the back direction when it suddenly began flashing lights all over the craft and turned slightly to my left and came down at a house on our street about 1 block away. At approximately 5am I had gone to bed but the other 2 witnesses observed the craft right over our house, it was straight above their heads, then it appeared to go straight up until it looked like just another star. It was a black cylinder shape with two round appendeges on either side which appeared to rotate with lights on them. The back end of the cylinder appeared to open and close with the thrumming of the sound and when open the inside could only be described as having 'liquid' light. We got a camcorder the next day, and saw it that night but at a distance and attempted to capture it on video, and though it doesn't look like a normal aircraft the video isn't that definative. I think this is important and needs to be shared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness includes photographs of object, apparently fabricated out of which paper.  It looks somewhat like a BOMARC missile.

Right as I passed the California/Arizona border I noticed what looked to be three glowing lights in the sky, just above the horizon.  I commented about them to my friend because unlike aircraft lights these were glowing an orange color, were much larger, and appeared to be motionless, like they were hanging there.  At that point they did not look like fireballs. I thought they could be tower lights but they were much too high, the wrong colors, and there were no towers around.  We passed behind some hills and lost site of them, and basically forgot about them. About fifteen minutes later we were in an open stretch of the desert when I saw the lights again streaking parallel to the highway but far off and very high.  Rather than lights I could see more clearly there were several huge white-orange fireballs streaking across the sky at high speed, just like meteors but seemingly much bigger.  They were so clear and vivid (no clouds, haze, fog) not to mention bizarre, we pulled off to the road to watch them.  Several would streak across the sky, then another couple more would come, then several more and so on all following the same ""path.""  Again these fireballs were huge.  They streaked from east to west, directly to the glow from the city of Palm Springs (which was hidden behind a mountain).  What was especially memorable was that while some streaked by with meteor-like trails behind them, those already in the distance appeared to hang motionless in the sky (quite possibly because of our angle of vision). The fireballs did not appear to have a manufactured shape, like a saucer, have any visible manufactured elements such as lights, or move in a controlled fashion across multiple planes; they simply streaked. Then it suddenly occurred to me: this must be the Mir re-entering the earth's atmosphere.  I knew the station was supposed to come in over Argentina but no one knew exactly where it would go.  It looked just like a body entering earth's atmosphere and breaking up.  I did question some elements at the time though, because the fireballs seemed very large, much bigger then pieces from the Mir, but then again I don't know anything about the Mir.  The other question my friend and I discussed while watching this display was why it had been going on for a good 25+ minutes.  If the Mir came in I would expect it to be more or less one ""clump"" of little fireballs. In the distance, the exact direction the fireballs were traveling, they seemed to arc down toward the earth, like they were falling gradually.  Then there were large flashes where they appeared to fall.  Seeing the arcs and flashes (which looked like lightening in clouds far off in the distance) I thought the ""Mir"" was breaking up and hitting the earth, although the flashes seemed surprisingly large.  Although it sounds absurd now, I actually thought the LA area was being hit with ""debris."" After the display ended we kept driving west.  I turned on the radio near Palm Springs only to hear that at the Mir re-entry was not due for another 45 minutes and indeed it was coming in over Argentina.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,33.7567,-114.5124

She said she saw it, too, and we watched it until all of the light had dissipated.

A large, bright green ball of light with a green ""tail"" streaked across the sky at a very fast pace, moving downwards at a steep angle. It looked to me as though the ball would crash into the college campus located about 1/4 of a mile east up the road. I asked my co-worker if she had also seen the light, and she said that she had, but only for a few seconds. I kept waiting for the resounding crash that I was sure was coming when the ""craft"" would hit the earth, but I heard nothing. Initially, I thought it may have been a plane that was in some sort of trouble, but then, after I got on the bus, and my co-worker and I talked more about it, I realized that it might not have been just a plane. It made no noise whatsoever, and from where we were standing, it was not that far away that we wouldn't have heard the roar of the engine if it were a plane.

The object which was viewd from underneath, was described as a large solidly outlined diamond shaped object which made a humming sound as it passed over. At each corner, there was a dim white non-blinking light. In the bottom center of the object, was a flat red non-blinking light. Immediately after the sighting, the witness and her husband drove towards the area where the object had disappeared, but nothing was seen. The witness reported feeling nervous and could not sleep well for a couple of days after the incident.

The object seemed large and moved out of the east sky going west into the treeline in front of Spectacle Lake in Bay Mills Township, Michigan. It was incredibly fast. It's not unusual for me to wake up between 3 and 4 in the morning, but I don't usually pull the blinds aside to look out the window. For a few seconds,  I kept looking looking to see if there would be more, but there wasn't, so I lay back down and looked at the clock; it was 3:33 a.m. It was impossible to see where it went down, if it did, because of the treeline across the street in a very rural area. Behind the treeline there is a small lake, Spectacle Lake, and behind the lake there is a very large ridge called Mission Hill. Fireball sightings are common here.

April 10 1998, ~5:30 am (EDT), crystal clear sky, pre-dawn light, only the brightest stars still visible. Cassiopea was still very clearly visible on a pre-dawn blue as it is a bright constellation. Between the North Star and constellation Cassiopea, 2 round objects of apparent size of about a penny at 20 feet 'faded-in' view as if coming from a higher altitude and coming down low enough not to be masked by the blue of the sky. The fade-in effect lasted about a second. It looked like something coming out af a fog. There seemed to be no self illumination. The color of the two UFOs could have been the reflection of the dawn Sun on a dull metallic surface. Hard to tell, apparent size was small. The color did not look even, sort of brighter in the center and brownish orange outside. Again this is more of an impression, as the size was too small for objective description of surface features. The formation appeared unmoving at first, one object was higher in altitude angle by about 2 moon diameters, azimuth North East, moved as a formation about 40 moon diameters east (towards the approaching rising Sun, which at that altitude was probably already up) and faded-out in exactly the same fashion they had come in, although they faded-out while moving rapidly east and were unmoving at fade-in. About 5-7 seconds. I am an experienced observer as an amateur astronomer for 30 years, a pilot for a few years in my teens and a general observer of nature. I don't have perfect vision anymore, I have a slight astigmatism and I was wearing my glasses. I used to be a software engineer (without a finished degree) and I now study Physics at the University of Montreal (back to school, got to get that degree). I am a skeptic. Still am, but I used to feel comfortable. My field now is astronomical optics, and I know what a sun-dog looks like, a comet, Venus, flocks of birds, nebulae, a meteorite, a galaxy, an aurora, a weather baloon, Jupiter, an airplane at high, low and medium altitude in foggy or clear conditions from up there looking down or from down here looking up. In winter and in summer. I've watched satellites go by hundreds of times, once even Soyouz in full sunlight, not penumbra as we are used to see orbiting satellites in, but if full sunlight; it glared many times brighter than Venus, quite a sight for all of 2 or 3 seconds. My point is that I am an observer, a good one, and a skeptic. This week is the beginning of spring and I saw flocks of Canada Geese, big birds, flying high enough for the birds to be the same size as the two UFO's of this report, and they flap, you see more flapping than bird actually, and even at that altitude you can hear them yak like a chikcken coop. The UFOs I saw this morning didn't yak or flap. This I am sure of: it was not two birds or weather ballons, planes or speeding bullets, helicopters, gyrocopters or Venuses. It was not any known human machine or animal. Which leaves unknown natural phenomena, ETs and SDI style research. ETs being the most unlikely of course. This is important: the movements suggested very low mass. An eerie 'easyness' about the movements which does not match the apparent size at all is what is most bizarre. Like inertia is for others. They seemed to go about the sky as droplets of water on a very hot surface. At least that's the best comparaison I can make. If anybody is interested I can make a small movie on the computer, but after the exams, in May.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,45.51408695464828,-73.58579954756006

Although it could have been farther over the water, we couldn't tell.  We watched it for about 5 minutes as it slowly made it's way from south to north.    Then without warning, just seemed to disapear.   To this day we tell people about it and have no doubt in our mind it wasn't a balloon or plane of any kind we've seen before.   Unfortunetly, neither of us had the opportunity to capture the sighting on camera.   Which makes our sighting probably one of thousands you recieve. The 'disc' as mentioned, was grey. It was stationary when we 1st saw it.  Then it slowly moved towards the north until it just disapeared.   The sky was clear that day.  (which is a rarity in Vancouver)  So we know it couldn't have been a plane fading into the clouds. I and the witnesses were just out of high school at that time.

((name deleted)), a (( XX))-year-old, semi-retired building contractor residing in Yuma, Arizona was vacationing at his summer home about 35 miles south of San Felipe on the east coast of Baja California.  This area is about 150 miles south of the U.S. - Mexico border.  While there in early evening of 25 April 2001, he saw a bright object moving steadily south over the Sea of Cortez, about 30 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It was his impression that it was reflecting the sun, which had just set.  He grabbed the binoculars he keeps handy for watching animal life and saw in front of the bright reflection what appeared to be a cylindrical nose.  When asked if he could see any other structural detail, he said: ""Although the object appeared to be reflecting the sun, the sky was too dark to see any other detail.  If it had had wings, I doubt I could have seen them.""  He was quite certain the object was no more than 500 - 1000 feet up, much lower than the aircraft which fly over that area.  He will not estimate his distance from the object.  But at 30 degrees elevation, trigonometry gives distance to the object as twice its height above eye level, or 1000 - 2000 feet.  He heard no sound whatsoever and saw no trail.  Sighting duration from first appearance as the object came out of shadows until it reentered them again on its southward linear path was about two minutes.  Weather was clear, calm, beautiful, and about 70 Fahrenheit. Mr. ((deleted)) was not a UFO believer previously but is unable to relate this object to any previously-seen aerial objects and concludes it was some kind of UFO.

While sitting on the patio with friends, shortly after sunset I looked directly overhead to view the sun shining on the high, wispy clouds. At the same moment, I saw what at first appeared to be a fast-moving jet moving from NNW to SSE. Because of my location, I could only view about as much of the sky as the equivalent of twice the width of my hand held at arm's length. The object crossed this section of the sky in less than two seconds (possibly as quickly as one second), only long enough for me to barely open my mouth to draw attention to the others sitting with me, but not long enough for me to utter a word. What surprised me about the object was that it was very dark compared to other jets in the air that evening (dark grey) and the way the ""wings"" met at a right angle, giving the appearance of a carpenter's square flying through the air. There was no fuselage visible. I thought it might be a very large, very fast jet flying at very high altitude or a smaller, slower jet at lower altitude. I observed other jets crossing the sky within the following quarter-hour and, even though some were quite some distance away (i.e. viewed at 45% from the horizon or less), I could clearly make out their fuselages in all cases, they were much lighter in colour than what I had observed earlier, their wings did not have the distinctive right-angled proportions or even width from fuselage to tip, and they travelled at much slower apparent speeds. There was no sound from the object (not necessarily surprising if it were in fact a very high aircraft), although I could hear most of the other aircraft I observed that night, even the high, distant ones. Anyway, it made me curious, and I've been closely watching a lot of aircraft for the past few days and nothing I've seen in the air even closely resembles what flew over on Sunday night. The object's flight path struck me as rather strange, as most commercial aircraft fly either more-or-less on east-west lines in this part of the country or northeast to southwest if they're overseas flights. I've never seen anything flying on so nearly a north-south axis (although this might be a good route for commercial flights from Russia or military craft returning from the far north).",2000-12-02T00:00:00,52.1078373650108,-106.66923239740821

There were 2 more lights side by side near the center and front within the triangle shape. It flew in northwest direction I was laying out on my sundeck looking at the stars. It was just after midnight and the sky was mostly clear with some high cirrus. As I looked up I saw what I thought was a satellite, except it seemed to be moving almost twice as fast as the average satellite. It only took a fraction of a second for me to realize that there was more than one point of light moving across the sky (as described above). The three points of light that made up the main outline of the triangle were a dull reddish-orange colour and about the same size as most of the smaller stars that make up the night sky. The two other lights that could be seen from within the triangle were a white light but were no larger and only slightly more intense than the outer lights. These two lights were quite close together and located on either side of a central axis extending from a halfway point  at the base to the apex and closer to the front of the craft. I could not see any of the usual running lights associated with typical aircraft ie. (port and starboard lights and the bright pulsing  central light).  As it moved across the sky in a southeast to northwest direction it seemed to me that there was no substance to this shape, as if it were held together by strands of wire, with the leading light pulling the others in tow.  The colour within the triangle was exactly the colour of the night sky, and there was no dark siloette, and no reflected light.  It did make a slight sound as it passed overhead but, the sound was not far behind which seemed odd considering the speed it seemed to be travelling at. It was not as loud or delayed as even the highest jetliners that fly over.  The best way to describe the size would be to say that across the base of the triangle it would measure about the length of an average human thumb extended to arms length, with the two sides being slightly longer than the base.

It was 9:50pm.  As I reached the area adjacent to West Seattle, I spotted a light in the sky, which at first I took for an aircraft inbound to Boeing Field or Seatac Intl. Airport.  However, after less than a minute, I looked up again and noticed that the light had not moved and that I, rather, was moving toward this light which hovered midair above the neighborhood on the East side of the highway, approximately 70 to 100 feet up.  As I drove past the object, I looked at it through my sunroof and wondered if it was a helicopter.  I noticed the counter-clockwise cycling strobes of white lights tracing the pattern of a diamond under the craft while two or more other white lights glowed without flashing.  Moments later, I saw a second identical object on the same side of the highway less than 200 feet North of the original one.  As I scanned the skyline, I realized that two more identical stationary craft were hovering above the downtown area at approximately the same height.  After an accidental detour due to the distraction, at the James Avenue exit, I returned to the highway and proceeded toward the University District where I saw two more on my right (East) and another on my left which was moving.  I watched the moving object, which passed above me NW to SE about 100 feet up.  After it passed out of my field of vision, I watched another hovering, stationary craft with bright blue and red blinking lights remeniscent of a police light bar.

He said that he saw one ""circle a star and then take off"". The objects seemed to hover at one point(near a plant called UTDC-paint trains etc) then moving away at high speeds(together).They seemed to be diamond shape from what we could tell in the darkness, and in the centre of the bottom was a light thats' color is hard to describe.

When it was a more or less directly over us it had changed direction by about a full 90 degrees. That was what surprised us.

I have never reported anything of such before, mainly because I do my own research, but this needed to be heard. Two of us were in a car driving up a road from where I live, and we saw what first appeared to be a helicopter flying very low, the person with me even remarked that it was in fact one, but it was only a few feet above the trees, no more and no less. The altitude of this craft was amazingly low, and when I finally caught it with my own eyes, it had a triangular shape to it I could not find any evidence of blades on the craft. Now, of the one thing I am certain...it was not any type of helicopter mainly for two reasons. First, it made no sound, and second there would be some type of physical activity in that general area of the craft for it being that low in altitude. (Mainly, the wind velocity causing branches to sway, etc...) After seeing the craft, it seemed to have had a 'sense' of something and it finally darted back behind the trees (Tall pines). It did not take us more than 3 seconds to drive to where we could see behind the trees and into full sky view where any normal object would clearly be in view. It was gone...there was nothing. From going back to the 'site' I have not found anything, all I know is that I consider this one of the greatest sightings I have seen myself in quite a while. Certainly, I have not witnessed one that close. Broad daylight made it that much more spectacular. There was not a cloud in the sky, and you could see the metallic sheen of the craft. It truly was fascinating...And my eyes will be open to maybe capturing the image of it soon, if in fact it does show again.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,33.96188745901639,-84.51021319672131

Many years ago I had some buddies show me some video tape of this thing they call THE METHOD..  It was a way to catch UFO on video or on film..  If you recall, When there is a eclips of the sun.. THere are many reports of sighting especially in souther America.. This was the principle of my friends way of spotting UFOs in the sky..  You stand in the shadow of a roof or building not looking derectly at the sun but around the corona of it.   You will obiviously see insects flying by but if you focus your eyes way up.. at about the hight of a commercial jet, there are things you can only see when they are lit up by a reflection of the sun..  I have been a witness to this many times..  Seeing pear necklace shaped objectes, chess piece objects and sphere shaped objects..  One time I saw this object that look as if it was spining. After it was way past the brightness of the sun I tracked it moving across the San Fernando Valley.  it was the same color of the sky, and if i didnt spot its reflection, ther would be no way of seeing it with the naked eye..  I have shared this method with many friends..  I am not the originator of this principle, and do not want to be sued by who ever discovered it..  So, the other night I was on the balcony of my apartment building..  It was late at night, about midnight..  There was a marine layer coming it from the south, and a fog of some sort coming from the north..  The night sky was not that clear above but getting overcast..  You could see some stars above but not much on either side of the sky.. I was only out there a min when I saw what seemed like when you see a grocery bag in the sky when there is a wind kicking up, but it was not windy..  It was the same color of the cloudy sky on both sides of the sky.. It made no sound..  And it traveled from east to west across the sky..  Very low.  Aout 500 feet I would say..  I thought it might be a balloon from a car dealership around here, but it was no! t perfec tly round like a balloon..  I cannot say how big it was,  Maybe the size of a small car.. or as large as a 747 jet..  It was spinning and seemed to cloak itself with it seroudings..  I was only able to see it when it when though the clear area of the sky, and I was able to track it, but then it stopped..  I got very scared and went inside..  After that I herd a helecopter go by in the same derection..  Has there been any new sevalance craft that the US, or and other countries might be looking at us??  I would think, or has this been something of a UFO origen??  I do not do drugs or drink..  I am very interested in finding more info about this type of craft, that can acually cloak itself with its surrondings..

While we were filming the moon, I saw a large dull red object with a tail go through the sky. It appeared to fall from the moon, then it did a turn and headed in a southerly direction .  As much as we tried to capture it on film we didn't, by the time my husband was pointing the camera in the right direction it was gone. Some strange things happened during this time frame.  All  of the neighborhood dogs were barking and even the two cows that live next door were ""mooing"". When we re-wound the tape to see if we caught the object that I saw, a low range, pulsating noise came through on the video that we did NOT hear audibly while filming. It went from soft to  very load and appeared as if it was coming towards us then it sounded as though it  went right through us!  It got very soft going away from us , then it disappeared. It was the oddest noise, kind of like something pulsating under water with a slight"" swishing in water"" sound too.  My husband said that it sounded like an ultrasound of an unborn baby, you know that swishing pulsing muffled sound. Anyway, the dogs and the cows all calmed down  right after this occurrence as well. My husband and I looked at one another and said, ""what the heck was that?"" and we both asked each other,"" did you hear that at all while we were filming"" ? My husband thought that something was wrong with the camera, so we filmed more stuff and it worked beautifully. Neither one of us heard anything except the normal background noises, you know, cars and of course the dogs and the cows.  We live out in a rural area on a one acre parcel. Most of the local houses are on acreage and the dogs don't bark unless someone or something has caught their attention. As for the cows, they  don't make any noise at night ever, that we can remember.  We are wondering if this  was a sound that we could NOT hear but the animals were hearing !  The animals all appeared agitated as well as uneasy.  FYI, we live in an area a little east of Mc Cord Air force base and Fort Lewis army base.

I am familiar with most of the types of planes, helicopters,  and dirigibles that fly in and around this area. The object I saw on this particular day was a silver color that was definitely more intense than any of the planes I usually see. The object was circular in shape and had no visible wings. Because I was in a moving vehicle travelling at a speed of 45 miles per hour, I could not estimate the speed of the object as it moved in an easterly direction. I can only guess its size and distance from me as 1 to 2 miles  and the approximate size of a quarter held at arms length. I attempted to pull off the roadway to get a better visual and maybe a still photo, but as I slowed down the object accelerated upward at a tremendous speed and was gone in an instant. The weather was sunny and the sky was exceptionally clear this day with few clouds. The reason that this is so notable is because this area is usually shrouded in cloud coverage known as the Great Lakes Effect, relative to the clouds that form over the Great Lakes Region and move in a southeasterly direction through Ohio and Pennsylvania.

There was only the one object and the sky was partially obscured by a layer of cirrostratus cloud.  She called to me and I went out to look at the sky.  The object was gone by this time but I did note the cloud cover and that I was able to see a slightly fuller than crescent moon and some brighter stars through the thin cloud cover.  She said there was no trail behind the object and it didn't look like a fireball.  My mother is a retired store manager and I am a  librarian.  She informed me the following day that the new space station was apparently visible in the sky during the time she saw the object.  This brings up many questions. It moved from the NW horizon to the SE in under 2 seconds.  If it indeed was the space station she saw, is it capable of such speed?  Is it tumbling which would cause it to reflect the sun's light and then seem to disappear?   Is it's orbit in a NW to SE direction?   My mother feels that is what she saw--the new space station.  But I am not so sure.  About 2-3 minutes before she saw the object the was a loud rumble like a sonic boom.  It definitely was not thunder; the sky was basically clear and here on the west coast of British Columbia we get few thunderstorms mainly from April to early September.

I was sitting at my computer looking out my window at the University of Guelph looking West. I watched as a craft flew over the residence bound West South West. The craft made no sound and proceded on a straight course at roughly 200 knots. The craft was triangular shaped with a bright circular light at each corner. No other lights were visible and the craft itself was dark (the triangular shape is a guess based on the position of the lights). Another interesting point is that the aircraft pattern to land at YYZ (Pearson International Airport) is ENE so this aircraft was headed against the commercial air traffic (I am an amatuer pilot).,2000-12-02T00:00:00,43.54310637254902,-80.2533625

It remained visible in the same part of the sky for approximately half an hour, at which time the original observer left.  Two other witnesses - family members - saw the unusual motion of the first object. Notes on an unusual occurrence in the night sky 16-17 Jun 1999. I stepped onto the patio at the back of the house for a smoke and was admiring the display of stars.  The sky was very clear ; it is often cloud covered to some degree here in Courtenay on Vancouver Island. I located Ursa Major to find Polaris, as I normally do, and found it with no problem.  I used the memory trick;d been taught in Navigator;s school; and followed the arc of the Big Dipper;s ;handle&#8221; to Arcturus then tried to &#8220;speed on to Spica&#8221; but wasn&#8217;t so sure it was visible.  A bright reddish planet was in the western sky &#8211; I took it to be Mars, but it may have been Venus. Turning counterclockwise towards the south and then continuing to approximately south east, I spotted a fast moving object apparently at great altitude.  I immediately thought &#8220;satellite&#8221; and watched as it proceeded from southeast to northwest.  The object was marginally brighter than the stars around it and about the same diameter.  As I watched the &#8220;satellite&#8221; it stopped and began a counterclockwise rotation describing a circle perhaps the size of the tip of my finger held at arm&#8217;s length.  It turned for about 3/4s of a circle, stopped and reversed direction &#8211; moving clockwise for about half a circle. Thoroughly  fascinated,  I wanted to get some parametric data on the object&#8217;s location.  I extended my right arm fully with my thumb and little finger spread as close to a straight line as I could get them.   To the left of the curious object was a star noticeably brighter than most of the others around it.  With my left eye closed and my thumb just touching the bright star the object was almost exactly a splayed hand spread away from, and in line with, the bright star.  To fix the azimuth I dropped my arm to about 45 degrees and noticed that with my thumb on the vertical middle member of the house&#8217;s upstairs window my hand filled most of the gap between the house and a small tree in the neighbor&#8217;s yard.  I noted where I was on the patio using the BBQ and a separation line in the concrete as references. I was approximately one pace away from the leg (on my left) on the back of the BBQ about a foot west from the line on the concrete.  I planned to come back later and attempt to get fairly accurate azimuth.  For the time being I estimated it to be about 130 degrees true with reference to Polaris.  Raising my arm back to the object I estimated its elevation at about 70 degrees (from the horizontal) . Trying to get more detail on the object I looked a few degrees to the right of it to use my peripheral vision.  Another quite faint object, reddish in color was moving somewhat erratically side to side below and slightly to the left of my first object.  It was proceeding towards the first object.  The first object appeared to be moving away from me, that is almost straight up, and it was getting dimmer.  I checked my watch and noted the time was 23:40 (Pacific Daylight Time).  When I looked back up I thought I saw faint reddish beams of light flash between the two objects.  They occurred rapidly &#8211; there were perhaps 3 flashes.  Both objects continued to move away from me during the &#8220;exchange&#8221; for lack of a better word.  I stuck my head in the door and asked for somebody with good eyes to come have a look at something interesting. The family was watching a video at the time.  My wife joined me on patio and I used the bright star as a reference point to steer her line of sight toward the objects.  She saw the first one that again stopped and dipsy-doodled around some more.  It did not move far, but at that distance it must have had incredible acceleration. She watched for a while and commented on its unusual motion. The second object was all but invisible at this point.  I thought I perceived a vary faint golden ring, or halo,  flash around the first object a few times.  I again tried to use peripheral vision the get a better look, but it was so faint I thought I may have imagined it.  I saw this perhaps half a dozen times.  I mentioned it to her, but she did not seem to see it.  The diameter of the flash would be about the size of a looney (Canadian one dollar coin) held at arms length.  I thought maybe something was causing a reflection from my eyeglasses &#8211; so I moved my head around slightly &#8211; looking at stars near the object- but the only place the halo occurred was around the object, centered on it. My wife went back in the house and a few moments later I saw a meteorite sparkle from east to west overhead then wink out.  I was getting a little cold, so I went to get a jacket.  Shortly afterwards I saw an aircraft&#8217;s red strobe and saw the red and green nav lights as it winged from south to northwest and I heard the jet engines,  faintly but clearly, as it passed to the west of me.  I noticed it was about 3 minutes after midnight.  Our eldest daughter came out and I located the object for her &#8211; she was not sure she was looking at the right thing.  The object was now a little fainter than the surrounding stars and seemed to be continuing to move vertically away from us.  It jinked a little but not as much as before.  My neck was sore by now so I went in and scribbled a few notes to later record the event in detail.  This is the account of what we saw.  I have never seen such an amazing thing in the skies before. I am a 45 year old man still actively serving in the Canadian airforce as an Avionics technician with 29 years military service, holding the rank of Sergeant.  I got interested in astronomy &#8211; primarily identifying constellations - while undergoing Air Navigator training in 1977.  I did not complete the Nav course, but using the stars as navigation aids is an interest I&#8217;ve kept ever since.  I have the equivalent of a college diploma as an Electronics Engineering Technician.  I have been married to my original lovely wife for 23 years.  We have 2 daughters, 20 and 17, and share our home with Ollie the bone-head dog.  I have spent most of my career working on the flight line on fighter aircraft (CF-104s, CF-5s and CF-18s).  I was a Quality Assurance Rep at a defence contractor&#8217;s plant for 5 years and have worked at 19 Wing Comox as the Avionics Shop supervisor for 4 and a half years.  I am a computer software power-user (my 4 Gig hard drive is full) and an avid flight simulator pilot.  I have about 20 hours back-seat time in CF-18 Hornets.  I have instructed courses in the military on Theory of Flight, Inertial navigation and Automatic Flight Controls .  I received two Suggestion Awards for designing/building technical improvements to the CF-18 and its ground Test Equipment. 1 I later measured the distance from my eye to my spread hand to be about 2 ft 3 inches (or about 70.3 cm).   My spread hand from thumb to tip of little finger is 9 inches.  Using this data it should be possible to compute the apparent distance of the object from the bright star. 2 I later approximated this angle and used a protractor to arrive at the 70 degrees elevation.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,49.662864583333324,-125.000978125

Then went over the cabin anout 12-15 feet above.   They were about 9 inches in size and were pulsating inside.   We could see that it appeared they were exhausting something.  This lasted approximately 25 minutes and we saw about 75 of them.   I might add that we had stormy weather that afternoon.. However it wasn't  storming at this time ((NUFORC Note:  Report from 1st witness.  We spoke with these witnesses on several occasions, and they seemed quite credible.  Their descriptions of the events did not vary between the various accounts.  PD))",2000-12-02T00:00:00,49.75730000000001,-94.3427

"Dim, fast-moving, rapidly-changing formation startles Bay Area satellite observer.",Oakland,CA,2001-05-06T21:09:00,formation,10 seconds,"Occurred : 5/6/2001 21:09  (Entered as : 05/06/01 21:09) Reported: 5/7/2001 01:34 Posted: 8/5/2001 Location: Oakland, CA Shape: Formation Duration:10 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/017/S17537.html,"Dim, fast-moving, rapidly-changing formation startles Bay Area satellite observer. At 9:09 p.m. PDT May 6, 2001 during late twilight, I was standing on the roof of my apartment building concentrating on an area of the sky just south of the constellation Leo awaiting the appearance of a satellite (Cosmos 1943 Rocket, U.S. Spacecom number 19120), which was scheduled to (and did) appear in this area at 9:11 p.m. (Observation of low Earth orbit satellites is an occasional pasttime of mine; I use a satellite tracking program to predict visible satellite passes.) About 5-degrees south of the star Regulus (or at about 207-degrees true, 55-degrees elevation), my attention was diverted by a dim formation of what I think was five points of white (or starlight-like) light moving east to west. I estimate the brightness of each light to be about magnitude 3.0, only slightly brighter than the dimmest stars visible in our local sky at the time. Apparent size of the formation was approximately 1/2-degree, or the size of the full moon. The shape of the formation was initially diamond-shaped but did not remain constant -- the distances between the lights changed rapidly and the overall shape changed to more of a square or trapezoidal shape. There seemed to be a fifth light which may have been ziz-zagging behind the other four. As I stepped out from behind the wall I was using to block nearby streetlights, the lights quickly pulled into line with each other, and distictly resembled a V-formation as viewed from behind and slightly below (i.e. a nearly-horizontal ""V""). The formation faded in the southwest sky (about 240-degrees true) at an elevation of about 30 degrees, appearing to recede into the distance. The formation covered about 30 degrees of the sky in about ten seconds and traversed an arc, the formation's bearing smoothly shifing from west to southwest. (I consulted sky maps after the fact for azimuth/elevation estimates.) The dimness of the objects, combined with their speed and my own perplexity while observing them, make exact recollection of their maneuvers imprecise. During the observation! , I was preoccupied with comprehending what I was seeing. My first thought was high-altitude aircraft or missiles, but the lights' maneuverability ruled that out. About midway through the observation, I thought that the lights took on a slightly ruddy color, and I considered the fact that I was seeing a formation of birds reflecting the orange sodium vapor streetights of the city. I tried to make out flapping wings or some type of form but could not -- to move that quickly across the sky and relative to one another, birds would have to be fairly low and, given the brightness of the sky (residual twilight, urban light pollution and full moon), I should have been able to make out silhouettes. I am a radio broadcast engineer by trade with a lifelong interest in science and astronomy. I have seen many things in the sky (yes, I've even seen the insect-eating UFOs in Excalibur's spotlight in Vegas), but nothing I could not identify. I don't know what I saw tonight, but that may be due to the short observation time and faintness of the objects. I am submitting this report in the event that it corroborates other reports. ((NUFORC Note:  I believe we spoke briefly with this witness.  We found him to be highly credible, as his written report seems to suggest, as well.
