I looked up, saw some lights, it was a craft of some kind, so I quickly thought to myself, then grabbed my camcorder that happened to be on my front seat,inside the truck. From this point on I have on video, its not the best, I tried to zoom in and out, and the camera didnt like that in darkness. But it will be worth the wait, if I am still alive. :-)  Its 8pm, and total darkness, a couple of street lights in yellow, the moon has not come up yet, when it does its a full moon. I look and see this craft has 3 lights, one in the center flashing, its a triangle shape and coming towards me over the homes, I follow it with the camera until it gets to the end of the street. Once it got to the end, I noticed at the end of the street another of its kind was coming the opposite way traveling towards us, the two met at the end of the street.  This other craft was flashing a white light and had stationary lights surrounding it just like the one I saw up close. I got into my truck to go look for them, but they had gone, so I thought. I took a left onto the other road, and shortly turned back. As I turned right back onto my street, I looked over to the left, and above the old town pool and park area, I saw both both of them, hovering, semi, almost fully cloked. I dont know how to spell cloked term from Star Trek so I am typing ""cloked"". Hopefully someone can let me know the correct spelling.  As they were hovering the other caught my eye, the other wasnt all the way cloked, its hard to explain, but to the right of the craft, it was lit up, just a little, its lights were lower, then stronger, it was doing something while the other stayed stationary to its left. finally the light went out, and both of them were straight ahead looking at me, cloked, each of the craft had one little light at each end, as if it was  a distant star far off, the lights were on each side, with a certain distance apart, the other craft had the same lights barely visable, only this second craft hovered just a little distance from the other.  It getting real cold, so I talked out loud to these things, because at this point I am wondering if I made this whole thing up in my head!, as I am leaving, the one on the left crossed over to the right, then towards me, as I turn around and go towards my truck, it starts to follow on my right and contunes to move as I am walking, I get inside my truck as it leaves, still cloked.  I have to record this for myself, but I should describe what I saw, because you cant see the video yet. This craft that I filmed was a smaller craft, a little smaller than a small airplane, it had three lights, one in the center, the 4th, was flashing also a white light, and it seemed, well once you see the video, it seemed that the flashing light was also being beamed out towards the other side. The craft went at a good pace, it traveled with one light as a leading part of the craft while the other two lights were on the sides. There was no sound, I was ruffly 35 yards away. Just across the street. In the video, it goes behind telephone poles, wires from cable and phone lines. This craft then met up with another that was coming from the opposite side towards it. I hope this was clear, any other info I can add if you need.  Once I copyright the video, you will see exactly what I saw. Hopefully someone wont come and kill me for the tape in the meantime.

We had just returned home from the grocery store, and were unloading groceries out of the car, and my mother was pointing to the visible sattelite in the sky with her cane.  A triangle shaped craft was spotted by the three of us flying directly over our heads, approximately 100 feet above the palm trees by my driveway.  It appeared to be black, but very visible to the naked eye.  We saw what looked like 7 small circles on the bottom of this craft, one at the point, and three on each side.  This craft was so low, that we could make out the outer rings around these disks, which were concave in shape.  It flew directly over the top of us, not very fast, but not slow either.  It continued on for about 500 feet, ascended, and disappeared right in front of our eyes.  The thing that really struck us was three things....first of all, there were no lights of ANY kind on this craft, but we  could see it clearly, as if the city lights reflected off the bottom, kind of luminescent.  The second is that for it flying so low, there was not a single air current in its wake in the tops of the palm trees, like a copter or plane would generate.  Lastly, but most importantly, it made ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND!  No engine noise, no wind, nothing.  What is really strange is that we live literally in the Marine Corp Air Staion's back yard...something flying as low as this craft was would never be seen on their radar. We see military and civilian crafts all day and night, because we also live right next to the airport.

The object streaked down slowly in similar fashion to flares I've seen in the northern Arizona desert, although it did not appear to be burning up like a fireball which eminates and emits an aural haze, it looked more uniform like a meteorite with a tail. The object was observed from 0-1 seconds for about 10 degrees when it disappeared for 2 seconds and reappeared at 3-6 seconds to the treetop horizon. I had a very good view of the object because I was obseving that exact part of the beautiful, clear evening sky at the time it appeared directly in my line of vision. The best way that I can describe the way in which it traveled was that it appeared to me as though it had been dropped. It's brightness was that of Jupiter, and it did not seem as though it burned up before it impacted or landed roughly 10 miles away. It's behavior seemed so unusual to us that we all immediately acknowledged it and joked that the aliens were landing in Leeds, Alabama.  We are MJ- age 30, April- 24, Brandi- 20, Crystal- 18, co-workers who had stopped at April's house after work to visit, and we observed the object as we were leaving to take everyone home.

I looked back, the two lights now vertical from one another (one on top of the other with a space in between of darkness) as it the object went straight up in the air. The radio began to crackle at this time. This was about 8 minutes into the viewing. We took a right and were in downtown New Glasgow and then took another right and were on the road heading towards the power station in Trenton. This is about 10 minutes after we first saw the object, we both looked to our right in the sky and the object was now visible in the sky at a quite low altitude. Once again the blueish white lights were flashing offset they were horizontal from one another again with the shape in the middle not visible. As we drove down this road both me and the passenger rolled down our windows and there was no noise whatsoever. The object slowed to a halt, it flipped vertically so the lights were now one on top of one another and for the first time we saw a very smooth, grayscale shape in the middle not very wide at all, like a dumbbell. The object the fly away very quickly and that was the last we saw of it. The viewing ended at about 10:23 PM EST.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

(Looking towards Acton)  Another call came in from a fellow who again witnessed something that looked out of place in the sky and he also shot some footage of what he witnessed. The man and his wife had some family members over to their home. The witness had been telling his sisters boyfriend about what they saw on April 24, 2004. The witnesses sisters boyfriend looked out the window and commented, ""it wouldn't be the light on the tower over there?""  The witness said, what tower !  The witness looked out the window and there again was something flying around the sky. There is no tower in the area where the sisters boyfriend was pointing out.  This time the witness grabbed his video camera and started to take some footage. Now he admits that he is a ammeter photographer and just doing his best to get a shot of what they were observing in the sky. With the excitement of seeing something strange he admits there is shake when viewing the footage, but all of the family members who watched the film says it is very interesting to watch and the fellow still gets the shot.  There was no multiple lights seen this time, only one object that shoots off at a fast rate of speed across the sky. The man who is filming this object, puts the camera down for a brief second as he was discussing what he was seeing with his sisters boyfriend. When he looked up again, the light/object was back where it originally was, or when the witness first saw it. Like the man said, it seemed impossible for something to move so quickly across the sky and return to the  spot from where it came from.  When viewing the tape back at a slow speed the fellow says you can almost see the outline of the thing, the classic saucer shaped craft. Also still viewing the tape on the slow speed they tell me you can see a burst of  color, purple pinkish.  We will see what the investigator who will be visiting the witnesses comes up with.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  One thing I would like to add. It was quick thinking that the witness thought to grab his video camera. I would suggest that folks keep a camera of some sort with them, or close by. One never knows when something like this will happen to them.

I was smoking a cigarette in the yard of my friends bar. I just got there and hadnt had a drink yet. I didnt know anyone else back there so i just smoked & looked up at the sky. Directly under the moon i spotted an object flying in my direction. The sky was completely clear and i thought it was a plane so i watched. As it came closer i noticed it was dark orange and sphere shaped. I figured that it was a light from the plane. It was at a distance & i had no reason to suspect otherwise. Then all of a sudden the sphere shape stretched out from the right side into a shape i can best describe as an oval. At this point i thought to myself, ""O.k, it's an orange kite or something."" Just as fast as i uttered that phrase in my mind, it returned to sphere shape. As it flew closer i realized that this thing was going much faster than a plane or anything i could concieve it to be. As it was coming closer & passing over me, i could clearly see a metallic shape circling around the sphere at an extremely fast pace, much faster than the sphere itself was moving. I couldnt tell the shape of it, but due to the clear sky & the bright moon, it stood out. The metallic object seemed to be circling the direct center of the sphere. This thing was going so fast i couldnt believe what i was watching. I tapped the guy next to me and said ""hey, what the #@&%! is that?"" By the time we both looked up this thing was pretty far already. He replied that it could be a satellite (he hadnt been watching it before hand like myself) but as we watched it, it stopped going in a straight direction and raised in altitude on an upward slant as if headed toward space. The object seemed to disapear. I looked around hoping someone else had been looking up, but the 8 or so people there were engaged in conversations with eachother. The guy who i pointed it out to did not seemed phased & just walked back in the bar. I dialed the operator on my cell phone ( i didnt know what else to do) & asked if anyone else called in a sighting of an ! unidentified object over east Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He laughed,so i hung up. Orange sphere flying at an extremely fast speed, metallic object circling around it at an even faster pace. This, i will never forget. Ive never experienced any thing like this, i know what i saw because it was a perfectly clear night, and i will continue from here on forth to search the internet for another reporting of this sighting.

As it passed over head and just in front of us we saw 3 white lights and one flashing light that made up this perfect triangle shape.  There was no noise and the craft glided across the sky.  The strange thing about it was you couldn’t see the body of the craft like when an airplane flies by; it was as if you could see through it.  It flew off and accelerated towards the north, north east.  I’m a pilot myself and can identify almost any civilian and military aircraft by shape and by sound.

It had three distinct circular lights on the bottom of the craft which was flat. The craft was black in color. I could not say for sure how high up this thing was but If it would have been a jet It would have shook the place at that altitude. I remember hearing a lot of traffic (tractor trailers) on the interstate that were heading south. This thing whatever it was, I believe was following trucks on the interstate for some reason. Maybe Military? Transport of nuclear waste? After I spotted it I yelled at everyone to come outside and look and by that time it had dissapeared into the clouds. This thing had no flashing lights on it anywhere. Just the three dimmly lit lights on the bottom. I saw two or three aircraft in the area to the south but I never saw the craft again.

It was only visible for about 15 seconds due to the cover of the clouds. I dont think this was a little green man ship.

I stopped to stretch and look at the stars sometime between 3:00 and 3:30 a.m. I believe. I was looking out toward the west (slightly south) above the ocean as we were staying in Lahaina. Suddenly one star flared brightly and decended. If I put my hand about a foot in front of my face and spread my index and thumb fingers apart I'd say the object fell down about 4 1/2 inches. It then turned toward the left. The turn was a curved (not sharp) 90 degree turn. Also, the speed of both the fall and the turn was fairly constant. It was brightest at the bottom of the fall and during the turn. It then ascended straight up again and slowly faded in brightness to about the size of a star or satellite. It then proceeded on a straight course over my head and past the hotel behind me as if it were a normal satellite. While it passed over head I observed only a straight course with no turns and the speed stayed fairly constant.  I've read other reports and comments by investigators about ""iridium"" satellite flashes. I'd like to know exactly what those are in case that might be it. However, from my vantage point it clearly looked as if it ""fell"" into the atmosphere, veared off to the left, and then rose out of the atmosphere. I don't know of any commercial aircraft or even space craft that can currently do that, but wouldn't be surprised to know that our military might have something like that.

Baker. in the east. Observed dark cloud shaped like an arm reaching down towards Burke Mountain. Just out of curiosity I took a look at it through my binoculars, saw what appeared to be a grey saucer shaped object just below the end of the arm, it was kind of hazy in that area and I thought at first it was just a funny shaped cloud. Kept watching and the arm shaped cloud was moving off to the south east quite rapidly but the saucer shaped object stayed stationary.  Object was definitely saucer shaped with a dome on top an another on the bottom. I had my camera sitting on my desk so I managed to take 3 shots through the binoculars, don't know if they will show up due to the low light conditions, 30 th. of a sec. 100 ASA film. When I looked through the binoculars again object had disappeared. Object was not visible to the naked eye, just through the glasses When I got the film developed the first two shots, which should have showed the saucer were completely wiped off the film (clear) and they were located right in the middle of the film, the 3rd. frame appears to show the edge of the saucer as it took off.

(In-flight sighting), KS Shape: Unknown Duration:15 - 20 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/035/S35758.html,"Huge Unknown Phenomenon (Distant Stobe Effects) Seen From Airplane Window on Cross-Country Flight I must admit, I have been curious about UFO phenomenon since a very young age.  I am 31 as of this writing.  Indeed, I had always wanted to see something, but never had.  I figured that I was just one of the ""unlucky ones"".  Perhaps there wasn't anything to see anyway.  I was raised as a Roman Catholic but have never held tightly to those beliefs as I grew older, allthough I do not discount all the ideas embodied therein.  I have never had a truly close relationship with my father, however, if there was one thing he has given me, it is a healthy respect, and dare I say, reverence for the truth.  I will also plainly admit that I have engaged on more than one occasion in the use of various mind altering substances.  My primary purpose being that of self discovery.  Having said that, I was not under the influence of any substance at the time of this sighting.  Furthermore, I do not suffer from what might be called ""flashbacks"".  Unfortunetly, I do not have a doctor's not to prove this.  Hopefuly this rambling prologue will make sense as I continue.  I feel it will provide necessary insight into my mindset and my validity as a witness.  I can only recount my experiences as truthfuly as I can.  And now my testimony:  As mentioned above, I've always been fascinated by UFO's.  And it were these thoughts that crossed my mind while I was flying back to Washington D.C. from Denver, Colorado.  I figured ""What better vantage point than above the clouds to see something.""  It was to my great pleasure that I ended up with a window seat for my return leg.  I was transfixed by the view out the window for almost the entire flight.  About half an hour into the flight, I figured I'd try a little experiment.  You could call it ""sending up a mental flare"".  If there was really anything out I figure I'd try to communicate, to use the term very loosely, with it.  Basically, all this consisted of was me projecting my thoughts into the vast open sky in front of me.  ""Show me you're out there.  Do something!""  As I recall we were travelling between 35 and 40 thousand feet (as noted on that tiny tv on the back of the seat in front of me).  I seem to remember we were travelling at slightly over 500 mph.  Apparently we had a good tail wind.  In retrospect, I should have been more ""scientific"" in noting the exact altitude, time, and location, but in all actuality, I wasn't expecting to see anything.  It was just starting to get dark, kind of grey-pale blue outside but still plenty of light.  My flight left at ~ 3:30 PM Denver time, and the incident occurred about 45 minutes into the flight.  From my view out the window, I could tell we were well above the main cloud deck.  Looking straight down, you could not really see the ground except only ocassionaly.  We weren't above storm clouds per se, they were the more whispy stratus type. The horizon line, however, was marked by a line of cumulonimbus (?) exteneding from left to right across the horizon with the some large gaps between the tops of them.  They got fatter towards their base were they merged with the cloud deck.  I could see some cloud to cloud lightning off to the left of my field of view.  You couldn't see the source, you would just see the cloud light up from the inside.  This activity wasn't very intense, was rather sporatic, and produced a diffuse lighting effect on the cloud.  It was approximately 10 - 15 minutes after my ""message"" that I noticed that a very bright red-blue strobe began flashing out on the horizon.  It was really at the far edge of my visability.  Not that it was hard to see, more that it was the furthest thing I could see.  It appeared to be on the horizon.  For a while, I thought it must be the strobe light from another airplane.  Its pulsating was more or less regular, but the object remained motionless on the horizon for quite some time.  It would flash deep red at first, quickly followed by secondary and tertiary strobes with a more blue or darker colored tint.  The secondary flashes occurred (from what I could tell) in the same place as the primary strobe.  Its size was approximately 2-3 times Venus (?).  Needless to say, I was quite intrigued by this development.  The strobe seemed really bright for being so far away. (orders of magnitiude brighter than the cloud lightning; clear and defined).  I finally decided it couldn't be written off as lightning because it was in the open and not behind any cloud, besides the fact that it was more a point of light than anything else.  I watched this remain more or less motionless for some time, maybe 5 to 10 minutes.  I can't say it was completely motionless as I would look back inside the cabin ocassionaly to gauge the reaction of the other passangers.  No one seemed to notice.  After a while I started to think ""Is this it? Is this all I'm gonna get?""  So I issued another communication: ""Your going to have to do better than that!""  I looked inside the cabin, back out, back in, out again.  The strobe was still there.  I was flabbergasted.  Every time I looked, it was still there.  Eventaully, the strobe moved slightly to the right of my field of vision, almost going behind a large cloud.  I figured ""Ah-ha, it must be another plane.""  But it never went BEHIND the cloud.  Or in front of it for that matter.  It never came closer or moved further away.  It just kind of stood there on the edge of the cloud, flashing every 10 - 15 seconds.  At this point I had been watching it on and off for what felt like quite a while.  Everyone else as far as I could tell was still going on about their business.  The young woman next to me was talking about meaningless career climbing nonsense with an older gentleman in the aisle seat.  This is when I notice a pronounced change in the object.  The object was still on the edge of this large cloud.  However, each initial burst was now followed by much more chaotic secondary and tertiary strobes of light that covered what appeared to be a HUGE area.  The first stobe would flash at the bottom of the object and was followed by a series of strobes that climbed higher and wider up along the edge of the cloud.  Plese note that at this point there was still a gap between the object and the cloud.  It continued to flash at more or less regular intervals and seemed to outline a HUGE shape.  Almost triangular, like an inverted pyramid.  I couldn't tell.  It was getting darker at this point, but still not what I would consider night.  The space between the strobes was rather dark and I wasn't able to make out any discernable ""edge"" to the object.  I sat there in awe.  The size of this thing seemed immense.  I would estimate that it was approximately one-third (1/3) the height of the visable part of the cloud; the part that extended above the main cloud deck.  I watched this go on for 5 - 10 minutes.   Red-blue initial flashes at its base followed by a succession of chaotic flashes that seemed to cascade upwards to the ""top"" of the object.  This large object remained stationary (from my perspective) at the edge of the cloud for some time.  The flashes were so intense at this point that you could see it light up the edge of the cloud it was next to.  Later, you could actually see the cloud being backlit by these flashes.  The object did not initially appear to be behind the cloud, or at least I would say that most of the object was not behind the cloud.  Since my plane was moving and hence my sightline was continually changing, my view of the object must have changed, possibly explaing why initialy the large object appeared be in the open. Only toward the end of the sighting did I see the dramatic backlighting effects.  The initial effects only lit up the edge of the cloud.  The second larger object never approached us either, nor did it ever seem to move further away.  It did not make any real ""maneuvers"" at all.  Throughout the sighting, from the initial single light to the last time I saw it, the object seemed to remain between two large clouds.  It did not appear to climb or descend in altitude.  Also, please note, that the times I have given as to the duration of the sighting are approximate.  Needless to say, it seemed to go on for a VERY long time.  In fact, I watched it for so long that I eventually thought to myself, ""Allright, enough alredy.  I'm getting tired of this.  You've proved your point.""  I wanted to get a nap in.  Unfortunelty, I never really did drift off.  I returned my gaze to the interior of the cabin.  The next time I looked out the window the object was gone.  I never mentioned it to the other passengers or crew.  As you can see from the above account, this was a very ""personal"" experience.  I felt at the time, perhaps somewhat selfishly, that this was FOR ME.  If no one else saw it, that was THEIR fault.  I mean, it was pretty hard to miss.  There was NOTHING else like it in the sky at the time.  In fact, I find it hard to believe that the pilots themselves could have missed it, allthough I assume it might have been somewhat behind their line of sight.  I would also like to note, that shortly before this sighting began, we passed another plane heading west and flying slightly lower than us.  I was kind of surprised to see another plan so close to us ... probably less than 1/2 a mile away and probably 1000 - 2000 ft lower in altitude.  (I have tried to refrain from using guestimates as to the size and distance of things up to this point because I really have no clue as to the scale of things from that perspective.)  For what its worth, I noted the size and brightness of the passing plane's strobes, and the initial single object I saw (as well as the larger object seen later in the sighting) was MUCH brighter and appeared SIGNIFICANTLY larger than this plane's strobe, not to mention it was MUCH further away.  Additionaly, the palne's strobes were mostly white, while the object on the horizon was mostly deep reds and blues.  In conclusion, I really don't know WHAT it is I saw.  I merely know I saw something.  Perhaps I saw exactly what I wanted to.  Maybe I saw exactly what I NEEDED to.  Whatever the answer, I'm buying a digital camera and keeping it handy on my next plane trip. ;^)  Sorry this is so long. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-03-23T00:00:00,,

I stopped to lie down in a clear, grassy patch that overlooked the western side of the park, and Fontana Lake.  I decided to watch the sky, and look for birds, as I enjoy watching birds fly from below.  The sun was bright and there were no clouds in the sky.  I layed on my back, and shielded the sun from my eyes.  I began to focus on how bright blue the sky was, and how there were no clouds at all.  There were several nearby jets, with jet-trails.  Soon, my eyes focused on a incredibly tiny white dot.  It was the size of a period, like this (.).  Just a single white point.  I thought to myself, ""that's incredibly high for a plane"".  There were no exhaust trails.  I watched the point for about 10 minutes, and it did not move.  I closed my eyes, and looked away, and looked back multiple times, and the dot was still there. It was not a plane, for it did not move or have trails.  It was not a speck on my glasses, as I moved my head about and the dot stayed in the same position.  It was not a cloud, far too small.  It was not a star or part of the moon.  The moon was about quarter that night, and it was about 3:00 in the day, thus no star would be shining.  It was not a receding balloon, as I've watched receding helium balloons before, and they diminish from sight much quicker.  The only thing I could explain it as was a geosynchronous satellite.  It had the same look, and this would explain why it didn't move.  However, no satellite is visible during this time of day.  Thus, I characterize it as unidentified.

I'm 33 years old and work partime at Skyharbor airport, I often see military aircraft taking off from the national gaurd next to the airport but I have never seen anything like what I have been seeing.

There was also air traffic in the vacinity that evening, so it was easy to make a quick comparison.

The object also seemd to be lower than a typical cruising or approaching airplane would be for our region. Due to the distance of the object I could not confirm any presence or lack of any sound. It was at this point that the object, which had a steady luminosity, abruptly and un-nervingly dissapeared. I continued to scan the area of the night sky for its reappearance, but to no avail.

Actually this night I had two UFO encounters. The first was very insignificant but it was because of this first one that I later noticed the more prominent one.  1st sighting: I was driving south on Hwy 97 in Bend, from the Holiday Inn. I hadn't quite reached Cooley Rd yet, but was coming up on it fast. It was about 9:00 pm, only a half hour or so before my second sighting. I saw this dark object ""fly"" over the road from west to east. I noticed it because it reflected light on it's underside. I saw it for perhaps a second. It then stopped reflecting light whereupon I could no longer see it. If I had to surmise how big the object was, in my best guess it was small; perhaps as big as a large duck. I also believe that it was very low to the ground, around 100 feet no higher. The shape was nearly indiscernable. It would be pointless to describe it.  2nd sighting: I was driving north off Glacier Ridge and came to the stop sign where you turn onto Neff rd. I was looking in the night sky for more stuff because of my first sighting. I noticed a bright light in the sky. I thought it looked funny, but not suspicious. I watched it at the stop sign until I noticed it had a blinking light. It then started to move to the west where I then realized this must be Air Life. I rolled down my window and heard the blades of a helicopter which more or less confirmed my suspicions. I then turned onto Neff Rd heading west and continued to look in the same patch of sky (looking true north), when I became aware of a strange assortment of stars. There was quite a few of them all in straight line. I knew this was more than a coincidence so I pulled my car over to the side of the road and got out to take a look. And I did for five minutes. This is what I saw.  There were 12 of these lights. They appeared just like normal stars. Equal in size, and luminicity. If they weren't in a straight line I would have never known the better. The first light closest to me was directly above me. Straight up in the sky. Then the next one was a little to the north, and the next one the same distance to the north as well. It appeared from my angle as if they were all spaced equally apart from each other, except that the distance they covered shortened the length for the ones farthest to the north. I noticed that the lights were moving ever so slowly. At first they appeared to be moving north, but after a while I noticed their greatest motion was from east to west. They all moved together to maintain this straight line. On a couple occasions I couldn't count 12 but only 10 but that's probably because they were hazed over by the city light of Bend. On two occasions it also appeared as if the lights all would wobble together. Meaning all of them would seem to wobble in place, and I believe all of them did this at the same time, however it was hard to discern without any reference for a plane of stability in the sky. It might have been only the one light moved from more or less directly north of me, to the northwest of my vision, and were ever so slowly moving north as well. The one light that used to be directly overhead was now further north.  So I got back in my car and drove no less than a quarter of a mile.. keeping an eye on these lights outside my passenger window. When the oddest thing happened. I passed them! I pulled over again and got out to take a look. And I noticed the lights were roughly in the same place in relation to me, as I was in my original spot after first spotting them! I had somehow passed them in less than a 1/4 of a mile! When I was driving I saw myself passing them up! Now before seeing this, my guess was that these lights that looked a lot like stars, were pretty high up in the sky. But after realizing I had passed them up in my car in such a small distance, they had to be really low to the ground. Perhaps 500 feet, maybe a little more. And they must have been small too... It's hard to say, but maybe the size of a kite.  Now I didn't watch them long after the second time I pulled over, but I just left after taking my fill. I tried really hard to be objective about this. No lost time. No noises were eminating from these lights. What little wind there was, was blowing from the west and sometimes the north. I find it very hard to think that this could have been some weird person's idea of attaching lights to a kite, and attempting to fly it with little to no wind, in the middle of the night! And somehow making them drift across the sky in formation! Usually a kite rotates from the anchor, and these lights did not do that!  The other interesting thing to note is that my mother said, according to the news station the military was testing jet craft or the like during the night time this last week. I heard such a craft around noon a week prior to this alleged news briefing. Now if this is military related, it must be small remote control craft. I would be very hard pressed to imagine something else. Whatever it was, these two sightings were small, which is a theme. Although one did not emit light, the other string of objects did..  I can't think of more than that. The lights seemed like natural star light. Remember Air Life (I assume it was Airlife because the hospital was a half mile away!) was nearby before I noticed the lights. They may have been there before, but I never noticed. Oh one last thing... It was a beautiful day in Central Oregon, so there was not a cloud in the sky, and ditto for the night as well.   I feel that it's pertinent to my UFO sightings to mention my mood. I have witnessed 5 UFO's, and I mean that in the most literal sense. I don't assume they were alien craft, military, or whatever. They are just Unidentified Objects manuevering in the sky. But on four of these sightings I remember my mood to be in the range of happy, and usually full of energy. More or less just feeling good about myself. The other UFO sighting of mine happened much earlier in my life (9 years old) and I can't recall my mood, but I was with a lot of friends, so I suspect it to be in the ""feeling good"" range.  Okay I have just proofread this and remember one last thing although I feel it's unrelated to the incident, and makes me feel a little more than embaressed. But when I first saw the Air Life helicopter, I tried flashing it with my headlights on my car. I was flashing them with my ""brights"" pretty rapidly, comparable to morse code. They copter was in the perfect position to see me, so I thought I might get a response from it. I did not.",2004-04-30T00:00:00,44.022083283582084,-121.28018388059701

I was cooking at the restaurant where I work and I noticed that none of the cooks were on line, so I went out back looking for them and they were all staring at these 5 bright lights that would go from not being visible to being a bright ball of concentrated light, no flickering.  They did this in a very random pattern.  Sometimes they would all light up individually at different times and sometimes two or three or four of them would all light up together in different hovering positions in the sky.  Not predictable at all.  One of the other cooks said that they were lighting up and then flying around each other in ways that airplanes or helicopters couldn't.  He said, ""It looked like they were playing tag.""  When I saw them they were very stationary or after some time they would slowly change their positions, but then stop and hover again doing their light show.  Their numbers went from 5 of them and about 20-30 minutes later I went out back with our dishwasher and saw one remaining, but faint.  We were looking to the North from downtown Olympia by the Farmer's Market on the water.  They also seemed to be in the flight path of airplanes flying into Sea-Tac.  Pilots must have seen something weird...  Right before they would lost all their light, I could see a very tiny object behind the light and I would say it was saucer shaped, although it looked very far away right before it disappeared.  When they would light up though, they were bright.  Not a star in the sky at the time, you could only see the moon and these things lit up brighter and with more intensity and solid white light than anything I've seen in the sky.  A good handful of customers saw them as well.  One guy even called up our local paper here, the Olympian, to tell them what was going on.  He said he is in the military and had never seen anything like that so he called it in.  I checked after the sun went down and I didn't see anything.  I think that their light came from the sun, because the sun was directly behind us whil! e looking at them.  As the sun went down, the less and less intense the lights became.

On april 26 2004, at aproxmetly 9:00 pm mountain time,  my father and I were outside observing what looked like a satalite crossing the sky above our home in Longmont colorado.  We watched it untill it was out of sight.  As I turned to go back in my home I heard my father yell ""What the hell is that!""  I Quickly looked up in time to see a large cigar or rectangle shaped object zip across the sky.  It was very dark in color but you could still see dim reflections through out the whole object.It had what appeared to be four dimond shaped lights,just slightly smaller than the whole object, across the bottom; however they were also very dim. The whole object looked sort of faded as it went over head. When I looked up the object was directly above my house and considerably low flying, aproxametly 10,000 feet or so. My father, who is learning to be a pilot, said that the object was flying about even with the top of the mountains.  As I looked up at the object it continued to fly forward in a straight line although it appeared to be sitting at an angle with one side higher in elevation than the other. It was flying from south to north on the west side of the big dipper and directly in between to very bright stars that I think may have been planets.(astronomy is not my strong point.) It crossed a considerable amount of sky very fast, about 4 to 6 seconds, and then was temporarinly out of sight. What struck me as the most odd part about this first pass, other than the shear speed of the object, was the fact that there was no sound. No soud at all, dead silent. A few seconds later the object was vissible again, only a lot higher in elevation, about cruising elevation for an average jetliner.  It continued north for about 4 seconds then quikly shot back south. It covered about 2 inches of the sky in only 2 seconds then just dissapeard.  My father and I stayed out side for about another 5 minutes wathcing the sky, more so out of shock than anything else.  At one point we saw a jetliner in the sky tr! aveling from east to west. One thing we noted was that for the jet to travle about a 2 inch distance of sky took nearly 15 to 20 seconds as aposed to the 2 seconds of the earlier object. Also the satalite we had been watching was traveling south east, and the UFO started about where the satelite had gone out of sight. Another erie fact to mention would be, that after the object passed I had gone in my 93 ford ranger to grab my jacket and upon entering every light in my truck began flashing. The headlights, the taillights, the domelight, and the blinkers, were all going nuts for about 15 seconds.",2004-04-30T00:00:00,40.1703733197556,-105.08544969450101

The lights were not shining straight ahead, or pointing straight down at the ground, but kind of in between. They looked like huge spotlights and illuminated the sky and trees all around it. The lights were white. I pulled over on the side of the road to watch it. After about a minute, maybe a little more, it moved a few blocks west pretty rapidly, still at the same height. Then came right back just as fast to the origional location. When this happened, I got scared and put the car in gear to drive again.

I called my mom out to watch with me. Within five minutes the object had dulled to a soft glow (our sunset is about 20:15 here now but the object was still highly visible). The light then completley extinguished and the object seemed to turn more nothernly, toward the Olympic Mountains. As it fell, dark black smoke trailed behind it. It wasn't falling quickly, like a shooting star, but as a ""regular"" plane would fly. We are just across the water from SEA-TAC international, and there is no way this was a ""regular"" plane. Besides the initial ""fireball's"" brightness and length, the turn it made was less of a ""plane circle"" and more of a direct shift in angle. The news didn'treport anything about the flame or smoke, and no one has gotten back to me yet about the reason behind this sighting. I do know that besides SEA-TAC, Vashon is about 60 miles north of Fort Lewis Army Base and McChord Airforce Base. I do not mean to insinuate anything with either of these establishments, just more to give the reader a location idea. This is our first sighting on Vashon.

At the said time and date, my wife and I were driving home. Almost nearly home, we noticed a fairly bright light on an object directly in front of us (North of our position.) At first, I dismissed it as a helicopter or a fixed wing airplane. Within 30 seconds of watching the object, what appeared to be the wing of the craft was illuminated by the bright singular light of the object. The ""wing"" appeared from our position that of an air plane in a hard bank. So the ""wing"" was straight up and down and was not hiding the large singular light, nor was it effecting the intensity of the light. At this time, my wife called her mother and had her look from her location which was only a few blocks away north of our position. Useless for triangulation. She attempted to get her video camera set up, but was unable to do so during the short time span. Gauging distance would be difficult, but I would guess it would be no more than 5 miles away. There was absolutely no sound. There was no wind whatsoever, yet the object looked as if it were drifting in a large circle, hung from a cable from high above. The object displayed no vertical movement. It appeared to keep the same altitude as it drifted to the West. At times it would stop making its pivoting circles, and hold in one location. From my position, it would appear as if the craft while drifting West would slow down, and head back East, then go back west. It would slow as it reached the edge of it's circular pivot. I've used and seen many types of flares, and this was no flare. For one, if it was a flare, it didn't do a very good job at illuminating the ground. No smoke was seen near the object either. Plus, the lack of vertical movement makes me skeptical. I kept wanting to think it was a hot air balloon dangling a light below it. That's the speed and impression the object gave me. There were no strobe lights that I could see. The single light was much brighter than the evening star which was present just to the West. The light was a dim redish color that tended to flicker slightly. The size of the light from my position was aprox. 10 times larger than the Evening star. When the object disapeared, the light simply went out as if you flipped a switch. This alone eliminates any type of commercial traffic. My only theory is it could be ball lightning, some type of flare, unknown military or alien craft. We did have non-producing thunder storms in the area earlier in the day. I can't explain the cable or the ""wing"" structure above the light either. That kind of eliminates ball lightning. For me, I'm a trained observer, and work security for the Federal Government at a local facility. I have an interest in aviation and military equipment. I've never seen a ""UFO"" before, since I was always able to find a credible answer for whatever I saw. On a side note, during the event, it sounded as if a large number of people were outside looking at it. Also, I heard some tires screaching off in the distance. This object definately had peoples attention. We're used to low flying air craft up some fairly large commercial jets overhead since the International Laughlin Airport is aprox. 5 miles away. No other aircraft were present in the area during the event. You may contact me through e-mail if you need any more information.",2004-04-09T00:00:00,35.084078494623654,-114.56282311827957

I wonder what I saw?? Well I can’t believe it’s me writing this. Last night (April 7, 2004 from approximately 9:30 to 11:00 pm EST) I saw what I guess was a UFO. But it was not what I always thought of as a UFO.  In the northwest sky there was an extremely bright, extremely white light so much so that it looked as you might expect a diamond would sparkle under a bright light.  At times it also seemed to shift, for a second or so, to a slight reddish color and then back to white.  In size it was at least ten times that of the biggest star in the sky.  Now from here on in I’m not sure if what I saw was real or imagined. There seamed to be small dot shaped, orangish – reddish in color, “balls, disks” in the surrounding area of the light. They numbered perhaps eight or ten. I referred to them as dots because they were perfectly round as a dot and with no extending light beyond the actual shape.  Then I saw what appeared to be two of the dots move away at a fairly fast speed. The one followed the other in exact formation space and distance from the other. As they moved away a white light was added to the orangish/red color.  They continued moving away and finally disappeared.  At one point approximately 30 minutes after I first saw the light it dropped lower in the sky, just a little, the reason I noticed this was because it was now just slightly below the tree line.  Before going to bed, 11:00 pm, I went to take a last look and it was gone. ((name deleted))",2004-04-09T00:00:00,42.09974517647059,-80.07763388235293

Three lights rapidly approached from the West in a triangle formation, at '12 o'clock low'.  I watched them closely to make sure that I wasn't looking at birds or something else. I am inferring that the object between the lights was solid and triangular, because when the object banked North, the angular relationship between the lights was consistent with the banking of an aircraft - however this was no ordinary aircraft. It moved completely silently and covered half the horizon, that is from Surrey to the North Shore Mountains in about four seconds. I am guessing the altitude (based on watching approaching aircraft in the same airspace at 2000 - 3000 f, and the brightness of the lights of the object relative to the brightness of passing aircraft lights) at within 7000 feet. My gut feeling while watching this thing was that it could not be man-made; I was also admiring the technology that could create something with this kind of performance envelope. Amazing! I continued to watch the sky for about a half an hour afterwards; I noted that the flight path of the object was directly over the approach path to YVR, and that at 21:55 an aircraft approached through the same airspace. I tried to sketch this out on paper, but the sketch doesn't do justice to the way this thing banked and moved.

I would sometimes look for air traffic from Carswell Air Force, to my west, from this vantage point. The sky was clear. There was no air traffic in my immediate field of view.  I noticed a silvery, metallic object about 30 degrees above the horizon, due north. It appeared to be elliptical, but was probably disk-shaped (1). The object was perhaps two degrees in size, measured along its horizontal axis, and appeared to be fairly distant (there were no physical points of reference that would allow me to judge the size or distance of the object). The outline of the object's surface was distinct. I might not have noticed the object had it not changed its physical appearance while I was watching it. It appeared to scintillate or ""wink"", causing the object briefly to ""disappear"", or at least become difficult to see. For the duration of the observation, the object did not move horizontally or vertically from its position, nor did it appear to change size. I presumed from this that the object was spatially motionless. I could detect no sound from the object, although this may have been a function of the object's possible distance from me.  (1) I could not, at the time, account for the object's scintillation, although I thought it might have been due to some kind of movement. I now believe the object was in fact disk-shaped, having an apparent elliptical shape due to the oblique angle at which I was viewing it. I also now believe that the object's scintillation, or ""winking"", was the result of the object changing its attitude relative to my position. If, for example, the object had been shifting its attitude (relative to me, the observer) by, say, plus/minus 45 degrees along its horizontal axis, it might have appeared to be a scintillating ellipse.  I observed the object for perhaps 10 minutes, after which I could no longer visually resolve it in the fairly bright sky.  Had the object been a conventional fixed-wing or rotor-winged aircraft, I believe I would have been able to track its movement from its (apparent) rest position to a point in the sky where it would have been obscured by some intervening object or would have gone below my field of view. It was not a lighter-than-air vehicle (e.g., a blimp or weather balloon), as I had seen these in Fort Worth before and was familiar with their appearance in the sky. It was not a missile, as I was also familiar with their appearance in the sky. The fact that the object appeared to loiter also presents some difficulties with its being a conventional aircraft.  The object did not appear to be any meteorological phenomenon - at least none with which I was or am familiar. It was also not an astronomical phenomenon. The sky was far too bright to have allowed stars to be seen and, as we all know, planets do not scintillate.  The object could have been some type of experimental vehicle. Working for a major manufacturer of advanced (read classified) air vehicles, though, I do not believe this would have been the case. If for no other reason, disk-shaped structures are difficult to control aerodynamically with current technology. It is also difficult to explain why an experimental (or conventional) air vehicle would want to change its attitude in the manner this object appeared to have.  I am 46 years old. I live in Los Angeles, CA. I studied astronomy and physics as an undergraduate and have two Master's degrees (although not in physics or astronomy). As I mentioned above, I work for an aerospace company, selling manned and unmanned air vehicles and systems. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Full Description of event/sighting: Around 11-13 March 1988, I was woken by what sounded like a metal ball being thrown from one side of my house (downstairs) to another.  I was frightened to say the least and hid my head under the duvet on the bed.  The sounds continued, and I remember thinking that if someone had broken in, I would have heard glass breaking!  I looked at the clock - it was about ten past one in the morning.  I decided I was being stupid and that I must go to see what was going on.  When I sat on the edge of the bed I became aware of a small figure, that seemed to glow, hovering inside my bedroom by the window.  It was ochre coloured, with a small round head on a flexible neck emerging from an ochre-coloured leather-like cylinder.  I remember being surprised by very large flat ""feet"" at the base.  There was nothing frightening about it - just a feeling of niceness and fun.  It stretched out two long flexible ""arms"" towards me, and that was the last thing I remembered.  I would have dismissed this ""sighting"" as just a dream if it had not been for the fact that the previous evening there was a lot of ribbon lightning - but no rain.  I went outside to get a better look, when suddenly two glowing orbs flashed in front of my balcony.  The impression was of two kittens chasing each another - fun.  Sometime later I read a letter in a magazine reporting the sighting of a large shiny object which appeared to be a space ship near the Jura mountains, close to where I live.  I have always regretted not contacting the writer nor keeping a copy of the letter.  Since I have not come across any similar reports, the possibility remains that the figure could have been a dream or all  in the mind.  But it could also have been a ""sighting.""

It was late night and me and my friend were on a university campus in Birmingham. Neither of us was intoxicated in any way, and although my eyes are slightly less than perfect my friend had correct glasses and we both concurred in what we saw.  At about a 60deg elevation I noticed an area of the sky (virtually cloudless - no clouds near event) where the stars appeared to be moving around in relation to each other, as if seen through a dynamic lens. What caught my attention was that a) it was a windy night and the object/region was barely moving relative to us or landmarks and b) the 'stars' refracted through the region were not accurate, that is not only the colour and luminance but the number of stars was different when the object cleared a section of sky. The slow movement of the region and the steady ""pulsating"" of its shape was entirely inconsistent with wind or thermal rising (I've been known to dabble in parascending and gliding - I know airborne objects).  I remember observing the object for 20-30 seconds before mentioning it to my friend, in case I sounded stupid. When I directed his attention  to the area, he also remarked that it was not behaving like anything subject to the wind, or flight. The best way I can describe it is not as a craft or solid object, but as if an object roughly the shape of the familiar weather-map ""cloud"" was wandering about the sky, pretending to be transparent. Size and altitude are very difficult to quantify, but my best *guess* would be 2,000ft. The region was roughly the size of cigarette pack at arm's length.  Plastic sheeting or other natural phenomena (with the possible exception of some sort of thermal or other atmospheric anomaly I'm not qualified to identify) was discounted by both of us in our conversation, for the reasons mentioned above and (I'm fairly sure) other reasons I can't readily recall. My recollection is crystal clear in that we both agreed it was unexplainable at the time and after watching it for a while, we said something along the lines of ""Well, that was ****ing strange"" and moved on to our destination with no explanation other than ""we just saw a UFO"".  Only recently have I come across some vaguely similar sightings (there is one from a Sean Amundsen at the base of this page: http://www.rense.com/general50/whatthe.htm) and decided to document our sighting for posteriety. Sean's description of a ""magic carpet"" sums it up very well to me, although his sighting was in the day.  Hope this tallies with something, or adds something to the field.

The object was oval in shape (grayish almost transparent) with 2 dots evenly spaced half way from the outer edge of the oval (1 on either side of the oval) think of a lady bug, then at the center of the oval there was a tethered object rotating around the oval in perfect symmetry (between the 2 dots). It looked like a string with an object connected at the end and it was rotating around the center the oval in the direction it was traveling. Almost as if it was the propelling force that caused the oval to move. Think of pedaling a bicycle. I observed it for about 10 seconds and looked back up in the sky and it was bright. Now being sure I could find it again I ran inside to get a witness. It was almost 6 AM and I pulled my sleeping son out of bed and aligned the object again in the telescope and his comment was ""what is that?"" I've shown him may astronomy objects such as nebulas, star clusters, and most of the big planets so this was also new to his eyes also. Now 2 minutes at the most passed as I tried to get a camera up and running but no luck and the object was moving overhead so I looked again through the telescope and just at that point ... the oval blew up. The explosion looked like a firework that just went off in the sky. What was observed next was unexpected ... the tethered object in the middle separated intact and continued to rotate. So what I saw was an explosion the tethered object separate and the rotation continued (only now end over end instead of rotating around the oval). And now instead of moving overhead the tethered object is starting to move downward. (My hand tracking of the telescope now has me moving the telescope down instead of > up and over as with the original path the oval was moving which was south to north. The tethered object now had 2 distinct ends one was the pivot end and the other was the original object that was rotating around the oval. So the rotation stayed the same but now moving downward as if falling from the sky and rotating around a new pivot. The new pivot point is now interesting as it now takes shape and color. It appears like an elongated cone, orange in color and it appears as if there are 2 ""strings"" coming from the ""cone"" to the tethered object rotating around this ""orange cone."" The ""strings"" seem to come together as one, half way down the length of the tether. I watched this for about 1 to 2 minutes and even tried a higher power eyepiece but due to the narrow field of view of the higher power eyepiece I only saw it briefly and subsequently lost track of the tethered object. The orange color was more evident at the higher power and the 2 ""strings"" appeared more evident. The telescope used was a Meade 8"" Newtonian on an equatorial mount,ironically the mirror was just cleaned the day before so it was perfect and the only reason I was still out at 6 AM (the Sun was rising and ruining the star gazing) was the tracking motor was malfunctioning and I wanted to test the tracking on any bright object I could find before total Sun rise washed out even the brightest of stars and I would have to wait till night fall to test again.

The lights moved as a general large cluster, with individual lights quickly moving forward and sideways, but still maintaining the general formation.

A witness called from Decker Lake to report seeing a very unusual object in the night sky. The witness said the sighting lasted for approximately 10 minutes before it moved away and into the distance. It then appeared as a very faint light until it just disappeared. The object seen was extremely bright white with a ring of red lights around the middle. It was reported that there were a good number of red lights which could be easily seen with the naked eye. It was a clear night and the star were shinning brightly, but the person said this was certainly no star.  HBCC UFO called the local airport which is very small to enquire to see if anyone knew if a helicopter or any aircraft was fling in that area on March 12, 2004 at approximately 10:30 p.m. and they said they were not aware of anything flying that evening. I also checked to see if anything was fling on February 27, 2004 and March 7, 2004 and again no reports of aircraft in the area. Both of these dates I mentioned had sightings of unusual craft in the area. I will also be taking a drive to visit all of the witnesses who filed reports to get a better idea where exactly the objects have been seen.  Also while I chatted with the witness I was told of a number of incidents which have taken place in and around Decker Lake and Burns Lake British Columbia. Objects being witnessed by a large number of folks. Some watching an object skimming over the water on Francois Lake and the object was of a large size, silent and glowing. Other strange white/objects making some very fantastic maneuvers in the sky's above and always dropping down behind one of the mountains in the Grassy Plains area. This is rather interesting because I know there has been a number of cattle mutes that have taken place across Francois Lake and around Grassy Plains. Also strange creatures are being reported from our native peoples.  I will also add I receive information from a very credible source who works on Francois Lake everyday, along with others who have reported that the large Canadian Search and Rescue Buffalo had been flying late at night for no known reason over top of Francois Lake at very unusual hours. Some of these witness made enquires to why the aircraft was there, thinking the flight crew may have been on a training mission but there was no information to come forward.  I am starting to wonder if there isn't something happening all throughout this area and I am certainly going to be spending some time out there talking with residents around the area.  Below is a little on what our Search and Rescue Buffalo looks like.  Buffalo  the Tactical Twin from DHC DHC’s Buffalo* was designed to meet a US Army requirement for a fixed-wing tactical transport with a cargo capacity to match Boeing-Vertol CH-46 Chinook helicopters. The type entered Canadian service in 1967 as a complement to the larger CC-130 Hercules. The training of paratroopers was among the CC-115’s early tasks but in 1974 the CF Buffalo fleet was modified for the search-and-rescue role.  Rescue equipment, improved navigation aids, and crew rest stations were all that was required to convert the Buffalo from transport** to SAR. Perhaps a little over- powered for their new role, the key virtue of the CC-115s was their availability. The Buffalo had little opportunity to make use of their phenomenal short take-off and landing abilities as SAR aircraft. However, the rear cargo ramp was ideal for rescue equipment dropping, and the paratrooper doors suited SAR-tech jumps just as well. But, the Buffs are aging and only 6 of 15 remain.

I was amazed and could not take my eyes off of it. I finally called my mom to see if she could see it too. She did! I told her she had to come over and look at it from my house, as I have a clearing that provided a perfect view. I watched it about five minutes until she arrived. Once she arrived we watched it for another ten minutes or so. As I watched it seemed to pulse. We were able to pick out a refernce point right under the light that allowed us to measure the movement. It seemed to sway (or hover) just slightly. I also thought I saw some small lights to the out side of the circle. After it started to sway we noticed that it actually was getting smaller, as if it was moving away. Within about five seconds it was completely out of sight. I checked later but there was nothing.

When I was about 14 in Lexington Kentucky in the early eighties, my brother's friend left our house one evening.  He yelled for us to come outside and see a UFO.  When we went out the night sky was full of clouds like I have never seen.  They all drooped down like cotton balls all the way across the sky.  When we all looked up there was this gigantic Orange ball of light moving silently through these clouds illuminating a huge portion of them.  We could only see the bottom of the sphere as it went in and out of the low clouds.  It stayed at a steady altitude and speed, beacuse it was the formation of the low droopy clouds that masked the upper part of the craft.  The craft itself had to be at least 50 yards wide as it passed over our heads.  It also had these long pole like extensions, like spikes, with different colored lights on the end of them.  This event was on the News in Lexington, Kentucky that evening, and hundreds of people saw this thing, propmting lots of calls to the military. Hope this little tidbit helps your research! 1 Question:  Did anyone elso report what I saw on 3/17??? 2 Question:  Is this a type of craft reported before, because I thought I saw it on a UFO special the other night on The History Channel??? 3 : I also have a friend that told me him and his brother have been abducted since they were very young...he lives in Evansville, IN if you want me to put you in contact with him.

My wife and I are both college-educated and in professional fields, she in allied health and I in information technology. On the date/time above, we were on our front porch, enjoying the relatively warm (for this time of year)air. Our porch faces west-northwest and we have a fairly unobstucted view in that direction, free of light pollution.  My wife noticed the 1st set of lights coming in from due west. I left the porch and went out into our front yard. Through the bare branches of the trees I could see several sets of very bright lights, heading roughly from west to east. The sky was very clear that night. The lights were primarily bright red, with smaller white lights interspersed. As we both loolked around, we noticed aproximately 12-15 of these aircraft, moving in level flight, all roughly in the same direction. They were not huddled together in a close formation, but I got the distinct impression that they were traveling together.  2 of the craft came directly over our house/property. I would estimate that they were aproximately 2-3 thousand feet up, much lower than the commercial (and military)aircraft that we are used to seeing. They were moving quickly, but I was able to discern an aircraft shape and the speed was in line with that of a jet. No sudden movements were seen. What was striking, however, was the almost complete lack of sound. I strained to hear anything and was able finally to catch a very soft jet engine sound. As a comparison, several nights later, I was out walking our dog and heard a jet sound. I discovered the source of this sound at a height that was at least 3 times that of the craft that I am reporting.  While this may not sound especially remarkable, the lack of noise, combined with the odd and very bright light pattern was very disconcerting. However, that isn't the end of the story. As we were observing the numerous craft coming in from the west, but prior to their overflight of our house, my wife suddenly noticed (and drew my attention to)what we took to be a meteor at a very low altitude. It also came in from the west, but at treetop level. Coming across our road, it bifurcated. It was intensely burning and the 2nd piece continued on along my southern property line, appearing to descend thru the trees. It very well may have landed in my back woods, which extend for about 2 acres before coming to an interstate highway. In any event, the 'meteor' was very, very close and very, very bright.  At no time did either of us think 'extraterrestrial', but we did think 'very odd'. I would not waste anyone's time unless it was far enough from the ordinary.

We noticed a VERY bright light, very close to the back of my parents home, not too high in the air but larger and brighter than any other thing in the sky.  At first, I thought it was just an air plane, but then my husband noticed it as we were backing out of the driveway and asked me if I saw that strange light in the sky.  We then noticed it was a diamond shape with small beams of light shining out of it from both sides.  As we traveled towards our home in Lynchburg, about 14 miles, it got even brighter then we noticed it started to travel away from us as it got dimmer.  I also noticed a small puff of smoke just when it started to move away. We watched it even after we got home for about 5 more minutes as it traveled further away from us.  Then about 10 minutes later we looked out at it again and it was as small as the other stars in the sky but it was very red at that point.  Then about 15 minutes later, it was just gone.  We are not sure what exactly it was, but it was definitely a diamond, very bright, unlike anything either of us has ever seen in the sky before.

It passed directly over our vehicle as we were driving due south.  We seen it initially comming towards us about 2 or 3 miles away.  I said to my fiance, ""look, theres a UFO"". In jest at first because we are both sky-watchers.  I said this because I am not used to seeing aircraft with dominate blue and green lights on it.  There were 6 lights visible from the bottom of the craft. Two lights 1 blue and 1 green that were dominate.  There were 3 yellow/white lights about 1/3 as bright as the green and blue lights. Also a slightly fainter red light. The red light was on the leading edge of the triangle at the apex.  2/3's of the way back to the base of the triangle were the green and blue lights nearer to the edges.  At the base were the 3 yellow/white lights located centered on the base between the green and blue lights. As it came closer and then right over us it was very clear that this was not a helicopter because my best guess would be that it couldn't be more than 1200 feet in the air and there was no sound.  I seemed to be going no mre than 80 miles per hour.  I turned around to follow it and kept up pretty well at 50 MPH. I was in a residential area and soon had to stop.  We stopped abd watched it for several minutes and seen 1 helicopter going from SE to NW seemingly going towards this object.  There was also another helicopter going directly N and to our left that seemed to be headed in that direction also.  It was very easy to hear and see that these were helicopters as we were stopped now with the windows down.  As the object in question reached about 5 miles to our north it started to change direction to more northwesterly as opposed to NE.  It made a apparently very slow turn, but as I was so far to the south of it.... it could have just been the distance that made it look slow.  Ater that we were unable to see the object.  We decided at this time to go back to our home!

I stopped to watch them 'bank' or make a tight right turn to get in position to land at the Des Moines Airport. -I watched the first F14, then the second, each came by about 20 seconds apart. -As I was wathching the 2nd F14 and looking closesely to see if their were weapons attached underneath the planes (they were very close and I could see the entire plane very clearly, something entered my site above the F14's that was extemely high in the sky. -The object started out as a small bright shining metal object because it was so high, that was all I could see. -I watched the object come directly down from the highest point in the sky to the 3rd F14 that had now entered my view right in front of me. He had started his bank or right turn and could also see under that F14. -Before the object was close the the F14 I could then see the shape of the object. -Description of object: Once it had descended close enough for me to see, I saw that it was bright, shiny metallic exactly like the metal 'mercury'. It was shaped like a bullet when it was coming directly at me. It was approximately 1/2 the size of the F14. -It approached the 3rd F14 from the top, and turned sideways and this is when I saw it change shape. It changed from a bullet looking object to a round flat sphere. The rear was not rounded, but was straight. It was able to change like controlled mercury. -Immediately as it turned sideways it dove under the F14 and started what I call 'sniffing' at the F14, or observing the underneath of the plane. -It was maintaing the same speed with the F14 as it went from the right wing, ducked under the F14 exhaust,engine and went to the left wing and continued the same observation on that side of the F14. -The 3rd F14 continued its extreme turn to head for the Des Moines Airport and the object then left the F14 turning left off of the left wing or heading west. -The object flew slowly at the same altitude approximately 500 feet and hovered. -The object then turned to face west, while hovering. -The object hovered after turning as if it was looking at something west, or behind me. I had a perfect view at this time of the object as it was approximately 1000 feet from me. -The object then turned north, while hovering, then flew at approximately a 75 degree angle upwards straight again to the highest point I could see in the sky at extremely high speeds, but still able to watch it leave our space. I would say it was like watching a F14 go almost straight up at full speed (which I have watched) and multiple that speed by 10. -The other or rest of the F14's made thier approach while I was watching the object leave. -20 seconds later 727 passenger jet came over my left shoulder at the same height of the F14's. That is what the object seemed to be looking at, but by the time the jet had gotten parellel with me, the object was out of view. -Witnesses: The pilots of the 727 had to see the object, it was right in front of them hovering. The 3rd F14 pilot had to see the object immediately when it was descended upon. It was also right in front of his windshield. The 4th F14 pilot was right behind the 3rd and had to see the object, no question. Myself as a witness. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

(in South Carolina) 4-28-04 in Varnville at 11:35 p.m. On Tuesday night April 28,2004 around 11:35 p.m. I saw what appeared to be an unidentified craft to my eyes. At first from a side view, as it was coming from the west heading towards a north eastern direction it looked like a normal plane. The object had two lights blinking on and off on the side,(one was green and the other red) on what seen to be the bottom of the aircraft were three big white lights forming a triangular shape. The object was moving very slow at about ( I would guest 30-45 miles per hour). As I kept looking at the craft it tilted a little bit to its side where I could see only the three big glowing light at the bottom. I was amazed to see this unusual object go by almost in a non noise making movement. No sound came as it was coming towards my direction and none was heard as it passed almost on top of where I was standing, just a couple of hundreds of feet away. Dispite the distance this thing looked huge. AS it went on its direction and I could not see it anymore I went back inside my house and tried to go to sleep. I tossed and turn and could not sleep. However the times I did go to sleep felt like it was a long time to me. But as it turned out to be it had just been 30-45 minutes of sleep. I don't know what caused the lack of sleep but I could not do it. In the morning, I told my wife what I had seen last night. She told me that it could have been a airplane. My responce was that if indeed it was an airplane it must have been a huge one with those kinds of lights on the bottom. But the more I remembered what it looked like the more it did not look like an ordinary airplane as she had claimed. I did not call any authorities to the scene because it was late and they would have dismissed it as a late night practical joke. This is the second sighting I have seen since moving tothe state of  South Carolina. Can someone explain what this object was.And by explaining it to me, I do not want to know that it was an weather balloon because it did not look like a weather ballo! on.

This was before the new skytrain line was finished being built.  Additional Information Below:  About 50m from the street hovering over the ravine where the skytrain tracks were being built. The light itself was 2-3 meters long and acted more like a spotlight but seemed to be a clear object behind the light. It headed on an angle up and southward incredibly fast once we got close to it. One witness lives just a few blocks away and I haven't heard from him in a couple days.

I have been a private pilot for nearly 40 years and have flown over most of the western half of the United States.  My 16 year old son was my sole passenger in the right front seat.  We had stopped in Mankato, MN to refuel and have a snack.  Departing Mankato airport approximately 2:15 pm on a heading of 100 degrees, we climbed through a layer of widely scattered cumulus clouds with bases at about 3,500 feet and tops between 4,500 and 5,000 feet.  We leveled off at 7,500 feet with good visibility and the scattered clouds below us.  About twenty minutes into the flight we were passing through the area north of Austin, MN and south of Rochester, heading toward La Crosse, WI.  Suddenly the my son blurted out ""What the hell is that?' as he looked out the window to his right toward the south.  I said ""Where?"" and he pointed off to the south and somewhat below our altitude.  I spotted an object slightly higher than the level of the cloud bases and 3 to 4 miles off our right wing.  Because of our speed at 170 knots (~195mph) and the intervening scattered clouds I only had a glimpse of 5 seconds or so after I spotted it before it began to be hidden by the passing clouds.  My first impression was I was looking at the back end of a blimp or a WWII barrage balloon.  The object was a medium dark grey, oval shaped but a vertical oval.  There were no vertical or horizontal stabilizing fins on it, however it did have two areas on the lower sides of the oval that were slightly bulbous and colored bright orange.  There was no apparent movement, however with our speed it could have been moving slowly and not obvious to us.  It was very puzzling since the area is very rural farming country and we were not near any cities or towns.  I thought at first it was a blimp, however a blimp would probably not be traveling within the clouds at nearly 4,000 feet since there was plenty of clear air below.  My next thought was that the object might be an Aerostat balloon the Customs Service uses along the Mexican border to spot incoming drug running aircraft, but this is not near the border and I believe those are typically tethered 10,000 feet above the ground.  The only other thought was a large balloon to provide a high antenna for a radio or TV signal, but here again it was out in the middle of nowhere and was not marked on the flight chart. Since we were trying to get to Oshkosh by 3:30 pm to in order to land prior a flight of over 100 incoming Beech Bonanzas, I did not deviate to investigate.  I am very familiar with almost all aircraft and have seen the Goodyear blimp and other advertising blimps many times both from the ground and in the air and this did not appear to be one of those.  On every flight I have to watch for other aircraft and am used to spotting and identifying them as traffic, yet to this day I have no idea what it was my son and I saw.",2004-03-29T00:00:00,43.67300000000001,-92.9592

We were leaving the house for a short time.  My wife was putting our daughter in the child seat and I had walked around to the opposite side of our car.  The night sky was fairly clear and I always enjoy checking out the stars, whenever possible.  I happened to look up, wanting to catch some of the nearby planets (that are in good view right now) and stars.  I noticed an unusually large light (about the size of a small pea, at arm's length) shining VERY brightly, nearby another fairly bright star.  I thought it unusual that two abnormally bright stars were clusted together, so I fixed my gaze a little more.  One looked to be simply a bright star.  The light on the right (approx. WNW of the other one in view) side grew extremely bright, almost as though a gigantic flashlight was shining straight down toward me.  I commented outloud for my wife to look, but she was busy constraining our child within the seatbelts (she doesn't really get into star-gazing much anyway).  I never broke my gaze, from the moment it caught my eye.  It grew very bright (almost pure white...brilliant) and then arced-off, for lack of a better description.  It looked as though it 'rolled around' and I lost complete sight of the object.  My best attempt at describing how it disappeared was that it looked like a very small eclipse.  I verified that there were very few clouds in the area, if at all.  The nearby 'star' on the left didn't change much throughout the whole ordeal (I suppose it was a true star).  After it 'turned off', I quickly scanned the sky for reference points.  From my best guess (sorry I'm not more specific) I would say that this observance was in the NW sky area.  I saw the open 'scoop' of the Big Dipper point up toward the North Star and noticed that the light I clearly saw, was off-alignment, over toward the NW (as the scoop-alignment pointed off toward my upper left).  This event happened off to my upper right.  When we returned, and all during our driving time to and from our destination, I kept scanning the sky for any oddities.  I saw none.  Perhaps someone else in the middle TN area saw something similar? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2004-03-29T00:00:00,36.354024242424245,-86.76205

Message: Around 1:26 a.m. March 28th 2004, in Prince George, B.C. my friends and I were dropping my brother off and my passenger happened to look out the window. He said to pull over, and I did as quickly as possible. He ran out of the car and I quickly followed to see what it was about. After getting out of the car I saw two fiery orange balls hovering in the sky above us, seemingly floating along. We watched the balls move for approximately a block and a half before one separated down towards the horizon. It was then we quickly got into the car to chase the other one, only to lose it.  The witness was kind enough to supply some more information on the sighting.  Additional Information below.  The object never stayed stationary at anytime during the sighting. No sound was heard coming from the objects. Also there was no trail or tail following the two object. An estimation of the altitude of the lights would have placed them at the height the UNBC University was sitting. (so not high at all). Both lights traveled side to side for moments, then split apart. No flames, but the flickering of the lights seemed to be like fire. The objects were moving North-east above Ospika/foothills. There were three witnesses to the sighting. The witness mentioned that he was not aware of any other who saw it at this time.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

I stoped my truck and got out as I was looking up, all the lights started moveing slowly towards I-90 produceing no noise whatsoever, As it moved my radio made static so i turned it off and roled down my window so i could hear clearly.

The then picked up speed and left me behind in a matter of seconds.  I saw it pass over the horizion in the dirrection of Seattle washington.

At first, because it had an irregular shape, I thought it was a plastic bag floating in the wind (there was a significant breeze).  As it got higher, I thought it might have been a kite.  As the object kept rising, it also kept moving closer to me at a slow but steady pace.  I watched it the entire time and by the time it was directly overhead, it was flying about twice as high as the church steeple.  It seemed to be a cluster of metal objects which were very shiny and appeared to have shapes like large flat letters (N? S?) It almost looked like a cluster of mixed metal chairs or picture frames.  The entire cluster, about 10 feet in diameter, was rotating in different directions as it kept moving south. By this point I thought it might be some kind of remote control object or part of some kind of air vehicle that had fallen off.  As it passed overhead it made no noise (that I could distinguish from the general din of air traffic from above).   I gathered up my books and by the time I rounded the church, it was very far in the distance beyond the library. I pointed it out to someone nearby who works at the library.  He had been sitting on the front steps of the church but had been looking down until I came around.  We watched it together for several minutes and could see that it continued to rise and move farther south, rotating all the while.

At approximately 19:50 PM this evening while trying to find the 5 planet alignment near the moon, my 13 year old son and I noticed 2 saucer like shapes rapidly heading towards us (we face Palma Sola Bay/West).  They were appearing to be racing one another but side by side, sometimes crossing each others paths.   They were quite large, no blinking lights, no sound at all, greyish in color.  When they were positioned just under the moon, they turned sharply and headed south. It looked like they briefly slowed down over the baseball park lights (which were on) and then rapidly headed southbound remaining next to one another but on occassion crossing paths.   When they were side by side, they were in identical formation and going at the same speeds.  Once or twice when they crossed it seemed they got out of synch but quickly went side by side again.   We watched them head south bound until we could not see them any longer from our balcony.  The sky was quite clear, some small, light clouds, temp. approx 73 with light breeze coming off of the bay.   The shape of the crafts were somewhat almond-shaped, with some type of haze surrounding them, moving very, very rapidly.  There were some distant planes in the sky but none of which were moving at any rate close to what these two crafts were going. ((CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mrs. ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for your telephone call, and for the excellent report!  We just received your son's report, as well. We will post your reports in the very near future.  If you find any other witnesses in your area, please let us know, and please encourage them to submit their reports to our site, as well. What was the apparent size of the two objects, relative to the size of the moon, or the planets, in the night sky, please?  How big did they appear to be? Thanks, again, for sharing the reports with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) Dear Mr. Davenport,   I will be working on witnesses tomorrow morning and will let you know if I find anything else out.     As for the size of the objects you'd have to know this info: ((name deleted--son)) and I were facing due-west, as looking out onto Palma Sola Bay from our balcony on the second floor.    I had a small map of the planet alignment that I was holding up and trying to relate Jupiter and Saturn to the left of the Moon.  ((Son)) first saw the objects and yelled for me to put the paper down.     They approached directly towards us but underneath the moon and were definitely closer to us than the planets and stars/Moon.  I would say that they were rather large, much larger than a plane that's for sure but in width especially.  I would venture a guess that they were maybe around an altitude of approx. 40 thousand feet or so, HOWEVER they seemed to pull back and forth quite a bit so maybe at some times were as low as 20 thousand feet and slightly higher than 40k ft.   They darted up and down and horizontally directly in front of us for less than a minute and then darted over towards the baseball park, where they didn't go directly over, but went more towards the north side of the park and seemed to almost stop for another half a minute or so.  Almost as if they hovered and then sharply flew north for a moment and then took a serious turn and headed south VERY quickly.   An interesting note was the fact that one of these objects seemed more stable than the other.  One was always crossing the other and seemed to want to stray but was pulled in next to the more stable object. I would also state that they were definitely following the coastline as they headed south.        As I had mentioned, I have been reading up and found something very uncanny regarding our sighting here, to someone in Scotland.  I've copied and pasted the reference....it's almost identical!  (Source http://www.rense.com/general6/discsspotted.htm) ((#2)) I do now believe that the objects may have been as low as 10 -15k feet at points last night.  I did observe some airplanes landing and based on recent flights that I have taken, I would have to say that they were probably at this level at a couple of points.   Hope this helps you.  ((name deleted)) ((#3)) Would it help if I drew you a picture of the objects and the paths they took? I can scan it over to you tomorrow if you would like.  ((#4)) You're very welcome.....   I've been reading on your site re: the many sightings here in Florida as well as in the local vacinity in which we live.  Up until last night, I had no idea what was going on down here! I'm amazed.   I use to tease my ex-husband about his ""sky watching"" and filming.  I will never, ever do that again!  I have tried to make a rational explanation for what we saw and just cannot do it. Nothing makes sense with this (I'm sure you've heard this before though).   I was really interested in the one report from a few years back of someone seeing crafts embodied in their own haze: THIS IS WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT!  No extra lights; the objects seemed to glow greyish from within and emit a brownish haze that encompassed each.   Anyhow, I won't take up your time here.......I'll scan over the picture(s) tomorrow morning for you.   Have a good evening Mr. Davenport. ((#5)) Dear Mr. Davenport,   Attached is my drawing of what we had seen last night.  If you have any problems w/this, please let me know as so I may clarify.  Hopefully you will get a better understanding of our view from the balcony.   Thanks again, ((NUFORC Note:  Please see illustration from witness on the NUFORC homepage.

We were sitting in lawn chairs when I looked up and saw a dark brownish-red object directly overhead. The object looked like a tube with each end rounded like a ball. It was undulating and twisting around slowly. After I determined it wasn't a bird or any other known object I ran into the house to get my camcorder. My wife, who wears glasses was unable to see the object mostly because she couldn't find it in the sky. It was moving in and out of the clouds. After I finally found my camcorder case inside I brought it outside and took out the camera, attached the battery and inserted a tape. All of which took some moments. By this time the object had moved off and was further away. When I first saw the object it was directly overhead and moving in a north - northeast direction. Now that I had the camera I moved across the yard to a spot where I could shoot through the trees at where I figured it would be by now. In a moment I found it and shot the attached video. The object was still moving to the north - northeast while clouds were moving slowly to the north. Today was a partly sunny day with rainclouds moving into the area from the south. My video camera has an onboard automatic focus and it kept trying to focus on infinity during the shoot, thus the image is sometimes out of focus. At one point I pointed the camera down to the top of some trees to force it to focus. As the object moves thru the trees it appears to remain focused. It then dissappeared into the cloud bank. My Hi-8mm camera has a 22x zoom which I had it zoomed full. The video is shakey because of this extreme zoom. I have a higher resolution version of this file as well as the 8mm tape.",2004-03-29T00:00:00,31.69650882352941,-89.11289705882352

We then saw a bright light flash on the horizon as if it was signaling the light up north towards Cape Coral and Sanibel Island. The light farther north glowed bright enough to see a reflection in the water and then all of the sudden it slowly split into three glowing objects. One went right  and one went left leaving the original duller but in the same place. The light on the right went faster and eventually behind trees out of sight. The one on the left stopped and went back to the original light and made it glow. At that moment the one on the horizon blinked again. While the north light disappeared leaving a dark spot in the sky. After about 4 or 5 minutes we thought it was gone when right in front of our eyes the Light on the horizon blinked again  and the light to the north reappeared. It glowed so bright this time that we compared it to the ALMOST full moon because the reflection on the water. The light then  split into three objects again and formed a triangle ( the light to the north) that moved across the sky slowly then darted out of sight the right which would be east.

It was faint and hard to see.  I could not tell if it was low enough to be picking up ambient lighting from the city streets here where I live, or if it was emiting a faint glow of it's own.  It looked very .....well it's hard to describe how it appeared....it looked like a made object, not an animal flying.  It took a very straight path in the sky and traversed the whole sky in around 15 seconds. No sound.  So if it was some kind of craft or plane,  and it had conventional (earthly) engines that we are used to,  it was way too high for me to hear,  meaning that it was indeed flying at some crazy speed akin to 2000 mph.  Weird.  I have never ever seen anything like that before.  The faintness of this object made it even eerier.  I am dumbfounded.  This object traveled in what looked like a nearly perfect north heading.  45 seconds after this,  as I scanned the sky wanting to catch sight of this object again,  a second object came into view.  Looking to my north, this object faded into view and appeared to be a shooting star.  It came from the direction that the first object was headed towards.  At first I really thought it was a shooting star and noticed the coincidence of it happening right after me seeing that first object.  The second object seemed to move at the same speed as the first...which was really fast.  The way it faded into view really lended to my thinking that it was a shooting star coming into the atmosphere.  This object looked as such for about 2 seconds,  but then as it got nearly overhead of me it turned red in color and changed course with what looked like a 90 degree turn towards the east.  It then continued east for about 1 second and then faded quickly from view.  I have never ever seen a meteor make a turn before,  I have seen them come into the atmosphere and slow down, turn colors, explode leaving trails of sparkles,  but never eber change course, especially a 90 degree turn.  This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this in the sky.  I look up to the sky all the time because I enjoy seeing the stars,  I like astronomy and science.

Around 11 pm on Friday night three of us decided to go to a local pub. Driving west on US route 6 out of Sheffield Lake towards Lorain Ohio at about 35 mph in light traffic, the road is only one lane in each direction and follows the southern shore of Lake Erie, homes line both sides of the road, the ones on our right have the lake as their backyard and are about 200 to 300 ft off the road. Myself and one other person are in the first vehicle and a friend was following in another. Ahead on the right is a cluster of trees near the city limits and through that I see a very bright white light appearing motionless. There are sometimes Medical helicopters traveling along the shoreline but this was not moving. As we cleared the trees there it was about 50 ft above the lake right next to a large 3 story house, a very bright white light that appeared to be star shaped but as we got closer you could make out faintly in the light a saucer shaped object with a dome on top and one red and blue light below it, steady not flashing. The light was very intense yet gave no reflection, not on the house or on the ground. Iam still driving westbound in some traffic, I slowed down and want to stop but unless you go into a driveway you can't. Then the object started moving, pacing us at about 30mph, still maintaining its position over the shore line and going behind houses, yet no reflection on anything. It looked to be about 20 to 25 ft in diameter and did not change it's appearance. My feind said be carefull driving, since I was staring at the ufo. All of a sudden a feeling of fear came over me, not just being afraid but near terror. I was driving ok and leaving about seven or eight car lenths behind the car in front because I was trying to make out exactly what the shape within that light was and keeping along side of it. Then I thought ""fear,fear what's with this fear."" Then all of a sudden the fear left and a felling of contentment repaced it. A close encounter ? I couldn't tell you but remember we're still going down the road. We were watching the ship the whole time when after about 5 blocks, we made the one traffic light, the ufo started to speed up, just got faster and faster heading in a westbound direction and climbing in the sky until it its light became a pinpoint and was over the horizon. The climb was very gradual as it excellerated away very smoothly, no sound was heard.  The sky was clear and when it was over I made a comment but my friend said nothing. The person following us didn't see a thing, said he was busy with the cd player in his car. I have sent in a few other reports from my part of the country but never anyting like this. The geographical location is near Avon Point on Lake Erie and I have read other accounts from here. Oh by the way, I downed a drink as soon as we got to the pub.

Other sightings here similiar to this have been reported several times in the past several years.  This time there was also a female witness besides me, and she too observed the same object, at the same time, as I did.  This is a TRUE story, and we were both surprised to say the least.  This object was really strange.  Anyway, I had been out for a dinner date with a friend, and was driving home when I just happened to look up out the front windshield of my automoble and saw a bright white light with something blinking on it.  At first, I thought it was probably an airplane or helicopter, because Bowling Green has a small airport located there.  Aircraft from our military bases at Fort Campbell and Fort Knox, Kentucky routinely refuel there.  But when I really looked at the object it remained stationary, and was not moving any at all.  The light was round, large, bright, and looked to be about the size of a large bus. A second large, bright, and round red ""strobing"" light was blinking on and off in the center of the object, and at times there also appeared to be smaller red lights in a row all along the outer edges of the object.  They too were blinking on and off, but not as rapidly as the center light.  The red light in the center seemed to be ""pulsating"" as it blinked on and off.  As I continued to observe the object, a female neighbor of mine drove up to park her car.  I asked her if she would take a look at what I was observing, and to tell me that I wasn't ""seeing"" things.  She did so and told me that she was seeing it too, and that it looked really weird.  We both continued to observe the strange object for close to thirty minutes.  This object, we both agreed, was truly something unusual, and not something conventional.  After more than forty minutes watching this craft, it slowly began to move sli! ghtly lower, but not landing.  We then went our separate ways because it was getting late.  This object appeared in the direction going toward Franklin, Kentucky/Portland Tennessee, leaving Bowling Green.  I have seen this thing before, and what it is I have no idea.  But it is strange and bizarre.  I do know that it is not a tower, star, airplane, helicopter, or satellite etc.  We both DID see this, and we are not making this story up.  Should this not be investigated?  Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the report is of a sighting of the planet, Venus.

First, I do not believe that this object we saw was the planet Venus.  I should have provided more information to you, and I apologize for that.  Me, and many others have seen this object before the night reported above.  Some have reported it on your web site.  It sometimes appears as a huge fireball, and it does move and zig-zag about too.  Sometimes smaller objects can be clearly seen underneath the larger object flying back and fourth.  At times the red lights are clearly visable on the object, and one time we even observed the craft through binoculars, and it appeared  diamond shaped glowing purple.  This thing even flew directly over my automobile late one night years ago.  I am not making this story up or anything like that.  We have had several strange sightings of triangular objects in this area before too.

I pulled the car into the driveway after picking my 13 year-old son up from a friends house (It was about 8:00pm). As we got out of the car my son pointed up and to the west of the house and said ""What in the heck is that""? I looked up and quickly said ""It's a Star of course"". My son then said ""That's the brightest star I've ever seen""!  I then took another look and my son was right. This object was far brighter than any other stars in the sky. It was a clear night. We watched this object for a minute and I could see individual lights on it that slowly rotated as the object would sway from side-to-side and move up and down in a gliding motion. I tried to tell myself it was an airplane, but many airplane passed by in the night sky and this objedt was far larger and brighter than any plane. The 4 or 5 lights on the object were white in color sometimes showing a redish light. It hovered around in one place in the sky slowly moving downward fro qbout 2 hours before I lost sight of it as is seemed to travel off into the distance towards the town of Colusa maybe. My son got scared and went in the house after watching for about 5 minutes. I got a little scare to when I realized that this was not a plane or a helicopter. This object was maybe 2 or three miles away (Hard to tell exactly).  It was silent as it hovered. Even more strange, another object ""entered"" the atmosphere high above in the sky while I watch for about 2 hours. I noticed the object above moving across the sky just like a satellite (a small blue dot) but then the ""satellite"" suddenly grew about 10 times in size and turned a bright yellow-orange color for about one second, and then returned to a small blue dot continuing to travel across the sky. This seemed to me to be something entering the atmosphere but could have been unrelated to the larger object I was watching.  I can't explain what this object was no matter how hard I try. I've never seen anything like this before. The battery on my camcorder was dead so I could not vide! otape th e object.

I was driving; therefore, I was unable to watch the entire time.  It had just gotten dark and we noticed what we thought was a plane above the trees on the road.  My friend mentioned that it was really low to the ground and I said, it was probably near an airport.   There were two very bright, square lights on it.  Then it looked like it was going to crash because it was heading straight for the ground and then it would even out.  Then the next time I looked at it was hovering straight down, slowly to the ground.   It was close enough to see the bright lights, they were separated and I it was not a normal shape, kind of like a triangle, but not close enough to see in detail so we decided to turn around (it was about ½ a mile until we turned because it was a highway) and we went toward the lights, on the same route, which we could still see through the trees.   We then turned on the nearest road to the lights, and discovering it was a cemetery I decided that were not going to drive around in the middle of the night, so we turned around and went back on the road to see if we could just stop on the side somewhere.   About 45 seconds after we turned around the lights disappeared, or turned off.  I was not going to submit anything until I saw a similar sighting just 12 days before in Kansas.

This is the 5th event I've encountered in the past 3 months, twice reporting to this board. It has increased in frequency and because of other events in conjunct with this, I am beginning to suspect other aspects of these 'sightings' might be in effect.  I was heading out to the garage to get a tool when I had this 'hunch' or sinking feeling about the night sky. I almost felt panicked, something I haven't felt since I was young boy and it was exactly the same feeling, specifically a feeling of being watched.  The temperature had dropped significantly, clearing the night sky for some good star viewing this evening. I look at the night sky each and every night, as well as study astrology and do some amateur astrononmy, so I am VERY aware of the placement of Venus, Mars and Jupiter and their present locations in the evening sky.  What I first thought to be Venus, was a bit too high yet in the sky for 8:25pm. I looked at it and kept looking at it, and thought it was odd that it looked to be as bright as it did back in late February, when it was much brighter. I continued to look at it and then it did the unexpected, it faded into a very faint dot, and then disappeared. I let out a laugh and said, ""I knew it..."" With that, I looked DIRECTLY above my head, 90 degrees, 12 O'clock and saw 2 more bright 'dots' or orbs' which were flying in an echelon right formation, heading due east. I yelled out, ""I SEE YOU!"" and with that, they faded from bright to dim dots and continued on their flight path.  I tracked them for about 30 seconds until I couldn't see them anymore and if ANYONE who looks at the light sky knows about simply watching planes, you can see a plane head on and notice lens flare, which catches your attention at first, then you know it's a plane of course when it approaches closer and then you usually can continue to track it as it heads out in ANY direction thereafter. No, these things were bright looking stars, lower than real stars or satelites even, then turned into dim dots (which then made them look more natural like stars). I hope this makes sense.  This is the most interesting part. I looked back in the direction of the first object and as I looked, it came 'zooming' back into full brightnest from being merely dim. This is NOT my first experience and in light of recent events, I anticipate these events to be more frequent and spectacular. I will try to keep my camera on me more readily, but I thought I MUST report this just in case someone else took notice of any of it.  Thank you for letting me contribute this...",2004-03-23T00:00:00,,

I happened to be looking out our living room window just after 8:30 this evening, when I saw a brilliant flash of blue-white light. My view was to the southwest, and the entire southwestern sky lit up. A good portion of the sky was lit up, well above the horizon. The houses and trees across the street were silhouetted. I've often watched summer thunderstorms approach our city at night, and tonight's flash was easily many times brighter than any lightning flash I've seen. I took a closer look outside and could clearly see stars and the last of the twilight from sunset an hour and 10 minutes earlier. There was not a cloud in the sky, although infrared satellite imagery currently (10:30 p.m.) shows light cloud. I checked my watch after scanning the sky for about a minute and saw that the time was just approaching 8:35.  About 10 minutes after the event, I saw a neighbor walking along the sidewalk in front of our house. He seemed to be gazing at the sky toward the southwest, but he disappeared down the street before I could go and talk to him.  There is a cellular telephone tower and a hydro substation, both about 3 km away, in the general direction that I saw the flash. I have seen nothing on this evening's news to indicate that they were involved in any mishap. There is nothing on the Environment Canada web site to indicate a lightning strike. Perhaps it was a meteor. I once saw a meteor create a brilliant flash in daylight when I was a child, and tonight's event was somewhat similar. Whatever it was, it was really bright.

We are used to seeing satellites and the ISS cross the night sky here, as we live in a fairly rural area with little light pollution.  What we saw were the same kind of steady pinpoint white light, similar to a faint star, that a satellite appears as. The very odd thing was that there were a fixed formation of three lights, that traversed the sky almost directly overhead from wnw to ese over a period of about 5-10 minutes. The lights formed the shape of an isosceles triangle, or Grekk letter Delta rotated anti-clockwise by 45 degrees. I would estimate that the lights that were furthest apart from each other (which were in ""line astern"" formation) subtended an angle of around 5 degrees from where I saw them.  I've checked with the database of satellite tracks at www.heavens-above.com, and none match the track and timings of the lights we saw for our latitude and longtitude.  I don't think these were aircraft. There was no noise, and no other navigation lights were seen.  These were not shooting stars. the lights were steady, and moved far too slowly and were visible for too long.  My opinion is that these objects were outside the earth's atmosphere. They appeared exaclty as satellites do in terms of speed and appearance, but the unique issue was that the lights were multiple and held exactly the same relative position throughout the sighting.  I am a qualified private pilot, and spent nine years with the British Army. I would consider myself to be very level headed. I fully expected to discover a rational explanation for these lights.  It could be that these were an array of three satellites which may not appear on publicly available listings. I'm happy to provide further details by email if you have any specific questions. I'm also happy to provide an electronic image of my impression of the object(s). ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, I've just discussed this with my wife, and we agree that the total time of the sighting was 4-5 minutes. And this was not a horizon to horizon sighting. I first spotted the lights as they were just east of Polaris, and we both lost sight of them as they were about 45-60 degrees above the horizon slightly North of due East. I was outside in our garden having a cigarette, and as I often see satellites during my nicotine fixes(!), I was idly scanning the night sky.  This was at 20:01 GMT (I'd just finished watching a TV show that ended at 21:00). When I saw the lights, it took me a minute or so to grasp the unusual significance, and then I dashed indoors to get my wife to come out and see them too. She followed me out, and we spent a good couple of minutes watching them before they slowly faded from view (I assume because of the particulates in the air and the reducing angle to the horizon). Thanks for the heads up on NOSS - checking the www.heavens-above.com database indicates that NOSS 2 or NOSS 2-1 are likely suspects, as the ground track and timings fits very well. Thanks for helping to solve the mystery. Regards from across the pond,  ((name deleted)) ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with the witness, and we suspect that he is an exceptional witness.   PD))",2004-03-23T00:00:00,,

It was not lit up, it seemed almost as if the reason I could see it was from the reflection of the sun or even the city lights. It seemed to be two ""X"" shaped or square but were on an angle looking and there was two of them, almost diagonal to each other, but very close to one another, and there could have been something I couldn't see attaching the two, and it could have been only one, with two X square shaped edges. They seemed to ""wobble"" as if hanging off a string and were an reddish-orangish color, going in a straight ""wobbly"" direction right across the sky towards the east.

It seemed to be in outer space, but yet didn't seem as high as planes go at 35000 feet, either it was much bigger, but I'm sure it was much closer.

While looking up at my dunking pole, I saw a giggantic flash towards west side of island that seeme to be over Kaena point area.  It was like the sky opened up and a bright flash much brighter and intense than halogen came out, but the flash moved from right to left in the pattern of the shape of a weak or lazy letter n. kind of like an eyelid shape, like a small hill icon shape. The thing that made it unusual besides the brightness and movement, was that it wasn't tiny like the hundreds of shooting stars we have seen siince childhood, a shooting star looks comparitively like looking at a small grain of rice in the distance, this flash that I saw was like looing at a D-battery or like if I was looking up from the inside of an old stlye overhead projector(flat glass drawing area) as a teacher dragged a piece of thick chalk maybe 2 inches long sideways across the whiteboard drawing area of the projector in the shape of a upper eyelid  or letter n.  I just happened to be looking up at the time this occurred and I immediately looked over about 60 feet to the other guy who was fishing by hisself to see if he saw it, but he was looking at his poles in the water.  This other guy was to my right alongside the boat-ramp section of the shoreline there.  Anyway, I went over to him and asked if he had saw that flash and he said he didn't but that he had saw a similar flash about 2 times before but a little more inland towards the sky over the Waianae Mountain side. Needless to say, we talked from that point on about what the hell is out there, and I kept saying I would call the morning talk show to see if anyone else had saw that flash in the sky (eerie), but instead I just telephoned my best friend here and told him what I had saw.

I did not see anything before it tilted nor after it ""untilted"". When it tilted it appeared to be off-white and I could only see the ""leading edge"" which was off-white. I never saw the entire object, just the part that tilted and ""became visible"". The object then apparently tilted back to its ""original"" position and became not-visible. It did not seem to be moving when I saw it. I heard no sound, nor did I expect to at that distance. The object, or rather the leading part of the object (off-white), arc shaped, was visible for only about 1-2 seconds. I took it to be a small plane making a turn (lots of cropdusters in this agricultural area - however they are always painted yellow) or maybe a white heron bird which are fairly common to the area. I kept my eye on the space in the sky where it had appeared and expected to find the answer to what I saw. I saw no planes or birds at all.

After the phone call my Wife, 8yr old son, mother-in-law,Father-in-law,and his grand daughter, all went out on the patio to look. My Wife Immediately called me after deciding that it was not a plane or a star. I was at Our residence waiting for her to come home when I recieved the call. We live aprox. 2 miles east of my mother-in-laws. When I looked up into the sky looking for what my wife was franticly describing to me, I found it immediately to the east of my location. My Nephew, His wife their two little kids, and My 12yr. old daughter all seen this Bright red glowing object that from my location looked to be a little bit larger than a star but much much more brighter, and it was very very red, about the same intensity that a red becon on a radio tower is but it stayed glowing bright red for about 10 min. and did not move. from my wifes vantage point she said it was ""f'n huge"" she said it was as big as my Chevy Blazer. and also said it was directly over the house. My Father in law also said it was very large, when I asked him if he held it out at arms length how big would it have been? he said about the size of a softball! They wathed it for about 10-15 min. when it started moving off to the west picking up speed as it got farther away. mean while I wathed it from my vantage point and watched it for 10-15 min. and then it slowly moved south, then it blinked a few times, got real dim, then it got real bright again and headed in a westerly direction at a very fast rate of speed till I lost it behind some trees obstructing my view. Mean while the cousin who first spotted the object had arrived home and was out watching it also. His observation was pretty much the same as mine except when it started to head off in the Westerly direction he observed it split into two peices. Which kind of makes sence to me because his street runs east to west and he would not have any trees obstructing his view. Incidently, Brookpark,Ohio borders Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. and My mother-in-law lives less than a mile and a half from the airport. The flight path of this thing would have been within a half mile of the airport. The next day one of the news statons reported the UFO along with a pixelated still photograph. and a report from some local astronomer that what everybody saw was actually the suns reflection off of the international space station. Bull Crap! This thing hovered, moved left to right and then off into the distance. And I know for a fact the Brookpark police were bombarded with phone calls on this thing and they had no idea what it was.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

The object was hovered over farm crops.  I instantly noticed how peculiar the object was as I moved closer.  I drove side by side with the flying object for about 15-30 seconds and observed it moving in the motion of a sting ray.  The object was very large and had bright white and blue lights on it.  As I traveled north I noticed it did the same, but weaved backwards and proceeded forward.  I continued to watch the object through my rearview mirror and I noticed that it was moving as if it were sowing something.  I immediately thought of crop circles.  The object was making a wave-like motion and traveling back and forth, it was a huge dark triangle with lights on it and not too far off the ground but high enough to be flying (like I said about 150-200 ft).

This is an additional report that was not reported this year. The exact day was the second Friday in March of this year(no calendar handy). These craft may have been military technology. The witness in this incident is the same person with me in the 08-31-05 Kentfield report. Me and my friend were sitting above Pantoll in Muir Woods on Mt. Tam. We had noticed high airline traffic during dusk with jets flying at 10,000 and 30,000ft range traveling north to south which is typical. Two crafts were observed exactly fifteen minutes apart before complete darkness. The first craft was definitely a military jet flying at approximately 60,000 to 70,000 ft leaveing contrails the jet was very quiet but an engine still could be heard and it was painted black. Fifteen minutes later a glowing orange disc was seen on the same exact path as the military jet and was moving at around the same speed which could only be estimated at 2,500 to 3,500 mph. I thought it could have been a test run of the SR-71 and our captured redesigned alien technology at work. This orange craft was slighty higher in altitude and was noiseless and stayed the same color at all different angles and was observed for about 45 seconds.  Note: The craft from the 08-31-05 report was traveling upwards from the ocean and was white/yellow/red verses this craft that was on the same military route and glowing more orange.  Note: The craft from 03-97 was in the upper atmosphere and was traveling north to south along the coast but it was stopping and starting over and over. This craft changed from black(cool to orange to red to white(high speed) and then back to black when it would stop. It did this maybe 20 or 30 times and also had about 30 to 45 seconds of air time before disappearing verses a jet liner that averages 3 to 4 minutes to traverse the sky.

We left his house and proceeded to drive around the local fields shining deer. We saw 3 6 point bucks and a few does throughout the night. As we saw less and less deer we took it easy...listening to the radio and talking about what would be going on the following weekend. We lost track of time and headed back towards home slowly at around 11pm sometime, driving slowly to shine deer in the fields on the way back to his house. We turned on the road he lives on(dead end) and proceeded down to his house(going South). As we came closer to his house I noticed an orange glowing craft which looked like it was over his neighbors house. As we got closer we noticed that it wasn't. It was infact sitting completely still about 150 yards into the field just beyond their house from the road and about 170 or so yards inward from the North. The craft was like a glowing orange about the size of a full moon at night..so it seemed some-what big...but since we had no background reference we couldn't tell how far away it was therefore unable to determine its size. How we came to find out where this craft was was when it began to move. Anyways, I pointed at it from the passenger side and told him to look(he was driving). And we slowed down to a stop where it was almost perfectly parralel to us out the driver side window. This was not a normal orange glow, but rather look like fancy flares of light being emitted from this craft. At the very ""center"" of this craft it was a very bright orange/white color, and as light emitted from it, the light very quickly became a very dark orange. We sat there for about 6 or 7 seconds watching this still craft in the air which was ""over"" the tree line to us...so we also couldn't tell exactly how high it was. But to find out later, it was only about 40-50 ft off the ground. After those few seconds where it was completely still and making no sound, the craft began moving towards the north at an undeterminable speed because as stated before, we couldnt tell how far away it was. The action in which it took off was very unique, it went from a dead stop and began moving north which we found out later to be at a VERY slow speed because it was so close. It's stop to go motion was exactly like seeing an aircraft flying in the air on video, pausing it, and then playing it again. In other words, it seemed to just ""be"" at that speed...no acceleration. Anyway, after those few moments of watching it travel to the north it, I promptly had to the idea to shine our spot light at it in which my friend grabbed the spot light and quickly aimed the light at it and I bluntly told him to Hit IT! He shined the light once at it for about a duration of 1/5-3/4 second. Almost immediately after that, the craft blinked a large blue light back at us from the ""upper right"" area of the craft. It was pretty big and could see that the light was being emitted from some sort of ""stick"" which was simply a rod that had to brightest glow and the actual emitting light was a bit darker. Right after that I said HIT IT AGAIN and he did and it flashed a big blue light at us a second time! I dont remember what I said next, but he flashed the light a third time and the craft emitted two flashes of light very quickly, and when we signaled back a fourth time it then emitted two slow flashes of light, acknowledging our signals to it. It was just a moment of awe...a few moments later to object finally got the the point where we couldnt watch it very good from the truck...so we both got out and began walking down the road in the direction it was flying(N).  When it finally got to the end of the field(north side, still a ways in) we finally saw its light shining off the tree tops it was heading toward. It was 10-15ft above the trees and as it approached one tree, it ""jumped"" up in the air a ways as if it were going to hit it. Then it came back down to the exact height it was previously at and was again close to another tree still heading north at the same speed. It then ""jumped"" over the second bigger tree, came down a bit, and ""leaped"" over the third tree. All three of which are in his neighbors horse pasture behind their house, right next to the field. Still at the same speed, it went behind some other trees(pine) where we couldn't see it very good...after awhile it finally got past the trees and began heading north-west and slowly flew over his other neighbors house and stopped above a tree in their front lawn(about 120 yards or so from where we were standing)...after hovering there a bit it slowly came down til it got to about 3-4 feet above the ground. Since we started getting so many references it was very clear this ""craft"" was only 3-3 1/2 feet in diameter. When it came down that low to the ground, its color changed a bit to be a little more white than orange and was softer and less intense. It hovered there behind the branches for must have been an entire 3 or 4 minutes...but it seemed like it was forever. It was like it was just as curious about us as we were of it. Then, the craft began to rise up and change back a bit more towards orange and got about 10 feet above the same tree and it seemed like it began changing shape. At the angle we were at at this point, looking up at it, its background was the sky. So it seemed like this object began changing shape of some sort but really it began flying directly away from us at a very small angle towards more trees. We began to slowly follow it down the road and after 20-25 seconds or so it finally got behind some trees where we could no longer see it. In this area it wasn't bare maple or oak trees anymore, it was pine trees so it was almost impossible to see it through them. We stopped a little ways before the driveway of the last house and waited for it to pop back out. After maybe 2 minutes it finally crept up above the trees at the end of the road over the trees and someones house heading west-north west. As it disappeared down at the end of the road we looked at each other with our eyes big and mouths open and we took off running towards his house...completely forgetting that the truck was parked in the middle of the road. When we got to the house, just my friends mom was home but she was asleep. We ran in amazed at what we saw, grabbed a bunch of smokes, a pop and ran back to the truck. We wanted to tell the people who were there previously what we saw but at that time everyone had left. We started it up, whipped it around, and took off down the road going North. We got to the end of the road, and began heading west down the road. I was the passenger again and I was watching the sky and fields out my window to see if I could find it. We got about 1/2 mile down the road and took the first gravel road that went north. Both sides of the road were fields for about 1/4 mile, then a thick woods again. As we drove down the road I thought I spotted a light in the woods on the left side, up the road and a little ways in. So we stopped and got out to see if we could see it from a better angle. The light was pretty big, a white center and a red glow much bigger than the previous flying object. We decided we needed to look closer since it just may have been a yard light, very doubtful since it would have to shine brightly through about 100 acres of woods :-) But we had to look closer and see what it was, after all, there was an old cabin back there, maybe someone was occupying it. As we got closer we couldnt see it, and as we got to the woods, we watched out the driver window to see if we could see it. We couldn't. So we got a ways down the road and turned around, and looked again on the way back. We got back to the fields and turned around and still the light was there in the woods. We drove towards it again to see if we could see it, we couldnt. So we turned around again and came back, doing it 2 more times. But on the last time we were on our way back driving up the hill with woods on both sides of us and the fields 1/8 mile ahead of us. We drove up the hill going kinda slow and there it was. A silverish metallic ball about 3ft in diameter shining off our headlights with three lights on it, all flashing in one by one sync with each other. There was two on top next to each other spaced out and one in the center below those two. Flashing very quick blue-white lights. First the top left would flash on and off, then the top right, then bottom and back to the top left. This pattern was done very very quickly. Probably 4-5 rounds a second. It was on the right side of the road about 4 feet off the ground and you could see perfectly it was self luminous, glowing white a bit. It was maybe 40 yards from us. It was stationary for only about 5-6 seconds, enough time for me to scream to turn the truck around...but he didnt, he seemed eager to drive by it. It then floated over to the left side of the road, by that time we were pretty close, at this time I was so frightened I began letting my head to look downward so I couldn't see it, and as I did...poof, gone. Even though it was gone I still remember lights being infront of us for some reason...but anyways, we slowly continued to drive down the road going south. We didn't say a word until we back on the highway going back towards his house. Even then we said very little, a few ""no way""'s and a few more simple phrases. When we finally got to his house....we could barely talk about it. It was like there were no words because it didn't even begin to process yet. The entire experience was just so powerful for us to understand right away. He then decided to goto bed and I took the truck home back to my step dads. That's where it started to sink in, because I had to haul in somethings to sleep on from a camper we had without a flash light. One by one I hauled in a small matress, a big pile of blankets and pillows in 3 trips. I didn't want to sleep because I thought I was going to be abducted or something or that I'd look up in the sky and I'd see another craft. I had a negative attitude towards this expierence for awhile, but then I realized it what was obvious. That it was only frightening to us, and they had no intension of scaring us at all. It was just our first expierence with something that isn't supposed to be real. Once I finally came to terms with it and realized how great and amazing it was, it started to sink in a little that we both had a form of contact with this craft that almost without an any doubt was from another world in my mind. It's technology seemed so unbelievable. When it would fly and and ""jump"" over the trees, it seemed to be completely unaffected by force as it were independent from traditional forces like G forces. It's moves were slow, controlled and flawless. It moved as if forces did not exist at all. It's pretty obvious that this craft was surrounded by an electromagnetic field. Although I cannot account for the magnetic part, I assume it. The luminosity is a by-product of oxygen/nitrogen? emitting photons caused by the electric field. I do not know if the second craft we saw was the same as the first one. Ever since the sighting I have been into UFO's. Reading about them quite a bit, researching them and watching for them. Since then I have had another expierence of a craft in which I will be reporting which took place about a month later, during the light of day, above our car as we left the city. Both of these sightings happened during the time when Wisconsin was having all the sightings last year. The way I understand these craft to work...it seemes to be connected to electrogravity theory. Where the craft is made out of key material(zinc/iron alloy as I understand) This craft is then surrounded by a strong electromagnetic field allowing the craft to infact have ""poles."" The field is strong and precise enough to where the motion of the charged particles allows the craft to ""free"" itself from gravity once it reaches a certain point. Many people say ""they"" cannot come here because the distances are so vast. When at the same time science has a way of explaining it, and I believe this is the way it works. Once the craft is in the previously stated condition, I believe, is no longer affected by force carrying particles outside of the craft. The craft then uses some technique(possibly Element 115, if it's true that the strong nuclear force can be used for space/time compression) to allow itself to propel towards a wave of gravity that the craft creates itself and allowing it to accelerate to unbelievable speeds instantly. A lot of new research has shown gravity may be faster than light, maybe even constant. The craft may also use a secondary measure when traveling through space. Once it is understood by us, a long time from now, space and time can be bent. And when we understand it enough, we will be able to control and or manipulate it to our advantage for faster-than-light travel in space. I am a computer scientist specializing in the field of security. I also study quantum mechanics and plan on attending college in the field of Nuclear Physics soon.

My co-drivier was asleep in the back. I spotted 5 to 8 bright lights in the sky south of us, in a crooded line from about 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock, they were orange in colour and stationary. I figured they were flares until one moved upward. After about 10 minutes of observation, I pulled my truck over on an offramp and parked. At the place I pulled over, there was noone else, it was a small construction site with a large pile of dirt. I got my camera, a 35 MM auto everything deal, and exited the truck, watching the objects, I climbed to the top of the pile and proceeded to take pictures. they moved a little, blinking on and off, and moving 5 to 10 degrees toward or away (up and down) from each other. I ran out of film, after taking a full roll (I reloaded once) of 24 exposures and 6 exposures on the other roll, watched for 30 to 45 minutes, then, pursuant to my schedul, I took off. I could see them almost all the way to AZ. Unfortunately, The film did not turn out, as Walmart's photo dept is incompetent, however, I still have the negatives, as well as a small notebook with specific date and times from my first noting them, until I lost them in light pollution, but they are somewhere in the chaos I have in my house since I moved. The weather that night was extremely clear, no clouds. I was wide awake, having just awaken in California, and started driving 3 hours before. 1) The strange things were that, even though I pulled over on a rough road, my co-     driver did not awaken, as any driver will tell you they will when the truck stops 2) I remember clearly the stop was 20 to 30 minutes, yet, I lost very little time in the log book, I even had time to get back in the truck to recover my spare roll of film!  The objects were clearly round, but not bright like a star or a light would be, more like a glow in the dark decal would be, except not green, but a orange colour. if they were 25 feet wide, I would put them at 1600 to 1800 meters away.  I will give a more full report when I find my notebook, and possibly rescan the negatives, when I get my scanner installed. Maybe Walmart just hosed up the prints.

In the front of the craft there was a small square window with light inside and another one on the side of the craft about the same size.  The under-side of the craft had everything molded inside except for what appeared to be four thrusters on each corner of the craft.  The first craft that performed the maneuver was a round sphere and was lit inside enough to make out a lattice-work frame, but could not make out anything else.  We watched the two craft for about 2 minutes and we noticed 2 more of the spheres coming from the north as the others had.  These two were identical the first sphere and like the first were coming in at an incredible speed but when they came in behind the rectangular craft, instantly matched its speed which was probably less than 20 MPH.  All of this was done without creating one single sound.  We could hear cattle bawling of in the distance and even birds rustling in the brush, but nothing from the four craft.

PD)) UFO sighting in Exeter - again  By Adam Dolge adolge@seacoastonline.com    EXETER - There was something odd in the sky last week, something that caused a Navy veteran with 10,000 hours of flight experience to have his own close encounter. The former flight engineer, who wished to be identified only as ""David,"" said of the experience, ""this was like nothing I’ve ever seen before.""  What the retired Navy chief petty officer said he saw last Wednesday could only be classified as a UFO, an unidentified flying object.  It was a bright and sunny afternoon, about 3:15 p.m., and David was outside preparing his lawnmower. He had filled the mower with gas, checked the oil, and took a sip from a glass of water he had poured. When he tilted his head back to get the final sip, through the bottom of the glass he saw a large cigar-shaped object hovering in the sky.  David said windows were equally spaced around the object, however he didn’t see anyone or anything inside. The size of the object was enormous. By comparison, he said, consider what an ultralight plane would look like next to a Boeing 747. He said it was about the size of two USS Nimitz aircraft carriers.  At first glance, through his empty glass of water he thought it could have been the Hood blimp. ""But, the instant I put my glass down, I said, ‘that’s not a blimp.’""  The object moved from west to east, very slowly for something that size, he said. His initial instinct was that the object was moving at about 100 knots, but something that big shouldn’t be able to stay in the air if it’s going that slow, he said.  The object began changing colors from a bright silver to an orange-ish red. A strange cloud of red and orange flames began surrounding the object, and before he knew it the object stretched out like a rubber band. It grew to about twice its original size, and then it was gone.  The entire incident lasted about 10 minutes, he recalled Monday morning, but he is unaware of the specific time because, ""it felt like time stopped.""  He went into his house and first thought to call the police. He decided not to because he didn’t think they’d take him seriously. So he went on the Internet and searched for ""report UFO,"" and found the Web site for the Seattle-based National UFO Reporting Center.  Peter Davenport, director of the UFO reporting center, said David’s report was astonishing because of his history with flight. ""I have no question on his reliability.""  He said he gets several accounts each year, but this one stood out. The report was well written and scientific, Davenport said.  ""In my view, that’s one of the cardinal rules of an account,"" he said.  The center was founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert Gribble. The center’s Web site, www.nuforc.org, has a large list of UFO sightings. According to the site, the center’s primary function is to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have witnessed possible UFOs. David’s report, which will soon be on the Web site, will be among dozens of documented sightings to be formally reported to the center.  Not the first time  The Exeter area is no stranger to UFO sightings. In 1965, two Exeter police officers and hitchhiker Norman Muscarello, who was with them, gained national attention after seeing a UFO hovering over Route 101 in Kensington. The sighting was documented in a book called ""The Incident at Exeter.""  And then there was the incident involving Barney and Betty Hill, a husband and wife from Portsmouth who claimed to have been abducted by aliens. The couple was driving from a vacation in Canada in 1961 when they saw a UFO.  The object moved directly over their car, and before they knew it they grew drowsy. They later claimed to have been abducted by aliens and gave identical accounts while they were hypnotized.  But for this recent sighting, David said he believes that there is life beyond Earth. He said the galaxy is so enormous, it’s hard to believe humans are the only intelligent life.  ""To the point of not being obnoxious, it’d be egocentric to think there is no other life out there.""

He looked up and became transfixed, not moving or saying anything.  I asked what was he looking at and he just pointed straight up and said, ""Will you look at that.""  Directly above us, fixed among the stars, was an extremely large, silent triangular craft that seemed to just float along.  Intermittantly flashing lights travelled in irregular patterns, to and fro, blue and red with a smidge of yellow in the mix.  We both stood in the roadway and watched it hover and move in a straight line until it passed from sight over the horizon of pine trees.  We spoke only of this to ourselves for the longest time, fearing ridicule.  No one tends to believe two 16 year olds with overactive imaginations.  As an epilogue to this strange event, one night my wife and I were watching Unsolved Mysteries in the mid-'90's and Robert Stack did a report of strange triangular craft seen in the SE Virginia corridor and, upon seeing their re-creation of events, I bolted from my chair and hollered out, ""That's it!  That's what we saw back in high school!""  My father-in-law, an ex-US Airforce officer, was sitting on the couch and had been in an animated state up to that point.  Upon my recognition of this craft, he stopped all he was doing and then just stared at me for about a half minute.  He then arose from his seat and walked--zombie-like--from the room.  He refused to speak of it to me and, from that moment on, I knew what we had seen was not open for discussion.  This told me the Air Force already knew all about it.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,32.2339,-92.6756

A friend was with me but she fell asleep just seconds before I saw this brilliant blue like a arc welders light on off ramp grassy area at I 80 interchange at Overton NE. My dashlights turned red. There were other reports of strange lights in area bt were attributed to weather inversions. 67 and 68 were banner years for ufos in midwest. Saw some other strange lights but nothing since. 10 years before that I was at the site of an alleged abduction near Kearney NE. Airforce debunked that as a hoax and the man was rumored as mental case BUT I saw his file. I was later told it was impossible that I would see his file but a lay at the courthouse was evidently as curious as I and she showed me when I asked. The paper from a mental evaluation said he was normal. Later in 1990 I wrote a song about it. In 1993 I wrote a screenplay which became a published audio book. Although most of book was satire; the account was quite accurate. Since my ufo encounter I have become quite a inspired writer and have had dreams that would come true. My latest creation is the ""Millennium Song"" published lyric in a national country music roundup publication Jan 2000. A group Millennium.org should have that in there archive. I also met a actress known for her interest in ufos in early 1970s. That has also inspired my interest. I was a rockabilly on tv in the 50s and folk blues writer from 60s till now. I also work as a custodian at a school in area. I sent my story to Hollywood in 1993 and had good comments from one director. But no  movie has been produced. I however felt like I might be the real mister millennium considering all the strange things that have happened. It was probably just a coincidence that ""Millennium"" tv show and X Files came a couple of years after my book circulated the studios.",,,

There was a naval air station very close to town, so we were accustomed to see various aircraft flying over the town. On this particular night the sun had set and the last few rays were a purple-orange color high in the clouds.  As we remarked on the nice evening, I caught a glimpse of an orange glimmer off the window of an aircraft. At first I thought it was the sun reflecting off a normal aircraft. It was no ordinary aircraft and we stopped in the first available parking lot to observe more closely. To our wonderment, this saucer-shaped craft was performing maneuvers above us!  At first, it simply hovered about the height that a small aircraft would fly - maybe 1000-2000 feet up. It made no engine noise. There was a row of what appeared to be windows completely encircling the center edge (as if two plates were placed together with the inner sides facing each other). These ""windows had vertical supports evenly spaced aroung the craft, like plate glass windows. They glowed a deep orange from inside the craft. The last rays of the sun glinted off the edge of the craft. The body was a dark metallic color, darker than a commercial aircraft. It began to move for a total of three maneuvers. First, it tilted at about 30-40 degrees and hovered. Suddenly it shot away so quickly we thought it was gone, only to find that it had moved across the sky at that same angle. It remained at the angle and then began to angle itself in a different direction. This time it moved in short quick motions, reangling itself toward another portion of the sky. It took off and we again found it by following the line formed by the angle from the leading edge. This was all very startling and my hair stood on end. We began to feel that we were truly watching a spacecraft. Within a few seconds more this craft just shot out into the sky and was gone in an instant. I have never discussed this with anyone other that close friends and family. We did, however, call the naval air station to report what we had seen.  Every time I hear of something like this I get chill bumps remembering the night we saw this incredible sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in 1971 is approximate.

We wern't looking up but we noticed something.  We got really quiet.  There was literally no sound what-so-ever.  The dogs, horses, and  all other stuff was utterly quiet.  What we saw were three lights.  (JUST LIKE THE ONE ON THE IMAGE YOU HAVE FLYING OVER THE OUTLINE OF MISSOURI) It came in from the north and made no sound at all.  it flew directly south... STRAIGHT SOUTH!!!  It moved extremely slow.  It made a hard right turn and it was at this time that it broke the speed it had moved at the whole time. It moved faster, but not real fast.  We watched it go toward the horzion  until we couln't tell the difference between it and the stars.  When it passed overhead, it was low enough that the lights from the garage seemed to reflect off of it.  Literally, it seemed to be only a few hundred feet off the ground.  I have to say, it made NO SOUND AT ALL.  Until it turned, it never broke speed.  In turning,  it didn't actually turn.  but just changed directions.  It was unmistakably a triangle.

I am a female, raised in TN, who at the time of this sighting was about 26 years old. While friends and family members have had very vivid UFO sightings, this is only one of two sightings for me, but this was the most vivid experience that I have ever had.  I have never heard of anyone seeing an object like this until I read about something eerily similar tonight on your web page (sighting dated March 23, 2004), so I thought that I should maybe share this. I can not remember the exact date, but I clearly remember that it was between 13:30 and 14:00 hours. I was traveling down a long, straight road that usually has frequent activity, like plenty of birds, squirrels, cars, deer, wind, etc.  It was a lovely, crystal clear afternoon and my windows were down. Halfway along, I realized that there was total stillness - no breeze, animals, cars, nothing. I slowed the car from around 55 mph to about 20 mph and began actively looking for signs of life.  There was NO movement except an airplane very high in the sky until I noticed, in a separate part of the sky, an absolutely perfect, shiny, smooth, seamless, metalic silver sphere at an undiscernable altitude. I slowed down even more and tried very hard to evaluate what as going on here.  My mind kept trying to make it something, like how the mind will fill in the gaps for a cartoon strip without conscious effort. I calmed myself and tried to just take pure data.  I couldn't pull over because there were no shoulders, but I used the tree horizons to establish a spacial context for myself and the flying object. That was when I began to see the true peculiarity of this object. Fundamentally, it was flying in a straight line, maybe a very slight curve, from west to east. But what I saw was a display of confounding physics - the object appeared to be going very, very slowly but it was gaining sky-ground quickly. I tried hard to determine if it was jumping, coming in and out, but no - it practically looked stationary, but it would have suddenly moved a good sized distance. I feel almost unable to describe how strange this was, how clear but confusing. This unnatural physics disturbed me more than it's unfamiliar and very captivating shine and shape.  I kept my eye on it. When I arrived at a spot where I could pull over, I stopped the car, still watching it, slowly opened my door, kept watching, got out slowly (still no birds, cars, or even a breeze), had it with my naked eye for about 3 seconds and then it vanished. Just there then gone. I continued to watch the sky for about 1 minute and then there were two cars, birds started flying, and then I realized I could hear all the usual, daytime sounds where before there only had been that very still, stifled silence.  Life came back into action.  Everything went normal. The stillness and silence lifted like a frickin' blanket pulled off.  I felt worried that I had lost time, so I checked when I arrived at the library. I don't think I lost any time, but if I did, it was 15-20 minutes at most. For me, what was most striking was the crystal clear day, the seeming simplicity of the shape, and the bizaare accompanying stillness and silence, like time had stopped.   What confounded me and convinced me that the entire event was a UFO sighting was the peculiar and unexplainable physics of the object's non-motion/motion across the sky. I felt remarkably clear-headed and calm for the remainder of the day, which I also found a bit bizaare. Why I'm reporting it now is because I just read, for the first time, that someone else saw perfect, shiny spheres on a crystal clear (exact words!) afternoon.  This struck me.  Same shape, same conditions.  So I wanted to add my experience.   Thank you for collecting the data. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Now I'm a rare divorced dad, with  full custody of three children.  So I asked them where they would like to go, ""lets get Grandma and go to Salt Lake City as she always wanted to see it"" was the unanimous desician , my Olds Cutlass Supreme was a great road car and in perfect condition so it was loaded with camping gear and ready to go!

While driving from Maryhill on the freeway {84), I was thinking about the Hanford Atomic facility somewhere to the north, as we were headed west.  Grandma said ""Look at those three funny airplanes"" , looking north,   I saw three, black, triangular objects, above the other side of the river gorge, headed our way, and grandma and kids were talking with great excitement!   Suddenly, as my eyes were on the road,  everything quit working, engine, dash lights, radio, CB, so I  coasted over to the side of the road--wondering what's going on ?

I got in the car, started up fine, everything working,  except the dashboard clock--we all acted dazed and dis orented--we decided to stop in the next town and get something to eat--and then continue on and see the dinosaurs at Fossil Or, that excited  everyone, so we stopped at a drive in at The Dalles, The Man In Black!  While munching our burgers and fries, the hair on the back of my neck stood up as if some one was behind me, I turned around and this Man was sitting two tables away, not eating but just staring at us, nothing was on his table and I sensed danger!   I stood up and walked over to him, he was thin (like a person that had rickets), olive-brown skin, coal black hair and beady eyes framed by bushy-black eyebrows and pointed chin!  Black shoes and suit, white shirt--feeling this was unreal asked ""May I help you with something?""   He shot back crisply, ""Where are You Going""? Feeling very uneasy I stated ""going to take the family down to Fossil, and see the sights""!   He replied, in a low but distinct  voice, 'DO NOT GO DOWN THERE, THINGS BIGGER THAN HOUSES, COMES  IN OVER  TOPS  OF THE TREES, !""  With that he stood up and went out the door,  stunned, I went back to our table and discussed the events of the day and it dawned on us that some how we were unable to account for three hours  of time, and then this weird guy,  Then we all saw him drive very slowly by the side glass door of the diner, in a very black- highly polished utility truck. (painters vans we called them then}, just staring at us as he passed by . Quick vote, panic setting in, lets go home quick!  Down highway 97 we raced, past Bend Or, we started feeling a little safer, Forest road, star lit sky, was beautiful,  Then a Big Black Car passes us like we were standing still, with that Same face looking at us as he passed, (I was doing 65 mph).  And was quickly out of sight.  Everyone was quite upset again!   I  mashed the gas  pedal  up to 80 and let it roll, quicker out of there the better!  Again that black car, with that stern face passed us again,  Panic now, find a place with people, Grandma found Dechutes State Campground on the map just ahead., quick right turn, and there standing by the side of the road,  was that strange man.!  This Is Nuts!! Shaking, I quickly found a camp site near the bathroom, removed my 30-30 from the trunk, and stood guard the rest of the night!!!   Next morning we traveled on home, wondering what had happened! Still don't  know!  The Oldsmoble never ran after that trip, too many  problems with it!  The storm?  That when the Estes Dam broke.  Was the man in black bad or good, good I think, but I don't want to meet him again,  Thank you!  The missing three hours, just gone, not sure I want to know!   Other strange experiences, yep, since I can remember, UFO  perhaps, don't know!  Sincerely  .",2005-10-11T00:00:00,42.1193,-123.60280000000002

I am an electronic (Retired) technician and know what I am talking about. In the evening of April 25, 1966 (I am getting a lot older and want to leave this information with someone), at 8:25 pm over the city of Reading, PA, I witnessed the most beautiful sight I have ever seen. The weather was beautiful, a cloudless sky with the sun just having set in the west.  We were on daylight saving time.  The temperature was about 74 degrees with no wind and 100% visibility. The sighting lasted from 3 to 4 minutes. I don't know what made me look up into the sky in the east at the right time but the object was at about an 80 degree angle and was a green fuzzy ball.  It descended in an arc, much like that of a rainbow.  First seen it was at an altitude of about 5000 feet.  It stopped at an altitude of approximately 1000 feet at a distance of about 10 miles.  Its decent took only about five seconds.  When it stopped at 1000 feet about ten miles away it started towards me at a very slow speed.  It took about 4 or 5 minutes until the object appeared over my head at about 100 feet at 85 degrees. I had a fantastic view from beginning to end and did not take my eyes off of this object until it was out of sight. I sent a report to MUFON and never really heard anything from them. To make a long story short I will now tell you what it was that I saw without going into any more detail. It would take me too long to put all the information here. This object was clearly a vehicle that emitted electro-magnetic beams of energy which could be seen quite clearly in the form of lines of maxwell, which are magnetic lines of force.  Completely silent, the object was < > as you see here.  It was 10 to 12 feet high and 30 to 36 feet long. It moved from southwest to northeast at approximately 15 to 20 miles per hour. One might ask how anyone can see a magnetic field!!  Simply, the spinning of the object was the key to the force of the field which made it visible to the naked eye.  I could go on and say much more but I will not. I believe the government is misleading and knows and if they don't they better soon know the truth about this beautiful and wonderful invention. I have several theories which I will not divulge at this time. It was real, I am real, and I hope people will come to realize the truth",,40.33998809831824,-75.94901358344114

This refers to the sighting mentioned earlier in this site over Fort Smith, AR in the Summer of 1966 or 1967. I believe the date to be August rather than July, but otherwise the same event. I was 11 or 12 years old at the time.  I am a retired USAF fighter pilot, so this event has always been a memorable event. I remember the accounts at the time of the three lights, although that is not what I and my parents saw that evening.  A relative called about 2100 all excited about the UFOs that were ""about to land out near the airport"" (where else?).  What the previous writer failed to mention was the significance of the Coca-Cola bottling plant locaton.  The Coke plant was within a half mile of the Fort Smith Municiple Airport.   Fort Smith is quite hilly with tall trees.  The area around the airport provides the largest view of the sky, Therefore was the area where people congregated to see the sights that evening.  Local AM radio station KFSA (there were'nt any FM stations in town yet) had set up a mobile broadcast near the airport to provide a live account of the sightings.  As I remember, the first name of the on-air personality was Bill.  The station normally ended its daily broadcast at midnight, but stayed on well past midnight for this event.  A sizeable crowd gathered there and could be heard in the background on the radio.  My parents and I stepped out into our back yard to take a look at about 2100.  We saw only a yellow/orange/white single light moving slowly along the southern sky on a westerly heading.  It was moving slowly; about normal final approach speed for aircraft of the day.  There was no sound.  The radio reporter and people near him were watching the same object.  Surprisingly, the object began to accelerate until it was going so fast, I lost it in the trees.  This would certainly have been impressive accerlation for any aircraft of the day, or today.  Yet I heard nothing like afterburners or any jet noise. My dad went to bed, but my mom and I stayed up to watch and listen to the radio.  It was an extremely clear moonless night.  For quite a while nothing happened.  The radio reporter was running out of much to say when suddenly at about 0100 the crowd that could be heard on the radio became excited.  The reporter stopped mid-sentence to look then said, ""Yes, out of the northwest...""  We looked and there was the most fascinating sighting.  An object of very distinct shape was traversing the sky on a southeasterly heading at what, even today after all my military flying, I would say was very high altitude and very fast.  The shape was razor sharp and clear; a V or boomerang shape. There was no sound and no visible contrail. As an 11-year old, I had chills.  It was a little scary at that age.  Interestingly, the object slowed as it neared the southeastern horizon (the direction of the airport from our house), turned west and appeared as the earlier orange slow moving light.  Nothing more was seen by us that night or following nights.  Local newspaper articles recounted the event the next day.  They reported contacting Little Rock AFB about the sighting.  They reported no activity in the area.  So, what was it?  In all my military flying from 1977 until 1997, I never saw anything like this; nothing not easily explained.  So, the memory of this childhood sighting, witnessed by hundreds, has been a mystery.  I have three theories.  At the time, Little Rock AFB had a wing of B-58 Hustler strategic bombers.  The B-58 was a supersonic delta wing bomber that was one of the first to be built with new structural technologies and materials.  The skin of the aircraft when supersonic (certainly the leading edge of the wing) would become extremely hot.  I suspect that the 1am object might have been a B-58 on a high altitude night supersonic dash over the city.  What we saw was the glowing hot leading edge of the wing.   Another possiblity with regards to military aircraft of the day that this might have been is the XB-70 high altitude experimental supersonic bomber.  Only two were built and tested.  One was certainly still flying at the time, although one crashed near this time.  The XB-70 was also a delta wing, but much bigger and faster than the B-58.  Certainly, it could have been this aircraft in a high altitude dash which heated the leading edge of the wing creating the very visible V shape.   Finally, the SR-71 Blackbird (or early variant) was flying by this time and could have done this.  Where was the sound?  Too high to be heard.  Sonic booms and jet noise dissapate from high altitude (over FL350) before reaching the ground...or so I have theorized.  I suspect that there are USAF records (flight logs, training records, maintenance records, etc) available to the public regarding these three aircraft that could be researched to see if my theory is correct that this sighting was one of these  historic aircraft...stirring up a lot of Arkansans...and one boy's dream of flight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS, DATED OCTOBER 21, 2005 @ 12:31 HRS.)) Results of research on Ft. Smith chevron sighting. This is a follow-up to my recent post here regarding the specific chevron-shaped object.  I have since done some research that would dispel two of my theories.   I contacted a retired B-58 crew member who confirmed that the leading edge of the wing did not glow when supersonic.  I have also researched the possiblity of the XB-70.  The Final Report on the the XB-70 program published in 1972 lists every flight of each of the giant delta wing aircraft.  A/V-2 had already crashed by the time of this sighting. A/V-1 was flying.  I have been unable to determine if the XB-70 did any night flying, or flying significantly away from Edwards AFB, CA.  From reading the chief test pilot's summary, I would highly doubt that this aircraft did either.  It was a very complex aircraft, often having malfunctions requiring unique support.  To intentionally stray from its support base would be doubtful.  Also, it was a very crudely equipped and instrumented aircraft in its experimental form.  Its single TACAN worked poorly, requiring the crew to rely heavily on FAA ATC for help with navigation.  There is one long-shot date of possibility. The aircraft flew on 8/24/67 for over two hours, reached over Mach 2, and an altitude of 58,000 feet.  If the actual sighting that I witnessed occured on this date, it would be an interesting coincidence. So, I believe that leaves this sighting on mysterious footing.  Other possible aircraft of the day are the CIA A-12 Blackbird and its followers, the YF-12 and SR-71. That will take more research and will probably be more difficult to find records in the public domain.

After a short conversation about the days events, my friend ((name deleted)) pointed to a cloudless sky and  told me that he learned about  the location and names of constellations in Science class and began pointing out the Little Dipper and the names of certain other star formations for me.   As our eyes were scanning the horizion,  my friend happened to notice 3 colored lights that appeared to be close by.  It was dark of course,  but I would estimate the lights to be about two miles away and about one mile high above the ground.  We were with-in 5 miles of an airport,  so the occasional appearence of multi-colored lights of small aircraft in the sky was not unusal,  and  we agreed that this is probably what the lights were and continued to scan the night sky looking for other interesting constellations.  About 15 minutes later, my friend looked to the horizon again and brought to my attention that the multi-colored lights were still in the same place as they were before.  We naturally thought that this was very odd,  but decided that it was either another airplane traveling the same flight path or the same plane had circled and just happened to be in the same location that we were looking.  We quickly went back to obsevering the stars.  Some time later,  about 20 minutes,  I happened to look in the direction of what we both dismissed as a airplane sighting,  and again,  in the very same place and of the exact orintation, I saw the same multi-colored lights.  I quickly brought it to the attention of my friend and together we tried to come up with a rational explanation as to why and how an object could suspend itself in the air in the same exact place.  I finally  came to the conclusion that it must be a helicopter,  but my friend reminded me that heliocopters are extemely noisey and it was a very quiet night with no breezes.  If the object was a helicopter, we would definitely hear the sound of the motor and rotor blades.  We both became very puzzled,  and our attention was now focused directly on the object for about 10 minutes.  As we stared at the lights, I strained to make out some kind of outline or silhouette of the object, but I could not see any discernable shape because the object seemed to absorb what little light was available and blend into the night sky.   Just as we were discussing what this thing could be, it suddenly moved at tremendous speed to our left at a 45 degree angle, upward about 5 miles in the sky, paused for a brief second, and then shot straight upwards  to the very outer  stratosphere of the Earth,... then stoopped,  hovered,  appearing as a point of light for a second,  and then suddenly  propelling itself into deep space at an even faster speed than I had ever seen any man-made aircraft accelerate to.  My friend and I looked at each other in astonishment,... all we could say to eachother is ""Woa"",... ""What was that?"".   The next day we told all are friends.  Some of are friends believed us,  but most did not.  However,  those that did not believe us, could not come up with an explanation either.   I am in my 50's now,  but I will never forget the experience, and the memory of it is still fresh in my mind like it happened yesterday.   At the age of 17 years old, I was a (""I don't believe it, unless I see it"") kind of a young man, and I cerntainly did not  believe in extraterrestial spacecraft, but after this 1969 sighting, I soon changed my opinion..

The owner of the farm contacted the local police who arrived at about 10h30 on the scene.  The UFO was sighted whilst hovering at tree top level in a dense forest.  According to witnesses the UFO kept on changing colours.  The police officers who visited the scene, saw the UFO.  One officer fired several shots at the object. The farm owner also fired shots.   Whilst being shot at the UFO stopped changing colours and remained a darkish gun-metal colour.  It kept on disappearing behind the tree tops and reappeared.  The colour changed to greyish white before it dissappeared.  All together fifteen shots were fired at the object.  To my knowledge this is the only incident where members of a police force fired shots at a UFO.  This event was reported in several newspapers and books.  Investigaters from the space agency in USA visited the town several months later and interviewed all those who witnessed the incident.

A friend came running inside where the rest of us were and yelled ""come outside quick and look at this"". We went to the back yard and on the far edge of the field,three large red lights were assending up from behind the trees (about 1/2 mile away at the back of the field).  They came to a stop about 50 ft above the trees (or so it looked from that distance].  About 10 seconds later two very large white lights came up from the same place and stopped above the red lights.  After a few seconds the white lights started moving in our direction,very slowly and the red lights went back down behind the trees. As the lights got about halfway across the field the hairs on my neck were standing up.  We all knew something wasn't right about this. There wasn't a sound coming from anywhere.  A dog about a half mile away started barking.  It was so quiet that nite you had no problem hearing it. As the lights got closer, one of them veered off to the right over the trees about halfway over the field towards us.  The other one was heading right over our heads. We were paralyzed.Before this we all had joked since childhood about ufo's and space men.

My wife and I were traveling South on Interstate 75 in the Spring of 1975, we were making a trip to the Ft. Lauderdale area to check things out.  I liked driving at night because there was a lot less traffic and much nicer traveling.   I remember very clearly that night I saw the UFO, there was no mistaking what it was.  It was approximately 2AM in the morning and my wife had fallen asleep while I was driving South.   I remember it was a very beautiful night that night and there was not a cloud in the sky.   I even remember sticking my head out the driver side window to look at the constellations a few times.  It was South Ga. and there were no city lights and the stars were magnificant that night, like I said, not a clould in the sky.   Then, all of a sudden, the entire Interstate highway in front of me was completely lit up as though it was daytime.  The road is very flat in that part of S. Ga, so I could see cars for several miles in front of me on both sides of the road.   I was amazed that the whole Interstate was suddenly lit up in a manner very similar to the light when a large lighting bolt lights up everything.  But there were no clouds or lightening bolts that night, only perfect weather.   As the light stayed lit, I began searching the sky and my view from left to right trying to figure out where all the light was coming from... Then I saw it perfectly through the rear passenger window, as it was just hovering in the sky.  It was enormous!   At first it looked like a full moon because it was a perfect sphere, but it was 10 times the size of a full moon.  It was only a couple hundred yards from the Interstate, and it was very low to the ground.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  I knew exactly what it was the second I saw it because I knew we don't have any technology that is perfectly a sphere, can hover like that, and 10 times the size of a full moon.   And, the colors were amazing.  The whole sphere was a solid bright green color, and all around the perimeter the light colors appeared to be a red and organge flashing of colors.  My guess was that the perimeter colors of the sphere was reflecting the propulsion system as they went completely around the sphere.   So here I am, still driving but totally focused on looking at the amazing, huge, bright colored sphere.  Then, as I was looking at it through my passenger rear glass, it went from standing still in the sky to shooting 180 degrees across my front windshield.  It went from standing still, to completely across my horizon in less than 2 seconds.  I had no doubt whatsoever what it was knowing that we have never had technology that can move that fast.   Then, I noticed that I was just approaching an Interstate exit, I was in the area of 20 miles north of Tifton Ga.  The exit had one of those very tall gas signs which use to be so popular.  As I was approaching the exit, my wife suddendly woke up in an absolute panic.  She started screaming, stop the car, stop the car, the car is on fire!   I immediately said to her to look at the tall gas sign, as I wanted her to see that the sign was complete enveloped in a type of smoke from the UFO.  She saw it, but it took me a minute to convince her that the car was not on fire.  But what really happended was that she was smelling the smoke left behind by the UFO as it tore across the sky at light speed and the reason I asked her to look at the tall gas sign, was because she was sleeping when I saw the UFO and I wanted whatever proof she could still see, I filled her in on the details later.   Oh yea, one more thing that always amazed me, the smoke actually smelded like honeysickels.... Really!  It did not smell like smoke at all, it was absoultely the sweet smell of honeysickles.   This UFO what I now believe to be ""a mother ship"", but that would take more explanation.  Maybe another time, as this is the first time I have ever told this story except occasionally to friends.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,31.459015873015876,-83.54016984126983

Sometime in July of either 1974 or 1975, three observers were sitting at a stop sign on McIntrye at 32nd Avenue in Golden.  The car was facing south.  It was a clear day with no clouds and no rain coming from the west.   An object appeared in the horizon from the west and moved rapidly across the sky toward the east and south.  The object briefly hesitated about 3/4 way across the horizon and appeared to move more southward.   The object was a bright blue sphere that appeared almost transparent but also seemed to emanate light.  By size comparison, the object appeared to be the size of a full, harvest moon.  It is very difficult to determine the distance from the car to the object, but estimates are about 3 miles.   The observers were a male professional bank auditor; a female college student working for an environmental consulting firm and a professional chemist and quality auditor.   The female student reported this incident at her workplace and discussed it with the firm's meteorologist.  It was the meteorologists opinion that the object was a plasma ball or ball lightening.   The female thought this not to be likely as the object appeared to be quite perfect and manufactured rather than a spontaneous natural occurrence.

We knew that something was very different when the lights came ashore.  The craft was approxamately 600 yards from our position and slightly below us, we were atop a ridge looking down. The object was triangular in shape, black with lights on each corner that changed through the entire spectuum every 3 to 5 seconds. The top of the object was very slighthly pyramidal in shape. The object was roughly 200 feet on a side, with the top raising about 10 feet in the center. There were several ""ports"" on the top of the craft through which we could see movement backlit by blue lights. Occasionaly a beam of light would be emitted from under the craft and illuminate the ground under the ship.  The object hovered in palce over the clearing for almost 40 minutes. It was almost in a ""station keeping"" mode and drifted no more than 20 feet from it's original position. It was silent for the most part, we occasionally heard a low humming sound.  After about 45 minutes we noted it rising vertically. It rose very slowly at first, at an altitude of roughhly 500 feet it began to accelerate, still verticaly. Over the next minute it shot straight skyward, dissaperaing from sight directly overhead. It never made a sound.

I was not the only one out there, others (strangers) were out there as well for the same reason.   We were all talking when I had a strange feeling,  I looked up and hovering directly over top of the Nathan Goff Armory (National Guard Armory), there was an enorrmous round disc shaped UFO.  It was as big as the building, and in the front of the building where I was standing, it hung out over the roof.   There was three sets of lights, one white, two blue, all of which were constantly in motion revolving around the thickest part of the UFO.  There was no sound, nor air disturbance.   We all saw it and watched it for about 2 minutes.  Nothing happed, it just hovered there.  Then you could feel an energy in the air, but nothing more, and the craft shot straight up and was gone.

This has nothing to do with a UFO, but would be classified as a close encounter of the 3rd kind.   When I was 5 years old, I lived with my dad in a two story house up on the hill above Vernon Valley.  I believe it was on Oak Ridge Rd.  My nearest neighbors were a distance away, maybe 100 yards, and wooded areas seperated the houses on my street.   It was late fall and getting dark early.  I was sitting in my bedroom, playing with lego blocks, and had my back to the window.  I remember that the window had a broken 'pull down' shade that would not stay down.   As I sat there, I felt a sudden electrical charge all over my body, and found that I could not move.  I had no idea what was going on, and became afraid.  I do not know how much time passed while I was unable to move, but when I could move again, I became aware of the feeling that I was being watched.  I got up, turned around and came face to face with a thing looking in my bedroom window, less than 4 feet away.  It had a large head, was whitish, and had piercing black eyes.  I do not really remeber if it had nostrils or a mouth, but I suppose it did.   It stared at me for a few moments, studying me.  I let out a scream and ran as fast as I could, looking for my father.  I found him in the basement, doing laundry.  I was crying, and babbling that I had seen a ""skeleton head"" in my window.   Of course, he didn't believe me, telling me that I had a nightmare.  As he held me, though, the thing in my window reappeared in the basement window, looking in upside down.  I screamed again, and pointed at the window.  My dad turned around to look, but the creature moved out of view very quickly.  He says to this day that he did not get a good look at it, and could not describe what I saw.   There were no trees near my bedroom window, and no way of setting up a ladder without me hearing.  It was too real to be a dream, and too solid to be a reflection.  Plus, many other people describe seeing the same thing when they are young.   Since then, I have had 2 ufo experiences, one nighttime, and one daytime, as recently as last year, and witnessed my more than two other people.  Also, I have been plagued by intense nightmares recently, where I wake up and am unable to move, and unable to wake my girlfriend, and feel hands on my back.  I get rolled over by these hands, and find myself staring up at one or more of these things.  I know there are other people who have seen things like this and would like to talk to them about it.

It was right in front of my truck. I could not tell how far away it was but in my view it seemed to be about the size of a quarter.  It was really bright green, almost fluorescent colored.  Its shape had a band that wrapped around it like a tootsie roll lolly pop. It stayed the same shape as I continued to drive.  I was going about 60 mph.

I was driving back to my parents house with my girlfriend at the time. We had just been out on a date, and it was a warm evening outsude. I was driving my mother's minivan, and we had the windows down because it was nice out.  The road my parent's house in on was, at the time, in a semi-rural suburban area.  It was a very clear night with lots of stars, no moon from what i recall.  When we were about 2 miles away, I saw a dark shape above the treeline in the direction we were headed. Even though it was very dark, there was still some ambient light from philadelphia on the horizon below the treeline. Because of that, I could define space that was much darker then the surrounding sky. I pointed the shape out to my girlfriend, and we both thought it had to be a cloud. Then we realized that it seemed to be moving. Then we thought it must be some sort of flat looking blimp. We could see no lights on it whatsoever, which we thought was very odd for an aircraft at night.  When we were approximately 1/2 mile from home, we saw that the object was much larger and closer then we thought, and then it was moving over us. I slowed the car down to almost a stop and stuck my head out the window to see what it was. It made no noise at all, and blocked out a very large portion of the stars. i was able to see that it was roughly triangular in shape- though i can't be certain of that fact because it all happened so fast and unexpectedly. I didn't see any visible markings or lights, and it wasn't moving at a high rate of speed. We both sort of laughed the whole thing off and never talked about it again.  I have been at a loss ever since to explain what it was, since aircraft flying at night have some sort of lights. I'd also expect some sort of noise, even from a low-flying blimp- should one decide to float around in the dark at low altitudes.

The light glowed steadily, did not blink or flash, and was larger and brighter than a light on any aircraft I have seen.   The light moved in a straight line in a southern direction quite slowly then made an abrupt stop in mid air and hovered for a second.  The blue light glowed intensely brighter and then turned bright red and shot back north in the direction from which it had come.  There was just a red streak for half a second when it shot back, and then it disappeared.   I have never seen anything move that fast, and I have never seen anything just disappear.

The Telegraph (calcutta) dt. 27 October,1994 Captioned ""Skywatcher claims UFO sighting""   Description of the UFO sighting :  Disgusted at not being lucky to join the group of amateur astronomers that left Nehru Planetarium, New Delhi for sky-viewing on the outskirts of Delhi in the evening of 2nd October 1994, I was dejectedly looking at the night sky around 20:30 hr standing in the balcony of my house in the Gole Market locality of Delhi when I chanced to observe six dimly-lit red-orange star-like objects resembling configuration of a hexagon in upright position swiftly moving across the north-eastern skies at location somewhere between 40-45 degrees from the horizon.  Surprisingly, the swiftly moving unusual object did not produce any sound, and disappeared from the sight within a minute. There were no clouds in the sky at the time of sighting of the UFO.  I was utterly confused about my having personally seen an abnormal object in the sky which did not match description of any of the established heavenly objects on that eventful day of my life.  Based on my knowledge of cosmology, I realized that the fast moving objects could not be a group of stars either.  Out of sheer excitement and curiosity, I reported the chance observation of the unexplained object in a local daily with a view to learning readers' reaction to my sighting.  To my surprise, I did receive a rejoinder to my report from a scientist, Prof. K.S. Vashistha intimating sighting of UFO of similar description on 10th October 1994 at Agra (India)at almost similar time I did the sighting of UFO on 2nd October.  Subsequent to confirmation of my sighing of unusual object in the sky, the news of sighting UFO in Delhi sky was a big news in the national dailies.

Summer 1995 Memphis, Tn.  I'm at work with several other people. Slow day, so a few of us are hangin' around outside helping one of the guys work on his car. We are in the parking lot of a small strip-mall. (Not all of these sightings happen out in cow country.) Two of us go inside to get a few sodas, on our way way back outside we hear one of the others yelling ""Get out here, you gotta see this sh*t!"" We ran. It sounded like an emergency from the tone of voice. So there we are a group of five all pointing up at the sky slack-jawed. The traffic just keeps goin' by like theres not any UFOs dancing around in the sunset.  There were 3 ""craft"" from what we could tell. Each identical to the other, they were shaped like a discus and appeared to be a metallic color with a soft glowin' white halo that surrounded them. They flew in perfect unison and in ways that seemed impossible, especially to what we know of as vehicular flight. It only lasted a minute or two but the lil' airshow was spectacular. As they flew away (quite fast), it was like all 3 ""ships"" flew into each other and became one burst of light... poof... gone.  One of the guys, the manager, comes out just in time to see the last half of it. He drops whatever he was holding. This is were I get confused. He can't believe what he sees... even while 5 of us point it out. He goes into complete denial on the spot. To this day I'm sure he wouldn't admit to it. He didn't go into hysterics or anything like that, its just that He went back inside saying ""No. Nope. No way."" Which was actually stranger than seeing what were probably our own creation. I should note that this happened not far from the Millington Navy Airbase NAS Memphis. (Formerly the largest by enrollment and most active training center for new Navy & Marine pilots.)

(These visits continue today on behalf of the Georgia UFO Group).  Each visit was in response to members of that community who were reporting multiple observations of unknown aerial activity.   Ths first visit was made on 15March98, taking along a team of MUFON personnel, including Field Investigator Jack Dowless who lives in that region of Georgia.   The witness was found to be a mature successful businessman who has for 12 years lived on the highway along which this upscale mountain community is located. The witness was found to be an intelligent and well read person, an active church member and an obvious PILLAR of the Murray County area. His home was located at 2600 feet of altitude on the side of Fort Mountain overlooking a large valley toward Grassy Mountain to the north.  His north wall lets out onto a full patio, the exit being a huge glass wall/sliding door.  This area is within the Chattahoochee National Forest, abutting the remote Cohutta Wilderness. Location being about 70 miles north of Atlanta.   The witness was cooperative and requested to remain anonymous due to his church work and business ventures in both Georgia and Tennessee.   FI Jack Dowless conducted the interview with occasional questions from this writer.   The witness stated that on an unrecalled date in September of 1995 at about 5:00PM EDT, the weather was clear and sunny. To the NW, he observed an object out over the valley and it appeared to be teardrop in shape.   He estimated that it was about 300 yards from his home, essentially stationary, but with a tilting motion that also revealed the top. He got his nearby binoculars and about half of the 1 - 1 1/2 minute observation was made with magnification. He further described the object as seeming to be SOLID, and of a dull aluminum-type metal, about the color of galvanized pipe.  Addtionally he estimated that it was about 30-40 feet in length, 12-18 feet in width, thickness of 8-10 feet, tapering to 3-5 feet, with a canopy or cockpit-type of protuberance on top.  The witness also described a black ""hole"" that opened in the top center/side of the craft.  Clear but bright icicle-like rays were projected from the circumference of the hole out to a distance of some 50-100 feet.  After about 20 or so seconds, the hole closed and the craft resumed it's original appearance.  (Witness later told this writer the ""rays"" might be compared to the shiny tinsel icicle-like decorations put on Christmas trees.....they blow in a stiff breeze).  The object then suddenly vanished.  No unusual odors, sounds or other effects were noticed. The witness had sketched in detail what he observed.  Much later, the witness and his brother was watching a documentary on the Fox Network and got the ""UFO Hotline"" number.  His brother talked him into reporting the incident (brother lives elsewhere in Georgia).  This was corroborated when the writer later interviewed the brother on several occasions. During later discussions with the witness and his brother over the next few years, ALL DETAILS REMAINED THE SAME.   Due to the witness' unobstructed view of the valley, mountains and sky, he stated he was in fact a regular skywatcher and  had some small interest in UFOs since they were always in the media.  He went on to describe some other events he had witnessed, as well as those of his neighbors.  Subsequent visits to this community to speak with other witnesses found his information to be absolutely correct.  This writer and other MUFON of Georgia personnel in fact personally witnessed a minor event from this location at a later date and subsequent to that, WITNESSED WHAT WE FEEL WAS A SURPRISING (!) UNEXPLAINED EVENT very near this witness' home. (As one member described it.....""That'll wake you up in the morning boys""!......this particular episode will be described in a future posting to NUFORC).   Overall, subsequent interaction with this witness during later visits to Fort Mountain further established his credibility to this writer.   FI Jack Dowless indicated he felt that no conventional aircraft could be mistaken in this case due to the close observation, lack of sound and vanishing of the object.  He did speculate a bit about some advanced experimental aircraft due to the close proximity (about 55 miles) of the Lockheed facility located within Dobbins AFB north of Atlanta.   The above described craft remains UNIDENTIFIED to this day.  On 20Sept05, during routine review of the various reports at NUFORC, this writer noticed the witness illustration from the 2June05 St. Louis, Mo. report. The similarity of that sketch to the Fort Mountain sketch is extraordinary.  This writer is currently forwarding a copy of said Fort Mountain sketch to NUFORC for further scrutiny.   Additional reports from the Chatsworth/Fort Mountain area can be found in the NUFORC's Georgia database after 15March98. As indicated, another is due to be posted in coming weeks.

At first I thought it was part of the building's fixtures but as the bus continued on its route, the ball remained fixed in the sky while the structures went by.   The distance of the object was like holding a ballbearing at arms' length.  The sphere was below cloud deck.   I was transfixed, wondered what it was, knew what it was and wondered again if the sky opened a hole and if it was space I was seeing.

It was rejected because I could not give an exact date or even the year. I knew that it was in the winter and I knew the time because of a meeting I was going to that meets at 8pm. regularly. However I was unsure of an axact month or even the year.  I knew it was between 2001 and 2002 and it was in either January or February.  Upon speaking with a friend about UFO's and about my experience,I have re-thought the date of my siting.  I believe that it was in January of 2001, to the best of my recollection.  Anyway, that is my best guess.  That is all this reporting site has asked me for, so if this report is not accepted then I will not try again. I was surprised when the report was rejected because I could not give an exact date, especially when I seen a report from a man who claimed to see UFO's in the 1970's  with no specific dates of the sitings. I found the reply to be insulting, particularly when this site is supposed to be looking for reports from people.  I am not looking for any special recognition or for anything for that matter, accept to be believed, however, if I am not, than so be it.  With all this said I will report what I seen one last time.  I was traveling down Main Street in Salisbury, heading to an AA meeting, of which I had been a sober member for many years at the time and still am.  It was just before 8pm and I was just going to make it on time because I was running late.  I noticed that the street became suddenly and very strangely deserted, even for a street Salisbury, which is not a large city.   I felt a very errie presence that I find hard to describe. I did not know where it was coming from. Somehow I felt that this presence was around my car and felt that I could not shake it even though I was driving and was in motion.  I looked around in all directions but saw nothing.  I knew there was a definate presence though.   Finally I looked up to see, directly above me, a saucer. I stopped the car immediately and it stopped as well.  It then took off in a slight foward motion from my car and angled upward where it dissapeared into the sky at lightening speed.  I remember seeing it become smaller and smaller until it dissapeared into the sky.  It was a metallic blue/silver color and had an aura about it.  The lighting about it appeared to fluctuate, although there were no actual lights on it or that were coming from it.I could not tell how large or small it was or how close or far above me it was, only that it was above me.  My guess is that it was closer rather than further away and that it was not particularly large.  Well, that is my siting report and that is what I had seen.I have never before or since seen anything like that. Thank you for your time.

I don't remember the exact date, because it happened several years ago.  However, I do remember the time of night because I was on my way home from work (I worked at a restaurant and always got off at the same time every night).  I turned left on Vollmer Rd from Shoup, and saw what appeared to me to be a plane crossing from East to West above Swan Hill.  No big deal; I see low flying planes all the time.  The area is close to 3 different airports (1 USAF).  I kept watching it as I got closer to the object, and it looked to me (from that distance) like it had turned, because it was no longer moving across the sky.  The closer I got the stranger it looked to me.  Finally, as I was driving up Swan hill, I knew it wasn't a plane or helicopter.  I slowed my car down to about 30 MPH (I remember glancing at the speedometer; limit is 45), and I turned off the stereo.  The object could not have been more than 100 feet off of the ground, and probably about 100 feet off to my left side, just sitting there above the trees on top of the hill.  At this point I could see at least the lights clearly, though I do not remember seeing any outline around the lights.  There were three white lights, in the shape of an iscoceles triangle, and it was pointed to the South.  30 MPH is pretty slow, and I'm fairly certain that it wasn't moving at all.  I do not remember hearing any noises, even with the stereo turned off.  I was quite young at the time (I'm only 22 now), so I didn't even know where I could try to report something like that.  I'm only reporting it now because I came across this website while searching on google trying to find a list of rankings for various cities for reported UFO sightings.  I'm writing a fiction novel, and the information would be useful.  Anyway, I see a checkbox for this below, but I don't ""want"" someone to contact me about this.

Completely clear and sunny, no clouds, calm air at ground level. I never would have seen them but I paused to watch an eagle circle in the sky over the lake.   I saw 2 spheres, 1 behind the other, coming toward me from the south heading smoothly due mostly north.  They were the same color as sky, barely paler blue/gray, slightly pearlescent sheen.   I watched continuously as they approached and a small cessna style aircraft turned and slowly flew on general intercept coursetoward them.  I assumed the pilot saw them too.   The spheres veered slightly to the northwest, the cessna soon turned back toward the southeast and seemed to be flying slower than the planes usually do in this area (about 7 miles from Arlington Airport).   The spheres seemed to turn again toward the north, 1 behind the other still.  I ran to get my binoculars in the house, and saw the objects thru them when they were just north of my position.  No other details were discernable but for a slightly darker blue gray ""core"".  They were close enough so that I should have seen details, such as appendages, balloon baskets, ropes/cables, but only a sphere was seen.  I am guessing they were 2 miles or less from me now.   The discoloration core was approx 1/4 to 1/5 the diam of the spheres.  I would guess the spheres were both approx 30 to 40 feet in diam.   Maybe about 5-10 thousand feet up, with no sound or light, definitely moving as fast or faster than small aircraft do in this area.   I watched until out of sight, 2-3 minutes worth.

I noticed a Florissant police officer had a motorist pulled over to the right of the road and was walking back towards his cruiser.  He was looking up towards the sky near a grocery store with his mouth wide open.  I started to look towards the direction he was gazing and that is when I saw the object.  It appeared to me to be a two story rectangle with very large windows on the side of the object.  It appeared to be very dark or black in color.  I did notice some lights but cant tell you the exact place they were situated on the craft as it was night and very hard to tell where the edges began and ended.  The exterior lights were bright and seemed to have a bluish hue to them like you see on some of the newer BMW or Mercedes cars.  The object was flying nearly directly over the Schnucks market at approximately 100-200 feet(very low like a police helicopter height ). The object was almost silent, maybe a slight hum as it flew in front of my car.  What caught my attention in the short time I saw the object was that the interior of the object was dimly lit up enough that I could see inside the windows I described above.  I couldnt tell much detail other than the interior was massive.  I would estimate the total size of the object to be the size of a football field.  I make this assumption because it nearly spanned the entire roadway (4 lanes plus a turn lane ) as it crossed my path.  The strangest thing about my encounter was that as it floated by I noticed movement in one of the rear windows.  I cant say how many total windows there were on the craft.  In the one I saw into, it looked as if a person was moving from the inside towards the window to look out in the general direction of me and the police officers car with its flashing lights.  I didnt report this story initially to anyone except I did tell my friends and my now wife the next day after my sighting.  About 3 years later I happened to be watching the Discovery channel and saw a documentary that had several police officers from Ill. Talking about witnessing the same object on the same day a few hours after my encounter.  I have since given my statement to a local videographer  (WWW.DBARKERTV.com) who did some interviews with Melvin Knoll, and the P.O. in Illinois.  Mr. Barker has recently done a video interview with me as well about the incident.

I was lying outdoors, snuggled in my sleeping bag in November, 2001, at about 1 am. It was a full-moon that night; ceiling and visibility were unlimited. I was encamped in a sparse cedar grove at the Southern end of a 40-60 acre cattle pasture. Wind was almost still; ambient noise was basically non-existent; air temp was approx. 40F. What breeze there was from the NW<5 mph.  I awoke to my wolf-dog hybrid(1/4 wolf;1/4 malamute; 1/2 yellow lab; I include this description of him to give a sense of how much I trust this dog's senses and instincts; he is very intelligent, very observant, and knows the difference between a possible threat or unknown machine or entity and something to be disregarded) growling--not viciously or menacingly--at first, just suspiciously, and observing something off the ground over the pasture. At first, very faintly, I hear a ""swooshing"" noise with a high pitched whine approaching from the North very slowly. Also, the swooshing noise was deep and rythmically slow. The best thing I could come close to describing it as sounding like is an attic fan with a whining, loose bearing. As it approached, the noise became more pronounced, but the same rythmically. This was a full moon night; this thing was within 200 yards of me over open terrain. I would judge its alltitude at between 100 and 200 feet. Its airspeed was much, much slower than any man-made aircraft I know of could maintain and stay aloft. I was in the military; I have flown in Blawkhawks, Hueys, Sea Nights, and C-135's.  As this object approached, my dog became much more menacing in his deep-throated growl, and his eyes locked onto this object and started tracking it.  Yet, I could see nothing.  This object flew directly over me; my vision was unobstructed.  The moon was overhead slightly to the South West. The object flew over me at about 100-200 feet.  Airspeed was <60mph. It was a slow ""wooshing"" sound, and the whine was so high pitched as to become almost auditorily painful and inaudible at the same time. It agitated my brain and nervous system to a point almost unbearable as it passed over. Again, the closest I could come to describing the effect is to compare it to the EMF field surrounding a powerful electric sub-station. My dog tracked this thing with a deep-throated rumbling growl and an intense, unabated stare all the way over us and across the horizion until it was inaudible; ie: He could see it, I could not! Its vector was from 11:00 NW to 5:00 SE. There was no visual obstruction overhead in the starfield; no obstruction of the moonlight; no visual distortion of any kind overhead against the starfield, the moon, nor either horizion from its approach to its departure. The diameter of the ""wooshing"" sound as it passed directly over me I would estimate to have been 40-60 feet??? There was no air displacement. The wooshing sound was moderately loud, but nothing to the point of roaring or uncomfortable.  INVESTIGATOR FOLLOW UP: In reference to your questions, I will try to answer them in order. The only other bodily sensations I  had consisted of the ""tingling and icy cold-blooded feeling"" one gets when confronted by something they have never experienced before; and cannot identify--in other words: ""fear""! (also, hair standing on end, ect.) As for how I felt after it left? Physically fine; no lasting hearing impairment or pain. Now psychologically, I was very agitated and anxious; it was very fascinating, exciting, and frightening all at the same time!  And no, no missing time. Sorry! lol. Again, no; no dreams--just fascinating and life-long memories. And yes, I have been back there since the incident--and many times before--and only this one time has anything unusual occurred. As for it being worth further investigation, I sincerely doubt it. Again, I have camped there many times since 1986, and have had only this one experience. However, I spent allot of time out West in California, Wyoming, and Colorado. I was in the Marines in California from 1988-1993 in the infantry. I am an avid backpacker, hiker, camper, and general all-around outdoor-nature nut! I have spent allot of time in far more remote regions than this; and this was my first and only experience(and my grandmother's ""sighting"" was in the same county back in 1987). So, who knows for sure?  As for an electrical transformer sound? No, not really; it was a whining noise: very high-pitched, rythmical, and...""mechanical?"" Not a humming or buzzing type noise. But without a visual/phyisical description, I'm not sure of what value it would be; other than its uniqueness of being only heard and not seen, I guess! lol.

Continues above our heads.  Then heads out at rapid speed. (forgive any wrong spellings)  A group of my friends and I were hanging out down on a beach.  From where we were you could see across the long island sound to connecticut.   We were all arguing for about 10 minutes what a light in the sky was over connecticut.  Some were saying it was an airplane.  I was saying it was a light tower.  We all agreed on a light tower because the light was not moving at all.   About the time we all settled down and started relaxing again the light began to move.  It came southeast towards us at a very slow pace.  We began to get uncomfortable with what was happening.   The situation worsend when the craft made its away all the way to us and turned east above the treeline behind us.  We all started to run.  The craft hovered with an ominous humming/buzzing noise over the treeline continuing east.  It then turned North and moved out over the water.  This is when the craft rapidly accelerated and turned back into a light in the distant sky.  Right as the craft dissapeard from our sight there was a very loud booming noise.  Almost as if the craft broke the sound barrier.  We have all disscused this since but none of us can explain what the craft was.

It was very bright, like the light of a jet flying toward you and was about 10x the size of a jet's front light. It appeared to have either flashing lights around the middle or a series of lights sort of circling the middle. It hovered motionless for a minute or so and also made long, slow arcs or half circles like a broad smile. After what seemed like 10 minutes it slowly moved off towards the NE, which would put it moving out to sea. As it started to move off, it's view was obstructed by tree's that were close to us. It wasn't very high in the sky either. Maybe about as high as you would see helicopters. I called the police and they said they had received several calls and that 30 minutes earlier the same object had been sighted over Margate which would have been SW of our location.

I live in a nearby area of Pasco County and this recent report may have been most likely a military aircraft.  I say this with a fair amount of confidence because, two years ago, I was commuting home from work at about 18:00 hrs in the summer on Interstate-75 heading northbound to Pasco County, FL. I was caught in a traffic jam and remained stationary for a good 20-30 minutes.  Out of nowhere, I saw a black sliver of something floating over the interchange where 1-75 merges onto I-4 East to Orlando.  I then stared at it for a few seconds more and I struggled to make out what it was.  As it got closer, I then realized that this is a B-2 Stealth Bomber gliding over the interstate to my right hand side at about an altitude of perhaps 100 feet! It was a startling sight. I had my car in neutral and i bolted out of my seat in excitement and stuck my head out of my sunroof. I saw it make a graceful arc and bank in a westerly vector towards Tampa Bay. I believe it was on final approach to land at nearby MacDill AFB. This aircraft glided by and made no noise (over my engine noise), i was able to get a dead-on side view of it and I could even make out the pilots helmet as the sun glared through the cockpit glass. Thats how Low and slow this thing was. If I had not been looking out to my right as I was sitting in traffic with nothing to do, I would have missed it completely. That is how ""low-observable"" this aircraft is even in a populated area. Since this was an explained observation, I do not need to be contacted.

The home was located in a large clearing on top of a countryside hill & we were enjoying the stars and trying to see our Milky-way in space. While viewing the night time sky & spotting the Big & Little Dippers, Orion and other mythical shapes, I noticed a few satellites crossing below the stars which is not unusual in the summer months on a clear night. But while one satellite slowly passed overhead, something unfamiliar was occuring even higher in the stary heavens. As I focused toward space to what ""I THOUGHT"" was another glistening man made space craft certainly was not! Maybe it was a falling star or a blinking light of an aircraft, but the spot of light (the size of a star) began to move faster than the satellite in the foreground. The semi-circular shape was traveling in a South bound direction & it then slowed down and instantly changed directions & was now traveling North bound without a single stop in action. No human device, rocket, plane or Stealth bomber can do that manuvuer in a split second, I exclaimed!! I asked my friend to watch the dancing light in the sky and she witnessed the same occurance as I. I believe this was a massive object because of its particular size to the stars up in the darkness of space. The distance was far more farther away than the satellites that traveled across the sky. This was not a shooting star with a tail for there was no tail or icy trail behind the object. As we watched the sparkling object continue its dance, yet ANOTHER orb exactly like this one joined with the first to play a game of tag. As the first orb continued to move North to South and then East to West in a triangular pathway, the second circular object followed the same direct path as the first orb. It was a game of chase for the two objects and they were not harming each other but only staying as close as they could travel behind one another without hitting themselves. The two orbs traveled with no sound and reacted as a rubber ball would bounce off of the surfaces that it touched. But in space, as we know it, does not have ""A surface"" to bounce off of. Which made me more curious about this event. I blinked my eyes to be sure I was truly seeing this event unfold probably a 1000 miles away, or so it seemed, in the night sky. I asked my friend if she was the second orb in the same pathway as the first and she agreed that there was now two bright objects in the sky that were playing a game of tag. Then as fast as the objects came into sight, they swirled away together as though they were sucked into a vortex and diminished into space & gone from our sight. It was then I realized that this was a UFO encounter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.  PD))",2005-10-11T00:00:00,41.7127,-85.7972

A friend of mine claims they  might possibly be helicopters... but I don't know, I immediatley thought UFOs, basically, because I -want- to believe it is one.  From what I see, it looks like a pyramid almost; with lights on every corner.  It was about a few months later that I came upon a television program on the Discover Channel (?) about a similarly described UFO in (Bermuda?) I can't remember.  but it did creep me out a little..  In one photo, it looks as I first described it; in the second, it looks as if I caught it while it was moving, and three little beams of color or almost.. shooting? out of it.  I really can't say.

At first, I thought it was a star.  But, I noticed it was moving very slowly.  Thinking it was an airplane, I watched it.  But, it was moving too slowly for an airplane.  And, it did not have any of the warning lights common to an airplane.  The object moved very slowly from north to south.  It was moving in a straight and level manner.  It did not twist and turn at all.   As I watched, the object slowed down to almost a stop.  At that point, I was convinced it was not an airplane.  After about 10 or 15 seconds, the object sped up to its original speed.  It continued to travel south for about another 20 seconds.

She then came running up the step call my name since I was also up watching a movie on cable as she ran to the back door to see what it really was, but when she got there the light had vanished. A few days went by before I decide to check the security monitor tape to see what exactly what she saw and I was surprise and amaze to find what the security cameral had catch.  First I thought if might have been a police helicopter even thought that night either my wife nor myself had heard one, but to be on the safe side I call the Columbus City Police and they gave me the helicopter division and I was told that all helicopter had not flown since about 4 that morning. Second thing came to mind was maybe it could have been an aircraft since we did live not to far from the airport. So I call the air traffic control towers and they told me that there were not air traffic at that time on morning and it did not start up until about 15 to 30 minute after the stated time. This left me with now what cause the light that came straight down out of the sky that make no noise what so ever and dance at the foot of my step.

From someone standing on my root to someone in a tree with a spot light, but for light to bend the way it did left me just a puzzle as it did when the first time I saw it.

I have waited for it to happen again but to my knowledge this was the first and only time it happen other than when my two oldest teenage kid had said when they was small that they saw some color lights shining in their bedroom window which is on the same side of the house as the back step and the window was on the side of the house and back steps was on the corner as the window.

The night this happened, and I'm thinking it was mid to late August, 2004, I was sleeping in our rv because of remodeling our home and I woke to use the bathroom.  I noticed out the bedroom window a light not normally seen and kept watching it.  The light was yellowish almost like a street light.  It was coming from the n/nw at a very low altitude and a very slow rate of speed....gliding regally, would describe it. I watched as it came towards our rv; this vehicle had to have been black as it did not reveal its triangular shape clearly til it was nearer the rv I was in. The light was round, flat, and, as I saw,  set into the bottom of the vehicle.   This light was steady, never moving or changing...quite big and seemed to be in the center of the vehicle's bottom.  The odd thing about this light is that you would have thought it would light up the ground, but it didn't.  I opened the window to listen, but there was no noise.  The vehicle came on and as it approached our rv to go over it, I could actually see the bottom of the vehicle, that's how low it was.  The bottom had the round light pretty much in the middle and molding around it but the molding was shaped in triangle form.  Sort of like if you drew a star and then drew a circle in the middle...I saw no other lights.  It kept going at that same regal pace over our rv and on into the night in a s/southwesterly dirction as far as I know.   I have a physical disability that prevents me from walking so I couldn't get to the other side of the room or go out to photograph this.  I wish I could have as I could have at least got a shot of the bottom of it. I probably wouldn't have bothered to report this, except I have seen two other unusual things in the sky lately, so mate said I might want to keep track.

Therefore, we can only conclude the following for the moment:  Genuine unusual craft (UFO) have been seen and recorded in the Tinley Park area and others on one or more of the above dates. They were seen,collectively, by thousands of witnesses and reported by hundreds. This may very well be one of the best documented mass sightings. Please allow the time for scrutiny to assure its value.

I am slightly near-sighted so I passed it off as vision problems, but then when I got a full view of the object I discovered it was not moving. It was hovering there, not going forward, and it was too low to the ground to be a plane. There was a building several yards away and it was higher than the building, but it was still very low. After studying the object for a minute it slowly rose a few feet into the air but continued to hover. It was then that I took the Ridgeland Exit and went to my class. I don't know what it was. It was not a plane or a blimp although it resembled more of a blimp like object. It was not particularly big or small, it was probably a little bit smaller than a commercial plane, but bigger than a small plane. It was white. It had no lights and no markings.

I have inquired of people living near by who have ponds, only one person observed such hole but attributed the events to deer falling into the ponds.

I never saw any other object in its path, and I surely did not see any smoke coming from its wing.

Bright and huge star-like object in the sky during mid-day hours,Orange Beach,AL,2005-05-23T12:00:00,light,1 hour,"Occurred : 5/23/2005 12:00  (Entered as : 05/23/2005 12:00) Reported: 9/13/2005 8:19:02 PM 20:19 Posted: 10/11/2005 Location: Orange Beach, AL Shape: Light Duration:1 hour",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/046/S46243.html,"Bright and huge star-like object in the sky during mid-day hours.  On May 23, 2005 beginning at 12:00 PM, 5 people including myself observed an unusual daytime object (almost star-like yet comparable in size to an enormous planet near earth at its closest point) emitting radiant light (correlative to reflection of sunlight shining off a mirror) in the daytime sky.  Our location when we saw the light in the sky was at Orange Beach, Alabama on a condominium midway through construction.  The condominium is located nearly directly in front of the Alabama Point bridge which I estimated the distance between the bridge and the condo to be approximately a mile in distance. The whole observation began when three people and I took our lunch break at exactly 12:00 PM on the condominium's balcony that was facing southeast on the first floor.  I tended to my lunch,  devouring the tuna-fish sandwich that I had made in the early morning, while the other three people began consuming their meal just a few yards away from me.   While attending to my lunch, I was wearing my polarize sunglasses and glancing towards the Gulf admiring the scenery of the barrier island's surroundings.  It was extremely hot and humid that day which also set a new temperature record for that day.  I believe the actual temperature was 98 degree F, and with the humidity factored in, the temperature actually felt like 115 degree F.  Because it was so hot and humid that day, the surrounding area had a slight haze in the air which is typical for hot, humid climate.    The sunlight seem to be especially intense that day for it was extremely bright and challenging when seeing without the aid of sunglasses.  Thankfully, there was a slight and gentle breeze from the Gulf  to briefly cool us off just a tad now and then.   While glancing around at the surrounding area, a brilliant light in the sky captivated my attention.  I said nothing to the others just yet, but I just dwelled there in awe scrutinizing the light to see if it would change direction if it was traversing the sky.   I didn't want the other people to think I was seeing a UFO until I rule out all possibilities of what the light may be.   There was some clouds in the sky, and few times, the clouds would pass in front of the light in the sky, yet the light still shined through the clouds seemly almost unhindered.  The light was just barely off the left side of one of the three, huge condo that was on the barrier island.  In the line of sight of the light is a small island that has some pine trees on it.  That was one of the reasons why I didn't spot the light in the sky at my first glance of the surroundings.   The light seem to just suspend over the Gulf just between East and South East direction near the area where the torturous sun rise slowly each morning.  If you were to draw a line between the light and the condo, it did not cross the Alabama-Florida boundary line, but it was just between the two, tall pine trees on the island.  Between the two pine tree was a stubby tree possibly an oak tree.  I used those trees as a guide for any lateral movement in the light.   The light elevation may had been between 30 to 45 degrees off the horizon, but almost level with the condo's roof on the barrier island which was also leveled with the pine trees.   Thinking it may be a jet heading directly towards my direction with its lights on, I waited five minutes for any changes in direction, elevation, or intensity of the light, and I also listen for any sounds of a jet flying.  Since none of those factors changed and no jet sound could be heard, I disclosed to the other people of what I saw.  I guided them in direction using the pine trees as landmarks for the viewing of the light.   At first, both witness had some trouble spotting the light until their eyes adjusted and was able to see clearly the light.  I let one of the witness use my sunglasses, and he was able to see the light with no problems.   I asked the two witness, ""What is it?""  Neither of them had any clear answers, but only possibilities of what the light may be.  There was another person on the balcony, but that person refused to glance in the direction that the light was being observed.   Both witness and I watched for another 10 minutes when three more people showed up on the balcony.  They were able to view the light and again I asked, ""What is it?""  No one had any definite answers.  One person said, ""It could be a balloon.""  Another person said, ""It could be a parachute ride.""  Another person said, ""It could be a plane.""  Another person said, ""It could be a planet or star.""  Another person said, ""It could be kite.""  ""It could be an UFO!"" I said because nobody could identify it. All the witness watch the light and discussing what it could be until our lunch break was over.   Occasionally, I would glance towards the light while we were working until around 1:00 PM, I could no longer see the light where it once was positioned exactly each time in the same area in the sky motionlessly shining like a bright, huge star.  My final thoughts, ""What was it I saw that day?""",2005-10-11T00:00:00,30.2802,-87.5918

I see what I think is the B1 Stealth Bomber heading south at 11pm as I stand in my driveway.  I feel pumped up and want to see it.  I've only seen the B1 a few times and never at night. It approaches close and low to the ground.  I see a white light glare coming over the trees.  I estimate the craft at 1000 feet above as I stand in a fairly small, hilltop clearing of an oak forrest.  As it gets closer, I notice a pointed front end.   White lights point directly down, like spot lights.  I now know it cannot be the Stealth Bomber.  Wow, I've never seen a Stealth Fighter.  As it reaches almost overhead, Im struck by the shape of the craft.  I see a perfect isosceles triangle.  The bottom of the craft shows shiney metalic.  I see 3 bright white lights running down each side of the triangle.  I try to see a cockpit that I can recognize.  I can't see it.  I see no cockpit.  Im stunned again by the perfection of the triange, the bright lights and now by the fact the craft moves surprising slow.  It passes overhead.  I see two oval exhast-like ports on the rear of the craft.  I see two fins sticking up from behind.  Those two fins resemble the stealth fighters two rear fins.  I cannot hear a sound coming from those exhast-like ports.   The back of the craft is straight, not jagged like the rear part of the wing profile of the Stealth Fighter or the Bomber.  It passes over the tree tops line out of sight.   I go to bed thinking I just saw the next new military plane.  The next morning, I notice that the electronic fish finder on my boat parked in the drive is strangely powered 'on' and running.  It dawns on me then that what I saw the previous night may not be military.  I later tried to identify what I saw through web research.  I found nothing military and could not identify what I saw.  Through the web reseach, I find Im not the only one that has seen a 'flying triangle.'",2005-10-11T00:00:00,38.1763,-93.3194

The dark circle stuck out very well against the blue sky which I had a good area of view of but could not see it anywhere, it was gone as suddenly as it came. and i regret I did not see how it functioned to come and go. was it a hole that closed up? or a craft that accelerated quickly or turned on some kind of optical stealth? who knows. the difference in size between the large dark circle and the small shiney object was equivalent to a boweling ball and a small marble",2005-10-11T00:00:00,35.34399793103448,-119.04089261083743

The sky was almost cloudless, apart from a sparse, almost mist-like covering, extremely high up.   At first, I thought the items were two aircraft travelling together, as is often seen, and the sun seemed to be reflecting off the planes.  Then I realised that they were, in fact, stationary.  They also appeared far too high in the sky to be planes.  I called my husband to have a look.  He also observed them and thought that we should report it to the Airport (Birmingham flight path is above our house).  I quickly took the binoculars outside to view the objects at closer range.  Through the binoculars I could see that both objects were flashing slowly from red to green to red, and so on.  The two spheres were visible in the sky for approximately half an hour and then completely vanished from view.  Although I have not previously taken a great interest in UFO's, my Mum is a subscriber to the MUFON magazine and a keen ufologist.  She informed me of a sighting reported around a similar time of year by railway workers in Coventry.  This spurred me on to report my sighting.

As it approached closer I noticed that it was much higher than I thought and thought this was a little strange, since we are close to airport you would see many planes run parallel to airport in the approach or  pattern for landing .But this was much higher and since I have no reference to size I am unsure of height a guess would be 30,000 -40,000 if it was airplane size. As light approached it had slowed and was about 80 degrees from horizon or almost directly above us. It stopped, drifted to right for about 5 minutes then disappeared. 2 minutes later another one appeared followed the same route but hovered above and drifted to right and left and stayed there for at least 15 minutes, but then lost this when fireworks started at around 10:00  or 10:10 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My girlfriend and I were going home from an event and as we arrived home we noticed a object in the sky. We first thought it may have been a blimp but the more we watched this object move we knew it was not. This object moved slow at times then fast with sudden stops and would hover for a few seconds then move out of sight then back again. The object was for the most part dark but it was a clear night and we could see the object clearly against the night sky. I would say that it was no more than 500 yards away during the time we saw it. It most surely had a metalic look to it but not very shiney. We watched this for a good two minutes or so and as fast as it came it was gone. The object to me looked to be more of a tube shape like a paper towel roll. This left both of us speachless for several minutes. We live in a small city but at that time of night there were few people out. We were in a well lit parking area and our front yard at the time of the sighting. My friend who was visiting from out of state also witnessed this but for only a few seconds as he arrived at our apartment after we did. He was awstruck with the object and had many questions but we were just as puzzled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We normaly stay in a hotel in Amsterdam, traveling to places like Haarlem and Beverwijk. This year we decided for a change seeing as we had gone to Amsterdam for the last 3 summers. We went to a place called Den Helder on the Northern tip of Holland. The place was beatiful, we enjoyed the first 2 days of the Holiday greatly. On the 3rd night at about 8:30 we settled down to a lovely specialised Dutch dinner at the wonderful De Yperhof Restaraunt. We spent the night eating and reflecting on the past few days. At around 9:30pm we got ready to leave, we left the building out the front entrance. As soon as we left the restaraunt there was a bright white streak of what looked like flour fill the sky. It was amazing, at first we thought it must be some type of odd dutch firework, but after a minute it started to fade like rising fog. Behind             this 'powder' we could see a few little blue diamond/kite shaped crafts wizzing round and round. I didn't get too good a look through the white streak which went off onto the horizon. I could make out a white light on the tip of the diamond but when i reached for my glasses to get a closer look they had vanished. It was a thrilling experience and one i am likely never to forget. It really shookme and will change my view on alien inteligence for ever.

I had just come home from work and I stepped outside onto my porch along with my husband and a friend around 10:30 PM. I immediately saw a very bright streak of white light travel across the sky and i thought that i had seen a shooting star, so i kept on looking for another one and then I saw one that only went a very short distance and it was very bright..I then started to think something was going on and then my husband spotted what appeared to be a star moving very quickly and jumping across the sky it swirled around in circles very fast and then dissapeared behind what looked like a normal star. Shortly afterwards, we began to see bright streaks of light zoom across the sky periodically and then what we thought were stars in the sky began moving around and coming closer (about airplane level) they were moving in very odd jumpy patterns and each of them had a bright red light. There were about 5 or 6 of them that we could see and they seemed to be playing with eachother. Then suddenly they started following eachother and they were all flashing bright lights in the shape of a triangle and the light started at the top and flashed down to the bottom of the triangle like christmas lights and they were green, purple, blue, red,and orange. They continued to play with eachother and they would periodically stop and hover, when they hovered they looked like nothing more than a normal star until they moved again. I witnessed one of them pass over the highway and when it did, all of its lights turned off. My friend did manage to snap some pictures of what we saw, I dont think that she has gotten them developed yet. The ""show"" finally ended around 1:00am. Also, when I woke up the next morning, i went to my computer and there was a warning message on it saying that the computer had not been able to shut down that night because other people were logged onto it at that time (we did not have the internet so i dont know how this was possible) I have never been a beleiver, but the things i witnessed that night have definately altered my perception of things. I would also like to bring to your attention that the space shuttle came back to earth unplanned the following day and I think that what I witnessed very well could have had something to do with it....just a theory.

My first impulse was to think of a plane.   but it had too many lights for a plane.  then it began to sink in that it was not moving.  i reached for the binoculars and began watching it.   it appeared big.  it had either blinking or rotating red and white lights.  there may have also been some green but using the binoculars i would hesitate on the green.  there were 4 each white and red  lights. They were all in the same horizontal  plane....giving a 'cigar'  shape impression.   of course they could have been rotating around something. it dd not move.   after a bit i began  to perceive slight movement in relation to the moon.....but  it was due to the moon  advancing.  The object was  stationary. after several minutes  a most remarkable thing began to occur.   the large object began to ever so slowly divide into two smaller objects......as if two attached craft were separating.   they ever so slowly parted until they were about an inch apart.  After several more minutes they began to move 'outward' from earth.  i say that because the elevation did not change in relation to me or the moon.   this caused me to believe they were going 'away' from me.   I watched them with binoculars until they were out of sight, which was quite some time.   This also indicates they were moving 'out' and away.  the elevation did not vary in relation to the moon.

Every evening just about the same time I walk my dog. But this time I saw something that I never seen before and I still can't explain what it could of being.  I noticed a very bright light reflecting all around me. I automatically looked up to see what it was. I didn't get to see how it started it. All I know is that it was nice and dark and out of no where everything got really bright.  It started flying from the left side to the right on a straight line. Never flew up or down, never changed direction. This didn't look at all like a falling star. This light was very close to me, I would say about 1 and half to two telephone poles tall. From this distance it looked to be the size of a basketball or a little bigger.  The only thing I can describe it to is a ball of fire flying super fast. But, the light that it was emitting didn't look like fire at all. Picture a basketball on fire flying to one direction at a high speed, the flames thickly trailing behind. But instead of being fire it was all light. It got brighter and brighter as it picked up speed till it disappeared with no trails or sound.  The color in the center was so bright it looked almost white. The closer it got to the surface the more yellow it looked; the actual surface was a bright electric blue. The light was leaving a thick trail, as it got to the end it was small yellow sparks.  It flew about 150 to 200 feet, when it disappeared. This happened in about a minute with no sound what so ever.

The only information that I was told my mother was that their car engine stopped, their watches stopped (they had to reset them when they arrived in Salina.)  The watches were approximately 30 minutes slow. A silver-ish disc like object came down in front of their car and hovered there. They did not speak, too stunned by the event.

I learned of this event around June of 1947.  The person who told me was my good friend ((name deleted)).  As a background, understand that after WWII, many American Officers brought their families to Europe and Japan as a part of the Dependents of the Occupation Forces.  I was one of these dependents, my age was 10 years old.  We lived in the ((deleted)) Compound on the Bluff, by the horse racing track and POW camp, at the edge of Yocohama, Japan.  We, the ((family name deleted)) lived in House ((deleted)) and the ((family name #2 deleted)) lived in House ((deleted)) Compound.  The houses were two story with flat roofs.  The roofs were made to use, much like a top deck. ((name deleted)), son of Colonel ((name deleted)), 8th Army in Occupation, was with his father one morning.  They had a Japanese brass telescope Colonel ((name deleted)) brought home for his son. They also had a 7X binocular.  They were experimenting with the telescope, at the time this occured.   I will paraphrase what ((name deleted)) told me, for it is worth being recorded.  They were taking turns looking through the telescope and binocular when ((name deleted)) father noticed a dark shape in the sky.  A perfect target on which to experiment with.  Colonel ((name deleted)) first looked at it through the binoculars, then took the telescope and brought the boject into its field of view and focus.  I was soccer shaped. (( ((name deleted)) said he and his dad took turns watching this object through both the binocuar and the telescope.  It was traveling toward them.  It traveled over to and above the race track and paused.  That was about one mile away.  It paused.  ((name deleted)) said it was not high, probably several thousand feet in the air.  This would put it under any cloud cover.  I asked what did it look like?  It looked like a soccer, it was ""metal-like, but the underside was somewhat darker.  The edge of the soccer was sharp, not rounded.  It had no windows or such.  I asked what did it do?  It move around and then stopped in the sky and just hovered.  Then it would move to another locaation and again hover.  For the record, at the time (1947) Yocohama showed the full brunt of many B-29 strikes.  The city was 90% burned out with an occasional structure standing amist a totally distroyed area, block after block.  Down toward the harbor, the canals were chocked with sunken wooden junks.  Out in the harbor several large ships were sunken in the harbor. The dock facilities were equally damaged.  The city was totally distroyed.  Many of the people who lived in the hills surrounding Yocahoma were really the only houses spaired by the bombing strikes.  The race track wa also spared, probably because it was a POW camp. ((name deleted)) said this ""craft"" was slowly crossing across the destroyed city.  It looked like it was inspecting the damage.  Where did it go?  I asked.  It went across us and slowly made it way across the city heading toward the harbor.  Did you see it by eye and in the binocular and telescope?  Oh sure, it was easy to follow.  I was in good view, expecially in the telescope.  What did it look like?  Like a soccer.  It was round, it was soccer shaped.  Did it make a noise?  No, not at all.  I was totally perplexed.  This was the first time I ever heard of a flying machine shaped like a soccer.  All flying machines had wings and big motors and they dropped bombs and shot machine guns and made lots of noise.  None hovered!  How long did you watch it?  I asked in perplexed wonder.  A long time, we watched it go out toward the harbor.  It moved around, paused and then turned off toward the left(toward Mount Fugiama) It slowly moved off.  we watched it until we could not see it any more, even in the telescope.  What was it?  I don't know.  It wasn't an airplane.  What did your dad say?  He said it wasn't an airplane.  He didn't know what it was, but it was real, we could see it.  The binocuar and telescope gave us real good views.  With that, we went on to other things that 10 year boys do.  We probably went over to the open field where we played baseball with the Jananese children.  I played right field.   I seem to remember ((name deleted)) was a baseman.  Anyway that was the end of our conversation about the unidenitfied flying object.  I left Japan in August of 1947.  I believe ((name deleted)) was still living in House # ((deleted)).  I do remember asking him about this strange soccer.  I asked what his father did.  He reported it.  I asked, what happened?  He said, ""Nothing.   We never heard another thing.""  As far as I know, that is where it ended.  His father being a full bird coloner in the 8th US Army, like mine were pretty VIP.  He reported it through chnnels and that was that.  They did not receive any feed-back, as of August 1947.  However make no mistake, the US Army was duely notified of the sighting.  That's as much as I know.   I hope ((name deleted)) or his father have already made this report. In this case, I prefer to defer to that that said.  At any rate, this is as much as I know, as close to the actual conversations as I can remember.

When a young child, around 6-8 years old, I was out back playing in the yard alone during the daytime.  My mother was inside.  Our house and backyard were very small. Backyards were all ajoined by wire fencing; and most had open space in yard between back of house towards the end of the yard, where most had trees for privacy.  I looked to the left and notice something that I would describe as shiney but dull metal, shaped like a perfect ball. ""Silverish or grayish"" in color. It was very SLOWly rising up from the ground ... straight up!  I first took notice when it was about 4 feet from the ground. ""Superballs"" (rubber balls of size from 1 inch to fit-in-your-palm size) were popular then. At very first I shouted ""wow! a huge superball..."" but realized it kept going up ... and up ... and straight up it kept going! and so slow! I watched it till I decided to yell for my mother before it disappeared.  I remember it getting shinier but not sure if that was due to the sun reflecting on it or not.  My last recollection was a shiney round sphere that ascended very slowly into the ""sky"", going straight up, and I do not recall thinking it rotated.  My mother first said ""oh that was a weather balloon"" but was clearly shaken.  I kept insisting on what I know I saw. I knew that was not a weather balloon. She did NOT let me go out to play the rest of that day.  NOTE: My mother before marriage had witnessed a ""cigar"" UFO in St. Louis.  (This of course I never knew till I was much older and after talking about the sphere incident now and then when growing up.) So this might have been why she was worried that day.  UFOs were something she never spoke about.  In fact, I remember she would never allow me to watch Outer Limits.  She hated that show.  If need be, please edit for posting. Thank you.

It had when it got close to us 1/4 mile and hovered it had a glossy shine to it. I did some checking may or may not mean anything? But back then at least ours was, T.V. was black and white. T.V. was really,for the most part not around very long. The TV 2 tower near us then first broadcast was on Nov.28,1954. So my thinking that it either picked up the signal with in 10 to 11 light year area from earth. If it came from a nearby star system. Or if it was a probe or ship of some kind that was just passing by and picked up the signal and followed it back to there, then who knows where it came from?

Looking closer I noticed two circular glowing red holes like jet engines at the back of a dark un quantifyable craft from where this huge fireball was protruding the fireball must have been 50 ft. long once compared to the size and altitude of the craft.   Than the fireball completely vanished leaving the two glowing engines and then they vanished and so did the craft.

During the middle of August, 1967, I am not sure of the exact date, I was out in my back yard playing, in Sag Harbor, located on eastern Long Island.  I was 13 years old at the time, and it was about 9:30 at night.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a round illuminated globe through the trees in the direction of south/south east. It was about the size of a full moon and I assumed it was till I realized the moon itself was out also more to the southest.  It was clear, no clouds and average summer night temperture.  As I stood in my back yard, facing in a generally south direction the object came over the trees towards me into view.  It was travelling north west about a lazy 5-10 MPH straight and level course was silent and with no trail.  It was about 200 feet from me. probably about 75-100 above the ground.  I will now describe what I saw, even though its 38 years later I have a razor sharp memory of it.  The object was a globe, approx 25-30 feet in diamenter. The globe glowed light green. It was not necessary a solid object, although it could be.  It had a haze around it, sort of like looking at a car headlight in fog.  Note however, that the haze only surrounded the object a foot or so, as it was a clear night.   The haze was without question caused by the object. The haze was unusual in that it resembled fog, but was not fog. The were NO other lights on the object of windows or the like.  The object was completely silent.  As it continued to approach in my direction and was not to far from being directly overhead, bright flashes began coming out of the bottom of the object. These were not lights or beams of light, but very closely resembled the bright white flashes one sees when you use an electric arc welder.  Almost identical.  So much so, I am sure it was some type of electrical device causing it.  The flashes were so bright it lit up the top of a 30 foot tree under the object.   At no time was there any noise.  At this point I had an intense feeling of fear and ran in the back door to my house.  I did not say anything to my mother, but she must have noticed something was wrong as she said, ""you look like you've seen a ghost.""   Later I advised her what I saw, and when I gathered the nerve to look outside again, the object was long gone. My guess is that it was one of the following. 1. an alien spacecraft. 2. Some sort of life form, or 3. some still unknown electical phenomenon.  I lean either toward an unknown life form or electrical phenomenon, as I don't feel there was a crew inside, but I also do not feel it was a natural occuring event, but was under some kind of intelligent control or the object itself had intelligence and I had the feeling it knew I was standing in my yard looking at it!  Bottom line, my mind doesn't know what to make of what my eyes saw, and probably I will never find the answer. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I don't know that what I saw is in amy way unusual - it may well be completely conventional, but I was struck by the characteristics of this object.  It was up in the clear night sky, similar in size and velocity to a satellite.  What was unusual (at least in my experience) was that it ""sparkled"" - I have been referring to it as a ""fast sparkler"". It sparkled in a regular pattern, it seemed to me, in maybe three levels of intensity, over the space of a second or a bit less.  My personal explanation is that is is a pulse-jet driven craft (Aurora?) but who knows?  Maybe it was a conventional military craft at Mach+ speeds.   I do not believe it was a meteor as it did not appear to change it's flight characteristics in any way (altitude, sparkle rhythm, brightness) and it appeared to be travelling precisely west to east.  I saw it cross at least 80% of an almost horizon-to-horizon vista over a span of maybe as much as 30 seconds.   If it wasn't for the speakle, I would have assumed it to be a satellite and not given it any more thought.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,,

Our farm is located in Hampton County, near a small town called Furman, about 40 miles north of Savannah, Georgia, and 90 miles west of Charleston, SC.  This event took place in May of 1969 on a Thursday night, beginning around 9:00 PM (I remmber the day because we had a service every Thursday night called Training Union; it was a Southern Baptist church).  My entire family witnessed the event, including my father, born 1924, and a veteran of 31 combat missions in WWII as a tail gunner on a B-24 Liberator bomber, my mother (a nurse), myself, born in 1969, and my two older sisters born 1960 and 1962. We were planting crops (I think either soybeans or corn) in a 25 acres field that was maybe 600 yards from our main house, seperated by a strip of woods.  My father was on the tractor (an old Farmall), and my mother and the rest of us kept the tractor filled with seed for the planting process.   I first noticed a very bright star which, because the area is so rural, and the fact that we often worked at night, we were familiar with the night sky.  I brought this observation to my mothers attention who paid me little attention.  As the light approaced (across the highway over the woods in a westerly direction) my mother finally looked up to see what I was talking about.   The object looked now to have approached closer, just above the woods.  My mom ordered us kids into the truck (a white 1963 international).  My dad, we later learned from him, had stopped the tractor at the opposite end of the field, and by his own admission was afraid to come back toward us.  He was, i's estimate 400 or 500 yards distant at that point.  I remember that my mother started crying and the rest of us did also when the truck wouldn't start.   Of course, when your six years old and you see your mon panic, you panic.  I do not remember viewing the object after getting in the pickup truck.  But I remember daddy returning on the tractor, saying he didn't know what it was. As for the characteristics of the object:  oblong in shape, somewhat luminous, made absolutely no soound; appeared as a small star that got larger.  Do not remember a  color. THis incident was often discussed in our family, and a few years before my fathers death, three of the five witnesses drew independent sketches of what we could remember.  The oblong shape matched, although we were in disagreement about a protrusion on top or the bottom of the object. This incident has never been reported to any offical agency until the writing of this letter. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the witness, and he will attempt to have his older sister submit a report, as well.  He sounds like a very responsible witness to us, and we suspect that he is quite credible.   The witness indicates that the event occurred in May 1969, but he is not certain of the day of that month.  However, he remembers that it occurred on a Thursday night.

Shortly after he left we all noticed a cigar shaped object directly over the Bay which was hovering at about 5,000 ft. with flames coming out of one end.  It was stationary and stayed in place for several hours.  During this time we witnessed the scrambeled F-102's (there were no F-104's or F-106's at Ellington as reproted in other reports) from the ANG circle the object and they stayed on station unil running low on fuel and returning to Ellington, some 15 miles to the south.

We noticed coming from the north a sphere very high up heading towards the south east, because it was so high it took quite some time to cross the sky. Then we noticed another coming from the east, at a right angle, at about the same altitude (very high up).  The two shperes came together, looking like a figure eight, almost appearing to be right above us. They remained together for at least ten to fifteen minutes.  They then separated and the one coming from the north continued to the south east and the other went straight back towards the east.  This was a Saturday afternoon.   In the Sunday newspaper there were reports that others had seen the same thing.  Rhodesian Air Force had received reports but had no comment.  They were not birds or aircraft. As a child in the 50's, I remember my uncle who drove a truck that picked up corn from farms saying that early one morning out in the countryside he had had a frightening experience when a large light appeared behind his truck, it was a dark night, the light followed him for some time then flew at very high speed over his truck and disappeared up into the sky.  There had been two black workers riding on the back of the truck when it happened and they were absolutely terrified.  Also in the 50's my grandmother, a no nonsense type of woman, had also seen a UFO from her house early one morning.  These were times before any jet aircraft were common in African countries. Granny's UFO was also reported by a number of people. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Actually there are two times I have witnessed UFO's.   The first which is the one I mentioned up top here happened when my friends and I were playing at a wedding reception.  I was about 15 at the time.  It was in a very remote area, all country.  We were walking down this dirt road and it was very dark, no street lights, when all of a sudden the whole area lit up with a very bright white light.   My first thought, and I said this out loud was that we were getting a bad lightening storm.  I looked up at the sky and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.  We were all very confused as to for a second as to how that could be.  Then we saw this round bright light rising into the sky, to the left of us, changed direction and flew away very fast and was gone.  After thinking about it later I realized that whatever it was must have been pretty close to where we were.  Maybe we scared whatever it was but I will never forget how bright that light was. The other incident was about ten years ago.  My wife and I were driving home from her parents in Memphis MI.  As I glanced out my drivers side window I noticed three objects flying in formation in the clear night sky.  Many colors coming from each, not flashing, just kind of glowing.  They were going very slow, much slower than anything I have ever seen, and then picked up speed and were gone.   It was hard to look for more than a few seconds each time as I was driving but I did get a good look.  They were gone by the time I had a chance to pull off of the road.  Only lasted about 30 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2006-02-14T00:00:00,45.26740436137072,-66.05407663551402

He recommended that I forward this to you and spoke highly of your efforts.   Here, then, is my e-mail to him in part.  I removed an introductory paragraph as well as my name from the body of the text.  Best regards and good luck  ""The year was either 1972 or '73 to the best of my recollection. I was in the back yard of our house on Robbins AFB one evening with my Father, an active duty major at the time, and would have been around 9 years old.  I saw some strangely colored stray clouds (which in hindsight were probably very slightly colored by the sun that was no longer above the horizon) and had asked Dad to explain what I was seeing when a bright blue circular image suddenly formed in the sky as if someone had removed the cover from a spotlight and had projected an image onto a screen in the sky.  The disk was slightly larger in appearance than the actual moon, which was on the opposite horizon.  I called for my younger brother, sister and mom and we watched this disk as it remained stationary for several minutes then slowly dissipated over a period of time as if air movement was breaking up the ""screen.""   We were all very familiar with the local aircraft, beacon lights, etc. as Dad was a pilot and he couldn’t explain the phenomenon. The object was stationary while it held together and did not appear to have an active source such as beam of light.  There was no sound coming from the object.  Its relative brightness was somewhat more intense that a full moon on a clear night.  It was a balmy night with widely scattered clouds. To the best of my memory it was halfway up in the south western sky from my vantage point.  My impression was that someone projected an image in the sky that left a glowing blue stain on fog or cloud particles. Our next door neighbor, another USAF officer, saw us looking skyward and came out.  He was also fascinated and at a loss to explain the phenomenon.""

My background is one of a traveling troubleshooter and consultant in the field of electronics.  It was my job to find what others had missed and detail was part of my daily routine. ....Also, while in the Air Force, I taught instrument flying techniques and procedures.  I am quite familiar with aircraft and have lived my life with an objective eye. Story, objective side:  While driving (after sundown, before dusk, with wife and two youngsters, only car on the road) just outside of town we spotted a soft white 'glowing' object. 'It' was hovering a few feet off the ground about forty yards from the highway to our left. It was shaped something like a slender football, maybe twelve feet long (including the aura) with rounded ends, although the shape was somewhat obscurred by something of an 'aura' around it. ....While the object was close to the ground, nor at any other time, I did not notice any reflection from the glow and it was not necessary to squint while looking at it. There was no audible sound and no discernible markings or lines.  I had slowed down to observe through my open side window and the 'object' began moving parallel with us..... I stopped. The 'object' continued slowly approx fifty yards, rising to about forty feet, and made a ninety degree right turn, came to my side of the road and made another rt turn and came straight at us. The shape at this point was approx. five feet wide by four feet high, as though a front view. (About that time I was very excited and had my eyes glued on it.) ....At any rate, the object, just over the power lines (maybe 25 feet), hovered right over the top of the car for a moment and then quite suddenly disappeared - in the blink of an eye! My next focus, amidst bewilderment, was on one of a few stars which had braved the twilight.  Subjective: I sensed communication, that the 'object' was not a vehicle, but life/intelligence.  My wife's objective description is the same as mine, the children remember that they saw the object, but nothing more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Its strange because I live close to the airport and the object i saw wasn't following the same flight path as the other planes and no planes followed that path after I saw it because I waited 30 mins after too see if any other planes followed that flight path an none did, they were coming in the opposite direction south to north.  And I usually hear the planes as they take off and land,and they are easy to identify because they are noisy and low to the ground....but this thing made no noise,and was much too high in the air to have just taken off from Sydney Airport.  And it was a really intense white light,which made me take notice of it. Also the sun was already up and all the planes that were landing weren't using their navigation lights as it was daytime.  As I saw it pass behind our tree at the front of our house it just disappeared. And it couldn't have been a plane coming directly at me as it moved horizontally across the sky continuosly glowing (no blinking of lights like an airplane - just an intense glowing white light), and I would have seen the tail and the shape of the plane as well.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,,

It was too far up or away to make out a shape but, I went to get her binoculars & through them was able to distinguish it as Silver object with a bright Turf Green & red-orange light.  It's location was North-East of the home & we looked up at it at an approximate 45-50* angle.  We thought it was a hot air balloon but thought it was odd for it to be so high.  It seemed to just hover at the same altitude & location for 8-10 minutes from when we spotted it then it began to get smaller or further away for a couple minutes becoming harder to find when we looked away but, still visible without the binoculars.  A small jet passed flying Northwest almost intersecting our view of the object & then shortly after that a commercial jet flying higher & a similar direction passed both giving us the impression that the object was both further away & at a higher altitude.  About 12-13 minutes into the sighting the object streaked out of my sight (One thousand Two) & it was gone. T his really startled me since I had resolved myself to this object being a balloon.  Its direction of exit was downward to my right at approximately 15-20 degrees which might have been South to South Easterly.  We watched the two Jets fly by earlier from a closer distance & they were slow compared to the speed at which this object Zoomed out of sight. I then called 911.

It was translucent white in color surrounded by a misty teardrop shaped aura.  It looked similar to a plane with swept back wings but neither of us felt is was a plane.  It was going north to south at a very high altitude.  It was so high it was barely visible; it seemed to blend into the blue sky.

This was extremely unusual.  In a concerned manner she said what is that.  I have been hearing impaired for many years and wear at least one hearing aid.  I concentrated and it seemed like every animal or bird was making noises.  Our neighbor had horses that were acting up.  The next neighbor had chickens that were belting out and our cats were agitated.  I had no idea what had them spooked and said I was no farmer and was dinner ready. We went in and I had dinner.  Our home at that time was what could be called a by-level or raised ranch.  After dinner about 30 minutes latter I perched in front of the TV which was located in front a large window facing out to the east.   Although I cannot remember the exact date I recall  watching the evening news with Walter Cronkite that evening.  My wife was sitting on the couch also viewing the news.   I looked up from the TV and saw off in the distance two blinking lights about 30 feet apart of which one was red and I think the other was blue. I  thought  it was a small plane making an emergency landing and was concerned that the site was not level and had a lot of trees and a large pond.  When the two blinking light arrived at the pond they both disappeared.  Approximately 30 seconds elapsed from first seeing the lights till they disappeared.

My wife and myself had come down the stairs and were viewing the event from the front stoop of our home.  We both felt very tranquil and had no fear.  I would have given anything to go and satisfy my curiosity.  As a matter of fact it will be my first question when I reach the here after.   Viewing the craft was about a minute.  I had the feeling that it just shot upward at blinding speed, however, it could have just disappeared with some other technology.   After the event the animal sounds subsided. We learned a few days latter that a neighbor across the street had also seen the unusual event.  Other reports were made as we learned it was reported in the Akron Beacon Journal and other media. Could something been exploring our earthly world and the animals with their superior hearing know it? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Was sleeping had to go to bathroom when I saw what I thought were to black children a little older or taller than me in my room with my brother.  I was squinting but thought they were there to take the TV.   As I have at this time just moved to West Orange from Newark and only thinking that they were African American because the afro' look was still prevalent at the time.  Being a harvest moon at the time in a house surrounded by 300 acres of reservation land and a large picture wall window was directly in front of me an my brothers bed so the moon lighted the room well.   Upon opening my eyes a second later I realized even as a child that they were not black children, but what is now the so called grey's which I would deem grey more a light blue an silver but very similar to what has been popularized fictionally an very much alive.  Still seems funny to me when people throw the line maybe were not alone in the universe because if one is right in front of you that thought blinks buy to the’s next.   To cap this quickly one the larger one stood off in the back an just stood there with what seemed a nasty look on its face one to the left of my brothers bed and one knelt on the other side of my brothers bed with what looked like a box an was doing something to his arm.  I at this time thought they were killing him and could not summon any courage to do anything but not move or be seen myself.  I thought that I could fight but there were three a seemed an eternity for me of what was my fate or what I should do.   My thought of screaming and or jumping up a tackling one was the best idea I could think but I was petrified in fear and didn't have the courage.  Sure as shit they say the little bastard near my brother’s bed got up and walked around a came to me.  Let me get this straight to you this was like having a terrorist coming at you to do harm as far as I knew.   He knelt and opened a strangely shaped box he was carrying at least for the 70's but still haven't seen anything like it today reached in the box to grab something.  I made a noise if I remember by accident and was beginning to cry an the ""man"" made a very unforgettable wince face ((hope you get)) maybe a grimace but the wrinkles curled and it was like he was yelled at for doing something wrong but during this time they did not speak although they looked like they were talking the whole time.   I can’t really explain the unexplained but the one who stood in front of me the whole times head moved and pitched slightly from left to right.   Anyway immediately after the grimace it was like a b-line to get out he closed the box immediately stood up an im telling you this was the icing on the cake they all moved like 1.  I mean it was like a the finest military coordination you have ever seen in unison they in stride not missing a beat filled out of my room abruptly.  With two more sliding into the rank from my parent’s room as they passed all together as one.  Anyway of course no one saw anything I didn’t move till light, told everyone and everyone didn’t believe yada yada same old story right.   But I assure anyone this was no dream and is not a situation where someone may feel confidant in saying I believe that he believes he saw something.  This was as real as anything; the sad part about it is that it really doesn’t matter.  An even if I could prove it, it wouldn’t matter anyway.   The impression I received from my experience I had was loud and clear.  Uncompassionate beings that are weak but very methodical that do make mistakes.  If any true understanding from this country or other nations about this race and problem I would agree that it should better be left unsaid. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event is approximate.

It a light on the end of the beak and around the wings and on the tail.  It was solid...meaning that the wings did not flap.  It's head was turned to where looking up, all you could see was one eye.  The color was very detailed and there was no sound.  It just hovered.

My stepfather said that he would go get him and he closed the door.  That's the last thing I remember.   What I do remember, I remember very vividly...as do all that were present.

They observed a classic gray alien standing with a rod in one hand outside the fenceline.   Following their training the member immediately challenged the being with his M-16 rifle and the being pointed the rod at him emitting some type of discharge knocking him out.  After this the being and object departed the area.   Upon examination of the nuclear warhead by Air Force technicians it was discovered that the missile had been altered so it was not operational.  This account was published almost word for word in the National Inquirer but drew little attention.   During this same time period there were numerous reports of UFO fly overs and landings near northern tier military installations but South Dakota drew little attention because it was not considered a northern tier base like Minot Air Force Base North Dakota.

Lauderdale prestige golf community. I lived on the 6th floor of a condominium in a gated, private golf community.  It had a balcony that faced (what I remember may be) Commercial Blvd. in Ft. Lauderdale.  I had gone out on the balconey (as was my habit) to watch a boyfriend drive out of the complex on his way home in the early morning hours.  It was a beautiful and clear night.  As I hung over the balconey watching for the boyfriend's tail-lights (which he'd tap to say goodbye), I heard a very low, throbbing sound to the back and right side of the building.  I had a good view of the space between the condos nearest me and I peered around the corner.  I saw a ""craft"", which I at first thought was some kind of advertising thing-- because lights were revolving around the mid-section slowly, like a marquee of some kind.  It also was bathed from the top and bottom by soft red and green light-- I cannot remember at this time which color was at the top or at the bottom, red or green. But those were the two colors.  As it moved between the buildings, very, very, slowly, I saw it was, well, a saucer.  An honest-to-God ""flying saucer"".  It was no more than 75 feet from me on the balcony. It was so close that I could see the ""windows"".  It was dull, gray metallic looking and seamless.  It had a dome-shape on both top and underside.  It was well-proportioned. It had ""windows"" or ""ports"" encircling the middle circumference that revolved slowly.  I could not see into these ""windows"" as the light seemed to be opaque.  The ""windows"" were similar to, I guess, airliner windows; rounded at the corners, appearing to be slightly recessed.  The light was not bright, but not glowing, either, possibly a little bit ""fuzzy"".  They revolved slowly and clockwise.  The red and green glow(s) at the top and the undersurface pulsed, but only slightly.  The sound it made I have best described as a low ""warbling"" of two tones.  I couldn't take my eyes off it, of course.  I was trying to believe what I was seeing.  It continued over the grounds moving south, and the thing that freaks me out to this day is that it started to follow the exact same road my boyfriend was traveling on out of the complex.  It was pretty much right behind him.  I thought, ""He MUST be able to see this thing, it's right on his tail."" This was BEFORE cell phones...  I lost sight of the road out after a few minutes and couldn't figure out if the craft had left the area over the road, but I think it did as it got closer to what I THINK was Commercial Blvd.  At that point it quickly gained altitude, like pretty much straight up into the air.  It didn't go up slowly, but just popped up like a balloon on a string you let go of, and then took off quickly southwest.  I called the Ft. Lauderdale police immediately and asked if anyone had reported a UFO in the area around Environ.  They simply said, ""no"".  I didn't make a report, I just said thanks and figured I'd read something in the paper the next day.  I didn't see anything reported, however.  I told my boyfriend the next day and he said he wasn't looking up and behind him, and didn't notice any lights other than his on the road.  But, the craft didn't have ""beams"" shining down on anything, anyway.  The road was fairly well-lit with those orang-y lights.  He believed me.  I'm a sober, logical, well-educated and intelligent person, not very excitable, either.  I took the experience in stride.  I know I saw what looked like the classic ""flying saucer"", and that's as simple as it is.  I don't know if anyone else saw the same one I saw, but I can't believe I was the only person awake in a great big complex such as the one I lived in at the time.  This sighting was smack dab in the middle of an extremely well-populated and popular area.  It still makes me wonder why, if this was an extra-terrestrial craft, why it would chose to show itself so low to the ground and in a place where it could expect to be seen clearly if anyone looked out a window or was walking a dog.  I've told other people in a matter-of-fact way exactly what I saw.  I never thought to find a website like this to report to until I finally got mad at the zillionith TV program about UFOs STILL with no explanation about similar sightings and went out to find a place to report my experience to add to all the others.  I'd like an explanation for what I saw, please. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2006-02-14T00:00:00,26.136914681280647,-80.21914075569657

It was a nice night, mild clouds, lots of air traffic up here.. commercial flights, small craft....   I was seeing a number of the typical very brief shooting stars.  A friend of mine had called me on my cell phone, and I was talking with him... at this time, all of a sudden, my friend Kyle yells out excitedly.. ""did you see that "" ?  I can't remember exactly what he said following that, but I remember assuming that he had just seen a shooting star...  It turns out that ((name deleted)) adamantly states that he was sure he had seen something shoot downward from one of two small planes that were in close proximity of each other, flying in opposite directions. I saw the planes a couple seconds after he saw this discharged object.  My best guess is that these planes were possibly flying 3 to 7 miles directly due west of where we were, which is very close in line with N.E. 75th St.  I Couldn't really estimate the altitude.. average for small craft I suppose. I learned from Kyle that this object he states was shot downward from the plane, was unmistakenly glowing red/orange in color.  Within 15 seconds, in that direction, there was a huge bright white flash, which seem to be more from the ground, than in the sky. It lit up the sky to a higher degree than lightning often would... just as a instant flash.  I thought the flash was quite strange, but was not yet alarmed.   Within another 15 seconds (and this is where it gets scary for me ) I saw a huge ominous dark cloud coming upward from the horizon.  ((name deleted)) unmistakenly saw this too !!   I am quite concerned about this ! I am sure many people must have atleast seen the strange and huge flash of light...

While standing in my yard you can see the plane traffic lanes going from west to east and ease to west. Well that night I was looking at the sky as I always do.  I picked up on a star in the North, North West moving.  Well it looked like a star.  It was as bright as a star.  I watched as it moved to the South, South East.  I first saw it at about 25 degrees in North sky and it disappeared at about the same in the south.  This thing was way higher than any plane I have ever saw.  It had no flashing lights just a constant white, like a star.  It went with the curveature of the earth and left no trail.  So I know it was not a shooting star.  It only took 30 seconds or so to travel from one horizon at 25 degrees up to the other horizon about 25 degrees up. Trees got in the way to the south and I first saw it about that degree to the North.  I thought, maybe a satalite or Space Station.   Then I thought glowing like a star, maybe the sun was lighting it up, but the sun is on the other side of the planet then and it would not make it look like it was glowing.  This is the first thing I have ever seen that made me think that it could be a UFO.  Also, there was no sound at all.   I do believe in UFO's this is why I go out back with the dogs every night weather permitting around 1 AM to 3 AM.   It was really fascinating.

In late summer of 1982, I (age 18) and 4 friends ranging in age from 12 - 17 were out on a warm and dark night driving for something to do.  In our search for adventure, we cruised through a grave yard on the edge of the city limits and near the local airport.  I was the driver, and as we explored the maze of graveyard lanes, my friends began seeing glowing white and red lights.  One of the girls in the back seat was nearly hysterical in directing me which way to drive so as to avoid the lights they were seeing.  I believed their sightings to be the late-night imaginations of ditsy teen-agers. I never saw what they were describing until, as I exited the cemetary, I stopped the car to ""call them on their bluff"" of seeing strange lights.  I parked along the road's edge after turning out of the cemetary driveway.  It was then that I saw, through my open drivers' side window, a red, soupcan shaped, glowing object - the color of a reflector for driveway entrances.  It was positioned about three feet above the ground, over the grassy ditch portion of the corner area where the cemetary driveway met he road. It didn't register for me that it was glowing of it's own power - not reflecting light from my car's lights. I thought that a reflector was exactly what it was and opened my door to prove it.  As soon as my leg moved to step out, the objct took off.  It moved quick and silent. The cylinder shape was traveling so that the cylinder was verticle in relation to the ground (like a bar glass slides accross the bar to the customer - not horizontal like a thrown spear).  It moved parallel to the groud and to the road. It glided at a steady and fast speed remaing about three feet above the ground.  I was so startled and frightened, I slammed my car door closed and drove away as fast as I could.  Even though I drove in the same direction as the object traveled I did not see it again. I wasn't looking for it. I was watching my gas gage at nearly empty and was trying to drive to get away from it.  I have wished ever since that I had not been so hasty in my get-away.  I wish I had taken more time to watch it and find more clues about what it was.

I went outside to have a cigarette in the wee hours, was listening to flamenco and working on a science project, I sat down and looked to the east at the constellation Orion and I thought, are those three stars the belt or the sword? They were in the configuration of the sword, but much brighter so I thought the belt? Then I realized they were too bright for the belt too. They infact did not blink as stars do, and I thought they looked like planets. They were somewhere between the brighteness of Venus and Jupiter at their brightest. But planets aren't typically that close together, and are usually more to the south. It was then that they started to move like a swarm of bees that have been aroused, slower than a bee though, faster than an airplane, in crazy paterns like circles, about the apparent circumference of the moon, allot tighter even. I thought nothing man made can move like that, so I thought is what I am seeing here is out of the noramal, could I be seeing a UFO. Before I could decide they stopped moving in circles and ellipses, or something like a path traced out by scribble, moved toward the horizon in a straight line and vanished beneath it. Orion was about a good three or four visual feet above the horizon. I used to work at an observatory, hence the accurate description.

I finally got him settled down a little and realized he was yelling...UFO..UFO..UFO...Look up outside of your gate !!   I ran outside and saw the largest objest I had ever seen which had many flashing lights and was moving very slow without making any type of sound what so ever.  I called the other military policeman at the admin gate so he could see it...I was so overcome that I climed up on the sand bags that surrounded my gate shack and up on the gate shack itself just to get closer to it.  The ufo stopped dead still then tilted to the right, it held that position for just a few seconds then straightened back up and then left at a high rate of speed that I have never imagined, it was out of sight in an instant and thats when the F-15s flew over and that was the first time that I had seen them fly at night and they came right over my gate shack at a high rate of speed.  The Lt and Sgt of the guard were notified and they stopped at the generator shop, then my gate shack then the admin gate shack. They had us draw pictures of what it looked like. The pictures we drew were very simular.  The airforce base close to us was Bitburg AFB which later advised us that nothing out of the ordinary was noticed on radar.  I still remember the name of the man from the generator shop but not the MP since he was fairly new there.  I swear this happened like I explained it and if you have any questions email me call me at ((number deleted)).

I thought it was a fireball although there was no lightening around but it was misty...however this fireball was not on a straight line path it seemed to ""dance"" along the tree line changing direction cleanly and swiftly. Well needless to say the rest of my gruop too had joined me in awe staring at this phenomenon, we had to staring at this for quite a while not realizing the amount of time that had passed...it had to have been a very long whilre because when we ""came to"" so to speak a very dense fog had settled in and we could barely make out each others outline  even though we were within a few feet if not inches from each other. This is the thing for years after I have nothing but problem pregnancies, one miscarriage after another, the Doctors all say it is because of extensive scaring in my tubes and on my uterus, that they could not explain. I have had no dreams or proof of an abduction but feel Iit would explain the scarring...please tell me I am not crazy !!   Also there are other things about my skeletal structure that put me in the Medical books in Pa. They had found extensions if you like on both my shoulder blades that resemble that of a birds there are 5 on each and extend only far enough to be visible in an MRI, the doc jokingly said it looked like I either did or was suppossed to have wings.

It made no sound, I'm not sure how high up this craft was, but I would estimate its size to the hole in the center of a compact disk.

My mother, who is in her early 80's, told me this story about 10 years ago. She told me that she has never mentioned it to anyone and only decided to tell me about it because she knows I'm interested in these things. She told me that when she was 17 (born in 1922) she lived with her family in a house that was just yards away from the railroad tracks. They were living in Keakuck Iowa. Her father and brothers all worked for the Santa Fe railroad which was why they lived so close to the tracks.  Once in the middle of the night she sat up in bed and felt compelled to look out her window. She said she could tell there was something large there although she really couldn't see anything, just a huge black oval ""space"" where there were no stars or anything else visible. She could tell it had a shape and it hovered over the tracks for about 10 minutes and made absolutely no sound. She never saw anything like it again but clearly never forgot about it.  She didn't tell anyone else about it for obvious reasons. The weird part about this to me is that no one had even said anything, that I know of, in 1939 about a similar incident. In later years after she married my father, moved to Portland Oregon and had 5 children we were always interested in Science Fiction movies or TV shows and just always believed they existed. My oldest brother joined the navy when he was very young and stayed for 16 years. During his time he was in China Lake for a few years and said he saw something that he could never EVER tell us about, which only made me more curious. I found out that the best way to sober him up if he's had a few too many is to ask him about what he saw. He sobers up and almost gets angry that I made him think about it... whatever it was.  I moved to the UK to be with my Scottish husband 9 years ago and am fortunate that I can hear Coast to Coast online. I love it when you're on and I thought I would take this opportunity to tell you about my mother's incident. I would like to add that my mother is a very honest person and wouldn't lie if her life depended on it.  Thank you for your time. I don't know if this is of any importance but I thought it couldn't hurt. I would be interested to know if there have ever been any other sightings like that so long ago.

One summer night, between 1977-1980.... I read a short article in the local news paper that claimed that 2 individuals recently witnessed a UFO event up the local mountain near a forest fire tower. Everyone was familiar with this area, and it was a nice night out, so we decided to go up there for a few beers and who knows, maybe we would see something. We were there for maybe an hour or so, and noticed lights shining upon the fire tower. It kind of looked like a spotlight, or maybe a cars headlights. Nothing unusual, so we weren't scared and we climbed the fire tower to get a better look. When we got up near the top, we looked over in the nearby valley, and a yellow glowing ball just floated up from down within the valley, no sounds. Just a very erie looking glowing ball. And then it hovered there for a few minutes as me and my friend were amazed by this. I would estimate the object to have been about 3/4 of a mile away, hard to comment on it's size at that range. It could have been 10 ft across... could have been larger 20-30 ft maybe. The interesting thing was that we knew exactly where it was... Since we know the area so well.  It came up with the mountain behind it, so it was not some very distant plane or star being mistaken.  You could clearly see it hovering there with the mountain behind it, less than a mile away. Down in that valley is an old abandoned strip mine that is flooded with water to the top.  Anyway, after a few minutes we noticed the flashing lights again, coming from behind us.  And in the distance we could see what looked like some sort of plane coming in towards us.. very fast, with blinking lights.  We were directly between the glowing ball & the plane, so it was coming right at us at low altitude.  Within a few seconds what appeared to be a triangular shaped jet passed right overhead maybe 200 ft above us, and towards the glowing sphere, and we ran down the steps of the fire tower scared to hell.  We got into our vehicles and got out of there pronto, a little shaken and amazed at what we just witnessed.  It would be interesting to see if anyone else comes forward that witnessed this back then, as apparently there were other sightings here at that time.

I then looked and did see a red light in the horizon just hovering, nothing too spectacular just a light like radio antenna or something.  I tried to make sense of it by telling them that It seemed to be moving cause we were in a car and the slightest turns would make the light seem like its moving.  But the strange thing about it was that it did not seem to move away like it should if it was standing still? We asked dad to stop the car for a better look and he downright refused and seemed to speed up instead like he was frightened.  I thought it was kind of strange to see him so scared like that. Eventually we lost it and did not make too much of a deal about it when we got home.... The next day I heard of reports of UFOs all over the airwaves and in the newspapers also. There was even a picture of an alien wearing what looked like a costume made up of lights. Then we really started thinking that we DID see something... Boy what I would give to have the clip.

I was with my best girlfriend, at the time, driving home from the Eastwood Mall.  We started joking.  We both seen these HUGE 3 bright lights in the sky. they were not moving at the time.

It was the hugest thing I had ever seen, just hovering with no sound at all, over her field.  It was lower than very tall tree tops.  We both started walking underneath of it. The metal was unlike anything yet, I have ever seen.  It was as big as a football field, with the three huge round white lights.  I could see all of these little compartments making up the whole bottom, that was coming down diamond shaped also. The only common thing that I have ever read was the same red light that was going around at the top.  The overall shape was like the one I seen in the Star Wars Movie that same year. That was just so uncanny.  When we finally started yelling for her sister and husband to come out of the house, and they did, it started moving slow, for a second or two, then made noise and sped off faster than anything I had ever seen.  I went home and told my mother, who said for me not to say anything for people would call me crazy.  The next day, however, it was seen by the workers out on break at Denman Rubber in Leavittsburg, where my husband was working at the time, and they reported it in the Tribune Chronicle of Warren, Ohio.

At the time, I was nineteen years old. It was a clear cool day on 17 or 18 November, 1978 and I was hitchhiking east from Jackson WY to Denver CO on Interstate 80. Outside of Rock Springs WY, I got a ride with a twenty-something year old professional driver who was ferrying a U-Haul truck. He asked me, ""Where ya' goin'?"" I answered, ""To Denver"". He replied, ""Sit back, we're headed all the way...that is if you don't mind going about 50 mph. That's all this truck'll do."" That of course was fine with me. The ride was mostly uneventful. It was a cool sunny day and there seemed to be almost no wind. Sometime mid-afternoon I noticed a point of light blinking due east at about 30 degrees, but I didn't really give it much thought and put it out of my mind. I figured it was sunlight reflecting off of an aircraft or something. As we headed towards Cheyenne WY it was becoming dark. The light I had noticed hours before had become strangely luminescent compared to the clear moonlit night sky. Things started to get strange when we turned south to go to Denver. The light turned as we turned and remained in front of us. The U-Haul driver became alarmed and pulled over to the side of the road and stopped. ""What the heck is that? I said, ""I don't know. I think I saw it blinking in front of us hours ago."" He replied, ""Yeah, I saw it too."" Then he continued, ""Here let me see."" At this he blinked his headlights on and off as if he was trying to signal whatever it was we were looking at. Suddenly, it appeared to get much closer (about the size of a quarter at arms reach). It seemed to have a cylindrical body with a cone on top, but I couldn't be sure as this was darkened by five luminous points on its perimeter. Each shot out what seemed to be rods of white light. I remember rolling down my window and I could faintly hear a high-pitched whirring sound. This all happened very fast and frightened the driver. He stepped on the gas. As we sped away, it seemed that we went under the apparition. Excitedly he yelled, ""Is that thing followin' us?"" At first I said, ""No."" Then I rolled the window down all the way, leaned out of it and looked back as far as I could. I came back in, ""Yeah, it's following us."" At this time, I could see out of the corner of my eye it shoot back into the eastern sky and hover from where it had begun before we turned south. We watched it several minutes and just couldn't believe what we were witnessing. As we talked about it, I glanced to my right at the moonlit mountain landscape. I noticed three or four hazy translucent purple spheres in the distance. I couldn't tell how far, but they were about the size of a nickel at arms reach. They seemed to be floating slowly, effortlessly, almost bouncing. It seemed as though I could almost see the landscape through them. They each had a smaller amber light that seemed to rotate, somewhat quickly and irregularly, around them. We watched these for sometime also. Again, I glanced to the east and noticed two star-sized points of light moving from north to south. I also noticed another point of light of similar size, further south, that was stationary. For some reason I remember telling myself that when the two moving points of light were in line with the third stationary point of light they would all move together. Surely, just a moment later when they all came on line, they all proceeded 'together' and disappeared slowly into the southern horizon. As we entered the Denver city limits we left the purple spheres with their amber companions behind. Only, the original luminous point of light in the eastern sky remained. The driver took me to a part of downtown with which I was familiar. So I wouldn't inconvenience him I asked to be dropped off. I walked about a mile to my brother's apartment and knocked on the door. When the door opened I looked up over my right shoulder and could still see the luminous entity/object flickering its shafts of light. It was about 1:00 A.M. so I went in and prepared to retire. I didn't mention anything to my brother or his roommates until the next morning. I can't say whether or not I experienced ""missing time"". Since then I have been reluctant to refer to what I saw as UFO's or extra-terrestrial. I have maintained a cynical view of contemporary scientific academia which too often relegates itself to dogma. I have complete conviction that our science at its highest is completely incapable of defining the infinite and infinitesimal dimensions of time and space much less defining whether or not margarine causes heart disease. I continue to keep my faith in Christ and I have come to believe that our best understanding of what I saw can be found only in metaphor. Simply, ""what was outside is inside"". I have had no such experiences since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))",2006-02-14T00:00:00,,

It was triagular shaped, lightly glowing underneath and you could see metal pockets and various pipes,etc.  We heard some noice, but not a jet sound or engines.

After watching these aircraft move off to the north and the east respectively, I turned my focus up to the stars directly above the backyard.  I saw a bright flash (as bright as the surrounding stars) which I assumed was one of the many aircraft which fly at high altitude which I have seen many times.  The flash appeared in the center of a triangle of stars directly above me. This flash was brighter than normal, and caught my attention.  I continued to watch the point in space, looking to see which direction the aircraft was headed.

It was approximately 2 seconds after the first.  2 Seconds later, another flash in the same position, only smaller and not as bright.

The colors were mostly bright white like a glowing light bulb comprising all of the center section running into about 10 percent of the revolving ring and transisting from white to orange and then reds at the outer periphery. There was a bright thick and continuous blue electrical arc surrounding but not touching the outer peripherial edge that was giving off a stream of orange / white sparks.

I was working then as an engine build-up mechanic for the Flying Tiger Line at their main base in Burbank Airport. Sense then I have worked for many companies within the Aerospace industry, retiring as a Project Assembly Tool Engineer. I have seen High speed aircraft flying just off the groung and overhead at just under mach 1. I have seen things happen in slow motion and reacted at a suprisingly high speed when jolted with an emergency adrenaline rush resulting in much detail being acquired within a second or two. Also I have not reported this before now because during the time I had seen the object I had told several people who I worked with and was laughed at and kidded for some time.

This incident happened to my father and his friend when they were about 11 years old, and the exact year isn't remembered. I submit this information because I've studied UFO reports my entire life and have yet to hear about an object quite like this one. My father and his friend were busy on a summer afternoon building a club house when they began to hear a strange sound. My father describes it as sounding remarkably like a metal object striking a 1/4 full aluminum can, only much louder(he tried several times to recreate the sound, at last using a fork against a 1/4 full can, which he said was very close to it. It would ""strike"" 4 times, then pause for a moment before doing it again. Naturally they looked around to see what it was. They saw, only a few feet above the trees, a 20 to 25' cylinder, slightly rounded on both ends, of a dull silver color. It had what looked like helicopter skids on the bottom, and between them, on the ""belly"", a strange series of symbols or writing (at his angle, he could only see part of it...it reminded him of chinese lettering). At the rear was a blue light or flame, very bright. Protruding from the bottom of the object was a silverish, bent tube. As they watched, the object floated, very slowly, from tree top to tree top. At each tree, it would stop and the tube on the bottom would touch the leaves (he said it looked as if it were sniffing them in a way). After a moment of this, it would move on to the next tree, all the while making the metallic clanking sounds. They watched it do this for a few minutes. It eventually turned and left only a slightly faster speed than before. It was soon hidden from sight by trees. They both ran home, frightened. This incident fascinated my father and soon UFOs became a life long hobby, which he passed on to me. I Have never known him to lie, invent tales, or even exaggerate. In fact he laments that he hasn't seen anything like it since. But the object remains clearly in his mind. I will include a drawing I did under his supervision. It is, he says, almost exactly what they saw. I have been trying to track down the other witness, but since this happened 50 years ago it hasn't been easy.

The military had it on radar and said it's altitude was 40,000 feet. People at that point could see it from the ground.  After 4 days air force jets were sent up to get a closer look, but not to fire at it.  As they reached about 20,000 feet, the saucer lifted up to 80,000, an altitude that the jets could not achieve.

We lived in a small parsonage in the Edith community which was a bit in the country. My Mother had gone with us on the move to help with my daughter who was 4 at the time. We're from Mississippi. My ex.was going to school at Lambuth college in Jackson, Tn had 3 churches and boy were things hectic. Anyway we had an elderly couple who lived next to us that we'd become friendly with. They were in bad health so we took it upon ourselves to sort of check on them. They lived about 350 to 400 feet from us if that and had a huge garden spot to the side of their house and back view of ours. Our bedroom window faced their garden and part of the house. We'd been in bed for awhile and my mom comes knocking on the door and says,""children, gret up,get up, there's something going on at the _____ next door! I wake up and think what in the world now. I was on the right side of the bed with the window next to me and when I looked in that direction I saw lights flashing. My ex was awake at the same time and said,I'll bet its an ambulance. Mama,by this time was in the room and was going on about,""look at that ,its an airplane! I'm trying to get awake and say Mama,how in the world would an airplane get out there?!!! So I peeked through the window,well we all werepeeking and there was this thing flashing all these multicolored lights right in the middle of these folks garden. I told my ex,Man that's ot an ambulance, why would they be in the garden out back, and have you ever seen an ambulance like that. This thing looked like a christmas tree lit up. there were red,blue,green,yello,white and amber lights just flashing all over it. I mean, if anyone had driven by,they couldn't have missed it. It looked like it was a pretty good size,the garden area had a lot of land on the back side. It didn't make any noise and it seemed like it was just a little above the ground. Mama is saying she thinks its a drug drop from a helicopter, I'm half awake and trying to sort this out and get her to calm down and be quiet. My ex is just WOW,look at that. I tell Mama, its not a helicopter,its got the wrong lights,its quiet and why in the world would anyone drop something in the_____garden in podunk Tn. I don't really know what I was thinking,it was just so weird. so we watched it for a long time. It just kept flashing and seemed to be turning, it kinda looked like a lit up turnip. That sounds silly but is easily understood. My daughter doesn't remember too much of this but woke up and thought it was Santa Claus. The lights didn't seem to have any pattern,they were just flashing all over this thing. What my ex and I did notice was that the lights didn't seem to be shing outward in a long direction but were confined pretty close, and cast shadows. By now,we're wondering why the ____ haven't woke up and noticed something strange in their garden.My ex had the bright idea of just going out there and finding out what was going on. I asked him if he was crazy,didn't he realize that we didn't really know what that thing was,my mom told him it was drug dealers and he'd be killed. I mean this was just really,really surreal. Mr. Davenport,at this time I don't think UFO had even crossed our minds. I know Mama didn't. That would be just too far out of her realm of reality and experience. So we watched some more. We remarked that if it was a helicopter we'd hear something,It was so close I could have probably hit it with a rock from our back yard. About that time,Mama pulled the curtain open wider to get a better view and I was trying to get her to quiet down and don't right in the window and the thing beamed a whitish ,blue light right at the window. Well whatever we thought it was, we all knew we'd been spotted. ___and I hit the floor with the baby,and Mama started crying and screaming that we were going to be killed. I remember peeping up at the bottom of the window and seeing this thing out there sorta of shifting and this light going through our room like a searchlight. Then it just shut off, the object rose slowly and just eased on. No big burst of speed, or anything like that. Mama wanted to call the police about drug dealers,my ex started the UFO thing and I remeber telling them,look, we can't call with wild stories about drug dealers cause that implicate the old folks next door, and we really didn't know anything of the sort, I told my ex that, we were new,in a goldfishbowl being in the ministry and young,what would people out there think of their new preacher seeing ufos in the neighbors garden? And God forgive me,I told my little one that it was santa checking the area out and that if she told anyone he wouldn't come back. The next day,I went over to the ____ house and asked them if they heard noises the night before. They told me they went to bed around 7 and didn't wake up until 6. They had a big,old house and probably wouldn't have noticed much anyway as their room was on the opposite side. I eased around and took a look at their garden area and there was no sign of any kind of depression,suggesting a landing,but the old stalks in the garden were whipped around.Looking back now,this was a very extrordinary event,maybe even more so than I know.How this got into the back part of my mind is the real mystery. But I was just 29 years old in a strange place and trying to be the perfect preacher's wife and model mom. I just installed a scanner and tomorrow am going to e-mail a drawing of what we saw. I'm 50 now,my ex is 53 and my mom is 76. I don't know what we saw. Neither does my ex. My mom to this day still believes it was drug-runners as she calls them. Me,my ex,who lives in Memphis and my Mom would have no trouble answereing any questions about this. Don't take my sense of humor relating this as this is some kind of joke, its just that it was just that way. Since then I've seen a ""few"" strange things and have no reason to mislead anyone. I just think by reporting what we see only helps us get a grasp on this thing. I would like to add that my mom is a very fine lady and pillar of her church. My ex is a man who I don't think would even know how to fabricate something and me.... I just tell it like it is. We are educated,sound minded people. By the way,I did post a sighting for Ripley for 1999. It was 1990,large rectangular craft. My typo. All the Best ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Date of this event is approximate, but there were probably several hundred to a few thousand witnesses (I know of 5 witnesses myself) and there were reports in the Kingston (NY) Daily Freeman and also on the local television news WTZA 62.  I was 16 years old at the time, at home with my brother, 14 and mom, 43.  My dad, 53 had driven his mom, 75 to Napanoch and also Ellenville to shop for groceries. About 8 P.M. my mom got a phone call from my dad who was calling from a pay-phone at was then the Great American supermarket (next to what was then the Channel Master factory).  He told my mom that there was a very large object in the sky travelling very slowly and that many people were watching it in the parking lot and also cars were pulling off on the shoulder of Rt. 209 and getting out of their cars to look at it.  He said he first noticed it as it traveled northerly and appeared to be at a height of about 2000 feet as it cleared the Shawangunk mountains between Ellenville and Napanoch and appeared to be about 300 feet wide. My dad called on the phone because our home in Mettacahonts was about 12 miles north and the object was headed towards us.  He said to go outside and see if we could see it, so my brother and I went out on the back patio facing southwest towards Ellenville and we could see it, so we yelled out to my mom who was still on the phone and she told my dad we could see it (and he was still watching it from 12 miles away). My mom quickly came outside and saw it too, but there were some trees blocking the view, so we ran to a large field behind our property to get a better view. Mettacahonts is elevated about 200 feet on the edge of the Catskill mountains with a view of about 50 miles of the Shawangunk ridge from south of Ellenville to north of Rosendale, and Rt. 209 runs parallel to the ridge following the Rondout creek.  We could see that the object was very large and had several white lights all around it.  There was no headlight like a plane or helicopter, and there was no red or blue light like some aircraft, and no flashing lights.  More importantly, there was absolutely no sound.  It was a dark night and calm, but with good visibility.  At that time there was only one light visible at night, from the Granite hotel in Kerhonkson, about 6 miles away.  The object seemed very low in the sky (below the top of the Shawangunk ridge) so it had to be lower than 1000 feet.  It also moved very, very slow.  It passed approximately over the Granite hotel and then took several minutes before it passed north of Mettacahonts road, so it's approximate speed was about 100 to 150 miles per hour.  We then watched as it went out of view somewhere towards Rosendale about 5 minutes later. We felt calm and it didn't seem scared at any time during the event.  Few words were said, partially because we were straining our ears to try to hear the object.  Normally, it was possible to hear cars travelling on Rt. 209 about 2 miles away.  But this night, there was no sound at all, so we definitely would have heard airplanes or helicopters if they came within 2 or 3 miles of our house as this object did.  Some news reports at the time indicated that it was only small aircraft flying in formation but there was no sound and the object maintained a steady speed and altitude over about a 10 or 15 minute time frame, so it could not be explained as several small aircraft gliding in formation. About 45 minutes or an hour later my dad returned home (normally a 20 minute drive).  His mom did not want to talk about the event, but he told us that at one point she got very scared and asked him to get them out of the area as they followed the giant object towards a large field near the Eastern Correctional Facility in Napanoch.  At that point the object passed directly overhead and he said he could hear a faint ""wooshing"" sound.  Then, as he tried to follow the object north on Rt. 209, he lost sight because the road had become completely clogged with cars.  Normally there was very little traffic at night on this rural road, but hundreds of cars had pulled onto the shoulder so they could get out and look.  But, after a while, the shoulders got full of cars and people began stopping their cars right in the highway.  It took nearly a half hour for the traffic to clear out after the object went out of sight.  Apparently the traffic jam was part of the reason it was so quiet that night. The newspaper ran a few small stories both proving and disproving the theory of light aircraft flying in tight formation.  The television news had the story that same night. Sightings were reported to the station from towns all along the Rondout valley and Rt. 209 all the way to Kingston, 20 miles to the north of our home. An episode of the television show Unsolved Mysteries had a similar story out of Poughkeepsie, NY that occurred around the same time, so it may be possible that this was the same object we saw (Poughkeepsie is about 40 miles south of our home). Nobody in my family was drinking or using any drugs at the time of the sighting.  My dad was a manager in a factory, my mom was a secretary, my grandmother was an active 75 year old with a sharp mind who lived by herself until she was 92, my brother was a popular kid in school who liked sports, and I was a high-honor roll student in high school.  There were also many sheriffs and state troopers who had to see the object as they tried to clear the traffic jam. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Long story short, very short,considering all related material about our lives since that is so important. My brother, father and I used to visit our family's cabin in northern wisconsin every summer when my brother and I were young. One night after fishing late, we returned to the boathouse, unloaded, and sat on the dock as we did everynight. Sudennly, I looked at my dad and he was pointing at the mouth of the channel our dock sat on. I turned and looked... here was this bright light, but contained, like not a flashlight, or anything else, and there was no sound at all, just a light layer of fog that night about a foot above the water. It was a very beautiful night, with stars, fog, etc. unusual. very dark, but moonlight. What I remember is my dad pointing to this light and I've never seen that look on his face.I look and from my left (this is narrow opening to a bigger part of the channel, at the point) a very bright light moved slowly from the edge of the woods on one side to the middle over the water. moved so smoothly, yet not on the water, but gliding slightly above it. It stopped right in the middle, which gave it a perfect view of us starring at this, and then it turned colors. Thats when my dad's trying to scare us by making a drunk fishermans flashlight seem like a ghost, actually scared the shit right out of him. after it stopped it faded into an orange color, almost spinning orange and red, I always remember feeling like it was focusing on us or trying to communicate, then at deep red and much smaller it took off, light speed, i don't know, but left a trail of red behind it into the woods at the point. My dad swore to my grandma he was just fooling us, scaring us, but as I learned later she was very concerned, because she knew of it, and was very interested in what the gov't is hiding from us, and used to lecture me of such things on that very dock, as if one day i'd understand, thesame with my greatgrandmother, one day(with a grin) you'll know. There is much, much more, and know i do Know, and i want to share it. It wasn't until i started growing up, reading and searching, and suddenly an explosion of reports, abductions(including my mother's, even though she believes it was supernatural gift of God) well, it was. I realized all these things i thought were isolated to me and my family were really happening all over the earth, fireballs, ""balls of light"" what we saw.This is all real and while discovering what i had always known inside on paper from writers such as Zecharia Sitchen, Graham Hancock, Erich von daniken.THIS IS REAL AND I KNOW SOMETHING ELSE AND I'm ready to let the cat out. please contact, anyone. thanks.

Date is approximate, however it was the night of one of my best friend's birthday party who turned 18 on April 4, 1985.  The party was actually set to begin around 9 P.M. but I needed to get there early because I was bringing my entire stereo system (which included a then-rare equalizer with spectrum analyzer).  I didn't have many friends back then, but whenever there were parties, I would bring my whole stereo, and for a while I would be the center of attention as dozens of drunk and stoned teenagers stared at the dancing lights of the equalizer in a dark room while listening to heavy metal music.  I, on the other hand, never drank or smoked or used any drugs in high school, and in 1985 had left high school a year early to go to the local community college in Stone Ridge, NY.  I didn't see my friends very much that year, so I was willing to put up with their smoking and drinking because otherwise I would never see them.  This meant driving my parent's car with the windows open even when it was cold so that the smell of marijuana and cigarettes would not stay in the car.  On this particular night I stopped on Tongore Road in Stone Ridge to pick up another freind who had no desire to get a driver's license even though he was 18.  This friend had a neighbor nearby who suppled him with marijuana and it was expected that he bring some to the party.  As I drove northwest on Tongore Rd. away from Rt. 209, he started smoking some of the marijuana, so we opened our windows.  We got about a mile away, to the flat area down the hill from Thumbprint Antiques, headed towards the Drumlin.  At that point my friend was already acting a little high, and was not paying attention to our conversation.  I saw what appeared to be a large house on a hill to the north with a lot of floodlamps turned on.  I said something to the effect that it must be nice to be that rich to afford such a big house and keep all the lights turned on.  For some reason, I felt like making a point of how he was not listening, so in the middle of the flats, there was a small dirt driveway leading to a field (like the kind farmers use to access their fields with a tractor), and I pulled in a few feet.  Then I pointed out the big house with all the lights on.  But when my friend finally saw it, we both realized it was not a house but a moving object.  Within a few seconds we both realized that the object was huge because it was several miles away and was as big as a house would appear from a quarter-mile.  It was travelling directly towards us.  It took a couple of minutes before it was nearly overhead.  We could both see that it seemed to have a flat bottom with many flashing lights and may have been cube shaped, although it was difficult to see the sides of the object with all the flashing lights on the bottom shining in our faces.  In that flat area there was one large tree, and the object appeared to be getting lower, as if to land, and was not more than a hundred feet above the tree.  I had shut off the car when we pulled in, and we had the windows open to air out the smoke, but we both noticed that there was no noise whatsoever.  Realizing almost silmultaneously that this was no normal aircraft (because it was silent, only 100 feet in the air, travelling very slow, and as big as a football field) we panicked, thinking that this thing was about to land on top of us and crush us. I remember feeling like an ant must feel just before a shoe steps on it on the sidewalk. So I started the car and squealed the tires, backing out of the driveway and drove away at the highest speed a 1973 Pinto could do.  We headed back towards Rt. 209 on Tongore Rd. up a steep hill where the car would not go over 30 m.p.h. and the object was nearly directly overhead.  It was going slightly faster than us and had gained some altitude to clear the trees on the ridge where Rt. 209 runs through Stone Ridge.  We followed it down Cottekill Rd. to Lucas Turnpike where the speed limit increases to 55 m.p.h.. At that point I was driving about 65 or 70 but the object was going a little bit faster.  We followed it for about 20 or 25 minutes before losing sight of it as it cleared the Shawangunk mountain ridge near the Mohonk Mountain House. We had traveled about 15 miles and the object had traveled about 25 miles during those 25 minutes, and it's speed seemed to go from about 35 m.p.h. to about 75 m.p.h., much slower than any aircraft I have ever seen. We drove over the mountain to see if we could see it over the Hudson valley near New Paltz, but the winding road and steep hills slowed us down.  By the time we got to the Hudson valley, it was gone.  When we finally arrived at the birthday party a couple of hours late, the other people were only concerned about the marijuana.  The keg was already empty, and they seemed a little upset that we were so late.  They accused us both of making up the story so that we could smoke the marijuana ourselves (which I definitely did not do).  My friend, the birthday guy, laughed when we told him the story, and 20 years later still does not believe either of us who saw the object, even though we have stuck to the same story for so many years. The friend who saw it aknowledges that he saw it 20 years ago and remembers chasing it many miles down dark rural roads, but seems content not to question what it was.  Whatever it was, it was big, like the size of a city block of apartment buildings 5 or 10 stories tall, but seemingly solid. This event is one of the biggest reasons I have never been on an airplane, because it seemed that even a jumbo jet could have crashed into this object and only dented it.

We were freshmen in college and dating at the time - we were standing outside in my parents driveway at about 11pm when we saw what appeared to be a very large, delta-shaped object with lights below it and a bright light shining out in front (similar to a helicopter). This object was coming from the North and passed directly over our heads at an altitude of about 500 feet. We were sure at first it was a very quiet military plane until it passed over and it made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I joked as it came towards us that it was a UFO and my wife laughed until it passed quietly overhead - she then burst into tears. It passed over fairly slowly, the whole episode took about 45 seconds. We called the Sheriffs department who told us that they had been swamped with calls about the object. They also told us that they thought it was probably an experimental aircraft out of Fort Hood in Killeen, 30 miles north of Georgetown. After reporting it my wife and I pretty much kept it to ourselves unless people were telling UFO stories. It didn't seem extremely important to me until I saw that drawing and read of the close proximity to where we saw our object. Note: When I asked my wife is she remembered the event she said ""of course"" but neither of us can remember exactly what month or year it was, it was either 1985 or 86 and it was summer, probably July and it was definitely late, around 11 or 12. I know this isn't complete but I couldn't read that couple's experience and not comment for whatever it's worth.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,30.65738063063063,-97.67511981981981

I want to make it clear that I do not remember exact dates or times so, I will try to get as close as I can.  My friend and I were about 14 years old.  We were wrestling in a neighbors yard as we did often.  I had my friend pinned down and he was fighting to get up.  All of the sudden, he froze and stared into the sky directly behind me.  I turned around and saw three orange-red circles in a linear fashion.  This object was not moving nor did it make any sound.  It would have been approximately 50 yards in the sky at about a  45 degree angle.  After a few seconds, the object starting moving towards a wooded area about 300 yards away.  We followed it to the woods.  I probably would have never mentioned this except for the strange events that followed.  I honestly do not remember anything after we got to the woods.  I do not remember going home and as far as I can remember, my friend and I have never talked about the incident.  I remember one time mentioning the event in the presence of others and was stopped short of telling the story by the friend that was with me.  The part that has always stuck with me is the way he looked at me.  It actually frightened me and still does to this day.  I have always wanted to ask him about the event but, I always “chickened out.”  After that incident, I did not mention the event to anyone for at least 9 years.  I, of course, leave out the details of the mystery of the event to the 10 people I have told.  I just say the object disappeared past the woods.  I do not want people to think I am crazy but, I just cannot get the event out of my head.  I just felt I needed to say something.  I have started to report this incident many times but, always erase it and try to forget about it.  The comical thing about me reporting this is the fact that I never planned on doing so.  I wonder how many people out there never do report their stories.  I know of a few that never did.  I bet you would have at least twenty times more reports filed.

It moved quite swiftly from my Left to my Right leveling out as it passed in front, and slightly above my position.  I have no memory of any sound associated with the incident.  The object might be described as a fat cigar with round features distributed down the side, somewhat like portholes. I don't recall how many. There did not appear to be any wings or lights. The overall impression that I have is that it had a metallic greyish appearance, with a slight blue or turquoise cast.  I remember it as being quite large which may be a reflection of my own size at the time.  Memory tells me that it was about as long as the width of the field below me.  It achieved level flight before it passed my position, and maintained it untill it disapeared to my Right. I don't remember anything about my circumstances at the time, either before or after the incident. I have questioned my parents about this, but they have no memory of any incidents that correlate.  An aircraft is unlikely even though the occurance would have been in the latter stages of WW2.  There is only one incident reported in which a crippled German aircraft passed over our home at right angles to the incident in question.  This was clearly remembered.

At first we were standing looking at lights racing across the sky from horizon to horizon.  Sometimes there were 3-5 at the same time.  They would make 90 degree turns on a dime and accelerate at a tremendous speed.  We were all baffled at the speed and maneuverability that the objects were able to make.   I estimate 20-30 people witnessed this event with me including officers and pilots.  Some of them contacted the flightlines and eliminated to possiblity of the lights being weather ballons.  Some of the pilots estimated them to be at 20,000 ft. or higher having a unbelievable rate of speed for being so high. There was never any audible sound heard. We ended up laying down on the grass watching them for about 1-2 hrs. I heard the flightlines made repeated calls to Wright Patterson AFB throughout the duration of the event.

They responded to my inquiry that the photo to which I referred had been blacked out of the microfilm image with a notation of a security step, which was totally stupid to me.

The year was schetchy, but I know he said it was after the war had ended, and before 1958. Over the city plaza, a large disk, perhaps 200= feet across just appeared and hovered.  He and the friend noticed first that the town's people were jabbering and pointing in awe at this thing above them. The disk was sivery, with noticable ""portholes"", and it  perhaps 200-500 feet above the plaza.  He was very impressed by it, for it darted suddenly over here to the left, then to the right, then in a moment, it dashed completely out of sight. As a recent grad from engineering school, he knew that nothing he had ever seen or studied could possibly withstand that kind of forces of acceleration and maneuvering agility.  He concluded that it therefor must be extra-terrestrial.  He was guarded as he told us, for he didn't share the account for concern that others would think him to be crazy.

While working security during the early morning of the 18th of August 2005, just before sunrise at 0530 HST, I heard a few of the neighborhood dogs barking.   I walked to the back of the property I was watching, a residential street, and I did not see any cars or people.  There may have been a stray cat around, but I didn't see anything.  I glanced up at the sky, which was still dark except on the eastern ridge of Manoa valley, when I saw a bright light with what appeared to be a lit cone area in front of it, like how a car with headlights on at night would appear from high up.   There were no clouds in the sky.   I assumed it was a helicopter overhead to survey traffic, but there wasn't any sound at all.  I couldn't tell at what height or distance it was at since it was dark, but it was overhead and to the west, and I was facing west.   As I looked at the object, the ""spotlight"" in front of it dimmed, and the light faded to the size of a large star.   I was about to dismiss it as an airplane, but the light suddenly stopped in midair, where before it had been moving towards me.  As it stayed there suddenly a faint light colored haze burst around it from all side, like smoke from a candle when its blown out, or the aura of the sun, only larger and more faint. It disappeared just as suddenly, making me second guess even myself.   Sorry if my description was vague.   As I watched the light, it seemed to separate into two smaller, dimmer lights, and then into three. The lights were the color of the stars and I would not have noticed them if I hadn't seen the larger light earlier.  The lights then moved to the northwest and stayed equidistant from each other, and although it was hard to tell in the dim light, I believe the spaces in between the light was a paler color then the surrounding sky.  The lights continued moving lower and lower on the northwestern horizon of the western ridge of Manoa valley.   The lights moved at a somewhat fast speed, but were observable for about four or five minutes since they stopped intermittently.   Just before they disappeared from view, I believe i saw the lights separate, veer away in arcs and then join together.  The time when I lost sight of them was 0542 HST.  I should note that I was not up all night.  I had just woken up for work 2 hours before and had gotten 6 hours of sleep the night before.  I am not superstitious, religous, and do not believe in ghosts or UFOs, or at least I didn't.   I have never hallucinated or fainted, and am not on any drugs, medications, or other physiologically or psychologically altering substances.   I looked around during the sighting repeatedly and when I looked back up the lights were still there.  Unfortunately, no one was around to bear witness to what I saw.

The object appeared to be white or silver and was roughly the size of a commercial airliner, or perhaps larger.  It was somewhere between 1 and 3 miles distant, at an altitude of perhaps 3,000 to 8,000 feet.  It appeared to be moving to the South-West, travelling much slower than would be expected for an object of that size.  At first glance, I assumed the object was a large airplaine, such as a commercial airliner, reflecting light from the setting sun.  However, as I watched the object, it became clear to me that there were no wings and no tail, as would be seen on a large jet, and it was moving too slowly to be a jet.  Then, I thought it might be a large helicoptor, so I continued to watch.  After a few seconds, the object changed it's heading slightly and it became obvious that it was not a helicopter either.  It was simply a giant cylinder shaped object.  As I said before, it was moving very slowly, and as my car was right there, I thought I might be able to drive closer to get a better look.  (This is not something I would even think of doing with any aircraft I know of.  Even small aircraft move much too fast to follow in a car.)  I kept my eye on the object as I walked quickly to my car, noticing that it was now directly reflecting the sunlight in a bright glare.  It was still in the same general area of the the sky as where I first saw it, about one minute earlier.  In other words, although it was clearly moving to the SW, it had not moved very far in this time.  After getting in the car and starting the engine, I looked to the sky again, and could not see the object.  I backed the car out and headed around another building to get a better view.  The object was still nowhere to be seen.  There were a few clouds to the West, but nothing but clear sky in the area where I had seen the object.  It had simply disappeared or moved away very very quickly (during the few seconds while I started the car).  The sky was still bright, and other objects in the sky could be clearly seen as silhouettes--birds, bugs, planes in the distance--but the large bright object I had seen just seconds before was simply gone.  Is it possible for a UFO to be visible only as a function of reflected light?  Maybe I could only see it for a brief time while it was reflecting sunlight in my direction.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,,

We looked up in the sky and both observed a pulsing light that was moving south across the desert sky. It was totally silent.  It would cross from left to right, then make a perfect right angle turn, go a short distance away from us and make another 90 degree turn to go across the sky to the left. Then it would make another right angled turn away from us, go a short distance and turn again to the right and go across the sky.

I was on guard duty on the wharf in Ewakuni Japan, in the summer of 1965.  I don't remember the exact date.  The wharf (causeway) goes from north and south, if my memory serves me correctly. Ewakuni Japan has a Marine Corps airbase there.  I was used to seeing the Navy jets and Marine jets and helicopters flying around the base. I never have seen a craft which could go staight up into the night sky like this one did, without any noise whatsoever. I was in the Marine Corps at the time, and was serving on guard duty for several days at this location.  There were several wooden boxes along the wharf, and I was basically walking around them.  To the east was the ocean.  To the west was the base. The sun had set about an hour when I rounded the corner on some of the boxes.  I was facing east.  I saw what appeared to be a bright light, (not enough to hurt your eyes, just a bright light.) come down from my left (North) and fly just above the water in front of me ( to the South).  I could hear the sound of the water hitting the object as it flew.  However the object made no sound, no engine noise, no jet noise, nothing.  The area was completely silent except for the splashing of the water. I estimate the the thing flew approximately 2 feet above the water. The object flew past me, but I could not tell you how far away it was. It appeared to me to be about 100 yards away, but I could be wrong. It went across the water, for about 300 feet, and then shot up at a 45 degree angle, and simply kept going up into the night sky.  I remember just standing there with my mouth open as I watched the thing continue straight up until it appeared to blend in with the stars in the night sky. (Incidently there were no clouds that night, to obscure my sight.) I finally turned to my left and ran over to a building (if I remember right it was a two story building, with the front door facing south.) I ran inside, picked up the phone and called the Officer on duty to report what I had seen.  When I told the operator that I had just seen what I thought was a ufo. I was told quite abruptly that I did not see anything, and had better not report it, if I didn't want to be labled a kook.  I was further told that I would be in very big trouble if I did. I hung up the phone and went back to my post. I have never seen anything like that since. I never told anyone but my present wife about the incident, but last night I was watching television and saw the program ""seeing is believing"" about UFO's.  Some of the stories were strikingly similar to what I had seen, so I decided to write in and let you know. It took a lot to write this down for you, as I do not seek publicity, or recognition. I am just reporting what I saw.  Perhaps someone else has seen something similar.  It is nice to know that I am not the only one.

It started slightly obstructed by trees in a generally northern direction and moved slowly and horizontally to the right with the ""open"" part leading the way.  It was about 15 degrees above the horizon and moved across open sky for an arc of about 45 degrees of sky.   It then stopped movement, in unobstructed sky, and rotated counterclockwise where the open portion faced upward.  In a matter of seconds, it faded from sight by a decrease in intensity of the light.

Bright lights were seen on the bottom of the craft illuminating the land around us as it banked to the east over Lake Ontario.  It was travelling at a high speed and appeared to be headed towards Toronto.   Craft appeared to have about 12 lights illuminating from the bottom.  Craft banked to the east then disappeared over towards Toronto direction not far from Pearson Airport.  No noise was heard.  Several other area witnesses came around asking if we saw the UFO.  Similar craft was seen in an old UFO magazine my parents picked up for me in the USA during the summer.  Craft in photo was not as clear as the one I saw with witnesses and lights on bottom were not seen, however colours were exact.  Local radio station reported it as a meteorite, not possible, but info was obtained from radio station from the Canadian Military.  Pearson Airport formerly called Malton was the former home of AVRO, which developed a flying saucer for the USAF back in the early 1960's, paid for by US military.  This project did not get off the ground but it became the forerunner of the hovercraft.  Also the CF 105 AVRO Arrow a nuclear aged supersonic bomber  was developed earlier at this location but was destroyed on orders of the Conservative Government.  AVRO later closed with many of their employees heading to NASA and had a hand in the development of the Space Shuttle.  Sighting could have been an experimental aircraft for the US military having to have a forced landing at Pearson or Downsview Military Airport in North York.  Lights on bottom may have been landing lights.  Craft did not appear to rotate, but as in the Stealth Fighter flew like a military jet - without the noise.  There was no evicence of a sonic boom but craft did not appear to be travelling in excess of speed of sound.  Lots of projects were ongoing in plain sight of the public many of whom  did not report sightings for fear ridicule. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I mentioned this to my girlfriend and we watched it for a couple of minutes.  It descended on the other side of the field and we forgot it as we were preoccupied.  Later I noticed that the object had reappeared and was moving erractically across the horizon.  I noticed that it was getting progressively closer and finally realized that it was heading directly toward my car across the field.   What I remember was two lights blinking alternately.  One was red and the other green as I remember.  About half way across the field it stopped.  I knew it was close to the ground for I could see the reflexion of the light on the ground.   By now we were both interested and did not know what to make of it.  It continued across the field directly towards us.  When it had gotten to a point very close to us, I think I panicked.   I was parked in a position just across a narrow bridge with no backup light that would make it difficult for me to back up.  I made the decision to crank up and drive toward the object instead.  When I turned on my headlights it stopped and the green light became a bright white.   I continued (without applying too much accelerator) down the road that would lead me directly under the object.  I was as scared as I have ever been in my life as we came closer to it.   I asked my girlfriend to move to the other side of the car and see if she could see anything.  She did and came back across the seat screaming that all she heard was a whirring sound.   I continued slowly down the road expecting the worst.  When I had gotten far enough along that I could see it in my rearview mirror, I stopped and got out to look.  At this time it took off with more speed than anything we have today.  It was a streak of light.  It was seen going over the town of Oak Grove that night by friends of mine.  There were many sightings of it during that time.  I saw my ex-girlfriend many years later and brought up this event to her.  At first she had no recollection of it at all.  She finally said that she thought she remembered something about it.

The campsite was around 30-35 miles east of Prineville, Oregon past a small village called Post.   One night during the trip I was awakened by a streaking lime green fireball moving very quickly across the sky.  It was emitting sparks (also lime green in color) and I could hear a crackling sound from above.  This whole memory is only remembered in a dream-like state.   In the brush across from the campsite about 30 yards away I saw a creature in a spacesuit-like outfit.  It was short and rotund, like the Michelin Tire Man.  It was in a form-fitting light brown color jumpsuit/spacesuit outfit.  It also wore a dark brown space-helmet with some sort of night vision/binocular type device in front of where it's eyes would be.  It stood about 4' tall.  It was just observing our observations of the fireball streak.   However the next morning a group of military personnel in a jeep and two US Army trucks questioned my parents about the event.  I think they were working on the idea that this was a crashed UFO!   I remember the creature probing my emotional state at the time.  Were we being tested in some way?  My parents are no longer around, I'm 47 years old now, and I was 9 years old at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Soon I noticed two fighting jets come from the direction of Jackson Air Force base toward the object. The object then rapidly flew away in a steep angle and disappeared.   I didn't report it then because of the derision heaped upon people at that time.

However, I do believe that most were natural phenonomen.  At least two I witnessed were not.  1987 approx, I was competing on a nocturnal motorsporting event in Wales, UK and witnessed a sighting that many people world wide have seen over the years.  In the sky, approx 60 degrees in front of me (and a crowd of non believers it seed at the time, I stood transfixed to a point in the sky.  An unusual line of 4 stars appeared.  They did not twinkle or move, but they were equidistant.  After a number of minutes these objects begand to move very slowly.  First one object moved from the right to the far left, passing each light in sequence then stoped.  Then another did the same.  This continued for a period of about two to three minutes before they all started to move being joined by further lights all on the same trajectory moving quicker by the minute.  Eventually a number of lights approx 8 to 10 moved back and forth until at what I can onlt describe as light speed (sorry) they shot off in different directions.  A collegue of mine, a lady, locked herself in her car and refused to come out!  This was witnessed by at least a dozen people.  None of which were aware that either of us were looking at the same thing until it ended.  Time did seem to pause for at least 2 hours.  Sounds silly I know but...it happened!  THe second episode was many years later between Christmas and New Year. I was walking through the towns car park on a clear night.  I was aware that there was something amiss above me.  To give a full description of the scene, I was in a built up area with mainly single storey buildings around.  As if a fog filled the sky, an object dusky grey in colour moved almost motionless over head.  This seemed to be, not necessary delta shaped, but simlar, with pale amber lights on each wing.  It took the size of this object to be the size of two large football pitches!  Then without sound one wing overlapped the other and the thing disappeared and the night sky was clear once more.  Where the Heck did it go!!!!  Unfortunately, I had my dog with me at the time so no witness to this sighting.  The above are true accounts and believe me, although not frightening to me, would have been to most persons.  Have you any other sightings of similar?

I told the tower what direction I was looking in and that was the last correspondence I had with him.   The craft was stationary and darted to the right very quickly and then dropped down to the bay and vanished.  I never saw it fly away in any direction.  It went right above the water.  I never saw any lights until I no longer saw the aircraft.  When it was out of sight I could see a brightness coming from the bay lighting the end of the runway.  I drove to the end of the runway and looked into the bay as the light started to dim and disappear. I talked to my commander the following day about what I saw and he said that they test all kind of things here but he usually has knowledge of the opporation before it takes place and he had not been notified.

I apologize if you are not interested in past sighting. It is just that it has never left my mind, but I had never reported it. I am not exact on the date and time ( I lived there from Jan-March of '88, and I just remember it being late at night.)  One of my roommates and I were in the living room, and we had no lights on in that area. We lived on the top floor of an apt. complex..  I believe 3rd or 4th.   I had seen something out the window in the sky.  I called my roommate over and we watched as a cylindrical/silver metallic object floated by for few minutes.  I wish I could give exact depth/measurements.. but that was difficult then and even more, since so much time has pasted.  My impression is that it was low, yet somewhat above the building, it didn't seem far off either, maybe 50 feet straight out yet we were looking up towards it. It was dark that night but clear, with street/city type lights present. To me, it only appeared about 3 feet tall and if I got a hold of it, as if I could just get my arms wrap around it.  I don't remember any lights, ignition source,exhaust emanating, sound, or distinguishing marks.  It FLOATED up right, like we walk.  No jerking or fast movements, just a steady float in a forward direction.  That is what was most bizarre, what made it float?  I remember trying to rationalize it..see if it was connected to something, like electrical wires, etc..asking my roommate the whole time if she sees what I do, and what does she think.  She said yes, but was speechless beyond that (even, was so freaked out after, that she never would make claim to it again.)  What kept coming to mind, was a probe of sorts, not a space ship with aliens, but who knows.  As it continued on that steady floating forward path, it cleared the corner of our building, making it so we couldn't see it anymore.  I ran down stairs in only a tee shirt, out the nearest door to our last sighting, into the winter cold, to find no trace of it.

I remember that it was suppose to be the closest Mars was to Earth in some time and after doing some research, I learned that it was the perhelion of Mars on 28SEP88. I do not remember if that was the exact date we went out, but it would have been close to that time within a day or two. The news channel in Madison had announced it and that is why I knew about it, so I am guessing it was the actual date.  We went out around between 1900-2200, I don't remember, but it was night and a chilly fall night. We set up the telescope facing the western sky and I do remember Mars was about half way up the night sky. We took turns looking. While my dad was looking through the scope, I turned around facing east and saw a small circular orange light traveling from north to south. It was way off in the distance and I remember thinking it was moving faster than a normal airplane, but not impossible. I was very curious and thinking it had to be an airplane of some sort. I waited to see the blinking lights. Instead, after a short while, the object made what seemed like a perfect 90 degree turn upward and zoomed out of sight in an instant leaving a streaking effect that lasted just as short of time.

Anyway, I do remember that this article was in the Des Moines register with a Picture of the Craft itself hovering over the River which is next to down town. This picture was very clear and ther was no mistaking that this was not something we created here on earth.I really cannot remember the exact date this happened(1980-1990's) but I do know this was a huge story that went on for a while but I am uanable to find anything out on the web on it. I am very interested in finding this story as I've heard so many stories from ""the saucer was using the water to stengthen itself?"" to getting power from the Electricity poles in the surrounding areas. It crazy some of the stories people can come up with. I'm positive these quotes were not something the newspaper had said and I am also not sure of exactly how long the ship was there but I know many people seen it driving across the bridges to get to work down town as did the traffic controller that moniters traffic from his news cam via helicopter. This was a huge thing. I'm hoping you can help me find more on this.  My other incident was in the late 1990's. Myself and a boyfriend at the time were standing outside talking on a warm summer night at a desolate softball diamond behind the appts I used to live in altoona, Ia. All of the sudden we look up and there is a flat shaped saucer. You could see the dimension of it so well due to the full moon. There were no lights on the craft that we could see. we both watched this as I would hover in one spot for 10-15 seconds then it would move straight to its left and stop and hover there where it stayed for much longer. At this point we went inside to get my dad to come out and see it adn of course he insisted we were seeing things and that we were. I grabbed an old telescopr that most likely was going give me no help since it was very old and we came back out where it was still there. I was so quite out side that it almost scared us but intrigued us even more. No sooner did I get the telescope out of its holder, the saucer shot straight out to the south and dissapeared. There is no way this was shooting star, or a plane or anything else made by humans as planes and such cannot hover in one spot and move at the speed of light with no noise whatsoever.

The saucer was (rough guess) half a football field round in diameter.  Possibly more.  A huge disk silently gliding through the air!  Set in from the outer diameter a few yards were a ring of lights, pulsating different colors at different timing.  It's been quite a few years past but I recall seeing red and green and possibly yellow lights.  It was riding low in the sky, roughly 5,000-6,000 feet above me. I continued down the road and the saucer seemed to be going at my pace, staying just over me.  I turned left and the saucer was still over me.  I took one last turn, which essentially  meant I was facing the direction from which I had just come and the saucer is still over me.

Resolution Northwest Territories.  My snowmachine experienced mechanical difficulties which resulted in us being forced to walk approx 12 miles back to a highway where we had left our vehicle and snowmobile trailer.  The weather at the time was quite mild for January minus 10 and there was light snow falling.  My snowmachine had broke down at approx 11:00 a.m.  We walked for several hours until about 5: p.m. at which time we stopped for a lunch break.  We made a small fire to warm up and boil some water for tea.  We were in the center of a small clearing roughly 300 ft in diameter and sitting under a large spruce tree.  We had been there for approx. fifteen minutes when we began to hear a low humming sound approaching from the east.  The sound grew steadily louder and the hum turned to a very low throbbing sound-like a huge engine running at idle.  The whole area was charged with an electric tingling.  We looked up but did not see anything of any substance.  After about one minute the object seemed to be hovering directly above our location.  We still did not see anything. Suddenly there was an intense flash of light like a million flashbulbs going off at once.  There was a pause and then another intense flash of light approx 5 seconds after the first and finally a third flash. At this point the noise began to move west in the direction that we whad been travelling.  The low heavy throbbing sound continued and finally faded away. We packed up our belongings and continued our walk back to the highway.  At no time did we observe anything, just the incredibly deep throbbing sound and the three flashes of light. We arrived back at the highway at 23:00 and returned to Ft. Resolution.   I am a private pilot with several hundred hours of flight time. I also have approx 12,000 hrs of time in various types of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft as a professional firefighter.  I am familiar with all the types of aircraft that are flown in the NWT and have never experienced flight characteristics that this object exhibited.

A shape could not be determined since the lights along its bottom were too bright to allow them to make something out clearly.   Said object however clearly did have three parallel, separate, long, narrow, pink colored lights which ran the length of the object, there being about ten feet between each pink line.

It was perhaps, 400 to 600 yards away. And I noticed it was hovering over some very large power lines. This thing was right on top of them.

I searched the sky over the city to the east and saw a F-104  ((sic--see below.  F-106's ""Darts"")) which I had seen in my area before and was famillar with.  The jet was heading diaganolly across the sky toward the Gulf of Mexico.  I looked toward the front of his flight to see if any other aircraft were with the jet.  I then observed a glowing reddish orange ORB moving in the same direction as the jet but again in front of the jet about perhaps a 1000 ft.   The object appeared the size of the eraser of a pencil if held a arms length.  The eye could not focus on the oject as it appeared to glow as an ember in a fire glows.  There also seemed to be a counter-clockwise swirling to the glowing object.  I had to slightly turn my head to the left to view the jet and all the while I could make out the features on the jet clearly.   The orb crossed over the island's seawall at a point I later measured and found to be 1 1/2 miles from my point of observation.  The only noise I heard was that of the jet and both objects proceeded out over the Gulf.  I then heard futher jet noises from the West and turning to look over the city to the west I witnessed two more F-104's flying only about 1000 ft. above the roof tops as they proceeded toward the Gulf toward the orb in an interception heading.  I lost sight of the Orb and jets as my view was blocked by a hotel that was on the seawall at the time.

As I walked through a large open area between the school and my next customer's house, I looked up to marvel at the number of stars I could see.  I then noticed two red lights directly above me.  At first I thought I was looking at an airplane, but quickly realized that wasn't what it was.  There was absolutely no noise, and the red lights were perfectly round.  The light was solid and didn't blink.  It wasn't defuse and didn't radiate which gave me the impression I was looking at bright colored spheres or discs, possibly illuminated from within, and not actual lights. The two discs moved together across the sky, one after the other, slightly staggared, not side-by-side.  They moved very slowly.  I remember thinking they were about the size of dimes.  I could not tell how high up they were, but they were higher than the tree tops.  I do not remember seeing anything solid between the lights.  I saw them as two separate objects and not lights at either end of something else.  They were fairly close together, about twice their individual diameters apart.  What made this memorable for me is I immediately recognized them as something unusual and strange.  It was like nothing I had ever seen or heard about.  I remember the sensation of heaviness, and a strong feeling of anxiety.  I was unable to move, and I believe this was due to fear.   I stood frozen and watched two perfectly round, slowly moving, silent, red spheres move across the sky for about two minutes when they suddenly accelerated away very quickly to pin points and then disappeared.

Objects seem 5 times in various locations over 45 minutes. Hi, we live in the Olympic Hills neighborhood in north Seattle.   At 6:45PM, while soaking in our backyard hottub, I saw an object in the bright, cloudless east sky that was a light/white ""dot"" in the sky, almost like a bright star, but it was pretty small.  I was sure it wasn't an airplane.  I thought it was more likely could be a mylar balloon that someone had let go.  It was pretty small and far away and my wife actually couldn't see it.   After watching it for a minute, my curiosity got to me and I jumped out of the tub and ran upstairs to get the binoculars.  On the upstairs back deck (also on the east side of the house), I observed the object through the binoculars but there still wasn't much detail to be seen...it looked like a bright white dot, only larger.  It was sort of like when you look at stars at night with binoculars... you can certainly see them better that with the naked eye, but they still are basically white dots.   The sun which was getting ready to start setting in the west was casting it's light eastward and was illuminating this object.  The object which I had initially seen straight east, had been moving to the north and eventually I couldn't see it anymore. I dismissed this object as a balloon.  I went back down to get back in the hot tub, leaving the binoculars upstairs.  Then 10 minutes later, I was surprised to see what looked like the same object, but it was a bit brighter and appeared due east of us, just between 2 tree tops.  I got out again, and went back upstairs to grab the video camera and binoculars.  I very quickly headed out to deck, but even though only 30 seconds had passed, the object which had been quite visible was gone again.  I turned the camera on and filmed in the same area where I had seen the object, but it wasn't visible.  I looked through the binoculars but couldn't see anything.  So this time I took the video camera and binoculars back down and set them on the table next to the hot tub.  About 10 minutes later, the object appeared again and this time both my wife and I saw the object through the binoculars and I took a video of the object which lasted about 30-40 seconds before the battery on the camera died.  With the camera running, I zoomed in on the object, and you can see the trees underneath it in the forground.  The video captures what we saw reasonably well.  With the battery in the camera dead, we passed the binoculars back and forth a few times for a few minutes, occasionally losing sight of the object.  My wife had the binoculars and said ""Oh, there's 2 objects now"" which was something I could also observe with the naked eye.  I took the binculars and what I saw was a bit odd.  There were definitely 2 distinct objects/lights in the sky that were close enough to each other that both appeared in the view of the binoculars.  But then I noticed that the one to the left actually consisted of 2 lights that seemed tethered together. There was a top light and immediately below it was another light that seemed to be swinging under the top light left to right and back again like a pendulum.  The two objects didn't stay visible for long and we lost sight of them again.  About 8-9 minutes later, a single light appeared again and I watched it for about 4 minutes through the binoculars.  It was far enough away so that I really had trouble finding it with the naked eye, but could find it eventually if I scanned around using the binoculars.  At this point it was just a single light and I didn't see the pendulum behavior anymore.  Again I lost sight of the object.  About 8 minutes later, again I saw another light that was directly east and about in the same position of the initial object that I had seen.  So over a period of about 40-45 minutes I guess we same this object about 5 different times in various locations in the sky.  They were not conventional aircraft, and certainly were not a single balloon.  I supposed it's possible it could be explained by multiple balloons/weather balloons.  It wasn't a mind-blowing event, but was still pretty unusual and getting it on video is kind of nice.  You may phone me if you wish to.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

As I looked at it, it seemed to grow even brighter still, and then just as quickly it grew dimmer.  Soon it dimmed completely out.   I thought this was very odd as it was a perfectly clear night.  I decided to investigate it further so I went and found some 10x binoculars.   Upon examining the spot in the sky where the object had been I found nothing but stars, but looking a bit futher north I found something in my sights that took my breath away.  The object was comprised of 3 lights a larger blueish/green light in the center with two smaller reddish/brown lights on either side.  The larger light in the center was slightly elevated above the two smaller red lights, otherwise the 3 lights would have formed a horizontal line.   Immediately, my mind connected the 3 symetrical lights into some kind of or attached to some type of aircraft.  But, this craft was motionless.  I soon discovered a second object beside the first, then a third above that one, and fourth, all of identical size, color, and shape and all motionless and not blinking or pulsing.  As soon as I had counted the fourth object the lowest object began to move, slowly at first, but then accelerating rapidly straight up to the outside of the other 3 objects which remained still.   At this point I wanted someone else to see what I was seeing, so I went to get my parents.

There was a bright flash of light that lit up the area. The flash came from above light at camera flash but lasted about a second or so. There were two objects that streaked from point to point going left to right... north to south. The slowed a bit after crossing the sky. Their form was visiable clearly round disks. Colors changing and then they shot what looked at to be light beams that went on and off The lights were aimed at the ground but an an angle. It looked like they were trying to illuminate an are like they were looking for something. I was coming into Clarksville on 41 at Sango it looked like they were aiming north. Could have been Fort Campbell but I have never seen a round or saucer shape anything in the air around here. Plenty of military air craft but nothing like this.

This happened in Omaha, NE in 1968. I cannot pinpoint the day or month because it was so long ago, therefore I could not enter that info in the box above, but it was during the Democratic Presidential Primary election (Bobby Kennedy vs. Eugene McCarthy). I had come to Omaha from Indianapolis as a campaign volunteer. I became acquainted with 3 other campaign workers, 2 of whom were instructors at the University of Iowa. A day or two before the election, we went to dinner at a family restaurant--NO ALCOHOL SERVED. The dinner conversation covered many topics. It developed that the name of a former English teacher from my alma mater was mentioned under his pen name, Brad Steiger. I informed the group of his real name and from there the talk led to the paranormal, Steiger's main subject in those days. UFOs were mentioned at length, but after awhile our dinner talk went on to non-paranormal subjects. It was dark when we left the restaurant; I believe it was about 9:00 PM. As we walked out the door into the parking lot we noticed a school bus in the lot full of what appeared to be high school students. Several were leaning out the windows, screaming and pointing upwards behind us. When we turned to look we got the shock of our lives. Directly over the restaurant's parking lot, at an altitude I estimate at no more than one hundred feet, was a UFO. The object was circular, with a flat bottom and an opaque dome on the top. I estimate the diameter of the object at 35 to 50 feet. It held absolutely still and made absolutely no noise. On top of the dome was a single, steady white light. Around the rim were solid white lights in the shape of rectangles with rounded corners, separated from each other by unlit space. The lights flashed around the rim in a counter-clockwise direction like lights on a theater marquee, but I assure you, this was not a theater marquee we were looking at. Conditions were ideal to observe. There was not a cloud in the sky. There was plenty of moonlight behind us so that the bulk of this UFO was outlined against the sky. I assure you this was not a hot-air balloon. There was no flame, no hanging basket. Besides, a balloon, even if tethered, could not have been so absolutely motionless as this object was. As other people came out of the restaurant, they also saw the object. I remember parents with children taking one look at the object, then RUNNING to their cars and leaving the lot as fast as possible. Eventually, one of the men from the U. of Iowa started timing the object. It was more than 2 more minutes before the object began to move away. But I stress that we were able to look at the object for quite awhile before it occurred to anyone to start timing it. While we were timing it, we also asked each other to describe to each other what we were seeing. Our descriptions agreed. When the object began to move, it moved VERY slowly, maybe 4 or 5 MPH. Again, it made absolutely no noise. There were no ports or windows in the object, just the disk shape with the dome on top, illuminated by the lights described. We watched until the object was too small to see with the naked eye. While it moved away, it maintained its low altitude. I have often wondered if anyone took photos of this. Let me tell you, if there had been video camcorders in those days, we would have had, without any question whatsoever, THE CLEAREST, MOST DRAMATIC, LONGEST-LASTING SIGHTING ever made of a UFO. We got in our car and attempted to follow the object, but this was tough to do in a city we were not familiar with. Later that night we thought we saw it again on the outskirts of town, but we could not be sure. Now, SOME PUZZLING THOUGHTS. Was it just coincidence that our dinner conversation had been, in part, about UFOs? Did our collective thoughts produce an illusion? But then, we were not the first to see it. More puzzling: this was Omaha in 1968, still the active headquarters of the Strategic Air Command, and yet there was not one other aircraft anywhere in the sky. You would think that this thing would have been seen on radar and all kinds of aircraft scrambled to intercept it. Unless, of course, it was one of ours. But, if it were one of ours, why would it hover so low over a busy part of town where it would be sure to be seen? Why were there not at least some police cars chasing this object? At the time, I was 23 years old, and had attended a small, private, church-sponsored  college, majoring in instrumental music and minoring in English. I do not recall what departments the 2 men from the U. of Iowa were in, but much later, maybe a year or so later, I happened to see them both in a story on the national TV news related to some event taking place at the U. of Iowa. I have never forgotten this incredibly vivid encounter. But, I'll tell you this: I never want to see another UFO. --end-- ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

After the movie, we went to park and ""neck"".  We were moving slowly down a dirt road that I had never gone down before. I looked to read my date's face to ensure she was not opposed to stopping for a while.  What I saw on her face may best be described as pure fear. Her eyes were fixed on something in the air coming right at us. As it went overhead, it could not have been more than 500 feet in the air and no more than 1000 to 1500 feet away.  The car did not have air conditioning so the windows were all down.  I sat and watched and listened as this craft went by.  There was not any sound that could be heard other than the purr of the car.   It was about the size of a large passenger jet.  You could see a row of windows that were near the bottom of the bowl just before the shape flatten out to make a saucer shape.  The window lights would go out one at a time in a series so that all of the lights were on but one.  It gave the appearence that the upper part of the craft was moving counter clockwise.  The bottom of the craft had a red light on the leading edge and every quarter that blinked but moved in the opposite direction.  My date did not want to look at this and I think I was telling her that she had to to make sure that she can confirm what I am looking at.  How much she did look, I do not know.  After it had passed and I was certain that it was making no sounds, I turned the car around and took off in the direction the craft was going.  We hadn't gone any distance before it was out of sight.   I continued on down the road until I came to a few houses where some men were standing outside their homes. I stopped and asked if they had seen anything strange.  One of the men was an older black man who responded by saying, ""yesssir, we just saws us a flying saucer""    Later that night I called the airport but they said it was probably nothing.

The Two boys sitting in a fold-up seat and facing out the back window were the first to observe a blue cone shaped light beam that appeared to originate maybe one or two hundred feet above the ground and then flash downwards to the ground as it spread out.  The beam would flash and then dissapear only to flash again from another point. The beam was roughly following the path of the two lane roadway and was catching up to the vehicle which was traveling at about 60 miles per hour.  The boys alerted the other vehicle occupants who then turned or used the rearview mirrors to see the the blue light.  The father began to slow the vehicle saying he wanted to stop to get a better look.  This panicked the mother who was afraid of the light, so the father accelerated and the light was soon not seen anymore. I was the 11 year old son.  I don't really believe in extraterrestrial visitors but after 8 years in the US Air Force and 20 years as a police officer, I am still unable to explain what I saw that night.  The hardest and most disturbing part to explain is how slowly the beam moved as it progressed down towards the ground.  To the best of my knowledge, even today, light can only be made to move like that in certain tightly controlled laboratory environments and then only on a very small scale.

Brampton, Ontario , at the time was stil a developing city (at least in the west end where I was) So you can have an idea of the area, there would be pockects of new developements and open fields in between.

After about 20 minutes of walking and taking in the beautiful weather I heard a humming noise over top of my walkman - I naturally assumed that it was a transport truck or something in the area. I turned off my walkman and that's when I realized the sound was coming from over head. When I looked up I was in awe of what I was seeing. I was not frightened or nervous. The object was no more than 50 stories above me. It was black, Triangular shaped, and had only three light at each corner. The object must have been the size of a football field. The object hovered in one place, directly above me for 1 minute when it shot off (from a stand still) and out of my sight in less than a second. This is when I became nervous. I do not know anything in physics that could propel itself from a stand still like that. I hurried home and as you probably encounter daily, I was met with ridicule from my friends and family. Three days later, while I was at school, three men in black came to my home and asked my mother all kinds of strange questions. They repeatedly asked if they could come in, and when my mom responded, no, they would ask something else. Where I was from? Where I was? How old I was? Could they come back and see me later. When I spoke with my mother later that day. All she kept saying is that they looked very strange....very odd. that's it.

Like others, I just found this website. So I decided to look up a month I too saw something I could not explain.  On March 11, 1993, 2 friends and I were heading out for spring break, first to Austin, TX and then to South Padre Island. I looked at the reports for March 93 and found, ""I SAW 3 BLINKING / JUMPING LIGHTS FOR MORE THAN 3 HOURS"". I can’t say it was the same object, however, I know it was the same stretch of highway and at about the same hour. Heading south from Fort Worth, TX, between Waco and Austin, we saw something in the sky that we cannot explain. I know, 13 years have pasted but this experience, I’ll never forget. We saw an object moving East to West at about 8:30 - 9:00 PM, a strange object with segment of lights blinking in a row. We first noticed it from a distance as it was moving from our left to right at a slow rate. Shortly after, we saw that other vehicles have pulled over on I-35 to watch this object in the sky. I-35 runs North and South, so the object appeared from the east and moved over I-35 to the West, it wasn’t moving very fast at all. Then from the South East, a huge bright light appeared, but that turned out to be a helicopter flying fast towards the direction of the object. When I look back to the object, it was nowhere in site. We know a helicopter in the sky, but we could never identify that object. This night has always been the strangest experience of my life.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,31.058507038123167,-97.78439354838709

I had just stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of South State Street (alternate Route 113) and Sorghum Mill Road located at Rising Sun.   My son, who was in the car with me, and I both saw an illuminated object that appeared to be close to the ground in the next town of 2 and 1/2 miles distance south on that road.  As the object was located along the road we were traveling, we continued to see it as drove along Alt Route 113.  Before entering the town of Magnolia, it became apparent the object hovered directly above trees in the center of the town.  Alternate Route 113 intersects the town and the Magnolia Fire station is located on the northbound side of alternate Route 113 at the intersection of Walnut Street. The object was hovering directly above trees and houses located behind the Magnolia fire station and along East Walnut Street.  The object was round, at least 900 feet in circumference.  The saucer had 3 sections, a dome, a middle section and a bottom section.  The dome-like top , had one large white or off-white light forming the top of the dome.  The center of the saucer had lights of varying colors that were oblong (almost square) in shape, with rounded corners.  These lights were either blinking or the center of the saucer was rotating.  I did not focus on them long enough to determine which.  The bottom  had off-white or light yellow lights that did not seem to blink or move.  The object was no more than 300 feet away from the road in front of the Magnolia fire department.  I did not hear any noise coming from the object and the trees below the object did not seem to be disturbed by any wind.  Just across from the fire station, facing south, there is a water tower.  The unidentified object was directly behind the fire station (facing east) and hovered lower than the water tower.  We were in clear sight of both the object and the water tower and there was absolutely no mistake that we were seeing an object other than the water tower.  I remember saying out loud to myself that I could not be seeing what I was seeing.  I also recall asking my son, who was 10 years old at the time, if he would mind if we stopped and took a closer look.  He seemed calm, but said he was scared and just wanted to go home.  As soon as we got home - about a 5 minute drive further south along blank road, my son asked if we could go back and take another look.  We had not even gotten out of the car yet and I immediately headed back.  The object was no longer there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

As best as I can recall, this event happened during the summer of 94 or 95. It was only recently that I recalled the event in a rather strange way. On Sunday morning, Dec. 11,05, I awoke suddenly, not from a dream or nightmare, but to a vivid memory of a large, Galaxy Class starship being escorted up Puget Sound by military helicopters. I was trembling and in shock, not from fear, but the thought of how I could forget such an fantastic event. It was then that I realized how ""they"" can get away with visiting and not getting caught. But this story has many facets to it that I can't try to explain it all. It was in the evening, I heard the copters flying over my house, which is on the bluff over looking I5 and the Nisqually Valley. There were two copters excorting what I would interpret as a large carrier,mothership, N.E. along the I5 route. They were moving at a slow deliberate pace. The carrier was typical battleship gray,and since it was still suuny out, I did not observe any lights. Since the craft was virtually overhead, I could only see the bottom and side of it. The side was lined with what appeared to be large bay doors. The size of the craft I can only say that 20 football fields may be a concervative estimate. Now why were there two copters excorting it? I can only speculate that it may have mechanical trouble and was being led north to the pole, out of public view. I seem to recall reports that this was observed along the sound and into Canada. Obviuosly, contact with the ship was made, and the military was coopering with them. I believe that through minimal media coverage, and the extraordinary nature of the event, things like this are quickly forgotten in the collective consciuosness. As long as we are distracted by lights in the sky, and unexplained objects, then the truth remains buried. I am seeking help to further clarify what I witnessed that day, since I cannot recall exactly when it happened. I do know it did happen, and there should be thousands of witnesses to this event. But if I am made to forget, then they are too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2006-02-14T00:00:00,47.02590722891566,-122.79733855421686

I grabbed him by the shoulder and without saying a word I pointed to sky.  These lights flashed and then made a jump towards the South.  They moved parallel to each other and after making an inital jump they appeared to jump back to the spot they had jump from before.  Each jump forward and backward increased their speed until they were moving faster than anything I've ever seen.  I don't think this was an asteroid because it was moving slowly at first and then accelerated.  Plus there were 2 bright pulsing lights that moved parallel from North to South.  After the lights disappeared I asked him what he saw and he smiled and said you know what I saw.  My friend called in the report to some one over the phone, but no one else saw what we saw.  Most people were probably looking West at the sunset.  We see figter jets all the time in san diego, but this was no jet and this was no rocket either.

After a week of multiple sightings throughout town we (my best friend and I), who were skeptical, decided after work to swing on the rope of a flagpole in front of a local school. We were 15 and bored. After swinging for a few minutes we stopped to rest at the base of the pole, back to back, when we saw over the top of the schoolhouse, just above the shadow of the wooded area immediately behind the playground in back of the school, a blue ball/light which curved down to the treetops and disappeared. When we investigated we were witness to a craft hovering above the woods where the light disappeared. It silently made it's way over our left shoulders, which were backed against the brick backed school building. With a low cloud cover toward the downtown area, which reflected the city lights, we could see 3-4 more ships slowly circling toward and then stopping above the same area. They seemed to be patrolling the area around and above the woods. After a time we could make our a figure walking along the edge of the woods on the other side of the large yard making up the playground. We could barely make it out but it stopped every time we called out. As we continued to watch the circling ships one suddenly made it's way toward us. Frozen against the wall and unable to move from fear, it was right in front of us about 50 feet in the air above and immediately in front of us. We could see the windows surrounding it and lights moved in a circular motion as the illuminated each window. There was absolutely no sound made. We were sure they were going to do something but it just slowly lifted and again made it's way over our left and over the school building out of site. After awhile we decided to move up closer to the yard from the building. As we moved forward we cleared a part of the school to our left that jutted out and my friend alerted me to someone running to our left. I forgot to mention that during the initial sightings of the ships we ran back to my friend's house to get a camera. His family actually didn't have one but we were able to find a pair of binoculars. That and a borrowed leather jacket for me that belonged to his father were all we could return with. As we walked toward the figure that was running, which had stopped at my friend's alert/shout, it became clearer that it was one of the aliens from the ships. He was tall and thin and was a light orange/white and appeared to have a suit with a black square on the chest. And a collar that appeared to be for a helmet or something. He was poised to jump as we approached. We were within 25 feet of him when we remembered we had the binoculars. When I lifted them to my eyes it was as if someone punched me in the eyes. I looked directly into his face. My friend's reaction was much the same. After I called out to him his face turned into us and he looked directly at me as I looked through the glasses. When I called out with ""we mean you no harm"" I felt silly saying that and was embarrassed. After about 20 minutes of holding him there, he started to make coughing sounds and a whistle of some kind. We decided to let him go as we didn't know what else to do. We backed away and (no kidding) as we cleared around the blocking part of the school, a police car came toward us from where we'd first started. As they approached we just knew the alien would no longer be there. The police (two of them) stopped us and asked us what we were doing behind the school and we told them about the alien. They first searched us, our pockets and such and of course my friend's father's jacket had a bunch of matches deep in one pocket I didn't even know were there. We did convince one of them we were telling the truth and they agreed to accompany us to the site. As we rounded the blocking part of the school we could see he was gone. The police, to their credit, did go up into the yard and shine their spotlight into the woods that edged that side of the playground. The alien had been standing just inside that thin line of woods that went up the left side of the school to the main woods that ran left to right. The sightings that the whole town had seen, including my mother and sisters, claimed there were three craft with one appearing in trouble and two on either side of it following. We surmised through the years that they were maybe repairing that craft in the woods and we happened there. If we had a camera, especially a video camera (not common then) we could have made a feature movie! This is all 100% true. By the way, to make matters worse (for our credibility) the National Enquirer was on a UFO kick and had along one whole length of the front page an exact picture of our guy! Unbelievable. But absolutely true. When I hear of regular sightings I just think, ""wow, if they'd seen what I saw!"" Thanks for letting me tell someone.

While laying asleep at home one night in a back room I shared with my sister, I was awoken by a strange noise.  It sounded like helicopter blades, rotating in slow motion.   As I woke I was aware of blue light rays shining through the gap in the bedroom curtains. Scared, I tried to get up to see what it was but as I struggled towards the window the light suddenly dissapeared and somehow, exhausted through fear, I fell back to sleep never mentioning the event to anyone until many years later I related it to my younger sister who also said she had seen it.  It is worth noting that the room was situated some 20-25 feet above ground level and the rear wall of the house fell directly into a back alley way.  There is no way that anything as large as a helcopter could have got there and we only had a small courtyard. Not long before this event I had witnessed a fireball flying over the city in broad daylight sometime in the early evening after school.

Former Navy military adviser,Viet Nam; Army Reserve Helicopter Gunship armament artificer, Electrical project manager / engineer. In the summer of 1972 I went to LaCoste, Texas, to hunt coyotes with a friend on his grandfather's property.  After several cups of coffee, I went outside to relieve myself, when I noticed a round or oblong object high in the upper atmosphere. What drew my attention to it was the extremely wide vapor trail or cloud that emanated from the object as it slowly spiraled downward in a long, wide, and very slow spiral.  Aside from appearing unusual, what really fascinated me was that the vapor trail or cloud the object produced, was a pale green color and was pulsating.  I watched the object for approximately 10-15 minutes, when it finally just stopped.  The cloud continued to pulsate and then slowly faded from pale green to white and looked then like any other cloud in the sky. It was a full moon night and very clear. I watched the cloud then fade to nothing.  I thought it may be a satellite falling to earth after losing it's orbit, but then I feel it would have been traveling at a much greater speed once it entered earth's atmosphere.  This object was moving VERY slowly and the spiral was gradual and very wide.   I have never shared this with anyone as I was the only one to witness the object and was afraid I'd be ridiculed.

Note: I have entered this before -- but in July 1973 by mistake.  It was in the SPRING. ..  I was entering Rt. 70S from Fields Road (70S is now 270).  The ramp dumps you onto the road about 50 feet before you go under the Shady Grove Road underpass.   Just as I was heading under I noticed something round up in the sky.  As I emerged from the underpass I was already looking up to see if I could see the object.  At first I couldn't and I wondered if it had changed direction, when all of a sudden it came into view, not high, but at a much lower altitude than at first.  It was crossing the highway in front of my car going roughly from NW to SE.  I think it was flying too low for legal airspace.  At that point, since I was almost under it, it looked just like a big black disk, but a second or two later it got far enough away to see the edge of it -- which was a band of sequentially-flashing green lights.  That's when I knew this wasn't anything ordinary.   It continued in the SE direction -- I sped up to about 90 MPH because it was the only thing I could do to see more, but I couldn't keep up ... I think it must have been traveling 300-400 mph.   I watched the object go into the distance and noticed that it kept descending, so that eventually I was looking straight out at it.  My location on Rt. 70S was high ground, and in 1973 there wasn't much built up along it, so there was a pretty clear view of this object.   After awhile it was so far that I couldn't even make out the flashing lights anymore.  It began to veer slightly toward the east. ....  The next morning, in almost the exact spot, WPGC announced that the Air Force said that the object reported by some observers the day before was 'an experimental airplane with sequentially flashing lights.'  The announcement did not include anything about the fact that this object had no wings of the type our aircraft usually has. ...  The sighting occurred about 9 a.m. over a highway that in those days wasn't as busy as it is in 2005, but there was other traffic besides myself.   I'll never forget this and am still hoping to find someone else who saw it and did the research to find out what it is.   Since the radio announcement said the Air Force made the statement, and the object did kind of veer off toward Andrews AFB, I never talked about it for 28 years.

I had been assigned to ""T"" class.  One night we were having a bit of a friendly fight between ourselves, all of a sudden one of our dormitory got all excited and started shouting UFO! UFO! and started pointing out of one of our dormitory windows.  We all (approx.11-12) rushed to look to see what he was pointing at, there approximately 200-250feet above our football (soccer) field were three big white lights. The single light was nearest to us with the other two beside each other just behind it, the object seemed to be triangular in shape, also there seemed to be no noise, the object was also not moving it was just hovering.  We looked at the object for several seconds (I am unsure how many, )when it suddenly began to move forward at what appeared to be a slow speed and passed over our our building.  Our roof was a flat roof and had no windows so we had to cross to the other side of our dormitory this would have been about twenty feet.  When we looked out of the window opposite to the first one we could see the object still moving in the same direction, it seemed to be at the same height and speed.  I am not sure how far it traveled but it would  at a guess be a quarter to half a mile, suddenly it climbed at a huge speed.  When it climbed the object seemed to attain its speed instantly, it stayed on a horizontal plane not climbing as with a coventional aircraft, also it left no trail that we could see. The object took about 3-4 seconds to be out of sight, it never altered course it just shot up at a great speed at about 45 degrees from a horizontal slow level flight path.  May i point out that this is the first time that this is the first time i have reported this in writing anywhere, although i have told people at times since it happened.  I also have flown light aircraft, sailed in the Mechant Navy for 18 years so am able to judge distances to some degree.

They were very upset, talking about a space ship but I was laying in bed, reluctant to believe them.  When I got to the window.  I saw a grey looking oval shaped object.  From my view, we were looking underneath the ship.  There were square like boxes underneath that white lights were passing over.  We were on the 9th floor and I could see many girls in their windows looking at the ship and screaming and hollering.  The object just hoovered there for what seemed like eternity and then just moved quickly out of view. There was no sound from the ship.  We were so hysterical the director of Job Corps called a meeting in the middle of the night to calm us down.  There were 400 women in that building that night and at least 250 witnessed this ship.

Summary:  - Flying cubes, 18"" on the side, in chain-like 'formation'  - Shiny silver spheres, 4"" to 12""  - Strange, anomalous 'footprints', birdlike, with 3 'toes' and one heel-spur (or whatever it is called on a bird)  Thank you for your kind consideration. I ask that you send me an email if you can find any similar sightings in your database. I want to know if anyone has seen anything similar:  Early AM, very cold; weather clear. Cubic 'craft', about 18"" on the side, flew overhead repeatedly, emitting a whooshing sound; a buzzing sound could also be heard, similar to the sound made by an electrical transformer under load.  These flying cubes appeared to be made of 'brushed metal'.  They flew in an undulating 'chain' formation. They repeatedly 'buzzed' me; in other words they dove at me. I was on foot at the time.  I attempted to 'escape' from this remote location by hiking toward a store (closed at that time of day).  I had to cross a steel bridge over a river, but saw that the cubes had landed in the center of the bridge.  I was terrified by this time.  I watched as the cubes disgorged a number of shiny silver spheres;  the spheres varied in size from 3"" to about 12"".  After the spheres had 'rolled out' from small square 'doors' in the sides of the cubes, the cubes suddenly took flight and vanished.  Now my path across the bridge was 'blocked' by these silvery spheres. They did not glow, but were very reflective. There were several spheres, I do not know how many. I decided to brave an attempt to pass by the spheres.  As I did, one of them vanished with a tiny 'ping' sound.  This was very strange.  I should mention that there was on the ground, the last of the snow of winter; this was very hard snow, a crust, about 1""-8"" deep. There were bare areas of dirt also.  As I walked toward the far end of the bridge, my head began to sweat, and my vision fogged.  I became dizzy, and could barely walk.  The sensation of heat _inside_ my head increased radically with every step I took.  My vision 'doubled' and I had to lean against the rail of the bridge to stand upright.  I was convinced that I was about to die.  I carelessly walked close to some other spheres, and they too 'vanished' with the 'ping' noise, similar to the sound of a musical triangle.  The moon was casting considerable light. I happened to look at the sloped, snow-covered bank of the river, which bank was about 40 feet from the top to the edge of the water.  There, imprinted in the snow, was a huge 'footprint'.  It appeared to have been melted into the hard snow.  The 'footprint' resembled that of a bird; it had three 'toes' and one 'heel'.  In other words, it was a 'Y' shape, with a middle prong between the uprights. For some reason, this sight deeply shocked me.  I finally began to panic, and indeed felt that my death was imminent.  I gave up the attempt to cross the bridge and went back to the shore which I had started from.  It was there that I saw, on the hard snow at the side of the road, MANY footprints just like the one described above;  but these were of many sizes,  from small (3"") to large (6').  They were scattered about, in what seemed to be a random pattern.  One thing did catch my attention; the footprints occured only in pairs. It looked as though some 'invisible creatures', whose feet were hot, had stood around there, in that hard snow.  I could not believe my eyes, so I bent down and ran my finger around inside the footprints. The snow had been melted into hard ice; the footprints were indeed 'real'.  Each footprint was literally a depression in the snow, a 3-toed shape, and the snow had been compressed, or melted, to produce these impressions.  The depth of a footprint of about 4"" was approximately 1/2"".  It occured to me that these 'footprints' were made by 'something' which had been 'hatched' when the silver spheres disappeared as I approached them.  This was totally mind-boggling, to say the least.  The problem was that I was apparently 'under attack' by invisible enemies.  I had been sweating, and now I was growing cold, as the heat had diminished when I returned to the end of the bridge.  It seemed to me that the cubes had deployed the spheres, which had deployed the 'invisible whatevers', whose job was to prevent me from crossing the bridge. Strange, beyond words.  I can describe this 'event' in much detail, but my main concerns are the footprints in the snow.  I had managed to forget most of this, until perhaps 5 years ago, when I read a report that an Alpine mountain guide of impeccable reputation, in Switzerland, had filed a report of an event which had greatly upset him.  He had observed 'huge, 3-toed footprints' in the snow of a remote mountain valley.  He stated that the footprints appeard to he those of a 'huge invisible bird'.  I have forgotten most of the details, but the similarity to my own 'sighting' was too close to miss.  I want to know, if you have in your database, any reports of similar cubes, spheres, or 3-toed footprints; especially the footprints.

I realized that what I was seeing was not the moon, but a large glowing off-white sphere that was hovering at tree top level.   It was moving east to west until it came to the Wabash river, then it started following the river north towards the bridge.  I wanted to see what happened when it reached the bridge, so I sped up.  I had been pacing the object at about 10-15 mph.   When I got to the bridge the object was no longer over the river.  It was moving rapidly to the south west to the town of Hillsdale.   As it approached Hillsdale, which sits low in a little valley, the object made precise turns to manuver through the valley and was soon out of site.  After trying to chase the object, I returned to town where I spoke with the town marshall and a county deputy sherriff.  Both had seen the object.   The deputy stated that he had initially seen the object a few miles east of Montezuma and thought the moon looked large and close that night.  He paid no more attention until the radio report came in a  couple minutes later.   At that point he looked out the window and did not see the moon.  He realized then, that it was not the moon he saw, but something else.   We all agreed that what we saw had navigational abilities.

We thought it was we were looking at a sky full of stars...until they all started to move....,Passaic,NJ,1974-05-15T21:00:00,cigar,30 minutes,"Occurred : 5/15/1974 21:00  (Entered as : 05/15/1974 21:00) Reported: 7/26/2005 1:53:21 AM 01:53 Posted: 9/2/2005 Location: Passaic, NJ Shape: Cigar Duration:30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45267.html,"We thought it was we were looking at a sky full of stars...until they all started to move.... I was fourteen...me and my sister (15 then) was in our home..an apartment type above a tavern. I was in the kithen, my sister in the livingroom.   We lived on Van Houten Ave. on a corner.  Across from us was a factory/warehouse.  It had a generator that made a rumbling noise. I was washing dishes facing the side street.   My sister yelled for me to look out the window...she was excited.  She was looking out the front window facing Van Houten Ave. She kepet screaming for me to look towards the factory.  I stuck my head out the window and saw this object kind of hoovering over the factory.  It was HUGE.  It was kind of cigar shaped and I don't know if it made any sound really, because of the generator, but it seems to me that the sound was a bit different than usual.   Anyhow, it wasn't a blimp or anything I'd ever seen, or have since seen.  I remember there was a light revolving around the (what I assume to be) ""nose"" of the vessel.  But the light didn't seem to be attached to anything, or be radiating from anywhere actually, it was just a light revolving around the nose.  This vessel hoovered there for about ten minutes give or take.   Me and my sister were hollering back and forth at each other trying to figure out what we were looking at, and what to do about it.  It just kind of sat there in mid air for a while, and then it turned it's nose straight up in a semi-slow motion, and it shot straight up in an instant it was gone.  No fire, no flames, no loud roar...nothing like that...It went straight into space and was gone instantly.  This happened on one night, and on another night...same place, but I think it was a little earlier in the evening.  Me anad my sister were again in our home.  I was in the kitchen again, but I'm not sure what room my sister was in.  My younger brother and a friend of his was outside jumping their bikes on a ramp.  All of a sudden we heard them screaming for us.  We thought something really bad had happened, and we ran down the stairs and out the door expecting something, I don't know what.  Anyways, we run out ""to help"" and find my brother and his friend staring at the sky.   We were like, ""What?!?"" and they both point straight up, and yell ""Look! Look! they're moving""  we didn't know what they were talking about.  We looked up and saw a sky with stars...no big deal...at least that was our first reaction.  And that's what we told them...""yeah okay, big deal..Stars!!!""  But they kept hollering....""No...No...Really....Watch 'em!!!  They're moving!!!""  So we decide to humor them...so okay, we'll watch for a few minutes.  Just a clear night with a sky of stars.   Well, they did start to move!!!  Every one of them started moving.  they started out slowly, kind of making circles and designs...but it was each and every one of them...they started slow, and gradually got faster and faster, and faster, and then they all kind of shot towards each other and instantly stopped in a clump...for maybe five seconds...then they shot out in different directions, every one of them, and they were gone.  Not a star in the sky.   None of us knew what to do, or say, we just all stared at each other.  I do think my brother said something to the fact that he was glad that we seen it too 'cause it kind of scared them.  I do remember trying to tell my mother about it...and she just looked at us like we were nuts or something, and dismissed it all as our imagination, or it had to be ""something else""...but we all know what we saw...and actually, I don't care one way or another if someone wants to beleive me/us or not.  It happened, and I think about it and know that there's life out there some where.   I know too that we STILL don't have anything made on this planet capable of the speed and manuverability that these things had then, and this all happened some 31 years ago.   I just thought that if any one wanted to hear about it, I would share it.  I think it was kind of cool myself. Thanks for listening.

I was babtsitting for neighbors and as they were coming in the house, the mother called out, from outside, for us to come outside to look.  We all went outside. In the sky was a completly black bicycle horn shaped UFO.  It had a large round shape in the back with a cylinder in the middle and cone shape in front of that.  Out of the cone shaped front was shining a huge light.   The UFO appeared to be about the size of a football field, or maybe a little bigger even.  It was moving extremely slowly and was hanging very low in the sky, much lower then normal aircraft.  We all stood there with our mouths open for easily 15 minutes watching in silence as it moved in slow increments across a very short distance.  Suddenly the ""front"" light went out and maybe two or three seconds later the now completely dark shape disintegrated like ashes.  Particules just seemed to hang in the air for a few more seconds and then there was nothing.  After maybe a few seconds we all erupted with sound, confirming that we had all seen it.  What we had seen, etc.   The father went in and called the police who, after several phone calls told him that they had some report that some air force base was conducting test flights of some craft they had.  The only air force base at the time was many many miles away and to this day I do not believe that we have the capacity to hold an object that huge in the air nor have it move that slowly with out it crashing, much less the fact that it completely disintegrated into nothing.

It made no sound, and did not change direction. The shape of the craft could be seen because of the glow of the lights of the town that were behind it.  I do not know what direction it was travelling, or how far away it was, but it was obvious that it was very large.  I come to this conclusion because the treeline that I compared it too was at least 3 miles away, and the object looked large as it went over the horizon.  As it neared the treeline, there was a ring of white lights that started flashing at the center-rear of the craft.  I don't remember if there was any pattern, as I was very scared at this point, but each ""pulse"" lasted less than a second.  I also remember seeing diffuse red lights near where I thought the ""points"" of the triangle would be, but I have less of a memory of them.  I was just out of high school at the time, with my girlfriend, visiting her relatives.  I had wanted to be an airline pilot at the time, and when I saw the craft I started listing any large aircraft that I knew of, but none matched what I was seeing.  A few years later when I saw her again, she did confirm that she remembered seeing it, and that my memory was accurate of what I saw.

We both started to mention that it was definitely strange how it seemed to be following us.

Eye Contact with alien beings...  	It was around 11:00 P.M. I was driving my car to home in Dayton, Nv. It was a Friday night. I am not sure what the date was other than the Year and Month. It was April of 1996. This is a real true encounter and I do not wish to be known. It has been actually a hard thing for me to deal with in my life. I was actually going to go home to grab my guitar. I was a 25 year old guitar virtuoso. My indian friend from the Hopi tribe in town was waiting for me to come back. I was a kid, just trying to have some fun on a Friday night. So now I am going to put into perspective the events that happened, true and factual. I will have you know straight forward that this story is complete and true. I will send drawn pictures soon. So I was driving in my Dodge Rampage on Hwy. 50 East in Moundhouse Nevada. My window was down. The air was blowing on my face. I had my radio tuned in and up fairly loud. My speakers sucked with some distortion, but it was cool with me. I was on my way home to grab my guitar at 11:00 at night. I was intending to get there as fast as possible cause I wanted to create some music with my friend ((name deleted)), the Indian. So it was already late and I knew I had to hurry. I had nothing else to do. I passed the Virginia City turn off on the left. As I passed it I noticed some light on the hills at the mouth of the Canyon there. There were 4 lights. They were a whitish blue and very very bright. They were lighting up the sagebrush actually on the hillside on the west side of the VC Highway. They were about 50 to 100 feet off the ground. I was driving so, I saw the lights but I looked away as I was driving. I was thinking to myself thats a low jet. I thought it was a jet plane coming from Reno. I looked back at them. They were still in the same spot some 30 seconds later. Then I began to wonder. What the heck is that. Must be a helecopter I thought. Then I really began to stare. No it's not a helecopter. I knew it was no helecopter or plane. Yet, I could see no object, only lights. They were not moving. I could see the brush on the hill bright as day. I saw some things moving in the brush. Little objects scurrying about very quick like that of coyote's or something. My heart began to thump. The adrenaline kicked in as I realized this was something different than that I'd ever seen. I was driving still and slowed down so I could see more of it. I was very realized and already had a hunch it was a UFO. I said out loud, ""Haha yeah you know I can see you."" As soon as I said this, the lights began to turn. They were no longer shining on the brush. They span approximately 100 yards apart with 2 on top about 30 yards apart and the lower ones at the sides about 100 yards apart. They looked like the lights in a stadium kind of. They were very big and bright. There were no other cars behind me I could see lights from nor in front of me. My heart was racing fast. I was frightened. I no longer was really watching the road. The lights had my total attention. They turned around and began slowly hovering down the Canyon towards the Highway I was driving on. There were then smaller lights below the larger ones that were blinking in succesion around and repeated. Thats when I realized it was a round object. I was freaking out. My eyes were huge I'm sure and I was awake and ready to notice every detail. The lights came closer down the canyon as if to head me off at the pass. Like direct coordinates at my speed to meet me at a certain point ahead. I knew I was heading straight towards them at the same time. I was afraid, yet I was curious. So I kept driving and looking as they became larger and closer. I was amazed. Entranced by the realization and curiousity I barely even looked at the road ahead. I was just staring out my downed window. My radio became all fuzzy and then was silent. My car was driving fine. Soon there became an embankment on the side of the Highway that separated the lights from my vision. I knew from driving the Highway many times that the embankment recedes as you approach Dayton hill where the Canyon is. I also knew the thing was moving down the canyon at the same speed I was. The suspense was incredible. I came to the hill and as soon as the Embankment receded, there I saw something that I will never forget for the rest of my life. I was at top the hill and the Canyon beside me on the left. Right there as the ground cleared way, I was gazing into the middle of a set of windows! Yes, this was real. I was not even watching the road. I was mezmerized by the depth. I was staring straight into a spacecraft from another world. It was indeed a saucer. Yes, there were long windows draping all the way across and around. I saw the tiers or stories, the floors. I saw the walls. Everything inside was white. This was incredibly astounding. I had no clue what to think or anything. All I could do was stare and observe.It was like I was above it and as I went down the hill I became level with it. On the left bottom story in the windows were aliens that I first saw. There was a female. They all were wearing white robes. She had a bracelet and a necklace on, that of gold or silver and makeup like blush on her cheeks. Her arm was on the shoulder of a younger one, a boy and they were looking right at me. Right into my eyes they were. She nudged herself to him and spoke to the other younger children along the window maybe 10 or so more. They were all smaller like a 5 year old. She was talking to the older boy and them without speaking! And me! I felt a joyful feeling inside as they gazed into my eyes and she then smiled and pointed at me as to show them that I understood her and them. Her long finger, their faces grey. She had 3 fingers and a thumb. I then had a terrible feeling. I looked up to the second story. There were 2 beings there in the middle of the room. I was about level with them I think. The being I first saw had a long draped back skull like that of the movie alien kinda but the face any eyes of E.T. His skin was chocolate brown and he too was wearing a white robe. His skull was maybe 2 feet long behind his head draping down. His face looked a lot like E.T. The kids faces below looked like the alien pictures you often see yet their eyes weren't black. Their eyes were shaped like the pictures but they were white with irises. Blue eyes, the girl had green eyes. The one with the draped skull on the second story was standing and holding a clipboard against himself in his white robe. I noticed all that stuff as he noticed me. His mouth dropped! His eyes bulged! As he realized I was looking at him and them and He was staring straight into my eyes! He was frightened that I saw him. It was deffinately not part of his plan. His eyes were white with huge blue irises and pupils. I'd estimate I was 20 feet from his face. I made contact alright. He immediately turned to the other one in the room in front of him. The one in front of him was sitting. I saw the side view of him but only his head at the time. He had a human like head. Not a draped skull. I could see wrinkles all over his head. It made him look very old. No hair on any of them whatsoever. He was not in white. He was wearing a black suit from what I could see. He turned his face toward me! Right after the one with the clipboard looked at him after seeing me! He turned his face toward me. Ohhhh Myyyy Goddd was I scared!!!! He was so so so so so old looking it sent shivers all over me. His face was all wrinkled and old and his eyes all beady! They were pure black. As he and I stared eachother in the eyes I realized he was a man. He was a human. He must've been thousands of years old and very wicked. I was petrified. I was scared shitless. He gave me this snarling look yet at the same time I could see his smarts. There was some kind of bigscreen in front of him blinking at the outer rim of the windows edge at the end of the ship windows on his floor. He then looking at me directly, raised his hand up with a very long finger and smiled or smirked as he hit a button on some kind of panel in front of him. Like he was signaling to me they were going up! Instantly! The windows covered themselves with a fanlike shell that was that like of ripples like of a Chinese fan decending from the top. Corrogated riffles about 1 foot high each decending from the top to the middle. They were breathing like and sparkling with colors. I noticed that they were very sharp looking like razor blades all on the top along the riffles.They could cut through anything! The bottom sealed up and began blinking lights around in succession. That must be how they do their airports. That must be their laws or regulations I thought. Then it began to spin. My window was still down and I was close to the bottom of the hill as I heard the riffles begin to hummmm! They sounded like they were some kind of giant fan blades. The object tilted at about a 45 degree angle. As it spun faster and faster I could only see the outline of it. Like it was suddenly cloaked. Kinda like a rim on a car as it spins. It spun so fast it began to become invisible. It then shot up into the sky leaving a small white trail behind for a split second. I was petrified. I had reached the bottom of the hill and pulled over. I had to look through my rear view mirror to switch lanes from traffic. I pulled over and got out of my car. I looked up. I wanted to see it more. It was sunny outside. There were cars going by. It only takes 3 minutes to get down the hill. I was at the top at 11:00 P.M. and the bottom around 8:30 or something. Yet, I didn't even realize this. Not at all. I had no conception of time. I was tired. I went home and crashed out. I woke up and remembered the hill. I don't know how it was daylight when I got to the bottom of a 3 minute hill at 11:00. I don't remember anything between that time accept for driving down the hill. I have only told a handfull of people this story. There's more to it as well in the day and the months that followed. I will tell more if I get a chance.? What I am wondering is how you could miss such an object because I was sure to see it. I am only 33 and I am not into hoaxing or anything. I would not email this important information right to you if I was. I don't give my name well, because I have a life. I have seen the mechanics of their vessel. Does that mean anything to anyone? I don't quite understand people anymore in general as far as all this goes. When I look up I know! I know the life is there cause I've seen it. God I wish only you could understand the reality of things more. The design of the ship was like of a seashell. It covers and uncovers itself when it needs. The windows are for sightseeing. They are huge! The riffles are razor sharp. I would imagine they could cut through tree's, maybe even burrow into the ground. It spins before it takes off. Like a top, it gathers momentum. It spins and whirrs and becomes almost invisible from spinning so dang fast. It tilts, and it shoots from some kind of small impulse explosion device. It shot up so fast you see, that all it left was a light streak. When it hit the atmosphere, which I did see, it made a flash. When it made the flash, I saw the shape of it up there. It was a millisecond. I watched it, I witnessed a real encounter. It was breathtaking. I made contact unknowingly and made eye contact very knowingly. These beings are astronauts and miners, sightseers, they are in search of something great. I think, or get the notion from deep within, I am not sure where, but they are taking samples of many places. They are beholders of elements, chemicals, they are ancient. Alchemists. They must be abducting in search of enzymes they use for experiments in genetics to endure life. The fountain of youth so to speak on a much broader scale. Why I know this I have no idea. It's a hunch. The search for life eternal exists in the life eternal above. See, when I look up I know, that through all them stars is eternal life. There is life everywhere there in every form imaginable. It is eternity. Can you imagine what that means? Human kind has just begun to seek. I do believe we as a race shall be warned. This planet is immensely overpopulated, it must look like a christmas tree at night from space? I am very patriotic for our astronaughts. I believe in the missions. I know I sound like a flake, but take it as constructive evidence. It is real. I do not know how the space, and naval and airforces of the globe and sattellites have not been able to track the vessel I have seen. The devices we use must not be sophisticated enough to see them. They do use light, and sound only at take off. Can you please map out gold and silver or electrum deposits and compare them to sightings of ufo's over the past 3000 years. There you may find something extensive. I am not sure why they would want gold being it isn't very conductive, but if you were traveling far through a lot of stuff, corrosion might be bad. Gold would be a great alloy? Collectors. I know for a fact where I saw the craft, there is gold. They were spotlighting the surface. Mars rocks found on Antarctica. Imagine that. You see proof of life already is here. Amonst ouselves and our globe. This Earth was heaven before we decided to make life easier for ourselves. There are lions and trees here just like in Heaven. All water is Holy. I do not understand the missions so to speak of the shuttle being extremely productive, yet. The craft we need to make is one of motion, not gliding. Like the craft I saw, it hovers yet it spins and gathers motion to spin off and out. It uses wind. Is there wind in space? It's like a spiral propeller. A disk is the object but I saw how it works. It spins gathering force and is designed to use that force to propel with angular coordinates. The shock or gun of the blast is what makes the sound when it ignites and shoots up. I believe you should experiment with these physics. This is the way they do it. One other thing I noticed was the antennae on the bottom of the ship. It must pick up all vibrations and such. We have dishes, they have antennae. Also I noticed that they're eyes are black eyelids like that of an insect, but the lids lift up to reveal the more human like eyes behind with irises and pupils. They have huge eyes, there's no wonder why they are so advanced. They take in a lot, and communicate without word. With mind they communicate. I am sure there are many different species. I saw 3 species on 1 ship. The information I have given you might be of vital importance, who knows. It is real. I know that. I have drawn pictures as well. I am curious as to what happened to the time warp I encountered as well. I can not remember for the life of me. There was 9 hours I can not remember. How could I be driving a car and be abducted. That doesn't make sense. I just drove down the hill, and it was daytime. I saw them take off and pulled over. It was morning time. What the hell happened to me. I wanna know. Kind of. I'm kind of scared to find out. The other day when I first began to take pictures of the drawn pictures, the cable went out, my cell phone just died, and my webcam took a dump all in the same half hour. I went to the T.V. and went to fix it somehow, and as my hand approached, the cable came back on, my cell phone beeped, and my webcam light came back on. Weird. So I used the cell to take the photo's and uploaded them to my computer system. I have sent them to 2 people and such. I would like to send the drawing to NASA. I would like you to see what I have seen. Anonymous ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2006-02-14T00:00:00,39.2643,-119.4804

While we were looking up (we were not drunk or on any drugs), we noticed a light slowly moving across the sky which we had first thought was a star since it was of the same size and and a little brighter than one. This object then stopped and made a 90 degree turn and continued before stopping again and then making another 90 degree turn. All four of us witnessed it and were in awe. We quickly went through the possibilities: a star, an airplane, a satellite...but none of which would stop and make such turns. The object soon disappeared. We were freaked out by the event.

The shape of the object did not resemble any craft capable of flight. It had more resembalance to a building than an air borne craft. One single yellow-orange light rotated around the perimeter. The craft was approached by two military helicopters, which came within very close proximity to it. The helicopters closed on it briefly, then backed off to a distance of about 200 yds. and maintained their positions. Three seperate missles, apparently ground fired from the Fort Carson military installation were seen to impact the object, causing it to fall to the ground. The line of sight prevented anyone witnessing the actual impact of the craft. The helicopters then left the area following the route they had come from. This activity was observed by approximately 10 individuals in one location to the south and another four at a location some 20 miles to the north, placing the object at almost the center of the field of observation and at a distance to the east.

I'm reporting this event that I witnessed nine years ago after reading a seemingly related report from the same date for New Mexico. Shortly after this event, I provided an in person report to a well-known ufo author. On this (Oct. 3, 1996 evening people across the west saw what was reported through many news sources as a meteor. I didn't believe what I saw to be such an object, although it occurred at the same time as the meteor. Deductive reasoning concludes that I either a) witnessed the meteor event and have somehow interpreted it as something else b) witnessed something that was totally unrelated to the meteor event yet uncannily coincidental in the timing of it c) experts were wrong in that the reported meteor event was something else and that is what I saw. There are probably other explanations but those are the three logical ones I can think of.  While car camping at a friend's property just outside of Crestone, Colorado, I saw four balls of light traveling in a southwest to northeast direction approximately 10-15 degrees above the horizon at about 8:15 pm, I was looking southeast. The balls of light were equally spaced, had no sound, no streaking, no change of speed or direction of travel. To me at first it appeared to be an airplane, but then I realized there was no sound associated with it and for the speed it was traveling and the distance away it appeared to be and altitude, there would have been. After about 30 seconds, these lights disappeared behind the crest of the Sangre de Cristo range which was about five miles from where I was. I listened to radio accounts that evening of people throughout the west who witnessed what was reported as a meteor at roughly the same time. They reported seeing color in the meteor, what I saw was white. Whether these objects were just behind the ridge or outside the earth's atmosphere I couldn't say, although I felt as though they were just behind the ridge.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,37.9964,-105.6997

We were situated in a canyon about 100 feet deep, but I could see miles upriver. It was a moonless night with many stars.  I noticed a movement and looked there to see a spherical object which was incredibly bright, yet cast no light (which bothered me constantly even years later) that was slowly rising vertically over the edge of the canyon maybe 1/2 mile away.  Once above the canyon edge, I saw that it was bright white, round with rows of lights that rotated around it that were white also. I said to my buddy, hey do you see that and he looked and saw it too.   Just then it started coming what we both thought as straight at us real fast.  Even now my hair stands up.   I said I'm grabbing the machete and he said I got the rifle.  We were both scared and went into survival mode.  Right as I said Im gonna take them out with me. It stopped.  Stood still.  It reversed the course and floated below the hill just where it rose up. We then heard what we thought were dozens of coyotes howling very close by.  We were nervous and went out with torches to gather wood for almost an hour.  We made the HUGEST bonfire you could imagine and talked like nuts about how scared we were.  My next memory was waking up completely zipped up in the sleeping bag and covered with about 8 to 12 inches of ash.

Let me start by saying I have never been all that interested in UFO's. In fact, until this event, I never really believed in UFO's at all. It was just something that I never thought about.  This took place in a very rural area of southwest Michigan, and I was 15 years old at the time.  I was waiting for the bus at approx. 6:35 am. It was still very dark outside. It was very cold, around 15 degrees farenheit, and it was very clear, no clouds at all. I was standing at the end of my driveway, which is about 50 yards from the house. There are no neighbors in this area, and there were no lights on of any kind - no streetlights, vehicles, etc.  Across the street is a very large field of soybeans. Above this field I saw four large lights.  The lights looked exactly like stadium lights. They were very bright and close together. They were very high in the sky, perhaps twice the height of a normal stadium light.  Strangely, I was mesmerized by the lights. I could not figure out why the farmer had put these huge lights in the middle of his field. I watched the lights for approimately 10 minutes, and they never moved. I had no reason to think that they were anything but very tall stadium lights.  Suddenly the lights came towards me and zoomed over my head. There was no sound. As the lights approached me, the craft went higher and took off over my head. At this point it was going very slowly.  I looked up and saw it in full detail, directly above me. It was only a few hundred feet off the ground. It was triangular, but the edges of the triangle were rounded off. There were lights on either side of it, small red lights that were blinking. As it went above me, The light in front of the craft turned on. It was an interior light, and I could make out a shape moving around in the ""cockpit.""  The craft was huge, but not as large as a jetliner.  As it went over my head, it veered sharply to the left (west) and took off very quickly. It completely disappeared within seconds.  It was completly noiseless, and it was only after the even that I realized I had seen something extraordianry. The main thing I remember is that for some odd reason i could not take my eyes off the thing. It was like it hypnotized me.  After I realized what I had just seen, I was completely terrified. I felt like I could not breathe. The bus came and I asked everyone if thay had seen anything weird in the sky. They hadn't.  Ever since that day, I have been a believer.

We were coming back from a friends house later at night, it was a clear night and dark with no cloud cover. We stopped to get the mail from our box, and my mom said to look out the window. In the sky was a large and very bright circular object, yellow in color with a streaking appearance to it, as if you threw something wet and the water would come off it as it flies. The streaks were yellow and would disappear. Here is the interesting portion of the event. Behind the craft/UFO was a Naval jet from NAS Whidbey, probably an A-6 Intruder, which were stationed there, chasing it. The craft flew behind the trees and we lost view of it. The A-6, about half a mile behind it, followed, and we lost sight of it. We went into the house and never heard anything about it. I have since served in the military, and have never seen anything of the like of this occurrence. I was young, but this is still very clear in my mind.

During a graveyard shift, I went outside to do my hourly weather observation, taking the temperature/dewpoint samples.   I noticed an object moving slowly from over the mountains to the northeast (Dragoon mountains), on a southwesterly heading towards the Bisbee/Ft Huachuca area.  I could not estimate the size or altitude of the object, but it was a light blue color and globular.  It seemed to glow and the intensity would fluctuate as it moved along.   Having been in the USAF and around aircraft for many years, I saw that this was definitely not a conventional aircraft, neither fixed wing nor rotor.   When it reached a point over the Mule mountains to the southwest, over the Bisbee/Ft Huachuca area, it stopped and just hung there. A couple of minutes later it started to move sporadically back and forth over that point.   I went back inside the station and rang Davis-Monthan AFB in Tucson on our interphone line requesting them to verify a target at that location.  Davis-Monthan confirmed a target over Ft Huachuca, and their height-finder radar indicated an altitude ""above 90,000 feet"".  The size of the object as it appeared, and at that altitude, must have been huge.  Davis-Monthan scrambled 2 F4's.   I went back outside and in minutes could see, approaching from the northwest, two aircraft moving towards the object and the glowing trails of their afterburners going full bore told me it was the F4s.   When the aircraft were approximately 10 or 20 miles from the object, it suddenly zoomed away at high speed towards the southwest and disappeared over the mountain horizon, leaving the F4s orbiting around the area.   I could only imagine what the pilots were saying to each other.  They then headed northwest towards Tucson.  Davis-Monthan had checked with the base at White Sands Proving Grounds to verify if a weather baloon had been launched recently.  They had not.   When Davis-Monthan called back for more information, I told them jokingly...""congratulations, you just confirmed a UFO"".  They were not amused.   I did not have any other inquiries from either the Air Force people nor our FAA.  A couple of days later I learned of the new UFO Reporting Center in Seattle.

As I was driving towards town I noticed off to my right a really shiny object,(like a top) hovering around the Family Life Radio Station tower. It was hovering just about 50-75 feet off the ground.  It was a bright sunny day, and I was first thinking, why would anyone have a weather balloon here. I  thought, why isn't it moving, because balloons move. This was not moving when I first saw it.  As I approached Tomlinson Road, (the radio station tower was located on that road, maybe about half a mile straight down from Eden Road), I kept watching the object. It was a very bright silver, glistening in the sun.  It had no windows, no lights, nothing except that it was really a bright silver.  It wasn't moving, just staying still.  I was listening to that radio station, (WUNN), and I came to the intersection of Eden and Tomlinson. When I got to the intersection, the radio station went completely static so I couldn't hear it at all.  Then the object started to move and I decided to try to follow it.  It really started to speed up and I know I was doing 60 mph and it just flew off and I couldn't keep up.  I saw no engine or anything to make it move that fast.  I went home and called the Capital City airport and asked them if they had any reports of an object shaped like a top reported to them. They acted like I was a little nuts, but they said they had nothing reported to them.  Even though it has been about 30 years since I saw it, it is still like it was yesterday, since it was such a strange thing to see.

In the winter of 1976, at the age of 10, while living in Flint, Michigan, my friend and I were excited about the big snowfall we had the night before.  We had a good portion of the morning climbing up the T.V. antenna and jumping off the house into large snow drifts.  The snow had stopped and it was just a cloudy day.  We were just about ready to go in for some lunch, but before we did, we climbed climbed up the antenna together for just one more jump.  I was above my friend near the roof top, when a white spinning object, the size of a 2 x 4, approximately 3 foot long came spinning around the corner of the house and then hovered right before us - still spinning - No Lights, just a faint whooshing sound as it spun.  We both staired at it in amazement as it sat there and spun.  I exclaimed out loud, ""Wow!  What in the heck is that thing?"" My friend replied ""I don't know!  I've never seen anything like it!""  We both were very nervous and did not know if we should move.  We both just stood there in the antenna physically and emotionally froze, staring at it.  After about 20 seconds, it spun back around the corner of the house and disappeared.  I remember looking at my friend and just saying ""Wow! Let's go see where it went!""  We both jumped down from where we were on the antenna and ran around the corner of the house to see where it went.  We never did see it again.  We then both ran in and excitedly told my mother about the situation.  She just listened intently and then fed us both a hot bowl of chilli.  That's it! Strange I know!

I'm writing regarding the well documented Phoenix Lights. I saw them from the base of Granite Mountain in Prescott, AZ., which is approximately 100 miles North of Phoenix. It was still light when I saw them traveling in a Southerly direction. The most important point I want to make is that they were absolutely not flares, as some would later claim. I come from a family of pilots and have my flight ratings as well. These craft seemed to be moving faster than most planes I have observed. They were traveling in a very symetrical formation-- like an elongated triangle, with probably three lights on either side of a single light at the point. They simply looked like round white lights to me. They seemed more luminescent than typical jets; made no sound; left no contrails; contained no other plane-like lights; and again, seemed to be traveling very fast. I have wondered if they might be some new secret military craft, but couldn't understand why they would fly over a highly populated area like Phoenix-- wouldn't make sense. This would also have placed them on Sky Harbor's (Phoenix's international airport's) radar as well. Anyway, I don't know what they were, but they sure as hell weren't flares. I will always consider them as having been individual craft unlike anything I had previously seen. I wish so much I would have had a video camera. I know others reported seeing these lights at least as far North as I did. I just hope that my report will lend support to the idea that they were not flares.

During a fall afternoon, when I had my son who was only four at the time, to a small park where there were swings, teeter totters, slides etc, and we left to take a short drive up along the Musquodoboit River, which is in Central-Easten Shore of Nova Scotia, near the Atlantic Coastline, approximately 45 degrees latitude.  It was about 3:00 pm in late afternoon when I was going to drive up to a favourite fresh water spring that is about 6 miles NorthWest from the small coastal community of Musquodoboit Harbour which is situate about 35 miles east of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Not too far away is a major International Airport, known as Halifax International Airport and it would be approximately 12 to 15 miles from where I saw this craft, and it is important to note that I did see other aircraft in the air on this afternoon, which were visible as they broke through the clouds on either landing or takeoff from the airport.  The date was on or about October 24, 1997 and as I was about 5 miles northwest of the community of Musquodoboit Harbour, something caught my attention on the North Side of the Highway low in altitude and I would estimate it to be about 200 to 300 ft in the air, although, it very well could have been higher as it is hard to reference size without having two known points to triangulate.  What astonished me is the shape of this craft, it was like two long partly clyndrical, partly square like cylinders with a large round midsection joining the two cylynders, almost like the letter H.  It was metallic with dark colours (possibly shadows away from the sunlight, and the clouds were scattered in otherwise a partly sunny-partly cloudy day.  This craft was very slow moving and moving in a easterly direction and slowly dissappeared beyond the trees that I could see.  There seemed to be some kind of ribbon like things hanging down from this craft, for approximately 30ft +/- near the midsection of this craft.  The actual length again is hard to judge based on what distance the ship was from me.  I would estimate this craft to be about 200 ft in length and the mid section joining the two fuselages to be approximately 50 ft or about one quarter the length of the cylydrical-partially square shapped fuselage.  There was NO SOUND being emitted from this craft and it was just drifting slowly.  I do not know if others may have seen this or not, but I do know there were a rash of reports of people seeing strange objects in the sky along the entire eastern shore that particular month, but what differs in what I saw, it was daytime. I have a background in Land Surveying and often used takl trees, towers, etc, as reference points to triangulate approximate distances or directions, but on that day, I had no theodilite and no way to measure, so my dimensions at best are pure estimation.  This craft was flying in the opposite direction of what an airplane would be flying on approach to the airport.  I told immediate family members, but no-one else at the time, as I feared being made fun of and have nothing to collaborate my story, except my very vivid memory of this incident that lasted for approximately 45 seconds +/-.  I tried to make sense of what this was, perhaps a large airplane flying low with some type of mirage or reflection off a low cloud, but it was flying far too slow to even keep an aircraft airborne.  I cannot recall if this craft actually flew out of sight at the treeline, or just vanished as quick as it appeared, but it was moving in an easterly direction.  I have attempted to draw what it looks like, and have superimposed it on a tree with clouds in the background to give others perspective of what I have seen.  Is it from another world?  Is it a manmade aircraft being experimented with?

On Mar 10, 1998 at approximately 5:30 a.m. my wife woke me, she was very excited and wanted to show me a light in the sky to the south of Santa Monica, she was sure it was something unusual.  I went out my front door with her and looked up, it was a very brilliant white light, I told her it was just a star (I'm forever a skeptic), we had planned a flight to Las Vegas that morning and I had to check weather and file my flight plan.  As I was making coffee (first priority), I kept checking the light up in the sky, it didn't appear to move at the time.  After I had prepared for the flight we walked out to the street to get in my truck and leave and to my surprise when I looked up in the sky, the light from earlier was now lower on the horizen and appeared to be directly over the north complex of LAX, it now looked like a large metallic sphere. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, nor could my wife(and of course, she told me so). I grabbed my binoculars from my vehicle to view the sphere and it was definitely metallic, was no longer glowing and was just hovering, at about 2500 ft.  I am a commercial pilot and have been around aircraft since I was a child, this was nothing like I have ever seen.  To estimate the size I referenced it against a 747-400 above and behind the object traveling southeast and roughly state 50 ft in diameter, and thats very rough.  The sphere very slowly decended to a slightly lower altitude as we observed it, I decided that I was just going to go ahead and leave for the airport, assuming that if it was anything of significance it would be all over the news, but of course after returning that afternoon and watching the news, nothing.  That is the first and only time I have ever witnessed something like that, and it really has sparked my curiosity about such sightings.

My husband was driving, I was passenger. Driving east on highway 70 in O'Fallon area, just east of Hwy 40.  Suddenly, we hear low hummings, like many aircraft.  Looking out the cars front window, at first glance, looked like helicoptors or F fighters in escort - but in a wide V formation?   We rolled down the windows.  Husband began to drive very slowly in the emergency lane.  I looked out my side window and saw many aircraft with flashing lights, both jets and helicopters in the sky.   Then I noticed a section of the sky a dull black .. and that it was moving slowly.  And it was what the ""escort"" aircraft were surrounding!   All aircraft involved could not have been more than half a mile up.  I could determine which were helicopters & which were jets, if that is a judge of how far up they were.   All in all, the entire ""V formation"" (aircraft + BT) covered both east & west bound lanes of the highway equally 8 lanes plus emergency lanes.  This was not a small sized event!   Well we could not believe our eyes!   What was this huge dark triangle that was so black, no emissions, no sound, no color, flew so slow and low to the ground?  It kept a straight and even paced course.  My first thought was ""oh my word, not only is Boeing near, Scott AFB is not that far either.""   My husband got a bit ahead under it and I looked more and more closer and noticed that it was flat and triangular.  No reflections under, etc. What appeared to be lights on its side, were indeed the aircraft surrounding it.  It was thee strangest thing I ever seen.  And ominous. After about 15 minutes my husband pulled over to the side of the road.  We got out of the car and watched it move slowly away over highway 70.  I remember thinking ""why do not more people pull over and watch this?""  But my eyes were more glued to the skies than worried to see just who was or not pulled over to watch.   As we watched the dark triangle & escort fly off east, following highway 70s course, (geesh how blatant I kept thinking), I remember noticing that it appeared rather ""thin"" in thickness ... which added more to the whole bizarreness.   I barely remember getting into the car.  And I do not recall the drive home. NOTE: when the object was directly over us I felt sick to my stomache.

I have tried to convince myself that i was dreaming. So it was a thursday evening i no this as i was waiting 4 my fave program to come on TV called top gear it started at 8.30 in the evening. One of the most strange things about this sighing is that i felt compelled to go to my window as if it wanted me to see it while waiting 4 this program to start had i been watching sumthing of a longer duration i would of never seen it and to be honest would of been much more happy to not of seen it. The instant i got to my window and looked out i see this object, first i thouhgt it was a grey bollon but almost instantly realised it wasnt. After about 20 seconds i was frozen still as i watched this grey blob like thing silently glide across from my feild of view (from left to right). i watched almost till it was out of sight as it started to go behind a tree and i swear it stopped dead in the sky 4 a moment then carried on till i could no longer see it. i wanted to rush out to follow it up the feilds but i was to shocked to move i looked around to see it any1 else on the street was looking but i think it was only me. must point out that it was still daylite altho the sun had just started to go down. This object must of flown over the local airport which isnt that big as it was on a same flight path as an aircraft taking off. Later that night by about midnight there was an awful lot of aircraft activity like iv never seen b4. i have spent the last year researching various sights relating to UFOs, military top secret aircraft and the like.During this time of looking around on the net i found a short mpeg video taken from a cctv street camera in kent which shows the almost indenticle grey blob craft at about the same hight same speed as what i saw and even more chilling is that the date time on the cctv camera coincides with my sighting.

They set up their camp near the river about 700' from my house. Early one evening at approximately 10 PM I went down to join my brothers and their friends at their camp site. We started drinking, just beer and having fun when someone looked up and said, ""what is that?"" I looked up and above us, at tree top level was a luminous, (white) oval shape like a huge smoke ring about 30'long and 15' wide, clear in the center. Around the perifery, inside and outside this ring were erratic pulsating flashes of white light. I remember what struck me the most was the shape of the flashing lights as they were triangular and seemed very unnatural also  how it remained perfectly stationary. There were no colors except for white and no sound. We all stared up mystifed and watched this light show display for 30 minutes or more, no one could take their eyes off of it. After a while I began to become concerned for everyones safety, not knowing what this was and I demanded we all go back to the house which we did in the darkness. Some of the guys said it followed us back up to the house but I didn't notice this. I would really like to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like this.

From directly behind the screen appeared a huge chevron shaped craft with many white and orange lights along the forward edges.   People instantly started yelling and screaming while pointing to it, several cars started and drove quickly and erratically out of the drive-in lot.  I heard no noise, but the noise of everyone in the lot was fairly loud so it would have been hard to hear anyway.   Several people starting yelling that it was ""ultra-lights"", (small planes), and I felt very strongly at that moment that this thing was one object and not a formnation of several objects.  I am lucky enough to have also witnessed the small craft (ultra-lights) that were indeed flying the Hudson Valley at the same time as the famous triangle ufo and I can say with conviction that the two sighting were instantly and exceedingly different.  The first craft was very slow, very steady and it seemed that a jogger would easily keep up with it.  The second sighting of the ultra-lights was easily recognized as a formation of small aircraft, unable to stay in precise formation, drifting towards and away from each other, and recognizable engine noise as well.   Also, the second sighting was not really a chevron shape, but more of a sloppy semi-circle of small white lights.   I can understand how those who never saw the first could dismiss the rash of sightings as bogus when they saw the second, but those of us who saw both things cannot be convinced they were one and the same.   Although there were hundreds of witnesses at the drive-in that night, and the craft moved slowly towards Peekskill city proper and many more must have seen it, I don't recall reading or hearing any report of it specifically.  At the time it was one of the first of many sightings of this craft.   I estimate it to be about 200-300 feet at its widest and nearly that long as well.  There was a smaller red light at its center.  The larger lights were huge themselves, maybe 20-30 feet in diameter.   I saw similar lights (very large) during daylight about three years later moving in the exact same valley as the drive-in, many people pulled off the road to see them as the were BELOW tree level.  The sighting lasted only a minute or so, and there were several  huge white lights in a staggered pattern.  I could not make out any structure, even though this was a midday sighting.

Walked all the way to the road which took about 20 minutes, and turned around to walk back to camp. About halfway back I feel like something was watching me, I scanned the field then the sky and there it was. It looked just like the older ufo footage of the saucer type ones, it was silver in color but the bottom was dark. It was to the south of us and a guess would be 1,500-3,000 feet, object was at least 20-40 feet round in diameter.  It was a perfect still day with no clouds, all blue. It had a mirage effect to it, like when your on a road when its steaming hot out and you get that wavey heat effect when you look in the distance, I could sense a type of energy coming from it.  From the time we first saw it until the time we walked back to camp, it did not move or make a sound. Bear in mind this is a very wooded area but about 5 minutes into the walk the woods clear and there is nothing but sky and fields forever. The ufo was not in the sky when we were walking toward the road, so I know it was moving and stopped sometime after we turned around to walk back.  We walked and then ran back to camp after we had observed it for about 20 minutes, this was a mistake. We got back and told a counselor and we ran with him to the clearing and it was gone, and I knew it would be, one of us should have stayed with it until we got another person to see it, or at least one of us would have seen it move, who believes two teenagers.

I saw that the vehicle that was following me was now going past me above the road.  I couldn't get a good view of it due to the glare of the rising sun. But it was definitly flying past my car. After I was blinded by what I thought was the metallic reflection of the front of a semi-truck trailer I noticed the lights on the vehicle behind me were blue and a light green color. After being blinded and realizing something was flying past I got really scared and about in a 30 to 40 span minutes later I found myself knelling on the side of the road about a 1/4 mile away from my car.

The other group continued in an E/SE direction when suddenly it transformed again into a glowing red/orange ball.  The glow was like nothing I had ever seen before.   Then we noticed a trail behind it. The trail was not like the ones created by a jet, it was wide, but was more transparent.  It was moving faster than anything else in the sky.  All of a sudden it made a right turn toward the ocean and then another heading south.  Then it appeared to stop, giving the impression that it was heading away from Earth.  It then suddenly diminished in size until it had disappeared.  The last bit happened in less than a second and it was definitely moving away from us.

When the first one appeared I was confused as to wether it was a plane and as it grew closer I thought they might just be balloons but then I relaise that it wasn't light reflecting of the balloons but infact light moving in a circular motion probably around the edges of the craft. There was a light haze around the craft probably caused by the lights refracting in the air around the craft. At times the circular motion changed to an elliptical one as though the craft had changed its angle of attack but it was definitely moving at a unifrom crusing speed with no erratic motion and a continous heading.

I studied it to the best of my visual ability and I am confident that it was not in the shape of any aircraft that I am aware off. I am not under the influence of anything alcoholic or any kind of drug. I am a logical, sound person with a few hours of flying time under my belt and have always been skeptical of UFO's and am still skeptical of alien life forms investigating our world but I can say for sure that the craft I saw tonight is unidentifiable. One thing I know for certain is that the Toronto City Centre ATC and the Toronto Pearson ATC should definitely have seen it on radar.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,43.67588634410802,-79.414188349018

I and some friends were at a Drive-In movie located in the town of 29 Palms outside the base. It was pretty late at night. The movie screen was located about 5 feet away on the other side of 5' high wooden fence that surrounded the parking area. I just happened to look off to the upper right hand side of the screen and noticed that something was hovering, with multi-colored blinking lights, above a darkened building, about a mile away on the outskirts of town. (29 Palms, CA) I thought to myself, 'What the heck is a helicopter doing hovering over a building out in town'? I was used to seeing all kinds of helicopters on the base.  I then noticed that it continued to hover, there was no sound or sand being kicked up. It appeared to be a ball of multi-colored blinking lights. I couldn't discern a shape. I absent mindedly started walking towards the fence to get a better look. I then noticed that many other people in the Drive-In saw it too and got out of their cars. The UFO then started to rise straight up, silently. It did not flair out at an angle like a helicopter would. It kept going up until it appeared to be the size and color of a star. It then started zig-zagging across the sky while still going up, until it finally disappeared.  I found out later that at the same time, people located on the other side (to the left of the screen) of the drive-in area, saw two UFO's hovering over a mountain, located to the left of the screen. They reported that the 2 UFO's they saw, also rose straight up, silently, and zig-zagged while going up until they were out of site. I thought to myself, 'I have to call the Base and tell someone!' But I didn't have any idea as to who to call. We all talked about it the next day. I called a friend, who now lives in N. Carolina, after 25 years and he still remembered the incident.

First of all the date of this incident has been so long ago that I am not sure of the particular month or day, though I know it was between March and may.  Also, the witness count of seventy plus represents toses imediatly around me, but does not reflect the thousands of host nationals who witnessed the spheres as it flew form Clark Air Base to Cubi point Naval Air station.  Or the Two F-4 Phanthom aircrews or the two A-4 Skyhawk pilots that were circling the object.  It took the aircraft between six to eight second to traverse from one side of the sphere to its other before dissappearing behind it. It was covered in continually shifting triangular patterns of colored light.  It was talk about on the local philipine radio broadcast for nearly a week, though not on the U.S. Arm Forces radio. Totally silent. Gigantic in size.  I serve aboard the USS Independence; CV-62,  I estimate that cut up, ten carriers her size could have fitted into this craft.  I and my finance at the time, who later became my wife witnessed the phenonenom after getting off of the base shuttle bus in front of the Cubi Point Chow Hall.  The base taxi stand was there also.  Between the bus load of people getting off and those waiting to board and the people waiting for cabs as well as the people coming out of the chow hall across the street, I estimate that there were atleast seventy plus people around us.  I grew up in the air force and my rate in the Navy was that of an airdale.  I flew mainly aboard SH-46 Sea Knight choppers. I am very verse in both military, commercial and general aviation aircraft.  I am sure that this vehicle was not of any technologies that I am aware of in either construction or aerodynamic properties.  I was also assigned several years later to the Naval Air Test Center at Patuxent River, in Maryland.  There I came into contact with some of the advance airframes or technology could produced in the eighties.  I've discussed what I saw that night in the Philippines with some of the best minds in the disciplines of aeronautic design and theory.  None of them have ever been able to tell me what I saw that night.  Of note, that I have always found interresting, is that the day after the sighting, my former wife, whom as I said was my finance at the time of the sighting, was a live in maid who worked in base housing. That evening when I met her at the bus stop in front of the chow hall, she was very hesitant to talk about what we had seen the night before.  She said that the enlisted service man whose family she worked for.  Upon returing home after work that day, asked her if she had seen anything unusual the night before.  She told him of the sighting.  He told her that he had been in a meeting with other servicemen who had famlies on the base that day.  They had been told to inform their domestics that it could cost them their jobs if they discussed with anyone what they had seen the night before.  Also as in her case, my permismion to request to mary her could be denide, even though it had been approved.  Or she may find it impossible to pass the American bried course which was mandatory befor we could get married.  Cubi Point Nas was located atop the hill range abouve Subic Bay Naval Operations Base.  From the vantage point which we were at,  We could see the object approacing from the north.  The only sound associated with it were the turbines of the fighters that Clark air base and Cubi Point NAS had launched.  It turned and proceed to slowly fly over Cubi and off towards the Marine Ordance Magazine depot.  I estimated from the the two different types of interceptors, of which I was toatll;y familiar with, that they and this object were approximately eight to nine hundred feet in the air.  The triangular patterns of light were continually changing by the second in a rainbow of colors.  I lost sight of the craft after it crossed behind a ridge.  I later heard that the object dissappeared over the South China Sea ... how I don't know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

As it did so, it appeared to 'jettison' a stream of falling lights as it rose. This caught our attention, and we stopped to watch this strange object.  The main light continued to move, and over the next minute of watching it became clear it was coming our way. I'm not sure how we realised this, time having dimmed my recollection. But, we were aware of a shape that blocked out the stars as it moved (it was a very clear night), and in the event the craft moved directly over us. Its shape was like a triangle added to a square - so a 'squat arrow' shape. The triangle point was the 'nose'. It was completely silent. As it passed over us it was larger than a hand-span at arm's length. Once we were viewing the flat rear of the craft as it moved away from us, three large round white 'engine ports' were clearly visible.  As it slowly flew out over the Solent, we saw a commercial aircraft (probably a passenger jet) flying across the sky also. It was in the same 'general' airspace, so I've wondered whether anything else was reported.  It's all so long now that I can't be sure of the precise year it happened, let alone the date. But I know I was about 15, it was a cold, clear dark night, and I remember hurrying home with my friend to tell my mum and dad. They weren't particularly interested. I wrote it all down, but the notes have long since disappeared. I often wonder whether other reports might describe something similar. But I am also interested by my own lack of drive to research more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

But, being an estimate of time, and the grade and age I think I was, I think it's the same PLACE.  My experience took place in an area of St.Albert where the field is huge and borders with schools. Coming home in the evening from outside skating at one of the schools, my sister and I crossed the street and entered the field through ""the hole in the fence"".  As we walked about 15 ft, just by the ball diamonds, we noticed an extremly huge ""spot"" light crossing back and forth through the field, as if searching for something.  There was no sound, and nothing to see but the light.  We froze in one spot, and watched this light as it virtually ""searched"" the field from one side to the other.  As it approached us, being frightened, I believe now we were in shock, my sister pushed me down, and told me to lay still and quite as she covered me in snow.  She then covered herself next to me.  She was so quick to act. I think she had covered both of us in less than 30 seconds.  Just as she finised herself, the light passed our heads by inches.  As the brightness of the light passed, we peeked to see that it was once again on the other side of the field.  We jumped up and watched as the light disappeared straight up.  For a second the sky was dark, then a bright streak of white and red shot south through the sky.  I have NEVER seen anything move and dissapear so fast in my life!We ran back to the ""hole in the fence"", crossed the street, to where the street lights were, and took the ""long way home"" along the houses and street lights.  We were frost bit, and I don't have any memory of entering our home.  I have tried to speak to my sister about this incident many times through the years, but only lately, has she spoken about what happened in the field.  I don't even remember entering our crescent.

This is very old that was never reported; I don't think I ever made a formal report of this before -- I really don't know why not-- maybe I thought people would judge me in a bad way.  Anyhow, my brother and I saw the object from the back seat of our car as we were on a trip with our parents from Nevada to Oregon.... it was really late and the other kids in the car were asleep.. but not us 2.  It was between about 1977 and 1979 and I think it was on Christmas break or possibly summer break... exact date and year or time of night I am not sure of, but the sight was definitely clear.  It was possibly 30 meters or so from us on the right hand side of the road down in the forest... we were situated at a level slightly higher than the object and the road was pretty curvy.  The thing was about 10 feet across maybe... dome shaped with hanging down undulating legs.  The whole thing was like neon -  glowing in the dark  - even the legs. The top dome had different  colored (I think oval) lights going all the way around the dome.  It was so long ago I wish I had drawn an exact likeness, but I definitley remember these things.  It was such a beautiful object hovering just above the forest floor.  We only saw it for a moment but it was clear... no distant nebulous lights or anything.  Still, my brother and I really had not discussed it much over our lifetime. I think we might have tried to tell our parents later on, but they must have laughed it off and no report was made.  My brother and I are both highly educated. We are not red-neck storytellers or something.  I have no wish of any notoriety at all. I am just curious.  I even called my brother this evening to ask about it and he laughed and said yeah that octopus thing ...that was definitely strange.

All of the sudden I see a bright light in the sky to the north east,  If you would take a welding arch white type of light that is how white it was just not as intense, though it stood out like a sore thumb (if you held your thumb out in front of you and put it over the light would be about the size of object, If you are into math you can use info later here to estimate size).  I thought nothing of it and looked at where my father was with the combine and he was heading down the hill not quite half way in the field.  I looked back wondering if i could hear any engines thinking it was a helo or a plane.  Heard absolutly nothing except the faint sound of the combine.  It would have been between 5-7 miles away and about 2 miles or 3 miles ubove the ground. I looked back at the light and noticed it was moving erratically.  Now by erratically i mean it moved up and down in the sky really fast but in very short bursts (not far up or down but very fast).  It also did not stop but did move forward fast then slow down in short bursts (not far forward and would slow down).  I had to turn away and blink to actually see what i have been seeing. While watching the movement I was also thinking it either was unmaned or had inertial dampeners.  With how fast it was moving in the short burts no human could stand the movements for a long period of time. All the movement was done on a line so to say (basically draw a straight line and it would move up and down on it and then move forward fast and slow down on it.  When it moved up and down on it it would move the same distance up and down on it). It would move up and down and then move forward on that line and move up and down again. Sometimed it would move forward once slow down and forward again and slow down again, then move up and down 2 times in a row.   It was heading south west.  Needless to say i had seen that object move to the south west and i had watched it for about 3-5 minutes till I could still barely see it and i quickly crawled up the ladder to the combine asked my dad if he could see it in the distance when he got to the end and he couldn't see it (very bad eye sight).  He thought i was nuts and made it up.  Day 2  2 days later. We were done early with the field we were harvesting and we took the rest of the night off.  I got the little 22 rifle and a spot light and went rabbit hunting.  It was an identical night to the first night calm, no wind 70 degrees out or so.  Anyway I had gone out back and got just to the north end of our trees (100 yards of trees) and seen the exact same thing only 1 mile closer.  Moving the exact same way exactly same movements.  I got chills down the spine.  First thing i did is listened for an engine.  Heard nothing.  Looking for anything i could use to identify it.  Saw nothing.  Then i thought to myself shine the spot light on it (1 million candle light power).  I shined it on it for a second as i was looking NW now (the closest I would be to it).  It stopped moving erratically and started moving in a straight line on that line i was telling you about before at a constant speed.  I then shined it on it again and got scared out of my mind.  A flashing light turned on underneath the object (in my mind to fool me or someont to think it was a plane).  I went running back in the house and told my dad and again he thought i made it up.  I use to go hunting all the time and sit for hours patiently waiting for a skunk or something snooping around.  Never went out again after that.

This is in ""Valle"" arizona at the intersection of hwy 64 & hwy 180.  I went outside to urinate at 2:30 in the morning. Directly at about 40 deg.in the eastern night sky was a very bright object somewhat round. It was stunningly noticeable as it was shaking somewhat violently kind of reminded of the way a ""bumble bee"" moves in flight.   At first I took it to be a regular type of aircraft.  I thought I might have to help the occupants of a aircrash because I thought this aircraft was in trouble.  that was until it came to a complete halt.  At that point I knew this thing was special.  In this area it is extremely quiet especially at night, There was absolutely no sound to this vehicle.  At times it seemed to move from this halted position.  I could not detect how it got from A to B but I could tell it was not staying put.  Its luminescent quality would jump in magnatude for a very brief period. I could tell this light could light up the sky if it wanted to.  You could sense it tremendous power.  The lighted object did not ""bumble"" after the initial sighting.Later two other object much more faint but with exactly the same luminescence came close to the original object and banked at 45 deg angle at a ridiculously fast rate of speed (like lightning)sped off and dissapered.  When the objects got close to eachother they seemed to exchange energy sort of like static electricity in a way.  The main object seemed to climb but very slowly.  It stayed in position in the same portion of the sky but more like 70 deg.  It was still there very bright but seemed higher and farther away.  It was there when the sun came up and all other stars etc, where long gone. I did not see it leave.  I went to work in Williams, AZ. and left the scene. This area has a wonderful black night sky with many bright stars.  The main object was the brightest object in the sky. It had none of the usual red and green beacons as on regular aircraft. No sound, this area is so quiet you can hear an airplane many miles away if it is flying by.  I noticed I had a hard time telling how close it was. Could of been 10, 20  or 50 miles away or maybe 3.  It was hard to tell. Its light was backlit like a stage light. Definately not an incandescent beam (like an aircraft or car) I will never forget it.

Then, we watched the news at 10:00 and it said there had been sightings of UFOs in many states that night.  That night started my interests in UFOs and I was browsing your reports and found the report of a person in Belle, Missouri, on October 15, 1988, that had seen the same thing!   I immediately got chills and called my mom.  She told me to write you because she always knew there had to be other people that saw it and also did not agree with it being ""space junk"" as the government claimed.   She was on a dirt road coming home from taking a friend home when she seen a ""giant"" dark object in the distance.  Her first instinct told her it was a blimp.  As it got closer she realized it was too big to be a blimp.   She pulled over her car and got out.  She told me ""I have no idea why I pulled over by myself on a dark country road because any other time I would be too scared, but I was so amazed at the size that I was almost in a trance.""   She said it was very very slow and did not make one single sound.  She didn't see any lights like the report from Belle except what looked like one light on the rear.  Also it was very low (too low to be a plane)   She watched it for 10-15 minutes until it had gone over some mountains.   She told me today that even though it was 17 years ago she remembers it like it was yesterday and she could still sit down and draw a picture of it.   My mom is a quiet woman and does not cause trouble,  but she has always disagreed that it was pieces of a Russian rocket falling through the atmosphere (one of the governments explanations)   She said whatever she saw was definately flying.  Not falling.   She does not have a computer therefore she has asked to write you.  I know it has been a long time since it happened but My mom could never find anyone who seen the same thing that night until I read the report from Belle Missouri.   Thank you.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,,

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SENT IN REGARDS TO THIS PHOTO AND SIGHTING FROM THIS INVESTIGATOR.  This is a photo of an unknown object taken about late evening 12 July 1990.  The local farmer I received the photo from was taking a shot of the ""rainbow"".  When he had it developed, the object was noticed. It also shows up in the negative, so it is not from the processing.  It was taken from his front porch, the dark area in the upper right corner is the roof line of his house.  The witness lives on the corner of Ten Bush and Fort Hill Rd. here in Willamina, Oregon.  He is a long time resident here since about 16, he is 72 years of age now. He is an advid photographer.  This object is estimated at about 2000-3000 feet in altitude, at a range of about 1/2 mile to under a mile.  Flight direction looks to be south by southeast.  The lights seen in the bottem of the photograph is the local wood mill here, estimated time was about 7-8pm on the 12th of July.  Witness does not remember anything being in the photograph except the rainbow... it was taken with a 35 mm. camera.  I live right at the top of Oak Lane, so I am familiar with this area...  Currently, the witness is writing his account on the sighting with some additional info on a ""blue sphere"" his wife saw in the same area just a few years back.  Most the land around this area is Confederated Tribal Lands of the Grand Ronde ... so it has some interesting history.  I will forward this on your site.  I scanned and enhanced the object.. which is interesting.  The closest military base is a Air Guard  Base, but for the 3 years I have lived in this area, I have never seen any low flying military a/c in the area, except for choppers.

At first I did not submit a formal report because the incident happened so long ago, and I can no longer find the details I wrote down immediately after my sighting.  However, when I read the report on this website of a sighting in Naples, Florida on 11/3/2005 I couldn't help but be stunned. The reported sighting was almost identical to a sighting I had about 15 to 18 years ago.  I also live in Naples, Florida. The night of my sighting, I was walking down my driveway with my dog. It was less than an hour after sunset. I was walking from north to south. I looked up because I saw what I believed to be a satellite moving from west to east. For some reason I can't remember I thought it as Hubble. I watched the satellite until it disappeared into the dark side of the day/night terminator to the east. At almost the same time the satellite disappeared, there was movement directly above me.  Whatever the object was, it was absolutely flat black, and very very fast!  The sighting was so brief (only a few seconds), that I could only gather impressions of what I saw. Although the sky was dark and moonless, the object was so dark that I could see a boomerang shape against the slightly lighter night sky.  It seemed to be low,  and was very large.  Much larger than any airplane I have ever seen.  It was absolutely silent. Not a hiss or whoosh came when it passed overhead. For some reason I had the feeling the leading edge of the shape was just a very little lighter than the trailing edge.  Basically, I saw a very dark object against a slightly lighter, clear black sky blocking out the stars.  The weather was clear, with a few clouds on the southern horizon.  The star Fomalhaut was clearly visible above the clouds to the south.  The thought has occurred to me, the object was intentionally flying near the edge of the terminator in order to remain in darkness.  When I checked the date and time of the 11/3/05 sighting, I found that the position of the terminator would have been similar to my sighting.  The largest discrepancy in the two sightings is that my object was traveling in a north to south direction, rather then the northeast to southwest direction of the 11/03/05 sighting.  I can still see the object in my minds eye, although some of the detail has been lost.  It is something I hope I will never completely forget.

During the time it took me to smoke a cigarette, this object came to within 75-100ft of the roof of the neighborhood homes, and was on a path that would take it directly above me.  AS it passed over my head I could see tat it was triangular in shape, with three lights (one at each corner).  It was almost completeley silent with the exception of a low humm.   Shortly after it passed over me it changed direction abrubtly and instantly made a slight course adjustment.  From what I obseved this object was not beholden to known principles of flight.  It traveled at I would estimate 3-5 Mph., it's turn was the most baffling becuse the objects speed remained a constant and as the object itsef rotated to the right its direction simultaneousley changed, there was absoluteley no delay between turn and direction change!  It was about 50ft across and had windows.  As the object left going south in the distance I turned and noticed another light where I had originally saw the first object.   I waited to see what this new object was and to my surprise it was an identical triangular object, identicle path and trajectory as well as speed.  The weirest part of the sighting to me was that the second object turned at the exact same point,at the exact same angle (vector)and the exact same speed of 3-5 mph.!!!   These triangles that I saw definately were not reliant upon any air flow for flight. Definately had the feeling they could be man made.  Not too sure but I think there are/were Air Force bases near there point of origin. (weymouth) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was late at night...I don't know how late...but probably after midnight. The road was through a pine forest. We were travelling toward sea level and as a consequence the plane of the land ahead of us was visible for a few miles to the horizon (we could see the tops of the trees for a ways ahead due to the downward slow incline of the land). About near the horizon, I see this lighted object. I first think that it must be an airplane. This is for a good minute or two. As we approached it however, I realized that the object was not moving and that it was shaped like a squat spheroid and had lights evenly spaced around its equator. I then assumed that it must be a water tower. As we got closer it became apparent that the thing was hovering right on the left hand side of the road about 3-5 feet above the trees. It was no more than 30-50 feet away from the car at the closest point. The lights on it were bright white and were shining downward. I guess it must have been 30-50 feet in diameter. On the underside of the object, there was a fanlike rotor structure composed of many thin metallic looking fan blades. There were so many blades that you could not see a gap between them...but it my also have been that they were spinning too fast, so maybe there were fewer blades and it was more of an optical illusion do to the spinning. There was a slight fog around and above the trees, and the convection of the fan was sucking the fog into the object. I was filled with a very definitive fear and hightened anxiety like I have never felt before. I pointed at the object and could only say, ""look, a UFO!"" and kept driving. All 4 passengers in my car verified a short while later at a diner that we saw what we saw. I still know one of the people today.

I grabbed my coffee and stood out on the deck of the machine to see better. There were two round lights connected together by an oval shaped light.These lights were much bigger than any star that was in the background so I assumed that it was fairly close or really big. The two round lights were what I would call irradecent.It was hard to nail down a specific color as it constantly seemed to faintly change color. The oval light was more like a pale white light, like from a dim flourecent light. I had shut off the engine of the machine and all was very quiet.After about five minutes of watching I observed the pale oval light that seperated the other two lights begin to get brighter. The lights then moved a good distance, angled upward in a straight line, stopped, moved down in a straight line,at an angle of about 100 degrees or so to the first line, and about the same distance and stopped again.It then took off again at an angle that intersected, roughly, with the original position so that a large triangle pattern was formed by it's movements.The lights were heading, in a northeast direction, into the horizon and faded into the distance within ten seconds or less.Also, like I said, all was quiet around me and not a sound was heard.I've never seen anything like that before or since and this is the first time telling this story in this fashion.

I was dropped off a mile or two from camp, to guard an ammunition dump in a clearing of about 100 yards by 150-200 yards, surrounded by tall trees.  The moon was full and the sky was clear. About 100-200 yards past the treeline, a craft arose in the vicinity of a small lake.  It rose like a helicopter and flew slowly, like a helicopter, yet it was silent and lacked distinctive characteristics of both a helicopter and airplane, like a tail fin, wings, propellers, or safety lights. In the bright moonlight, I could clearly see the entire craft, which was long, possibly oval or round, and tapered towards the tail.  There were three sets of lights in a 120 degree arc around the front of the craft, which appeared to be windows, but may have been headlights.  I was paralyzed with fright and tried not to move, lest be seen.  I slowly turned my head to watch the craft pass by.  After it had passed, I could hear the faint sound of a jet-type engine, however the craft moved far too slowly to be a jet.  There were no runways, from where it took off - it had to come out of the lake.  Having seen many helicopters throughout my training, and ridden in them, I can say without equivocation this was no helicopter.  With the bright moonlight, there is no doubt in my mind this was neither a commercial nor military craft known to the public. Another soldier was posted about 1/4 mile away at another ammo dump. We had agreed beforehand to pick up our field phones at 11:30 to make sure we were both awake. Our exact conversation went: me,""Hey, you there?"" him, ""Yeah"" me, ""Did you see that?"" him, ""Thank God you said that!""  We had both seen the same thing, described the same thing to each other, and agreed we had both seen a UFO. This incident was never reported because our fellow Reservists thought it was a joke we had both concocted and we eventually dropped it.  But to this day, I shudder when I think of it.

We caught sight of this object in the vicinity of an overpass approximately 15 miles east of Coalinga. Initially we saw three lights that were lower in height than the overpass and they appeared to be heading south along the freeway, making a sharp turn to the east.   As we approached the object it had turned around and was heading northwest along the freeway.  At this point we saw strobe lights on each side. It turned around again heading straight for the traffic and we thought that it might be a plane making an emergency landing.   At this point I began to brace for the worst believing that it might crash land into the cars, but it crossed right in front of us just skimming above the cars on the freeway.  I craned my neck around to get a closer look as it passed overhead and to the south east behind us.   It maneuvered incredibly quickly around almost as if it had flipped over (inverting itself),throughout performing extremely tight turns and came back at full speed to make a quick pass overhead again.   At this point I saw two blue strobe lights on its back outer edges.  We were travelling at approximately 65 miles an hour and it kept up right with us.  A number of cars had overtaken us by this time leaving us alone to observe this object.   I had become quite nervous by this time and did not feel safe being around this object.  My brother wanted to stop to take a closer look, but I felt uneasy because of its erratic behaviour and because I did not want to cause any more traffic hazards myself.   The three large round lights that were spaced evenly across the front of the object cast subdued lighting rather than bright headlights.  We estimated the size of the object as approximately four car widths across, having a black (triangular shaped?) main section.

Why I say this is there is no aircraft then or now that could duplicate what unfolded next.The two brillantly red circlular objects appeared to start to vibrate then its hard to explain they started jumping all over the sky back and forth up and down around each other in circles at incredible speeds then as fast as it started they stopped in a blink of an eye side by side just as they had when they rose up from behind the trees.Again I must say there was absolutely no sound while this is going on.As I said earlier no manmade object could duplicate what I witnessed.Then the object on the left started to vibrate again and went from a brillant red to a shimmering orange. I would say the change from red to orange took about 10 seconds and then the object shot straight up into the sky and was gone in one second.Then the 2nd object repeated the same process but didnt go to a brillant orange just a dull orange then it went back to a brillant red and shot at incredible speed climbing into the southeastern sky then stop on a dime. I would have to say at this point it was over 10,000 ft in the air.It then dropped back down a little bit and shot down towards South Meridens markham airport below.I must say I am almost 40 yrs old and I can still see the event as it happened yesterday.The only thing I`m a little fuzzing on is the exact day on which it took place.I do recall that we ran down to my house at the bottom of Sidehill road  all excited telling my parents and their friends what had just happened so they let us call the police station and the local news station to report it.As you can imagine the people on the other end of the phoneline just laughed at me.

I observed and exchanged lights with it on and off for about 20 minutes, as if we were communicating somehow.  At this time the object broke apart or separated and landed behind the school.  I then called the Delaware State Police and reported the incident.  They combed the area by car and helicopter, but nothing was found.  My decription was confirmed by the pastor of the Millsboro St. Mark's church who was en route to a friend's home in Georgetown with his wife.  He kidded his wife that it might be a UFO.

I remember the incident as if it was yesterday.  But in fact it happened 25 years ago.  This is the first time that I write about it, although I have discussed what I saw at the time to family and friends.   I was 24 years old at the time of the sighting and of sound mind and body.  I now discuss what I saw as what I remember and with clear mind, if anyone trys to discredit my story, let it be known that I do not care about anyone else's opinion, I know what I saw.  I was working the second shift at a large automotive assembly plant on a Friday night.  I left work to go skiing for the weekend @ 12:30 am, heading for the North Conway ski area of New Hampshire.   At the time of my departure at work there was a bad rain/ice storm pelting the highway all thru my drive up Rt 495 in Massachusetts, then onwards up following Route 3 north.  Because of the bad weather, I was for the most part the only vehicle on the road.  Proceeding northward all the while the weather continued to be stormy and difficult to proceed.  Once past the state capital of Concord, now traveling on interstate Rt 93 the weather stopped raining/freezing raining.  The cloud cover was billowy but close to the ground.   All of a sudden I saw what looked like an unusual light coming towards me in the sky, below the very low cloud cover directly over the highway.  As this strange light got closer, I began to stop my car, Due to the storm and late time, I was alone on the road.  The light came closer.  Suddenly, over my car what first appeared as a light turned into a multiple sighting.  I counted perhaps 8, maybe 10 objects that were a green neon in color, shaped like what my high school science books used to describe what a while blood corpuscle looks like, only in a glowing neon green. One after another these objects flew over my car in total silence, following the highway, but only up maybe 100 feet in the sky. As they passed over these objects were moving at a resounding speed.  As these objects passed, they all were following one after the other, except for 3 at the end. These three were to one side of the rest.  Looking in my mirror they continued onward and disappeared into the low cloud cover. I distinctly remember seeing the green glow in the clouds behind me as these objects disappeared into the night.  Although it has been a long time that I saw this the image and experience is still fresh in my mind. This is the first time that I document my experience.

It sped by and we went back in the tent speechless. Later, about 1 minute later, another craft but more quieter went by as fast as the other one. We were convinsed this was not a plane.

This is the full and correct information. It was mid August 2000 when my sister and I were looking out my bedroom window during the night, estimated 10:30pm USA eastern time. We watched as a form of lights appeared a few miles out from our view coming from the east. There is an airport in that direction, Stewart International Airport. As it got closer the aircraft was not like a plane. It had more lights and wasn't moving as fast as an airplane does. It started to fly over my house directly and made an extremely loud rumbling noise. The aircraft was octagon shaped and all black. It had a light on each side of it and was moving at about 15 to 20 MPH. It was very low to the ground for an airplane. My house is 40 feet tall plus a TV antenna making a total of 55 feet. The craft was a few feet higher and we ran to the back window to watch it continue on but it disappeared before we could watch it fly over my backyard. We believe it blasted away before we could see it come over the house fully. The craft was 30 feet in diameter (estimated).

It was a cool autumn day, with clear blue skies and no clouds, and lots of sunshine.  There was a bit of wind, as I recall.  I looked up and saw a white puff of cloud appear, like a firework...but there was no sound.   Then, a white hemispherical shape came out of the smoke, with a white/metallic cone underneath it, pointing down, and seemingly separate.   I thought to myself, ""This looks like a model rocket nose-cone with a parachute, I remember making those.""  However, I saw no indication that a model rocket had been launched (they leave smoke trails.)   I slowly realized that this object was actually much larger and further away.   My estimates are that the bowl shape was 100ft across, at a height of 750ft to 1000ft above ground.  I puzzled over why it was hovering in the air.   Then, to my surprize, the cone began to rotate around underneath the bowl shape, clockwise if you were looking up at it from the ground.  It acted as if it were connected to the rim and remained pointing down.  There was a hazy dark cloudy spot between the cone and the bowl shape, like a field of some kind.  The cone spun around at a rate of 3 to 4 times per second. Then, the whole unit turned on its side at right angles to the ground, and proceeded due south at an estimated acceleration of 1000km/s (100 Gs!!!).  The cone continued to rotate around the rim as if attached to the bottom of the bowl the whole time it did this.  It was on the horizon and out of sight in less than 4 seconds.  Then, mysteriously, there was a second puff of smoke where the first had been, as if something closed behind it.  This happened in broad daylight!

It flew approximately 20-30 feet in front of automobile and was in a gradual descent over the road.  The object simply faded out of sight right in front of us.

Found nothing. No one else was around.  We immediately came back with flashlights and searched again.  Found nothing.  Went back the next day and checked the entire area during daylight and found nothing.  What makes this so odd was the apparent size of the object and the fact that we both had a clear, unobstructed view of it right in front of our car, 20-30 feet away.

My girlfriend, daughter and I were returning home from Washington when we saw a bright orange light in the south southeastern sky. At first I thought it was a grain elevator light so we rode around to an open field where the grain elevators are. Then we noticed there were more than one and thought maybe someone was using flares to get help, sometimes boaters use them to signal for help on the Pamlico river and they were orange like flares or fireworks look in the distance. We live near Pinetown, at an intersection on HWY 32 N. called Five-points. It is north of the Pamlico river and north-northwest of Cherry Point MCAS which is in Havelock, and we thought maybe they (marine corp) were doing some type of manuevers there, maybe using multiple flares. We watched and to our amasement, there were three lights, two lights closer together, southsouth east of our position, with one which was further to the west of the first two, directly south of our position. They were orange round lights and they turned, like a lighthouse, they would go out and after 3-4 minutes they would come back around. We were about 5-10 miles as the crow flys north of the Pamlico River and as distance is very hard to judge in the night sky, I would say these objects were at least as far away as the river. They were higher than the tree line but definitely in the southern horizon, not overhead. It put you in the mind of a helicopter with a search light flying in a circle looking for something only they were too high to be a coast guard or police helicopter and be effective and they had no other tail lights, wing lights, or other marking lights of any kind. They didn't do any exceptional manuevers but my 8 year old daughter did get a little scared when the southern one seemed to be getting closer. We observed them a good 15 to 20 minutes. I will not be surprised if this is explained but it was no burning space garbage or meteor, it was some type of aircraft or spacecraft. I would like to know what it was and if anything was seen on radar in that general vicinity at that time. This is no joke.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,35.5805,-77.0127

We both commented about how it must be very large fire because of large glow.   As we headed into Pottsville, we noticed the glow seemingly get larger.  Interstate 40 can be seen pretty clearly from highway 64.  The approximate mile markers on I-40 where my mother and I witnessed event would be between 87 and 88.  As we drove East, we came to an area where the Interstate (I-40)can be seen clearly.  Both my mother and I witnessed what looked like a large ball or sphere of orange light, lift up and over the interstate.  This object was extremely bright.  I estimate it's distance from us at approximately 75 to 100 yards.  I estimate its diameter at about 10-12 feet because it was about the same size in height as the diesel trucks driving under the object.  There is no way the drivers of vehicles on I-40 could not have seen this object.  My mother was driving and I was in the passenger seat in awe of this sight.   She (my mother) slowed the car as we watched this ""thing"". It lifted about 50 to 75 feet off of the ground and then changed color.  Now it was a blinding white color.  It was like looking at someone welding because it hurt to look at it directly.  We had to pull over because we could no longer see how to drive as we were temporarily blinded.  Then we noticed it just blinked out.  As far as we could tell, it was gone.   I asked my mother to get on the interstate at exit 88 heading West to see if there were any burn marks or maybe a car accident in the area.  I could not pursuade her to do that.  There were no other cars on highway 64 at the time of this event that we know of.   I was not sure of what we had just witnessed, so I asked my mom what she thought she saw.  She was shaken, but described everything exactly as I saw it.  We thought it may have been an car accident and subsequent explosion.  We had our windows down about halfway and we heard no blast.  Surely we would have heard something that big and bright no farther than we were from it.   This disturbed me so badly when we got home I reported it to the police.  They did not tell me anything at all, like if someone else had reported it or anything.  They just said they would check it out.  I do not know the exact date or even the month for sure now, as I rarely ever talked about it.  I'm pretty sure it was in early to mid Fall as it was still warm outside and it was Football season.  I remember that because I found out later that day while looking for news of what we saw, there was a story about a cheerleader dying in a bus accident when a diesel truck hit the school bus she was in and he kept going.

I was driving,and my wife was awake in the passanger seat when I told her to look over to the left,but before that I noticed an air craft that resembled a helichopter which dropped a container into the Kanawha river that looked like a parachute, then the container was lifted back up into the air craft.After that I started to slow downand,and also roll my window down to hear the sound of what I thought was a helichopter,but we hear no sound at all,and we were only about 100 yards away.We watched as the air craft moved very slowly behind the trees near the river as I followed it's path,and about 100 yards down the river when it stopped,and we pulled over to the side of the road to a stop. We both looked up just over the trees to a large window shaped object with a bright clear window that had a small bright round red,and green or even a small blue light I can't be sure on the blue light. What was so scary is that it made no sound at all from a very close range,and moved side to side up and down trying to avoid us.

There are usually planes flying in and out of my area going to Dulles, BWI, etc., so seeing air traffic is usual.   However, I saw a bright light illuminate as high as the planes were.  First suspicion was that it was a satellite, or a helicopter.  It was neither unfortunately.  The starshaped light (had vertexes like a star) starting moving to the left very slowly, and then blue and red lights started blinking that were much smaller than the yellowish light, not in unison.   Then the light moved up, and fast to the left and stopped, then went up a little, and then the light transformed into a small ball of light that was not as bright, the blue and red lights stopped, and then it disapeared.  Immediatly following this another starshaped light moved into the scene, and did almost the same movements, but then we saw two objects that looked like planes (because of the lights planes give off) move EXTREMELY fast parallel under the starshaped light and keep on flying past. Possibly fighter jets sent out to investigate or scare off the crafts?  As this was happening we saw no commercial planes, just the lights, and the fighter jets which only went by the scene once.  Then, the startshaped light number 2 disapeared, and for another minute nothing was going on;  then to the far right of the sky another light started, moved to the left, and then went into a ball of light, but not as small as the previous two, and emited a blue misty/cloudy/lightning type string in the sky. The final light went left like the others, stopped, and then vanished but without turning into a ball of light. After this I was shocked, frightened, and positive that these were ufos, and i'm very glad to see that figher jets were sent to make them go away.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,39.14072038404727,-77.20584416543575

I was in my living room & heard a humming noise, so I went out on my front porch & looked up but didn't see anything.  I went back inside & a few minutes later I heard the humming again. Outside at the end of my porch I looked up & there was this object directly over the top of my house.  If I had a 30 foot extension ladder, I could have climbed on board.  It was long,about 75 feet long,with windows, amber colored light coming through the windows. To me,it looked like an office building flipped on its side.  I stood there in awe--spiritually moved by seeing this.  It was just there,not moving,stationary, over top of part my house & part of my neighbor's house to the left. Finally it moved & slowly headed north. What didn't make sense to me afterwards was that I didn't hop in my car & follow it. I just went back inside my house. My sons, who were 9 and 7 years old at that time, had a different story to tell later. They said they were out back playing (it was dark out & they wouldn't be outside that late at night)...and they saw a red beam of light come down from this object.  They got scared and hid in a shed we had in the back yard.  I have no memory of any red beam.  But I was really ""spaced out""...no pun intended.  I was in total awe & amazement! I may have had missing time, I don't know. The only after effect I had was that my hair got kind of thin on the top not long after this happened. I was afraid to report it because I just don't trust our government.  Because this sighting was SO close up...just 30 feet over my head..I can state for a fact it was not a plane or any known vehicle. I mean what kind of object can hover silently right over top of your house? I've had lots of dreams of alien babies after this happened. One time I dreamed that a black helicopter landed in my back yard & I was deathly afraid of it.  The word ""Kraft"" was coming into my mind when I saw it.  I would love to go under hypnosis to see if I could remember more details, but I don't know of anyone who does that. I have a small little bump with a red mark about the size of a B-B on my right shin area.  I've had it for years but don't really know when it appeared.  My Mom had one exactly like it on her leg.  Thanks for your website & all your hard work. I'm listening to you on Coast to Coast right now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

A special event took place on 4th may 1945 at 16.03 when 3 Mustang flying over a very importend german radarstation area Camp ""Lindwurm"" near Fraer, Jutland Denmark as this event took place:  All three pilots mentioned above ((below)) were on their way back to their base in England from a raid in Danish water ""Kattegat"" - but they were on their course crossing a big and very importend ((important)) german military Radar- and listening Camp- codename ""Lindwurm"" - with 6 spec. Radar/listening devices/system were placed among other equiments etc. - I think they all three pilots got very suprised on this spot which looks peacefully - here is the event as I remember it:  On that this very last day 4th may 1945, just 14 hours before the second World War (the german surrender) ended both in Denmark and Germany was on a Friday 4th May 1945 and precisly at 16,03 hours did 3 Mustang Jagerfly IV pass by on crossing Jutland and they were passing by on course 280o. - A schoolboy (((witness name deleted)) - 13 year)  has stopped on the road, when he heard this special  airplane noise which only could come from the allied flights.  The boy stopped on the road, on his way home from school, just outside one of the german Würzbug Reise radar-station - close to the road (30 m) and when he discovered three Mustangs - he signaled to all  3 pilots by waving his arms.  The pilot in front tipped with his wings from side to side back to the boy. On the precisly the same time a german flak open fire on these 3 Mustang IV from ((Squadron # deleted)) Sqdn. (Madras Precidency). All 3 Mustang-flight´s now turned 360o around and back again to fire on this creasy german flak, hidding in on a very small forrest area - Pilot P/O   ((pilot name deleted)) here was hit in his arm, and the aircraft was holed. The  P/O  ((name deleted)) crash landed few  minutes later on an open field,  approx 1 Km east of the city Hornum village,  where he was taken care of and brought to Løgstør Hospital by civilians (local doctor), just before the German army entert the crassing plane. - The German army now went to Løgstør Hospital to capture ((name deleted)) as prisoner, but the hospital cheif/doctor refuse to do it, as he said: ""this patient was in treatment."" - P/O ((pilot name deleted)) soon recovered and was back in Great Britain within 2 weeks time. The schoolboy shortly after that got in serious truble from two germans soldiers, who was stationed at this Würzburg radar, nearby him - they shout, threaten and running after the boy, they want to give him a beating. The boy jump on his bicyckle as fast as he could away home. A very special event toke place as those 3 Mustang turning 360o around to fire back on the flak. Than they aprox. after 90o all meet a collered ""grey hat formed object"" hanging in the air - max. 100 m of the ground, without no sound!  When this ""grey hat-formed object"" realize that it now could get in truble, it started at ones away from those Mustangs in direction SSW. When ""the grey hat object"" (a german ""Haunebu"" Vril-7) was on its side marked with a german cross. This object did started with a short heavy noise, a sound as you may imaging comming from many metal dustbins, like rumbling and away was this ""grey hat-object"" as fast as a now a day Jet-fighter.

Note: The special event on 4th may 1945 at 16.13: I would like to get in contact to one or all 3 RAF-pilot who was stationed on Banff Air Base in northern England in may 1945:  Mustang  Jagerfly   ((a/c # and pilot #2 name deleted)) Mustang Jagerfly   ((a/c # and pilot #3 name deleted)) Mustang Jagerfly   ((a/c # and pilot #1 name and birthdate deleted)) All three Mustang on crossing out over Jutland, some flak positions by Mariager (correct pos. was Fraer near Skoerping) opened up fire.

He soon recovered. - Some sources also state that the Banff Strike Wing was ""escorted"" by their Air Sea Rescue Warwicks as well on 4 may 1945. It has later been confirmed that P/O ((pilot #1)) has been killed in Kenya by the ""Mau-Mau movement"" in Kenya sometime between 1952-56. I´m willing to answer any quistions and to your first question I can replay: I did not see this rfz object before the insident tool place becuse my interest was the well knowing noise from this P-51 a noise which we during the 2. WW have heard many time but only at nights and never have seen, now was possible to see in full daylight and this was a exciding moment for me. after following the P-51 around in the air I here for the first time got the wiev of this rfz object there was hanging quit was just after the germans try to shoot the P-51 down and they now turning around very fast- here I got the first look at  the rfz -object. Second question: the rfz did take ofF from its hanging position after the P-51 was in very close contact to this rfz object and the rfz  fly of in the direction SSW south/south/west in high speed possible and my only guess is that it did try to avoid any futher contact. i do hope that my response to your quistions be content sincerely ((witness name deleted)) P.S.--My english is not the best but I hope we understand each other.

Most of all, I would like to know whether you witnessed the object ahead of time, before the P-51's arrived.  Also, I would like to know what happened to it, in the final analysis.  Did it fly off, in order to escape from the P-51's, or did it stay in the same place?   I will enter your description of the incident as a report, and post it to our website in the near future.

At that time was aware of shooting stars, meteors and commets.  I was also aware that satilites and planes cross the sky at night.  Being a farm boy I was also a good observer.  Also I grew up coon hunting at night so I am very comfortable at night and not spooked by things that go bump in the night.  While on the grass looking up the boy next door noticed what at first seemed like a slow shooting star but it was much to slow.  I determined that it was probably a satilite.  The object was no larger or brighter than any of the background stars.  That was all that was normal about this object or light in the sky.  The object was traveling in a east north east direction it was directly overhead.  Our location was almost exactly 45 degrees north.  The object or light moved in a steady striaght track and suddenly took a sharp 90 degree turn (angular not a curve) to the north.  If you held you arm out in front of you and stuck your thumb out the object traveled about the length of your thumb.  Then it took another sharp 90 degree turn to the west and again to the north.

As we crested the hill to the dam, it was hovering over the dam.  The water was high, but not moved by the UFO.  It was very large, shaped sort of like a cowboy hat with a very narrow brim, with a large yellowish ball protruding from the bottom.  The top was encircled by rotating red and blue lights.  It stayed there for as long as we did.  My mom only drove away as I started to get out the car to get a closer look. I was 14 at the time.  It followed us as she very quickly drove along the resevoir.  When it began to follow us it seemed to lean onto its side and appeared more cigar like.

While, I waited I glanced up at the clear colbalt blue night sky. Just above the tree line was this gigantic brightly lite floating ship sitting stationary E to W.   Underneath the hovering silent ship were 25  (cubes or rectangle shaped) smaller craft being off loaded or launched.They seemed to all have bright headlights.  Wow.  The smaller crafts were all flying in different directions N to S, SW, SE, NE, NW.  I decided it was time to continue on to work. When I arrived the  supervisor asked me if I had seen anything unusual in the night sky. Yes. Then he told me we were going to have a crew meeting. After the crew meeting he sd you can go home early. He said we were slow this evening.   I thought thats unusual because we were usually busy after lunch.   As I was driving home I noticed that all the planes were flying very low. There are several airports near by. I thought perhaps the space craft had done something to the flight path.  I arrived home. Everything was prefectly normal. I was watching late night TV.  Suddenly my dog started acting strangely. Her hair was all ruffled up on the back of her neck and she was whining. From the couch I looked out the window and standing on the deck  were 4 or 5 red or orange miltary insigna uniformed males with primate features.Their foreheads were slanted, copper color, they had bushy eye brows, dark eyes,short necks. Their bodies were covered in military uniform. I didn't see their shoes.  I couldn't figure out how they had gotten there on to the deck.   They were tall around 5ft 8. They had a fierce presence. My friend was sitting at my feet growling and whining. Then all was quiet.  Next I was closing the window facing East looking out on the deck, the sun was coming up. My face felt hot, my hair was dirty, my tongue hurt,I had an odd metalic taste in my mouth.I felt fatigued. I was very angry. My dog was laying at an odd angle on the couch. She perked up when I closed the window. Like it was a signal. She wagged her tail and I comforted her.I looked up at the clock and it was very late. I could not figure out why we were still on the couch.  Afterwards, I had difficulty eatting anything from a tin can.   I had to use plastic utensiles instead of metal. I couldn't see shadows when we went walking in the dark. I had to keep the lights on when we were sleeping. I was told not to talk about our adventure.  I wasn't threatened. They definitely told me they were coming back. That they were going to be around. I finally went to a doctor who practices alternative medicine and he told me that I was not alone. I am surviving. There isn't anything I can do about them anyway. My dog died when she was 5 or 6 years old too soon. That was along time ago. Best regards,",2005-09-02T00:00:00,47.5602,-122.2281

rectangle falling turning and flipping end over end,Pendleton,OR,1985-09-01T13:30:00,rectangle,3 minutes,"Occurred : 9/1/1985 13:30  (Entered as : 09/01/1985 13:30) Reported: 7/26/2005 12:53:55 PM 12:53 Posted: 9/2/2005 Location: Pendleton, OR Shape: Rectangle Duration:3 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/045/S45273.html,"rectangle falling turning and flipping end over end Date approximately around 1984-1986, at Fleetwood Enterprises in Pendleton, Oregon. I am thinking it was some time in the late summer at about 13:30 p.m. in the afternoon, and with no wind blowing to speak of. Approximant length of sitting around 3 minutes  While working on a park model trailer just outside and on the North side of the main building, facing south, I happened to glance up and look out of the vent hole in the ceiling, which was just to my left and slightly in front of me while facing south. (The vent hole is a square hole with an opening of approx 32x32 inches) The nearly full moon caught my eye, and as I glanced at it I saw a small box like object falling towards the ground. The object seemed to be falling at a slower rate than you would expect an object to be falling at. Another worker and I went  outside of the trailer to get a better look at the object, which was up in the air about 1000 feet or so and was East by south East of us. While trying to figure out what it was and how it got there. I noticed that it was falling with a precise pattern. The box was a rectangle, which had on one side a reflecting smooth light brown surface, and on the other side was a real dark brown matt or black color. I believe the other four sides were a light brown color. As it was falling it would turn on its axis. If I remember right it was in a clockwise rotation. That is while looking up towards the bottom of it. It would turn three times and then flip end over end, and continue in the same pattern over and over again. You could see the sun reflecting off of the light brown shiny side as it turned. When it got about 500 feet or so from us it leveled off and went into a glide like state, which brought over and passed where we were standing. By now it was about 200 feet up in the air and 150 feet in front of us. It went another 50 feet or so and then made a fairly sharp left turn and headed south across the road and towards the river and high power lines. It passed almost directly over the top of a small C model trailer which was parked next to the road. The trailer was approximately 18 or 20 feet long by 8 feet wide. And the object was pretty close to being the same width and length as the trailer, and looked to be about 3 or 4 feet thick, as I remember. The object passed just above the wires which went over the river. When the object got approximately over the center of the river, it made an abrupt sharp left turn and started up the river. It went for about a hundred feet or so and then stopped. Not wavering up or down or left or right. Then it started to go into a rippling effect, which reminded me of looking at  a stingray from its side. It stayed there for about 10 seconds or so doing it’s rippling and then went solid again (or ridged) and then it stood on end and slowly rose up into the air and turned on its axis again. But this time it did not flip over as it did before when it was coming down. It slowly rose up into the air and slightly drifted south. As it rose up while turning you could see the light reflecting off of the shiny side till it went out of site. It looked like it was heading in the same direction from whence it came. Later while talking about the object with some material handlers, who were on the other side of the building at that time and which did not see the object, were discussing about a weird noise that they heard at the same time as our sighting, which sounded to them like a siren trying to start up over and over again. (I did not hear any sound, because of the dust collector, which was on my side of the building was running and making to much noise to hear anything.) My memory is not to good, but I sat and thought about this for some time, and put down things as I remember them. I have only talked to a few people about it. And have never reported it, For fear of ridicule. (and also didn’t know who to report it to) If some one else has seen something similar I would like to know. Its been haunting me for some time now.

While nursing my infant in her darkened bedroom at night, I observed what I first thought was an aircraft flowing low between hills. I became concerned because it seemed to be a large aircraft, flying very fast at way too low an altitude. I watched as it made a turn to fly against the hillside range above my house. Suddenly I realized that not only was the aircraft NOT flying fast, but it was much smaller than I'd thought. I kept watching and realized that the aircraft was sort of ""floating"" along, not following a direct path, but sort of meandering side to side, and up and down.  Sort of like a ball floating on waves. When I could make out details, I found that it had no particular shape, was sort of ""opalescent"" like a bubble, and seemed to be revolving, but in no particular direction. The strange thing is, when I realized I was not looking at a standard aircraft, I gasped and said out loud ""OH MY GOD!""   The aircraft reacted, sort of stumbling to a half-stop, and then dashing away full speed. I dropped my child into her crib and raced out the door, 3 seconds tops, and it was already out of sight when I got outside. There were no discernable lights on the craft, yet we had no lights that would reflect on the craft, so the lighting must have been interior.  For years I would have a vague memory of that night in the back of my mind, but it was not until my daughters and I saw another strange shape over the San Joaquin Valley and started talking about it, that the memory and all the details of that evening long past came flooding back.

At first I thought the apartment building next door was on fire, then I felt a static electric feeling and the red light covered my body moving from my feet upwards toward my head.  I was paralyzed and could hardly breathe.  It seemed to last forever, but it was really only a few seconds.  After the light got to my scalp it left and the window was dark again.  I was terrified, so I called a friend. I was crying and shaking.  My friend told me it was just a street lamp shining in or the brakes on a car. I was on the second floor of a building that was facing another building.  I was at the end of the building farthest from the road.  I insisted that it wasn't a light from the street, the red light was angled from above my window.  She said that it was just a dream and I was stressed because mid-terms was coming up.  I have never forgotten this light that ""scanned"" my body or the feeling that went with it.   Since that time I have had terrible nightmares of something swooping down from the cieling at me.  When I awake from these dreams, I am usually yelling at them and the swooping things have taken on the form of an object in the room.  I don't remember having any different marks or anything after the light came in, but I started remembering events that I had never remembered before about childhood abuse.   I'm not sure the memories are real, but the feelings that go along with them are very real.  Has anyone else ever experienced anything similar.  I've not told anyone about this incident, other than my friend, because no one would beleive me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I lived in an apartment building's top floor (6th) with my wife and 5 year old daughter at the time.  Our daughter slept in a bed that was in our bedroom. One night (during late hours), I was awakened because I heard my daughter crying.  I sat up on my bed, and to my surprise, I saw a short being with gray skin and large eyes that fit the description of the beings that people report as alien beings. There were two more at each side of my bed as well (total of three). Being that I am also a martial arts expert it was clear that these small beings were no match, at least physically to me. It all happened in milliseconds... I saw my daughter sitting on her bed as well and in the middle of the commotion my wife would not wake up. I felt numbing vibrations aimed at the lower portion of the back of my head. I had the sensation that the sensation was some form of attempt to restrain me. I did not like the scene at all, I was fully awake and not unders what is known as sleep paralysis. I decided to instantly repell the intruders to protect my family as a triggered instinct. It was clear they could not understand or prevent my initial attack but before even touching the closest one to my bed I was incapacitated by a sharp energy shock. It was aimed to my back and delivered instantly to my spinal cord approximately below my shoulder plate bones. I was immobilized falling back into my own bed as I could still hear my daughter cry. These beings surrounded me and were curious as to how I was able to resist their first attempt to shut my motor functions down. I was scared and unable to move. What was more, listening to my daughter cry in fear was the worst experience in my life yet. Everything faded and I have a partial recolelction of being inside a large oval metallic craft with other people in there as well. They appeared to be awake and yet out of it, simply sitting and waiting for 'nothing'. I tried to communicate with the 'crew members' and with my peers but I do not remember anything after that. I woke up the next day on my bed, I was fully aware of what had transpired and my child kept asking me who were the little men in the room last night. She drew their pictures, my wife and I told her it was just a dream to minimize her fear but I know all too well what really happened. Who do you call in these matters?

I was working one night at Indian Creek Correctional Center in Chesapeake, Va.  I was a Correctional Officer on duty, roving the outer perimeter that evening.  There was an air field near-by, where the military practice there training.  I do recall the military operating that evening, before I seen the bright lights in the sky.  It was approximately 1:30 a.m. when the military completed there training operations.  It remained silent that night, after the jet noise had stopped.  It was approximately 2:00 a.m. when I seen these bright lights hovering in mid-air, over a group of trees, near a open field adjacent from the compound.  The lights went from a dim sparkling light, to a bright strobe light.  The colors around the object where like the marvelous colors of a rainbow, but prettier.  In the center of the object was a white/bright blue light, almost like a welders arc.  These lights where changing colors rapidly!  My first reaction when I seen these bright lights, I took it as if it was just a military airplane at first. I said to my self, ""Wait a minute, that can't be an military aircraft because it is not moving at all!""  So I immediately stopped roving, to make sure if what I saw in the sky was still a military jet.  To my knowledge, it did not appear to me as an airplane.  The cluster of lights where hovering in mid-air over the tree line.  I immediately put my truck in park, I took out my binoculars so I could get a better view of this object hovering amongst the trees.  As I proceed to look through my binoculars, there was an aura around the floating light.  I got on my radio, and asked the officer in the watch tower to step out onto the catwalk to confirm what I saw.  We both came to the conclusion, that it was not a military aicraft, so it had to have been something else.  The lights remained in the sky for about ten minutes or so, then it disappeared. This is not the first time I've seen something like this. I've seen green lights from the sky.  It started in 1997 and it still goes on now.  (green lights 1) The first time, was when I drove across the Campostella Bridge one night heading into Norfolk, Va. and out of no where this green flash of light lit up the night sky like it was daytime. It knocked out some power in the area. I thought it was just a flash of lightning, but there was no thunder following the powerful flash. I remember the clouds where really low that night, and the rain was misty.  (green lights 2) The second time, was when I went to visit my mother in Virginia Beach. The time was 8:00 p.m. it was cloudy that night as well. I remeber that it was raining that night, the rain was misty and the wind was blowing kind-of  mild. I was getting out of my car about to knock on the door, then out of no where this green light flashed for 2-3 seconds over my mothers house. I felt as if the flash of light had frozen me where I  stood and this warm sensation just went through my body.  My sister said she seen the same light one night, she asked me what it was.  I couldn't give her a answer, but I got a good Idea what it may be. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It appeared to be a perfectly shaped sphere: Blue in color, but like shiny metal at the same time. The object made no sound and went from horizon to horizon in seconds making no noise.  At the speed it was going you would think that even a sonic boom or something would have been heard.  We talked about it all day that day. The Sat, July 27th, 2002, in the afternoon my friend that witnessed it with me brought me a news clip from the ledger stating that 2 Jets chased mystery object over Washington on Friday July 26th 2002 describing what we'd seen to the T.  It freaked me out something serious.   Believe it or not, I still have the news clip as to never forget what I saw that early morning.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,28.2321,-81.8115

Have been involved with meditation's and various Shamanic work also.  I see this experience as spiritual in nature.  As natural as any other. I also feel honored to have had this experience. I had been on a raw food only diet for a week, no alcohol, no medications, etc. and for the past three day's before the sighting had attended a seminar which had a profound affect on my consciousness. A few hours before the sighting, at the end of the seminar, something happened to my awareness. This must be explained in detail to make sense. I am willing to do that if need be. Anyway I was in an amazing state of bliss. It was something I had never experienced. As I returned home at dusk, after the seminar's completion, I went up to my apartment in Newport Beach, California. As I walked into my place a voice said softly in my ear, ""Go out to the balcony""(second floor). It was not strange to hear this voice in the state that I was in and I slid open the door and went out. The sun had gone down and immediately off to my far right was a ship slowly moving in my direction. John Wayne airport is off in the distance and I remember even seeing, as is the case regularly, a distant plane flying out. I knew immediately this was no airplane, jet or anything else I had ever seen. And it was so close. The ship's details were not clear because it was getting towards dark and the light was not hitting it in front of me. As it moved at about 10-20 mph from a quarter mile away at my right to directly in front of me it was between 500 and 1000 feet from me...right over the parking garage next to my complex. It stopped right in front of me...as if to say hello (that's the feeling I had).  And within 10 seconds of stopping flew off at a 45 degree angle upwards at incomprehensible speed.  It was gone from view in 2 seconds. When the ship was stopped in front of me...I looked down breifly and there were the usual people walking in and out of the large apartment complex but none of them were noticing this craft.  My estimation was it was the size of a football field.  It was circular with noticeable, but undefined, multi-levelled sides.  There were also dim auburn colored lights at a few places on it's side.  Or this may have been the after-sunset reflection. This is the only time I have seen a UFO.  I believe my ability to witness this craft was because of my raised level of consciousness(via an intense seminar, etc). My theory being ""I met them halfway"".

At about 9am, as I was getting ready to start the day, I approach the window next to the bed and noticed a large cigar shaped object hovering over the area.   I was actually looking to the belly of the object.  At arm's distance, the object was about 6 inches and it had no features such as tail fins that could be seen.  At the beginning I thought that it was some kind of cruise missile that was being tested, but that was impossible.  I noticed that the object did not produce a jet or propeller noise at all.  The object then proceeded to make a 180-degree turn and immediately went back to the direction where it first came from, at the same low speed, until it was no longer visible from my window.

What I saw caused a heart-racing thrill: Totally silent, a large, dark craft in the shape of a grid-like array (grid reminded me of iron pipework) was floating slowly toward the north over our house. It was low in the sky, about 800 feet up in the air, silent as I said, and in motion, as if it was carried on a breeze. It had no lights. I only estimated its shape by the pattern it took in blocking out starlight above it. I watched it for about thirty seconds, then got scared and went in the house.

His (friends)folks had a camper in the back yard for sell and he was showing it to me.We had walked out of the camper(in back yard)in around his house.I don't remember who saw it first, him or me.But right over our heads,not sure how high it was or true size.But you could see it perfect because of the moon light,and clear sky.At the time I was about 17.I had always been interested in UFO stuff.Well,we both had our heads straight up looking at this.It was a black shape pyramid.Square on the bottom(4 side) and came to a point with 4 side,just like a floating pyramid.I seen it and freaked.Raised my arms in the air toward it and tried to talk with it in my mind to see if I would get any mind talk back,or to show them I see them.My friend said what are you doing and I told him seeing if they talk back.He said put your arms down and was scared.We watched it for maby 5 minutes just float on by in a what seemed to be straight very very slow path.We walked away from his house to keep watching it as it just floated over the roof tops,guessing 100 feet up?.It went over(guessing)25 houses and then it made sparks.The whole time it made no noise,had no lights,and just looked like it floated.Then befor it took off it made sparks,small little balls of fire.It looked like some one had dumped coles out of a out side grill.Thats what the sparks/fire, looked like from under it.From our view point. That always made me think maby it is us(secert stuff)and not UFO.Then after the sparks it shot straight up at a angle to the sky.Then it looked like a star and think it made 2 more angle turns befor you could not see the star looking light it had made.We ran in and told his folks and they did not come out or anything so quess they had no interest.We tried to find a camara to go back out and watch for anything elce but he had no film.When we went back out and looked we had seen 2 quick star like lights that had looked just like the thing we had seen after it took off.But that was maby a 2 sec. deal.Well I really don't know what to think as far as real UFO or not.The sparks it made befor taking off just seemed not right for a real UFO??

It was trully awesome! My girlfriend and I were driving home to San Luis Obispo from Chico California on day and spotted something flying in the sky a quarter of a mile ahead of us. We were headed south-bound on highway 5 parallel to the city of Patterson, Ca. The sun had just gone down and there was still light out when we noticed a flying object over the highway headed toward us. It had flashing lights on it and its movments resembled that of a helicopter..at first. The object began to descend from above the highway of north-bound traffic into an area over an aquaduct. I turned my head to see where the flying object was going. The flying object stopped when it was parallel to us and changed course, flying at the same speed as us. When I finally caught a good look at it, I realized it was not a helicopter at all, but an obscure shape with lights rotating around it. It was a wierd sight. I didn't know what I was looking at. I intended it to be a helicopter, but it was not. My girlfriend was shocked. She pointed at the object with her mouth open and her eyes wide with awe. Her harm blocked my view of the road, so I slowed down to about 45 miles per hour. I turned my head again, and examined the flying object further. I realized at that moment, next to our car was a FLYING DISK with two RINGS rotating around it, one ontop of the other. The Craft was comprised of an approximately 25-30 foot long disk with the color of gun-metal silver. The shape was not round, but more oval in its length-wise, with a rounded off pointy tip. At the end of the disk was a smaller disk apparatus of the same color. Its length was appox 10-12 feet. After seeing this I slowed down the car to roughly 25 miles per hour. The Flying Aircraft then began to speed up and rise into the sky. It flew above the northbound highway and stopped in mid-air appox 200 yards ahead of us. My girlfriend was panicking. The Flying Disk then began a perfect diagonal decent to an area above the south-bound highway 5. I remember the crafts movments were so perfect, as if the craft was in another world, uncontrolled by gravity. The movments it made, made me sick to my stomach. They seemed very unnatural to me. I began to cough. After the diagonal shift downwards to the side of the road, the craft stayed there for a moment and then made a perfect upward movement approximately 35 feet straight up into the sky. (I am sorry, this experience is very hard to describe). We were driving very slow and there was no traffic infront of us. A few cars could be seen in my rear-view window, but they were about a half mile behind us. There were oncoming cars going northbound, but they were atleast 3 quarters of a mile away. Then the Flying Disk with rotating Rings made a perfect opposite movement towards the ground. Its movements were that of a mouse icon on a computer. It moved very unnaturally and fluidly. I slowed the car down to approx 15 miles per hour and we watched as the Flying Disk hovered above a grassy hillside. My girlfriend scrammbled for her disposable camera she brought with her on the trip. There was still light out, so the whole examination of the Flying Disk was unobstructed. I noticed its shiney body, and rings that had becons of lights on them. It was a marvel to whitness. It was the most awesome piece of machinery I have ever seen. This is when, under further examination, I noticed that the rings were huge metal looking apparatuses rotating around the disk. But there was something I could not intend to fathom, they were not connected to the craft by any bars, cooks, anything physical. The first ring closest to the Flying Disk was rotating at a 45 degree angle to the ship. The second ring rotated around the first ring 45 degree's to the ship counter to the first ring. This was trully an amazing sight. After about 10 seconds, of examination, we were parallel to the Flying Disk. This is when I began to rise upwards about 20 feet straight up. Again its movements, made me feel ill-at-ease. After rising approximatly 20 feet, a bright light lit up from beneath it. It permiated the ground and I saw dried grass sparkling underneath. I was trully in awe. Again, I was shocked by something that could not be intended by modern physics. The light was not attached to the aircraft by a light bulb. The light (similar to that of a hallogen) began from a point approximately 5 feet below the craft. It was as if it was a hallogram or something. Whatever the craft was doing, it was obscured by its awe-inspiring looks and movements. We kept our speed and moved on until the Flying Disk was out of sight behind us. A mile ahead we saw a police car in the middle of the north-bound highway with its sirens on. The police car was traveling approximately 5 miles per hour and was evidently there to stop traffic from passing. Every light I saw for the next 145 miles, I thought it would be another Flying Craft, the same Craft that I saw before. For a least a month I tried to explain to people what I saw. But the words would not come out of my mouth as I intended to voice them. I was completely spellbound by the awesome sight of that strange Flying Disk with Rotating Rings around it. The object made no sound. A detailed drawing of the becons of light, shape of aircraft, can be offered upon request. My girlfriend was unable to find her disposable camera, which was later found just beneath her feet under the passenger seat.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,37.49570000000001,-121.2546

It was hovering over us and kept on going west, but it lasted about 30 minutes and just dissapered in the sky.   The whole thing was black and had no tails like all the other airplanes do.

I was traveling west on Forder Rd. in St.louis, Mo on August 31st, 2005 at approximately 11:35. As i was driving, I noticed an object traveling across the road at a very low and smooth pace.  My first thought was that it was a helicopter, but as i approached the object, it became very clear to me that it was not.  With the object not more than 200ft from me and my windows down, you would think, had it been a helicopter, the sound of rotating blades would be more than enough to assure me it was in fact a helicopter.  The bright object which consisted of very familiar colors (red, green, and white) where blinking in a consecutive pattern which in someways was reasurring me it must be something of human construction. But as the object continued to move and i traveled closer, the shape appeared to be disc-like. I know this sounds very typical and familiar, but this is what i saw. The object continued to move in a northeast direction and as it slowly disappeared over the tree line, i made a quick right turn onto Lemay Ferry Rd. which put me in the perfect line of sight to see an object that had just flew over the tree line and all i saw was an empty sky.

On 9/02 my sister and I were on the Princess Regal cruise ship in route to Tracy Arm Alaska.  We had an outside cabin and were on the XXth deck of the ship room # xxx to be exact.  My sister had gotten up to use the restroom and then went to the window to look out.  She immediately woke me up and told me to hurry and come to the window to see what she was seeing.   There were 5 to 6 balls of light maybe 10 to 15 feet from our window that were just hovering and following the ship.  It was very dark out that night and these balls of light were very brigt, gold in color, and had a haze or aura around them.   We stood there for 15 minutes or so just mesmerized by what we were seeing.  They were in groups of 5 or 6 and we saw one shoot straight up and over the ship, it was faster than anything I had ever seen.  They just seemed to hover and then would disperse rapidly, then would reappear again.  We could see smaller ones further out just above the water.   On one of the balls of light we saw a triangular tail appear, it looked transparent, but you could see the outline of it, and then it just shot off and left a vapor like trail.  We called the front desk after that and reported what we had seen, but they had no answer of what it might have been.   The next day the Naturalist on the ship called us and we explained to him what we had seen, but he had no explanation.  I was looking at the other reports, and low and behold there was another reporting from someone in Aug. 2004 that was on the Regal Princess cruise ship that had reported seeing glowing objects from there balcony.  They were lucky enought to be able to take a couple of pictures of the objects because they were outside, unfortunately we were not lucky enough to get any pictures of what we saw.   But because these were sighted by another person in 2004 aboard the same cruise ship and in the same area as where we were at, I am convinced that what we saw was not from this earth.  We looked out on 2 other nights at around the same time and we never saw them again.  So maybe these are seen out at sea between the route from Juneau to Tracy Arm Alaska.   I would love to hear from anyone else that has seen these objects or anything similar, and would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

She locked the doors, and then called my Aunt who lived 1/8 of a mile away, as well as an Uncle who lived the same distance away.  All had children, and to listen to my Grandmother talking on the phone, it was obvious that everyone also saw what we were watching.

It was coming toward where I was watching it out the window and it was really moving.   At first the movement of it really puzzled me because it was going back and forth advancing toward me until I realized that it was in a zig zag motion horizonally while flying.  Then the object streaked out of the window space while making a sharp turn toward the west where I lost sight of it.   I burst out the back door and caught a very quick look at it as it went through the sky at an incredible speed through a break in the trees. This object crossed a large part of the sky in just a blink of an eye and made absolutely no sound.  No plane or jet could do that back then or now and be lit up like this thing was.   Of course I just happened to be passing the window when I saw it but since it made NO sound my family, who were outside at the time, missed it completely because there was no reason to look up.

The UFO's I saw were at night and can best be described as orange-white lights that moved in a fixed formation.  They would shift the shape of the formation and move about very quickly in a tight area in the distance. They were silent.   Suddenly they moved away from us until they disappeared over the moutains.  Every person that was witness that night was graduating from Morehead State that week.   Anytime two or more of us get together the first topic is the night we saw the UFO's.  The incident was reported the next day to Wright Patterson in Dayton.

This sighting may have been in the police officer daily report. We had stopped at a local party store on Highway US127 that runs north/south through the town of Hudson. I looked up and sighted a cigar shaped craft directly over the highway. The craft was at a low altitude probably below 500 feet.  The sun was just beginning to set and was to our backs, the craft was a little to the east of us and you almost had to luck straight up to see it. We observed port holes and you could see lights inside the windows. The craft did not move.  A Hudson police officer who was in the store came out and was about to get in his car and my mother got his attention about the cigar craft. The officer was stating he had not seen anything like it and did not know what it was that we were observing. It was getting darker and the cigar shaped craft was starting to blend with the dark sky and by now all you could see as far as lights was the window lights. I can't remember how many windows there was but more than 3 windows and they were in a row toward the bottom of the craft.  It had no anti collision lights of any kind on this cigar shaped craft.

While driving along, approx 10 or 11 pm, I-5 was pretty deserted, it was the middle of the week.  I noticed a car pulled over to the side of the shoulder, and then a few hundred feet further another car pulled over to the side of shoulder.  The passengers of this second car, two people, a male & female were standing in front of their car with a flash light pointing it straight up towards the sky and turning it off & on, like they were signaling to something.   I thought what the heck are these people doing???  I slowed down and had to lean over the wheel and look up to my right to see what they were signaling to.  Once I saw, I immediately pulled over to the side of road also.   I pulled over about maybe 15 or so car lenghts in front of this car and immediatley turned off the engine and lights and then began to watch the object.  The object was to the right of my car, approx five or six car lenghts off the shoulder and then approx about a telephone poll and half up into the sky.  I can't measure real well in approx feet which is why I'm using objects to describe this.   The object that I saw was so close to me and so close to the ground but yet it just hung there, no sound or vibration at all, absolute silent, and very, very, big. I am very hesitant to give all the details over the internet however, I will say that in looking over your site I found one VERY close and similar incident which follows -          Occurred : 7/17/1996 01:35 (Entered as : 07/17/1996 01:35)  Reported: 1/17/2004 4:37:11 PM 16:37  Posted: 1/22/2004  Location: I-5 (Firebaugh Exit), CA  Shape: Diamond Duration:15 min  What I saw, and I know the other two people saw as well , was a triangle of lights. Becasue this incident was so close to me there was absolutly no mistaking what I saw.  I know that this was a craft of some sort, however, not something of our world.  I'm no expert but I feel very confident that planet earth does not possess the capabilities to do what this craft did.  Additionally, the entire time I watched this object I had the very distinct and real feeling that someone, or some thing,  was watching me back.  I'm posting this today becsue of the sighting that I referenced above.  This happened to me at approx the same area.  I was just about 2 or 3 miles from the Firebaugh exit on I-5.  After viewing this object, which eventually traveled straight up into the cloud covering and disappeared, I immediately drove to the first gas station there at the Firebaugh exit and phoned my mother to tell her what had just happened. This experience happened to me in 1987 almost ten years ago, however, I remember every detail as though it happened ten minutes ago.  I would like an investigator to contact me if at all possible as this experience bothers me a great deal.  I simply can not forget it.

The Odenwald was right outside our fence, and our barracks was 20 feet from the fence. Our unit was ""in the field"", so there was no ""lights out"", and we were playing pool.  Between 22:00 and 00:00 we noticed small white Christmas tree-like lights flickering in the tree tops and started watching them, curious (not constantly).  We then noticed the balls wouldn't go in the pockets right. They sort of veered away a little. We all thought something peculiar was going on but had no idea what.  I started getting the feeling of being watched and mentioned it.  At least one other person had a similar feeling. It was really bothering us and we had a new guy, just seventeen, that it was really freaking out.  I can't remember exactly, and the date and time of day are estimates. I imagined whatever it was could read our minds and I must have been thinking UFO because I thought telepathically to whatever it was to leave before that guy freaked out completely and contact me after I got back home.  The odd feeling subsided and I went to bed. A little after laying down I had the sensation of being sucked out of my body. The legs part of me felt like they were at a right angle to how my physical body was laying in the bed and my shoulders and head were still in.  I had learned before to fight fear by concentrating on something else, and that's what I did. I'm not saying I wasn't afraid that much. I was overwhelmed and consumed by raw fear. But I noticed it made me weaker in the fight against whatever it was, so I conentrated on a girl I knew and the feeling subsided and I was able to get up.  I was afraid to try to sleep then, so I went back up to the pool table and wanted to wait until daylight to try to sleep. A while later I went up to the fourth floor to a friend of mine's room and looked out the window just in time to see an oval shaped object take off out of the top of the trees. It was a fiery orange in color.  I had been in that woods many times and there is no swamp or water within miles. There is a large clearing a few hundred yards from our fence so it might have been sitting there.  I never told anyone about seeing the UFO until I got home out of the Army. I talked to a guy that was there a few months ago and he still remembers the lights in the trees and the rest of it, but he says he didn't see anything take off.  I never saw another one, but I had many bad experiences for a few years after that that I think were related to it. And I heard one landed about two miles from where I lived about a week after I got home.  About two or three years ago my mother told me that my brother would see two guys sitting in a car parked at the end of our driveway when he got up for school in the morning. What's funny is she doesn't remember that at all now.  I wouldn't suggest anyone asking them to contact you later. I never thought of myself as being psychic at all before that, but that really changed.  Incidentally, I saw the same thing in Indianapolis that was reported on your site under Indiana - Lafayette - on 4/16/05, but it was around December '05, and it kept splitting and going back to one over and over.  I've had the sense from time to time that some of ""them"" are actually very friendly but I'm not interested.",,,

It had just turned Easter at the time of the sighting. I watched the craft go down the street untill it vanished into the darkened sky. I felt totally in awe seeing and watching the craft. I dont use drugs or drink and am a professional artist with 5 years of college training in the arts. I went back to my apt and told my roommate of the sighting and he laughted in my face, eventually I told my parents and they as well thought I was nuts. I was 27 at the time of the sighting.

The sky was hazy and white to light gray. Temperature was about 75 degrees Fahrenheit. It was a pleasant day. I was cutting small branches off of my pine trees which sit on either side of my sloping driveway. As I looked up and to my left I saw a large object flying over the street. The object was banking hard to the right. Very strongly and quite loudly I shouted:""What the hell is that, what the hell is that, what the hell is that?"" I dropped my shears and ran diagonally across the street to the space between the houses. The object was still banking very hard to its right and flew across the street to my left and over a house to my left. It was at an altitude of about 60 feet and moving slowly right above the tree tops. I arrived between the two houses across the street just as the object was directly behind the houses and flying parallel to the houses. At this point the object was almost overhead. The object was light brown with some black shading. The object was approximately 7 to 8 feet wide at the bottom and five feet wide at the top. The object was approximately 12 to 13 feet tall. The object made no sound. There were no lights on the object. There were no markings. There were two tubes coming out of the bottom of the object. These tubes were approximately four feet long. One tube was straight. The other tube was straight and then kinked at about 45 degrees three feet from the bottom of the object. The tubes were about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. The object seemed to be covered with scales or tiles and you could see through the object near the top, about 12 inches from the top.  By this time I called very loudly for my wife. She came outside. I was across the street between the two houses and told her to go and get my binoculars (7x50). She returned a minute later and said she could not find my binoculars. Very determined I said to her, ""Go find my binoculars.""  Finally my wife came running across the street with my binoculars. I ran back to the street and watched the object continue to fly above the tree tops. It seemed to go up and down to stay right above the tree tops as it flew away. I watched the object through my binoculars for about 10 minutes until it became a speck in the binoculars.  Then 4 golden disks appeared around the speck and in a moment the disks and object disappeared. The sighting lasted about 15 minutes,(4 to 5 minutes without binoculars and about 10 minutes with binoculars.)  I sketched or drew a diagram of the object on Monday, 18 June 1990. This was the day after I sighted the flying object. Now 15 years later (27 June 2005), I have Xeroxed my sketch at a magnification of 4x and then scanned this very same hand-drawn figure electronically into a computer ""JPEG"" file. I have submitted my sketch on a diskette by U.S. Mail and also by Email.  I am very familiar with USAF aircraft. Kettering is located about 9 miles from Wright-Patterson AFB. So I have seen all kinds of military aircraft and civilian aircraft fly over Kettering Ohio over the past 32 years. The object I saw was not an AF aircraft. The object was not an unmanned AF reconnaissance aircraft. The object had no wings or air foils. The object was not a civilian aircraft. Over the years several ultra-lights have flown over our home and neighborhood. The flying object I saw was not an ultra-light aircraft.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

I lived, at the time, in an apartment complex on Jackson Keller, overlooking West Avenue. I lived on the 3rd floor of a building that was situated on a hill, so I estimate I was about 50 feet above the ground, with the treetops just below my balcony, facing due east. I know because the sun would rise directly in front of me. Off my balcony is an empty field and next to that is a local private school and a residential area.  I owned a telescope, so I often would be on my balcony at night looking at stars, and I was familiar with the positions of constellations and planets, knowing their relative positions at any given time at night, or season.  This one night I was on the balcony, and decided to train my telescope on a portion of the sky that I often did.  As I looked for a bright object to observe, I noticed a perfectly circular cluster of ""stars"" that I hadn't noticed before. I knew it wasn't Plaiedes... though they were roughly as bright as the stars in that constellation. It was circular, and after realizing I hadn't seen it before, I continued to look at it, and realized the points of light were following each other in a pattern. It was rotating.  After about 30 seconds of watching it, one of the points of light circled the others, then exited the cluster from the center, and accelerated away from the others. Soon after, they all seemed to diminish in brightness until they were all gone.  I was certain they were moving, and it wasn't the illusion of movement that one gets when they stare at an object in the sky for a long time. I have noticed this phenomenon before, and I was careful to make absolutely certain I was not seeing things. I have seen simple satellites or space debris streaking across the sky before, and this behavior was not reminiscent of that.  Some time later, I saw an episode of Unsolved Mysteries that featured a couple that had taken a video of the same thing I saw that night.

This is a big sloppy coverup if there ever was one. Todd Sees the victim, lived at the foot of Montour Ridge,a mountain stretching over 20 miles east. Todd Sees went up the mountain to look for pre-season deer.  He told his wife that he would be home by noon.  He rode his 4 wheeler up the powerline behind his home  at a little after 5:00 in the morning. Noon came and no Todd, his wife and children became concerned,at 2:00 a search party was organized, local police, state police, paramedics ,and 200 volunteers helped search for Todd Sees. The 4 wheeler was found on the top of the mountain near a powerline,tracking dogs could find nothing to go on around the 4 wheeler.  The search went on for 2 days over 6 miles of mountain were covered ,from top to bottom.  Todd vanished with out a trace,the 4 wheeler was keep in mind ,2 miles from his home at the foot of the mountain.  A pond a few hundred yards from the house was even searched by skin divers just so they overlooked nothing.  Dogs were over the whole area constantly no results,no trace, Then in the evening of the 2nd day something white was spotted in a large brushy area 25 feet from the pond,police and rescue workers spent 20 minutes cutting and hacking, brush and small trees so they could reach what looked like a body.  It was Todd Sees, he was wearing his underware, he was emaciated, not, bloated, he was white, he had an expression of horror on his face.  When he went up the mountain he was fully dressed,boots camo vest, hat, socks, pants,. The F.B.I. showed up with in 30 minutes, they took charge, they would not let the wife look at her dead husband, no matter how much she tried. The F.B.I. asked questions around the area, neighbors, mostly farmers, 3 farmers on one farm said they saw a large round bright object, just above thje powerlines, At the time of the disappearance, it was silent, it did not move fora bout 10 to 15 minutes.  It suddenly went up and suddenly stopped,a light shined down and something was pulled up into the light.  It then went straight up, hesitated again then went west over the Susquehanna River and out of sight. A police friend of mine said after 2 autopsys nothing was found, a toxicology test revealed nothing, no visible cuts or bruises any where except from the brush.  Now the body is at Allentown, from there it is going to Fort Indiantown Gap, Pa. The wife was told she cannot have the body for 6 to 8 weeks.  A boot was found a mile from the 4 wheeler a few days ago at the top of a tree, it was his.  I notice military copters have been scouring the mountain ever since at least once a day.

Myself and my mom decided we would just hang around for little while longer since it was so nice outside.   I then questioned her about the ""North Star"". We were looking around for it and I spotted this bright light in the sky.  I thought that it was the ""North Star"" because they say that it is the brightest star or whatever.  But as I watched it, it didn't ""twinkle"" like all the other stars seem to do.   As both my mom and I watched this bright light it began to move. Now it didn't move fast like most UFO sightings claim and it wasn't an odd shape it looked like a very bright star.  But it started to move very very slowly back and forth.  It moved left to right in kind of a dipping motion. Then it started to increase in size and brightness as if it were getting closer. I started to get a little nervous and started to back away but my mom was fascinated and remained there.  Then very slowly the light got very small and became very dull, barely visible. Then after a while it got larger and brighter again. Then all of a sudden it decreased in size very very quickly and it disappeared. It was as if it shot out of the galaxy.

I almost felt as if the globe knew i could see it and it were mocking me.   I called my then girlfriend on the phone and talked to her as it was occurring.

It appeared to be situated in the stars yet closer if that makes any sense. It paused for only two or three seconds and then left so fast I guess I would only describe as up and it was gone in about one second.  I sat there and knew that this was not man made.

If it was 200 feet off of the ground, it must have been a quarter mile wide, as it took up most of the sky, and if it was higher it was even bigger. As far as speed goes, it went from one horizon to the other in approx. 2 seconds, which is staggering considering it was a clear night, and the craft made absolutely no sound.  Again, if it was higher, it was even faster.   A minute later, an identical craft flew the same route, which means there ware two identical crafts or the first craft made a circle. Everyone in my group saw the exact same things. About 15 minutes later we noticed spotlights in the sky, and military aircraft circling the skies. This continued for a few hours and then stopped. we reported the incident to the state police who told us we were not the first to call regarding the incident.

My dad stopped the car in the middle of the street . There were no other cars in sight . The craft slowly flauted over our vehicle and into a yard where it floated over the top of a tiny house . I didn't know what to do . I was screaming telling my dad to go because I didn't want to get abducted !!! I thought it was going to blow that little house up !!!

There were red & white lights on the front of the ufo, about 15 or 20 lights going across. They would flash at different speeds, from one end to the other.  So you would see a red light flash on the left side, then a white light next to it, then a red and so on..... there was absolutely no noise from the ufo, then I noticed another one in the distance, with the same type of light pattern, and then another one flying from another direction.  On the other side of the road behind me, there were many trees, so when a ufo flew that way, I could not see it anymore.  So when a ufo would come from over the trees in that direction, I could not say if it was the same one I just saw minutes ago, or if it was another one.  The most I saw in the sky at any one time was 7.   My best guess is that they were flying no higher than a 15 story building.  One flew right over me, and from underneath it seemed to look like a glowing egg.  The only unusual movements were two ufo's that were flying straight towards each other, instead of colliding, one of them stopped over the top of the other one, after about 10 seconds? the one on top suddenly backed upwards at a 90 degree angle.  After 30 - 40 minutes, one by one they turned off all the lights (red & white) and then a single glowing orange light came on. They started to 'park' over the delaware river.  It looked like a constellation once they had all parked (7 ufo's)  So after awhile I figured the show was over and that I should go home and tell my wife,  well I crossed the river into new york state, and after less than 5 minutes driving I saw another ufo with the same red & white lights as before.  So I pulled over to look at it, and it turned out there was a company located there, as I drove into the parking lot, I stopped my car and called 3 people over, saying do you know what's flying out here, the one guy with a girl, said it could be an airplane and left, the guy who stayed, I told him it was flying right over us and didn't make any noise.  Then I told him it was going to 'park' where those orange lights were, because now I was on the opposite side of the river from where I was before.  The ufo parked with the other orange lights that looked like a constellation, and the guy said ""as long as they're not coming to get me""  He then left abruptly.  This was a Friday night, June 2002.  I could figure out the exact date because the newspaper on the new york side 'the times herald record' had a front page story a couple days after my mass sighting.  It was a story about a guy who took 15 minutes of daytime video footage of a ufo.  The original spot for the sighting was a self storage business on route 191, just over the border (about 3 minutes) from Hancock, New York.  There are almost no companies on the new york side of the river (route 97) so it was very unusual to pull off the road suddenly and actually be in a company parking lot with people, usually it would just be trees & deer.  This location here is about 50 miles northwest of pinebush new york, which is suppose to be the most popular spot for ufo sightings on the east coast of america.

On 4:10am, me and my dad saw this UFO flying slow and at a low altitude, it was too slow to be a comet, so i took my camera and took a picture, but i never developed the camera, so i dont know if i got the UFO on a picture. What i noticed about this certain UFO was that it was diamond-shaped with lights surrounding the edges, then all of a sudden the UFO split into 7 pieces and fused back together.

PD)) ((TEXT OF COVER LETTER TO REPORT; LETTER SUBMITTED BY DAUGHTER OF WITNESS))  March 21, 2005    Peter,   Enclosed is my Dad’s written report of his 1925 sighting.  (I have the original.)  I have not edited it in any way.  Nor did I discuss it with him to tell him what to put in it.  This is his unadulterated version, in other words. He still won’t agree to be interviewed by anyone, and wants to remain anonymous.  So, if you have questions, I guess I’m your source.  You can ask me, and I’ll ask him.  Sorry, that’ll have to do. This occurred in Henry County, Illinois.  Number ""6"" on the map is where Dad was standing.  (I understand the map, while it won’t make sense to you.)  It might help your understanding that, as Dad has previously told me, he was standing on a ditch bank that was higher than the field the ""craft"" went across when it left.  It seemed to be low over the field and had to go up to clear the hill and neighbor’s barn that was on the hill on the other side of the field.  In other words, it didn’t streak across the sky.  The barn it cleared when it left was on the neighbor’s farm, not the barn where Dad was. He previously mentioned an ""odd"" sound of a low hum, or buzz. Please don’t use my name, either. Hope this helps. Signed,  ((name deleted))   ((END LETTER))    ((HANDWRITTEN REPORT OF SIGHTING IN HENRY COUNTY, ILLINOIS, IN DECEMBER 1925, SUBMITTED BY WITNESS, BORN IN 1914)) Tuesday, March 1st, 2005   The event that I describe herein happened in 1925, between Christmas and New Years (Christmas vacation).  Three people were present, Uncle (name #1 deleted), Uncle (name #2 deleted), and me.  Uncle (#2) was in the cow section of the barn, and Uncle (#1) was in the horse barn.  (We were later than usual with the duties of doing the farm chores.)  Uncle (#1) suggested that I take a bucket that was nearby and to go to the corn crib for corn for the horses. I exited the barn and started for the corn crib.  The corn crib was at a lower elevation than the barn, so as I started to descend to that level, I stopped to admire the scenery because it was such a ""picture-postcard"" winter scene, about 15 degrees F, fresh snowfall, clear sky, wind was calm, so I stopped to look around.  The stars were beginning to come out.  In viewing the stars, looking to my left, I noticed two stars, brighter than the others.  This caught my attention, so I studied them a little. It occurred that one of them was moving away from the other.  As I watched this going on, all of a sudden, an object is above me, and the whole area becomes as light as day.  I looked up and looked all around.  I could see the neighbor’s building as clear as day. The object above me, the source of the light, this was not like a searchlight, more like daylight, so I could look up at this object, just a short distance above me.  However, all I could see was a dark (not black) space about 10-feet in diameter, enveloped in sort of an aura atmosphere. It remained there for a short time.  The light dimmed, then it glided over the field at about the same level that it was above me, about 25 feet in the air.  It went directly toward the buildings on ranch #2.  It had to ascend in order to clear the cow barn (a huge barn), and sailed off to the northwest, and it faded from view. I returned with the corn.  Uncle (#1) and Uncle (#2) were emerging from the barn.  Someone said, ""What was that?""  Also, someone said, ""We will read about it in the newspaper when we return home.""  When we got home, Grandpa ((name deleted)), who always read the paper thoroughly, said he saw nothing in the paper of such an occurrence, so that was the end of the event. Place: ((name deleted)) Ranch, about six miles north of Atkinson.  No longer in existence, as such.  Building #6 ((shown on hand-drawn map)) has been completely demolished.  It was in a remote area, about ½ mile from public road. Uncle (#2) at last interview remembered nothing of the incident.  He was milking the cows, and did not have much exposure. Uncle (#1) remark was, ""Something happened"" somewhat bigger object, about as big as a car.  Uncle (#1)((deleted-twenties)); Uncle (#2); ((deleted-teens)); Me ((deleted-11 yrs.))  No women were there.  Neighbors at least one mile away.  I was not frightened. I think the object was either tinted glass, of some kind of fabric. ((name deleted)) ranch sold into smaller parcels. Horses were called ""oat sniffers,"" but draft horses were fed several cups of corn with the oats, plus timothy hay.  Also, this corn was selected with care.  So, the best corn was called ""horse corn.""  The names of the #1 team on Uncle (#1) farm were ((deleted-horse #1)) and ((deleted-horse #2)). No telephone; no newspapers; no electricity; no radio. Building #6 ((indicated on map)) was known as ""the ((deleted)),"" by the locals.  The buildings were used during the construction of the company ditch, and abandoned when the ditch was completed.
