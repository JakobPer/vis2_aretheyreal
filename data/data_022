Watching the meteor shower, I noticed two lights that seemed to be changing directions in their movement.  The brighter of the two was actually three lights in a triangular formation.  The smaller light followed the triangular lights back and forth across the sky.  They were faster than a jet airplane but not extraordinarily fast moving.  They seemed to be at a medium altitude, perhaps 5,000 - 10,000 feet or perhaps less.  This made the actual size of the object undeterminable. After some time the triangular light vanished in an instant and the other light turned in the opposite direction and flew off towards the horizon.  Living near Andrews Air Force Base, it was assumed that this was an air force action but the triangular shape is what sparked my curiosity and made me think that something unusual was going on.

I would estimate that the Bright object was halfway between the ground and the flight corridor of the jets. I continued to watch as the jet passed wwhile the ""object"" remained fixed in the same position in the sky. Many minutes elapsed and another commercial jet aircraft followed on the same flight path with a smaller jet following very closely behind.

My office window is on the southside of the building, the building is located immeadiantly to the west of the Arlington airport, at the south end of the North to South runways. My attention was caught by a bright flash outside, which at first I thought was an airplane entering the landing pattern of the airport.  However, when I looked out the window, I observed an object which appeared to be hanging motionless in the sky, at the top of a cloud formation directly to the south of my location. The object looked like a straight dark line running from east to west.  As I watched, it remained stationary for approx. 2-3 minutes, then began a slow, jerky, upward motion, until it was slightly above the cloud formation, where it stopped again.  It remained motionless for a few seconds, then tilted forward at an approx. 20- 30 degree angle, and began moving very slowly, and wobbly toward the northeast.  At this point the object reflected the sunlight.  I could see that the object was a elliptical shape that appeared to be approx 3-4 times longer than it was thick when viewed edge on.  It also appeared to be oscillating or rotating clockwise.  It again stopped and hung motionless. At this point I went down the stairs, to the 1st floor of the building, to tell other people of the object.  I encountered our computer system administer who is a former combat helicopter pilot, having spent some 14 years in the U.S. Army as a Warrant Officer in that capacity.  I told him to look out his window and tell me what he saw.  He looked, saw the object, and said he was dammed if he knew what it was.  He and I continued to watch the object as it moved slowly up and down, and back and forth, side to side.  It tilted several times, and displayed a definate silver metallic color on its topside.  When viewed edge on, it continued to appear dark in color, and thicker in its middle than at its edges.  We both agreed that it was metallic in appearance, and appeared to be oscillating or rotaing clockwise.  We then advised the switchboard operator, who also looked out and observed the object. I had the operator dial the number of a friend who works in north Everett.  I told my friend what we were observing, and asked her to look from her location for the object.  She called back in a couple of minutes and advised that she could not see the object as there were cloud formations at her location.  The system admistrator and myself stepped outside the building where we continued to observe the object as it hung motionless, or slowly moved up, down, and side to side.  During the time we watched, approx 15-20 minutes, several private planes entered the landing pattern, generally by flying in from the north,on the west side of the airport, banking to the east, and turning north again to approach the north-south runways.  All of the planes were between us and the object which appeared to be approx. 2 miles (somewhat of a guess)from us.  The object appeared to be somewhat larger than a Cessna 172 type plane would at the smae distance. We continued to watch the object until it started slowly moving to the southeast, appearing to slowly be losing altitude, and eventually was lost to our sight behind buildings approx. 1/4 mile south of our location.  This was observed by the 3 of us.  Again, I would estimate the entire length of the sighting at 15-20 minutes. I am a former law enforcement officer, and served in a jet aircraft fighter/bomber squadron during my service with the U.S. Navy, I have received training in both oberving details, and reporting, as well as being familiar with aircraft.  This object resembled no aircraft I have ever observed flying.  The system administrator, former helicopter pilot, also could not identify it it as a conventional aircraft.

The light may have been part of a sprinkler system, according to that individual.  We cannot confirm that fact.  PD)) Brilliant electric blue pulsating light moving at an incredible speed soundlessly passing within 100 yards of our vehicle. My wife and I were driving north on an isolated section of State Highway 79 when we observed an object which at first appeared to be a police car with flashing lights. It appeared to be stationary in the center of the road approximately a mile ahead. As we closed the distance to approximately one-half mile, the flashing lights appeared to move slowly forward and then to the left approximately 75 to 100 yards. When we were approximately an eighth of a mile from the lights, we recognized that the lights were hovering approximately 10 to 20 feet above the ground over the field west of the highway. To our amazement as we watched, the lights suddenly sped at an incredible speed directly south passing our vehicle on the left side. In less than a second it seemed to stop and hover in the field approximately a half-mile behind our vehicle and remained there until we drove out of sight. The light appeared to be an brilliant electric blue pulsating pattern, approximately 18"" to 24"" in diameter. The center appeared to be circular with many narrow shafts of light emanating from the circle forming a criss-cross pattern. It moved at an unbelievable speed yet made no detectable sound. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the witnesses to this event, and we felt she was unusually credible.  Neither she nor her husband had ever seen such an object before.  NOTE:  Not included in this report is that they attempted to dial the local police department, using their cellular phone, and it would not function.  Minutes later, after the object had left the area, the phone reportedly once again functioned normally.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM A READER)) in ref to the below sighting, I know exactly what this was as I live in the area.  In that stretch of the highway there are several sod farms that use pivot sprinklers.  At the end of the sprinkler set is a blue strobe light that moves with the sprinker, this let's the farmer know where the sprinker is and that the sprinker is operating.  Infacts as I look out my window now, I can see a blue light, red light and a white light, all coming from the irrigation sprinkers.  Furthermore, there is no cell phone coverage in that stretch of highway   thanks! ((END FOLLOW-UP",2002-08-16T00:00:00,,

Right after I opened the door, I noticed two flashing objects in the sky over a short section of the Blue Ridge Mountains.   The section I'm talking about is directly to the left of the restaurant Skyland, right over Skyline Drive here in Luray, VA. The two objects were flashing red and white lights, possibly blue or green as well.  And they were moving in ways that I've never seen anything move before.  Suddendly jerk to the left or right, constanly verying speed and direction in a 3-dimensional space.  I know this because their also happened to be a small patch of clouds in the same area that the objects would move in and out of.  Over the course of the next 2 hours, the two objects were soon joined by 5 or 6 more objects that included smaller triangle orange-white lights that didn't blink or strobe like the others.  The strobing objects flashed in an irreglur pattern.  When they would go into the cloud, you could see flashes like heat lightning kind of.  (The temp was 71 or so). Within the first few moments of this experience, I became extremely frightened and began to shout ""what the * is that!!!"" while tears began to roll down my cheeks.  This is the 2nd time in 7 months that I have seen similar objects over the exact same area.  The first time was about 7 months ago and there were two other witnesses that time.

Then I spotted an object that could had been a meteror. It was a bright light that traveled toward the south-southwest at rapid speed. I went back in the house for a moment to phone electric company. Found out from them that power outages were occuring in Cannon and Rutherford Counties. Went back outside to check up on dogs. When I got outside, I discovered all dogs in the area howeling and barking. I looked up and saw what appeared to be a craft flying at the lowest level that commercial aircraft fly.

It appeared to be moving slower than commercial aircraft but not that slow. Maybe 150 to 200 MPH. This object could had been a passanger jet but I heard no sound from it. All other aircraft that I had seen at that level have made the normal jet engine sounds. This one did not. It was like it was gliding. Then object slowly moved on toward Smyrna and Nashville. Dogs were going mad at this point in neighborhood. My two dogs were running about. Cats were also running about. Then spotted a white SUV traveling at high rate of speed down road.

They seemed to be partially behind a gray haze (cloud) and some of them kept fading in and out behind the haze. I think the objects were producing the ""haze"" as a camouflage.  The brightest object was in the rear of the pack. The only clouds in the sky were on the horizon and the objects seemed to be headed in a SE direction at a steady speed.

I was a little freaked out by what we saw and did not ask other people around me to look at it which I now regret. I have not heard or read anything about it since.

I noticed it because it was bright - brighter than any of the stars around it and it was moving fast enough to get my attention. It took perhaps 30-45 seconds to move from just over the horizon to nearly overhead. I still thought it was just a satelite - but then it stopped. The light did not change it just stopped. And then it started to fall. Almost as if it was some type of rocket that had reached the apex of it's trajectory. ""That's weird"" I though and I kept watching. Then it stopped again and started to zig zag. Whatever it was - it was very high in the sky - really just a point of light about what you might expect of Mars viewed with the naked eye. I ran in and got the binoculars and watched to for another ten minutes as it zig zagged around. I know it was moving because I had to walk from the West to the North side of my house to keep it in view. Then it was gone. Through the binoculars, the object emitted a faint redish light. It's movement was extremely fluid. When it zig zagged, it looked like a tadpole swimming in shallow water. It moved very slowly at times, hovered, and at others moved very fast speeding out of the view of the binoculars. The object made no sound (then again the frogs and crickets are very loud in the field and drown out Route 95 some 3 miles away so I would not have been able to hear anything but a very loud sound).

There was like haze around it also. My friend and I saw this, and tried to go run inside to show our other friends, but by the time we went back outside it was gone. It was no where in sight and we stayed outside for a while after that just in case it were to reappear. It was flying real slow and kinda high. We saw this for five minutes. It didnt make andy noise at all.

My two friends, who wish to remain anonymous, were with me and we decided to ivenstigate from a closer distance. When we pulled into the gravel parking lot of Padre Serra Church, the object slowly descended out of site behind the mountains. Before it descended out of site, from this distance, we could tell that the surface of the object had a distinct liquid-like texture resembling a ball of water in zero gravity. From where, I assume, the object had landed past the horizon; there was a short but distinct flash of light which momentarily lit the surrounding area to the point of daylight. When this happened, the headlights of my car instantly died followed by a sputtering motor about three seconds later. When I checked my cellular phone I found that it was also dead. I saw, what I assumed to be, the same spherical object rise above the horizon again. This time, at a terrific speed, the object approached us and halted directly above the car. My car was about and eighth the size of the sphere. It's surface was definitely liquid though we could not see what was inside due to the silvery reflection of the surface. My friends and I panicked and tried to run from the car in different directions at which point the object descended with the same terrific speed, encompassing the entire vehicle as well as us. At that instant, there was another flash and the cold feeling of the liquid on my skin was gone. Neither my friends nor I knew what happened but when we checked, we found that we could not account for a twenty-four hour period of time. Although we pleged to keep it a secret, I believed it important to inform someone.

Nearly directly overhead was a brilliant light about as bright as an aircraft landing light but with a bluish cast to it similar to the newer driving lights on autos.  It was obvious the light was not a stellar object because of the size and color. The size was larger than Venus at its brightest but no more than 1/8th inch in diameter at arms length.  The light remained absolutely stationary for about 25 seconds.  There was no sound or other identifying marker lights or markings discernable.  Suddenly the object rotated in a circular path and appeared to rise rapidly.  The circular path would have been approximately the size of a dime at arm's length.  The path was only 180 degrees in rotation.  At about the 180 degree point of rotation the craft had already vanished down to a pin point and vanished.  The rotation maneuver lasted only about 1 to 1.5 seconds.  During this maneuver the portion of the light that was originally facing downward was angled as if the craft were banking while rotating and it became apparent that a light shaft was being emitted from that portion of the craft now assumed to be the bottom.  The light shaft was approximately 1/4 inch in length at arm's length. The instant the light vanished I grabbed a pair of 7x50 binoculars that were 10 feet away and looked at the area where the light last appeared.  Nothing was observed in the area where it was last seen. The sighting took place at approximately 10:30 PM mountain time.  The sky at that time was clear with numerous stars visible.  No cloud cover was present and visibility could be classesd as unlimited.  The only obstruction to view was the ambiant light of the neighborhood (street llights and entry lights on homes).  Commercial aircraft were in the air with the closest craft at least 10 miles away.  There was no interaction between the aircraft and this object. The observer is a college graduate, former law enforcement officer of 18 years and a licensed general aviation pilot familiar with aircraft and their appearance.

The next thing that occurred was when it was directly in sight it began to light up intensely, (about 5 times brighter than any star in the sky) then dimmed again. This might have been due to entering the atmosphere then exiting again. After watching travel halfway across the sky heading south, it then turned 90 degrees and went east towards NYC.

The three lights seemed to fade into one another making the craft seem as if it was a single craft that was sigar shaped.

Initially I thought the object was a shooting star, but because there was no tail and its course and brightness remained steady for about 3 seconds, I felt it must be a satelite. Then,to my amazement, the object made several instant course changes (i.e., 60% right, 60% left, 60% right then continuing on its original vector until disappearing). I have never seen such a thing. I immediately recorded the time of the event and documented my observations on arriving home.

PD)) Dawn arrives ahead of schedule [from the West] over a remote Pacific Island. 27 October 1997, 9:42pm A black night, low cloud, light drizzle. From the west, below the horizon a light lifts steadily and quickly, like dawn, but much faster. Lights up the entire sky but no object discernable because of the cloud. Lagoon waters turn blue, like day. Birds fly startled from the trees.  Roosters crow. The light passes overhead then up and away (rather than bending over the opposite horizon}. At least 200 witnesses, including the Director of ((deleted)) ever read of, never mind seen, anything similar. Like dawn breaking at high speed in the middle of the night. Some say they saw a blue light. A group of football players, resting after a practise match, say they felt a strong rush of wind as it flew past. One guy saw it while out in the ocean fishing and jumped for cover under his boat. Seasoned merchant navy sailors, home on vacation, had never witnessed or heard of anything like it before. To this day no one has a clue as to what it could have been. Footage on tv of metorites entering the atmosphere, while spectacular, were nothing at all like this. Here the entire sky lit up, not just a portion of it. As the source of the light passed overhead there was a reddening low on the Western horizon, like explosions, things dropping into the ocean, burning, then blackness. Funafuti is a coral atoll, extremely flat, making visibility of all horizons very clear. The event took maybe 15 seconds it total. There was no noise. Tuvalu is 700 km north of Fiji, remote, and on no airline flightpath. Nothing like this had been seen [in Tuvalu] before, or since, at least not in living memory. If photographed, which it wasn't, it would probably look something like an artists impression of the 'second coming', Watchtower style, but without the figures and trumpets. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested more information from the source of this excellent report.  We will contact local authorities, in attempt to obtain more information.  PD))  ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Dear Peter, Thanks for your quick response. Yes it was something very strange and very spectacular.  It has been a few years since the event and no doubt some witnesses have moved on. Good guess, but no I am not the Director ((deleted)), although ((that person)) was sitting not twenty feet from where I was and witnessed everything I did. I will try get ((that person's)) email address and pass it onto you. Tuvalu is a really small place and in 1997 there were no newspapers, so no written reports to the best of my knowledge. As you can imagine it was the talk of the town for a few days then back to normal routine. If you are really interested I will put you in touch with a few people whom I know personally witnessed it and you can take it from there. A couple of days after the event I spoke to a few people who lived on one of the outer islands [Niutao] - about 100 miles North of Funafuti - and they said they had seen strange lights in the direction of Funafuti - so I gather from this that the event was local to Funafuti - even though it appeared [from Funafuti] to cover the entire sky.  Some have suggested a Nuclear explosion in French Polynesia - but that is 2000 miles away - and none were reported. Another theory is re-entry of the spaceshuttle but I doubt that would brighten the lagoon and startle birds. A very large meteorite skipping off the upper atmosphere perhaps, but how could bend over the western horizon and brighten the sky as it did. Its a pity about the cloud cover, but in some ways it added to the spectacle, - the source of light silhouetted the banded cloud (herringbone?) - and as it rose it looked like a curtain rising.  As people were watching the light I cast my eyes back to the West and that's when I saw what looked like a uniform explosion low on the rim of the western horizon.   In the days following the event a friend (another witness) tried to get in contact with the international press to tell the story but in those days Tuvalu had not yet been hooked up to the internet.  His name is ((deleted)) and currently lives in ((deleted)). I am sure he will not mind recounting his story to you. His address is ((deleted)), but he is not the fastest correspondent in the world. Meantime I shall try get you some other addresses. regards ((name deleted)) ((SECOND FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE)) Dear Peter, I have no problem in you featuring the article - that would be great - provided anonymity is assured. Once you have finalized the story I will alert some people in Tuvalu and point them to your webpage.  That may encourage and jog the memory of others. I would like, in particular, for you to get the ""((name deleted))"" story as he was on the open sea further to the East when it happened. His name is ((name deleted)) - I will find you his email. The ((deleted)) team story is also interesting as they were all resting, backs flat to an old ((deleted)), facing the sky.

Since Abbotsford is home to an international airport I was used to seeing and hearing many types of aircraft at many different alltitudes in under different conditions. I estimated it's altitude to be 250 feet, and it's speed at about 700 miles per hour. I instantly slammed on the breaks, stopped the engine, and got out of the car as quickly as l could, to catch the sound of crafts engines. There was no sound however. Abbotsford is situated in a valley surrounded by mountains. That is how I managed to gauge it's speed and alltitude. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

About 10:10, I was on the phone with a friend and went outside onto the porch, which is 12 ft or so off the ground. In just a few minutes, I saw this triangle shaped pbject moving over the field by the house.  It was about 30 feet away from me, about eye level, due to the bank that drops about 10 ft below the driveway. It was dark in color, black?, and had orangy yellow lights that flashed in a pattern, but not sequentially.  It was moving at approximatley 5 mph, and made no sound.  I told my friend that I had to go, but would call her back when it was gone. At this point, a blue?white light came from the bottom, and that's all I remembered at the time. 2 hours are unaccounted for, but I have remembered a few things.  One is an odd black box, and I was shown what was inside but am not allowed to remember what it was at this time.  The being that I saw that night is the same one I have been seeing since childhood, and even though he has told me his name, I can't say it or spell it.

They were very bright, and at first appeared to be a large tower.  However, the lights started moving vertically. Three large bright lights were seen from our front yard.  My boyfriend called me outside to see them because they were never present prior to this sighting. They seemed to be suspended in air, but we took the car to make certain there was no tower in the area; before we could get out of the driveway, the lights had disappeared. The three lights were originally horizontally lined evenly.  By the time I had joined my boyfriend outside, two had moved downward.  Within 20 seconds, and while getting into the car, one of the three zipped upwards and disappeared.  By the time we left the driveway, all three had vanished. We drove to where we had seen the lights.  At first we had suspected a tower in the area not seen prior to the sighting, but no tower was there.

My husband and I were camping the night of 6/17/02 at Troublesome Creek campground, which is located on the shores of the Skykomish River. The rain made it hard to sleep as we were in an old VW camper van and the rain was loud hitting the roof. I had opened a window earlier in the evening for air. At around 1am I woke up from an intense dream where I was in a hospital with bright lights all around. As I lay there trying to relax, I noted that the rain was subsiding, and that the sound of the rapids was being interrupted, as if it were being blocked off, at regular intervals. Then I heard a loud buzzing noise above the van. It came closer, and suddenly I was being absorbed, or I was absorbing, this noise. It was loud in my head, and I tried to plug my ears but my arms would not move. I felt like I was on a fast moving carnival ride, but I didn't go anywhere. It was pitch black out- no lights, nothing. This buzzing inside my body only lasted for about 5 seconds, then it was outside again. It moved away, and the river still had that odd pulsing sound. Then the buzzing returned, the same as before, starting outside the van, and then inside of me. And as before, it left again. The second time it left, I noticed the river sounds were normal again, and then the rain started pouring down, enough to wake-up my husband. He never heard a thing. The next morning, as we were getting ready to leave, we were approached by another camper (there had been only 3 couples in the campground. Early in the morning, I saw one of the couples leave), and I asked him if he heard any strange noises in the night. He said he slept soundly, but his wife complained of hearing things. When I told him what happened, he said it was similiar to what his wife told him happened to her. At that point, we left. One thing I noted: Before we went to bed, I left a couple of plastic cups on the table by our drinking water. In the night, it sounded like they were on the ground, being kicked or blown around. The next morning, they were exactly where I left them, with rainwater in them. Also, when we stopped for breakfast at a diner not far from the campground, we were told that there had been a lighting and thunder storm over the area the night before. We heard no thunder and saw no lighting, and we were only about 7 miles or so (about a 20 minute drive on curving roads)away. So, what happened to me???",2002-07-01T00:00:00,47.8207,-121.5551

I was facing west and noticed a Commercial Airliner heading west I'm guessing at about 25k - 30k feet. As it approached the mountains I noticed a small shiny object in the air just south of the airliner and it seemed to me it was hoovering approximately 15k - 20k feet. My wife went to the car and got the binoculars while I kept an eye on the object. There were a few scattered clouds but for the most part it was very clear and bright. I looked at the object through the binoculars and it appeared to be spherical in shape and had a bright chrome like shine to it. It hoovered in the same spot for approximately 4 - 5 minutes and then started moving relatively slowly in an east/southeast direction. I followed it with my binoculars until it was directly above me, unfortunately so was the sun. I lost it in the sunlight and tried to find it again on the eastern side of the sunlight but could not relocate it. It appeared to be gaining altitude as it moved east. At first, before I got the binoculars, I thought it might be a hot air balloon. But when I saw it close up it was just a shiny sphere, no other protrusions or markings. There seemed to be no means of propellsion and there was no noise as it moved. My wife also saw this, but not through the binoculars. When we got back to work I called the Air Route Traffic Control Center @ 2211 17th Ave. in Longmont Colorado to see if they had seen anything on their radar. They told me there had been no sightings and referred me to the air traffic control tower at Jefferson County Airport. They told me they also had seen nothing.

I am a police officer in the town of Moultonboro. On Tuesday evening I received a message from my dispatcher advising me that a subject in Gilford, NH observed flares shooting in the sky in the area of Red Hill, a small mountain in Moultonboro. I and the other officers on duty set up strategic observation points and observed no such flares or lights. About 30 minutes later I was near the Moultonboro Airport, a small private unattended airport, and observed a military turbine helicopter (I was unable to determine the type because it was dark but, from my experience, it appeared to be a Blackhawk.) make an approach to the airport, land and then take off. This is not unusual as I have observed military helicopters making practice approaches to the unattended air strip in Moultonboro in the past. Shortly thereafter, I observed what was clearly a military aircraft flying in an area north of Moultonboro, most likely over the town of Tamworth or Sandwich, dropping flares. My dispatcher radioed me and advised me of a resident in Tamworth observing a military aircraft dropping flares. I am also a pilot and have flown in this area extensively over the past 17 years. The geographic location of Moultonboro is at the north end of Lake Winnipesaukee and at the southern edge of the Yankee One and Yankee Two MOAs. These two military operations areas encompass most of the White Mountain National Forest. We live and work just south of the White Mountains. (A New York VFR sectional map clearly shows these two MOAs.) I have observed dozens of military operations in this area over the 25 years we have lived here, especially at night. I have also contracted through the Carroll County Sheriff's Department to fly drug interdiction for the Nat. Forest Service and have flown all over the White Mountains and, while doing so, have observed Military jets flying operations at tree top level in this area. I have also been involved in the investigation of a military jet crash about 14 years ago that was participating in a training exercise in this area. The Yankee 1 & 2 MOAs are primarily used by reservists flying out of Otis AFB on Cape Cod, the Air National Guard out of Concord, NH and I also believe aircraft from the Brunswick Naval Air Station in Brunswick, ME. It was also used for a training area for aircraft out of Pease AFB before its closure several years ago. All the lights and flares I observed Tuesday night definitely came from military aircraft. I am certain that anyone else who observed these lights were watching the same aircraft I was. What puzzles me, was the number of calls that were received regarding these observations. This type of military operations in our area is not that uncommon. Granted, most military operations take place farther north, deeper into the White Mountains which is virtually unpopulated. However, this is certainly not the first time I have observed military aircraft engaged in training in our area. This is especially common at night. In response to your comment regarding dropping flares over forested land, the dozen or so flares I observed being dropped from aircraft Tuesday night burned out long before reaching the ground. I hope this answers some questions and clears up some of the mystery of this event. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to this witness, and the several other witnesses, who submitted reports in response to our letter-to-the-editor to The Citizen newspaper in Laconia, NH.  Based on the information available to us currently, we believe that the most likely explanation for the event is flares launched by military jet fighters.  However, this explanation does not appear to explain away all aspects of the event that have been reported to our Center.  We are uncertain as to what caused the event.  PD))",2002-07-01T00:00:00,,

We were facing east and watching high in the east sky. I noticed an orange light in the sky that at first I thought was an aircraft, but it would have had to be extremely high (I could not distinguish the red/green sides and there was no strobe).  There was also no sound. It struck me that the light was moving very fast for such a height. I made a comment about it. My friend looked and was shocked. She saw a very large triangle. When she stated she saw the triangle I shifted my field of view that had been concentrating on the one point I spotted and realized there were 3 greatly separate points in a triangular shape all moving together and at what seemed to be a very great speed if the lights were as distant as they seemed to be. We both watched the triangle move to the north north-west. I tried to see if it obstructed any stars as it moved, but the light pollution was too great and the visible stars too few, I did not see it pass in front of any visible star until I lost sight of it in the light pollution to the North. The total sighting could not have been more than 15 seconds, more likely it was 10 or less. The triangle shape was irregular, certainly not equilateral. To judge it's size I compared it to Jupiter and Saturn, which were both visible at this time in the east sky. The longest side of the triangle was about 6/10 to 7/10 the distance between Jupiter and Saturn. The next side was about 4/5 the size of the longest side, while the shortest side was perhaps 1/2 the size of the longest side. It did not move with one of the points in the lead, rather it seemed to sweep across the sky with the shortest side of the triangle in the lead. The corner points did seem rigidly fixed, they did not move relative to each other at all during the observation. My friend and I are both unsure if this was one very large object or simply three lights flying in this pattern. She (very much a UFO skeptic) believes it was one object; without having seen it obstruct a star I'm unsure and more inclined to think it was 3 objects. We both agree that it moved across the sky too quickly to be aircraft at the height that aircraft would have had to be at to look like this (several miles).

The object moved across the sky slow enough for us to really get a good look at it.  It made no noise, at least not that we could here and was in the shape of a triangle.  At first I thought it was a plane or some kind of formation used by military aircraft.  I realized that this was not the case when I noticed that this object was close enough to us that if mthey were tradtional planes, we would have heard them fly by.  It never turned or made any sudden moves, just traveled from the southwest to the north-northwest and eventually out of sight.  We passed it off as something no one would ever believe, and something we could ,never prove we saw, but I recently saw a news report here in Columbia that described others who had seen the same thing my friend and I saw, so for what it's worth, we saw it to but have no earthly idea what it was.  It was triangle in shape with lights at each corner, it was fairly large and made no noise, the middle of the craft looked open or see through but I may be wrong about that, but it definently was not a solid craft because I could see stars in the sky within the triangle of lights.

I just read an article on rense.com about someone here in Salt Lake City that saw a UFO similar to what I saw several months ago, unfortunately I didn't document the exact date and time.  My estimate would be that it was late January or early February.  I was outside in my hot tub.  It was between the hours of 2 - 4 am.  I first noticed an object moving as it blocked my view of the stars.  I turned of the jets on my hot tub and stood up to get a better look as steam was rising off the surface of the water.  It was at an altitude much lower than a craft of that size should be and as it approached I saw a dark triangular shaped object with no lights and it made no sound.  I saw the lights from the interstate and city reflecting from the bottom of this object which helped to define its shape.  It appeared to be following the route of Interstate 15 coming from the north and going south.  I live fairly close to the interstate.  My guess was that it might be some kind of experimental military aircraft, but who knows. I am just now sending this in as I read an article on rense.com about a man who saw this same object and I wanted to confirm that I have seen it as well.  When I mentiond it to a couple of my friends, they looked at me like I was crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in February 2002 so that the report sorts to that date.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport: Regarding reconstructing the date:  Unfortunately I cannot give you an exact date and time, as I said, I did not document this.  I do remember that it was quite early in the morning as I had finished studying - again between 2 - 4 am.  I generally do not bring writing or recording materials out with me when I sit in my hot tub and I do not have a clock outside.  I guess thinking in hindsight, maybe I should.   I just remember that it was in the first quarter of the year.  I don't think this happened before my birthday, which is January 31st, because I don't remember mentioning it to friends at my birthday party.  It was a completely dark night around the time of the new moon.  I had a two-week break from school during the Olympics and this happened after a long night of studying so that would exclude February.   That leaves the time period around the new moon in March.  The weather was still quite cold as steam was rising from the surface of my hot tub.  Sorry I can't be more specific on that. In answer to your question about why I waited so long to report:  I did not report this at that time because I was not sure who to report this to.  The local police are somewhat less than concerned and professionally responsive (At least in my past experience with former next-door neighbors who had vicious rottweilers and juvenile delinquent teenagers, on one complaint the cop told me to ""bake them some cookies"".) about normal everyday complaints so they were not an option for me to report a UFO sighting to. Look at it from my perspective: I had never experienced anything quite this freaky and before and I don't know anyone who has, to ask for their advice.    I was trying to process what I had seen in my mind and I guess I rationalized it as some sort of experimental military aircraft as it somewhat resembled the stealth bomber only larger.  I also live within close proximity to the Salt Lake International Airport so I am aware of normal flight patterns.   Numerous aircraft, although none as large as this one flying at the lower altitude, fly along the I-15 corridor.  I am single, I have no roommates or family, and I was alone at the time this happened.  As I said, when I told some of my friends they looked at me like I was crazy and from that, I perceived that they did not believe what I was telling them, so probably no one else would.  I know what I saw that night.  When I read the posting about the recent sighting of this object by a gentleman in Salt Lake I wanted to onfirm that this thing does indeed exist.  That is what prompted me to report at this particular time.     In conclusion, now I know who to report this to and am aware after looking through your site that several people have seen this object as well.  I won't hesitate if I see anything in the future as I have now bookmarked your site.  I found your website address through the article on rense.com, which I read today, September 28th. Prior to this I had no knowledge of your organization or your website. I hope this helps you to understand.

There were two very bright, white lights not moving, but hovering above the tree tops. It was just after dusk and they were way too big and too low to be stars, but they did not move but hung in the sky. One was a short distance away from the second. They did not move unless they slightly drifted, for about 20 minutes, when they were no longer visible to me but were behind the tree tops. I kept thinking maybe they were helicopters, but they did not make any noise. This is kind of near military sites, like the Pentagon and not too far from National Airport.

I spotted a light in the sky and I watched it thinking it was an airoplane, as there are many commercial flights whose path is almost directly above the beach. These planes are usually travelling in a northerly direction, heading for San Jose airport. However the object I watched was travelling extremely fast and made no sound. It moved in an exactly straight line from east to west. To help describe the speed, imagine lying on your back with your feet pointing south, hands pointing out and the sky above is one half of a clock face: your left hand is east and also 12 o'clock; the right hand is west and 6 o'clock. I spotted the object at around 1 o'clock and watched it travel until 5 o'clock in less than 5 seconds. As the object moved it was completely silent and left no trails. It appeared to go through brightness changes, as if light was being internally reflected off the inside of a sphere. The brightness changes were as linear as the object's motion. I have watched many planes over the skies here and this was not a plane (well, not a normal one anyway).",2002-09-28T00:00:00,37.011256646216765,-122.04450858895706

Lying in bed, at the above mentioned time or approximately at that time or slightly later, I was gazing up at the skylight just above my bed, when a very large lighted object passed directly over the skylight.  It seemed to be round diffused light with a tiny bright possible light source. It was very bright and seemed to be traveling at about the speed of what an airplane might be traveling when it was approaching a runway for a landing. Having only seen this object for a couple of seconds, I'm only guessing at its size and altitude.  It seemed quite low and I'd estimate its diameter to be the size of the length of a private single engine airplane. It had no defined edges as the edges were more or less glowing similar to what a bright light bulb might look like from a distance.  I live approximately 2-3 miles from the edge of Lake Michigan and the ""craft"" was flying from the East to the West which is the direction of Lake Michigan from my home.  Interestingly enough, and the reason for my filing out this report, someone that I work with saw something the same night down in the Douglas, Michigan area. Her discription was nearly identical to mind.  Same bright, large object moving from the East toward Lake Michigan. She also lives quite close to Lake Michigan.  She had another experience in the past, but I don't think that it was very recent, but it did involve a ""craft"" over the Lake Michigan area shoreline down in Douglas, Michigan.  Douglas and Norton Shores are probably 55 miles from one another.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and my first thought was that whatever this was was heading downward toward the lake. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-09-28T00:00:00,,

The lights appeared to be moving in a NW direction at the speed of a small aircraft (120 kts or less.) They were at about 20 degrees above the horizion. As the light were moving away from me The front light went put. I don't know if this due to the light being turn off or if it became obstructed by part of the craft. I can not say this was one craft or three as it was to dark to see. The lights disappeared behind a hill to my NW. There was no noise from these lights. The morning air was still and quite, no dogs, no birds and no traffic noise that could have covered the sound of an aircraft engine. The dam located not far from my location is a hydroelectric dam.

The light turned off like an over head light and then reappeared farther north.  This time the light hovered and then moved from left to right in the sky.  Became stationary and went out again.  The light appeared again in a different part of the sky, more east hovering ... on two separate occassions two others lights appeared asthough they were dropping to the left and right diagonally forming a triangle.

Being prior military and around aircraft I was amazed by the angles at which these objects moved.  The activity lasted for approximately 15 minutes when I saw the light turn off.  I contacted the area airport a few days later to see if anyone else reported the occurrence.  The airport ops stated nothing unusual was reported for that evening.

As I watched the Phenomenon I was facing the North East sky.  This would have place the sighting over the area of the Enola Train Yards, the susquehanna river, south of the Interstate 81 bridge, which is due north of the city of Harrisburg.  I was not able to distinguish any shapes to the phenomenon but I was able judge some relative distance because I was able to see the mountain tower lights across the river that are located in the Linglestown area.  These objects were definitely between the background lights and the location from where I was standing.  Again, it was nothing like I have ever witnessed before ... the maneuvering of the lights was simply amazing.  I hope this information helps and I would be happy to help out as much as I can.

PD)) Triangle formations over Washington and Oregon checked against satellite data...OUFOR. Two team members/investigators for Oregon UFO Research, a husband and wife team, were staying at James Gillilands Sattva Sanctuary over the Labor Day weekend as they frequently do to skywatch near the base of Mt Adams in Trout Lake Washington. Steven Greers group (Disclosure Project) was there on their first night of skywatching during their week long stay in the area for their paid conference. Mr. Greer was not there at the time and was to arrive a few days later. The husband and wife were approximately 150 yards east of the Greer group for their skywatch along the driveway from the main road into the house. A few minutes after 11:00 p.m. they heard several people in the Greer group to their left shouting in an excited fashion for several seconds. Wondering what the shouting was about they both searched the sky to see what they were looking at. The wife saw it first and it was a triangle. The form was an uneven elongated triangle with one of the trailing lights ahead of its counterpart. The Brightness was dim but was readily discernible as moving together in formation. The husband hastily got out his camcorder and tried to video the object. He could see it in his camera and, after a few seconds, it made a banking turn and headed back the same direction that it came from. Approximately three seconds after it had made the turn, all three lights faded out together. Throughout the whole sighting the three lights stayed in formation and kept the same brilliance. Here is a computer rendition of that sighting by team member Cameron Johnson in the modeling department... http://www.oregonuforeview.com/MTADAMS.jpg It was headed from north to south and after the turn it headed back the way it came and rapidly went out. The weather was clear and there are no streetlights in the area. The milky way was readily visible. There was no moon. Everyone who was outside skywatching saw the object or formation...over 15 people. There was no object visible within the lights as they were not markers. There was no sound, or visible trails from it. Its size was about half a hand at arms length. Bill and Ferne were facing north when they saw it and it was directly overhead. There were no obstructions and they report having an excellent view. This is a substantial sighting and team members ((three names deleted)) will be getting together with the witnesses soon to fill out a detailed report form and gather any further information available. Friday, September 6th update...We have recieved NOSS Triad Satellite information for the evening of the sighting and, if in fact these times are correct, indicate that this sighting WAS NOT not satellites. However, at 11:30, a half hour later, another report was submitted from Clackamas, Oregon.  The witness writes... ""At 11:30 p.m., I observed three objects traveling from the NW to SE at satellite speed. The objects were as bright as the brightest star. They formed a triangle, one flying directly behind the lead object at some distance (close enough to be considered flying together). The third object was about 45 degrees from the tailing object, closer in the formation, that is between the lead object and its' trailer. The objects were observed both with the naked eye and through 10X50 binoculars. Duration of observation was about 20 seconds, then the objects disappeared after flying directly overhead. This may have been a result of the reflection from the sun being out of reflective range."" The same NOSS triad satellite information for the evening of this sighting shows that this may well be NOSS triad satellites. Date Mag Time Alt. Az. Time Alt. Az. Time Alt. Az.

The pic was taken in france in a very rural area called Tenteniac nr Rennes down from San Marlo in Britany.We were stoped by the customs in france and back in the uk,the first time in many many trips there.But that might just be paranoia!.

We heard the sound for about 30 seconds and got up from our campsite (out from under some trees) to investigate.  The sound was making area coyotes/dogs howl like crazy.  The object had a red light on one side and a green light on the other, and white lights on the front and back.  The red and green lights were about a third of the way between the white lights-- if you connected the lights, it would look like a kite.  So basically, not terribly unlike a plane, but a different shape. However it did not sound like any plane we'd ever heard.  It was traveling relatively slow and low and went directly over us.  As it did, due to the Doppler effect, the sound became lower and the oscillations slower.  We followed it until it disappeared into the horizon. We suspected it might be a B-2, but saw one the flying the next day outside of Alamogordo and it did not sound the same at all.  Based on subsequent Internet research, we're pretty sure it wasn't one.  Actually, as an aside, it sort of sounded like the opening music on the MUFON website (www.mufon.com).",2002-09-13T00:00:00,33.50664583333333,-104.45876666666668

We work on the State Campus which is located southeast of the Albany International Airport but within aircraft takeoff and landing patterns.  We were checking out the sky, discussing how unusual it looked with the different kinds of clouds.  Suddenly from the west we notice something bulleting across the sky.  It had a very narrow vapor trail which was so thin that I briefly thought if the puffy clouds were cotton balls it would pull them together like thread. It was also strange in the fact that the trail failed to scallop like the vapor trails of the jets we saw only moments before. The object made no noise. As it shot more to the northeast it was going to be blocked by the corner of my building.  I went down the steps just in time to catch a glimpse of the object.  It appeared to be football in shape only a bit longer and slightly deflated, with at least one fin on the top and bottom.  Its color looked dark metallic gray.  The air around it was a bit funny; gave the appearance it was traveling in a fuzzy bubble. Since the military has been active in our area since 9/11, I thought maybe it was something new they were flying so I didn't report the sighting.  I missed the orginal FOX report but my co-worker told me about it the next day.  When I didn't see any followup a week later I wrote FOX email info line to make an inquiry and report that we had seen the object.  To date, I haven't heard anything from them. While I work in a civilian capacity now, my background is law enforcement.  I was a police/peace officer/investigator for 25 years prior to my current appointment. ((NUFORC Note:  The object photographed by the FOX 23 cameraman was visible for approximately 11 frames of video, or about one-third of a second.  We would be surprised if people witnessed the same object with the naked eye, although the object may have slowed at some point during its presence in the airspace over Albany, NY.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport: Thank you for your quick response.  While my report stays the same in every other detail, I failed to check a calender when submiting the date of our sighting and it wasn't the 20th.  My co-worker and I work Monday-Friday.  Ours took place during  the week, the day of the evening report of the Oct 20 object by FOX to the public.    I do know that for sure as my co-worker came in the next day all excited because he had heard the report of the original object on the news the night before.  He said that FOX had done a report on the object we saw (last time I listen to him).  I didn't see the broadcast and couldn't  find anything on it until I found your site yesterday (I was using the wrong search word on FOX).  I apologize for this inaccuracy. However, it does not change the facts that I have otherwise reported. You asked if the object made any maneuvers while we watched it.  No.  It was the vapor trail that first drew our attention to the object shooting like a bullet across the sky.  It wasn't until I ran down the steps and the object changed directions (from traveling due east to NE) that I was finally able to briefly get the shape.   Since we couldn't really see it before and I now could, I had the impression  that it tipped a little and  I was looking more towards the top of the object rather than the side.  It was just so fast I only got a glimpse.  The whole experience was almost surreal in that something that big should have made some sort of a sound but didn't.  Yet the vapor trail and its funny, fuzzy bubble around it told me it was really high up and something ""different"". I have been thinking about its vapor trail and the way jet vapor trails look.  This object appeared to be more seering the atmosphere than putting out exhaust.. You ask if what I saw was like what the reporter filmed.  His object appears to look more like a walking stick.  Ours was a bit fatter and the fins a bit broader.  It looked as though the reporter's object devoured half of itself, just that much fatter. Ever since 9/11 when the hijacked plane turned right over us we have been sky watchers.  I have a window seat at work and  can tell when something is going on at the airport, note the flight pattern changes and every type of plane that takes off and lands, including the military.

I was sitting at the computer about 15-20 minutes later when I heard something outside that I have never heard before. It sounded like a very slow moving propeller (almost what you would expect a boomerang in slow motion to sound like). There were other noises accompanied by the propeller sound one was a steady humming (vibrating) noise and the other was a static-electricity sound (like an electrical zapping sound) that was louder than the humming but not as loud as the propeller sound. The electrical zapping sound could be compared to a soft buzzing sound. The sound seemed to come from the northwest and moved off toward the northeast. After hearing the sound I scolded myself for not having gone outside to look. I realized though that the sound almost mesmerized me, and I didn't move the whole time I heard it. It sounded like it was right outside my window, directly above my house. It seemed to be hovering directly above for 30 seconds. Between the propeller sounds which were louder than the other sounds there was a 3-4 second gap which is how I heard the humming/vibrating noise and the occasional zaps/buzzes. I'm certain this was not a helicopter, or anything I've ever heard before.",2002-11-04T00:00:00,40.912,-85.4762

The object brightness was approximately the same as average brightness of Pleiades. The dimness of the object prevented me from focusing on it to observe any detail. The sky was dark with closest street lights more than 100 yards away. There was no interfering noise such as traffic or aircraft. It was dead quiet as the object passed directly overhead from East-South-East to West-North-West. The object traversed a straight line at uniform speed and dissappeared out of sight 10 degrees above the horizon within 10 to 15 seconds from the time I first spotted it. I observed the object through approximately 100 angular degrees of the sky. The object moved into my field of view as I was observing Pleiades and thinking to myself about how clear the sky was and how well my vision was working that evening. I would not have noticed it otherwise. At first I thought it was a satellite but it was moving too fast and was too large. I was walking with my wife and when I said ""Look at that!"" she caught view of it immediately. All her impressions of the object agreed with mine.

Some how the craft had the ability to generate a strong magnetic field as the electronic devices in my vehicle were acting mysteriously as I stood and stared with disbelief the craft revealed itself in its full glory.  It must have been hovering at least 250 – 400 feet above; it totally obscured a huge cloud and had to be at least the size of an aircraft carrier.  It had multiple rows of lights (I would estimate 12-15 rows). The lights ranged in colors from a pale yellow all the way up to a deep dark purple.  The lights pulsed in a unique symmetrical way, yet some how it seemed to follow some sort of code.  Somehow I felt as though it was communicating with my inner soul, I was not afraid yet I felt at peace with the universe.  I had been trying to re-establish contact with the beings but somehow feel that my neighbour’s loud music is interfering with my cosmic karma.  The alien aircraft had an unusual disproportionate wedge shape when it originally uncloaked and after about 10-12 seconds, additional micro-pods began appearing as though attached to its starboard and aft sides.  I discovered the following day that I was photo-sensitive and had minor vomiting spells. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as being experienced with electronic circuits.

I'm kind of dissapointed that over the last 2 months I've witnessed several bizzare objects in the sky with a witness, but didn't report them to you and I should have.  I'm a very observant of the skies due to the fact that I've seen many of these ojects in my life. Today, on my last coffee break of the day 3:15 P.M., I wondered down 7th Street in New Westminster, B.C., Canada.   This is how my sighting transpired. I noticed in the sky what appeared to be some floating garbage or black balloons of some type which seemed to be liked together like a cluster of balloons with a definate arrow shape to the mass.  This seemed a little odd and puzzling this shape.  The distance of this floating garbage or ballons when I first spotted it was probably 20 stories high compared to the height of a high rise building.   Whatever this was flying up in the air, I just thought, it's got to be garbage and didn't think anything much of it, but I did continue to watch this (garbage) float upwards with what I assume was air currents moving it upwards.  As my head was looking up towards the sky in an easterly direction at this floating garbage, I caught sight of a disc shaped grey object moving rapidly skimming the clouds and moving fast and steady from an easterly direction towards a south western direction.  It moved smoothly across the sky from the East and curved on an angle towards a South Westerly direction.  I watched it move across the sky till infinity (I couldn't see it anymore).  I had a fix on this object for at least 30 seconds crossing the sky.  It wasn't a bird or small plane.  Stunned at what I saw, and frankly, if it wasn't for that (garbage thing) floating upwards, I probably wouldn't have seen this object at all. I looked in the sky where I originally had first spotted the object (which was in the easterly sky) and about 45 seconds to 1 minute after the pass of the first object, there was a second flying object of similar size, heading from an Easterly direction towards a definate Southern direction.  At the moment that I spotted this second object, there was an airliner in the sky heading towards Vancouver airport.  This object was much higher than the plane, and this 2nd object also was skimming the clouds as well. That's all I have right now, plain and simple, but I wanted to get this one to you for sure this time.",2002-10-15T00:00:00,49.201911307420495,-122.9272519434629

I wanted to report an interesting occurance over my house earlier this month.  Before I do, you should know that I am a student pilot, an avid aircraft buff, and have been in/around aircraft all my life.  I know the subject pretty well. I live in Derry New Hampshire, which is not far from the Massachusettes border.  On the morning of August 4th, I was still online at 1:00 am.  It was a very clear night. I began to hear a rumbling sound which very quickly graduated to a loud roaring sound, rattling the windows. I sprinted outside to have a look.  Traveling east to west, high overhead, was a single bright white light.  I would guess its altitude to have been at least thirty thousand feet, if not more.  I could discern no standard aviation lighting, but that's not unusual given the height.  What was amazing was the roar!  I recently moved back here from Florida's Brevard County, where the sound of rocket launches was somewhat routine.  If I had seen this in Florida, I would have thought they were launching a rocket in the wrong direction.  As I said, the sound of this aircraft was so loud it rattled the windows, and sounded EXACTLY like a rocket launch.  There was no sound of turbines at all. This sounded extremely powerful.  My first impression was that I was looking at a missle coming in from the Atlantic somewhere.  The hair stood up on my arms and for a moment I thought...""uh oh"".  All I can say was that this was no normal aircraft, if that's what it was.  I do not believe this was a fighter jet with afterburners on.  It was not traveling especially fast, and continued at the same speed throughout its trajectory. I would like to know if anyone else in the area heard this that night.  It was traveling roughly over the Mass/NH border. The sound actually awoke others in my household, which has never happened before. Thanks for your time, Greg",2002-09-06T00:00:00,42.8915,-71.2787

It had two less brighter lights on the back.  I could not see any body form, just the very bright light up front and the two behind.  It was not moving and I did not notice any sound.  then, right before my eyes - I did not look away, I did not blink, it disappeared.  It just vanished and I could see a much lighter night sky again.

We saw just lights and no crafts.  The lights were more like shadowy shapes and were grey (sometimes changed to red) in appearance.  What we saw were bird-like in shape with the width (i.e. wing span) varying in width.  They generally moved across the Milky Way in approximately 5-7 seconds.  They started out dim, got brighter as they passed over and then dimmed.  At times they appeared stippled.  They almost moved like a wave in the water.  They moved in different directions across the sky.  Most of the time each shadow moved in a single direction, but rarely some changed direction as they moved.  Most of the time we saw one shadowy shape at a time, but occassionaly we would see two at a time moving in different directions. We saw approximately 50 during the half hour we viewed them.  We were viewing the Percieds at the best time of the year and saw many shooting stars. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witnesses to the event, and they seemed to us to be both sincere and quite credible.  They reported that they had contacted the Hansen Planetarium in Salt Lake City, which we confirmed with personnel at that facility.  The Planetarium had received ""four or five"" similar reports from communities in the same general area as Salem.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH ANOTHER POSSIBLE WITNESS)) I am fairly certain I witnessed the same thing as reported from Salem, Utah with minor variations.  The ""object"" had an orangish glow not red and the boomerang or v shape broke up completely two or three times to form somewhat of a circle.  I was able to watch them long enough to determine with 99% certainty that what I was seeing was birds.   I called two wild bird companies to find out what kind of bird migrates at 10:30 at night or later and could ""glow in the dark.""  I was told that the  white faced ibis, for one migrates in v's, is brownish grey, and has luminescent feathers that will reflect light from the setting sun or possibly street lights.  I was told also that birds migrate at night and in this situation probably from the Great Salt Lake to Utah Lake.     This is one possible explanation for what we saw.

I watched it as it became very large and more brilliant until it was about 15 to 20 times larger and brighter than the brightest star. It remained motionless until it started to dim. It than started to move to the right. As it dimmed but did not disappear, it started to move Southward. Because it was so dim, I could see that it had a round shape.

At 2:20am, still not able to fall asleep after a night of shooting a documentary about my ((personal URL)) website, I decided to poke my head out the window to look for stray Persieds. After just two minutes of looking out into space (facing generally up and to the north), a large, very slow moving object caught my eye, emerging from the limb of a building rooftop to the NNE.  It was a dark grey in color, appeared to be more or less diamond-shaped, and it had four lighter colored spheres or disks on its underside.  The object was approximately the size of my thumbnail held at arm's length, so it was quite large and easily seen & tracked even though it did not have any lights on it.  It was moving very slowly from roughly NNE to SSW, curving slowly to the W as it passed nearly overhead and then headed out away from the city. It displayed a slow oscillating motion; appearing to twist back and forth but with its movements limited to perhaps 10°, so the leading edge never became the trailing edge or vice versa.  The movements were very regular, like a cam on a slow-turning gearhead motor. It did not appear to emit any light of its own, nor did it emit any sounds that I could hear.  At first I thought I might have been witnessing a stealth aircraft of some type, but the very slow forward travel and the slight but noticeable oscillating motion ruled that out pretty quickly.  Birds in flight were also ruled out due to the very slow forward speed and the lack of flapping wings, which would have been visible on something of the same apparent size as what I saw. After viewing the object for perhaps 20 seconds, I stumbled into the next room and grabbed a pair of 10X50 binoculars, then went back to the window and tried to zoom in on it.  I lost 15-20 seconds of possible viewing time in getting the binoculars. By the time I had finally got myself up to the window and located the object again, it had dimmed substantially and moved out over Elliot Bay; and I didn't see any more detail on it than I originally did with the naked eye.  After viewing the object in and out of binoculars for an addition 50-60 seconds, it faded from view; though only due to lack of illumination as it flew away from the downtown Seattle core and out over water. It was still plenty large enough in the sky to see with the naked eye had there been more light. The color of the object body appeared to be a dark grey; and the color of the four circular devices or projections on its underside appeared white or light grey; the only source of light striking it was the sodium vapor lights reflected off the streets of Seattle.   Shape was that of a slightly elongated diamond with significantly rounded edges; and the round or spherical projections were positioned just inside each apex of the diamond.  Of several unidentifieds I have witnessed in Seattle, this one had, by far, the largest apparent size of them all.  Its longer axis was more or less aligned with its plane of travel at all times. Actual size and altitude are difficult to determine as there are no clouds or other objects to use as a reference.  I would have to estimate the altitude to be 1,000 to 2,000 feet, and the object's size to be approximately 20' long by 15' wide. I'll try to depict what I saw in Photoshop and then email it to you.

As I go outside, I was looking upp at the sky because the stars are very visable from my house, especially at that time of night.  I saw what seemed to be a round object moving fairly slowly around the sky.  It had bright lights, was definetly brighter than any star or planet.  My dog saw it also, as she started to bark.  I noticed blue and red lights on it as well.  As it was hovering pretty far up, it moved in circles, not straight like an airplane or satalite would, changing directions frequently.  I was amazed and immediatly ran inside to get my husband.  When he came out, at first we couldn't see it, but after another minute or so, it appeared again, and did the same thing, circling around.  We watched it for another five or so minutes, and then it was no where to be found again.  I am sure this was no airplane or anything else of that nature.  It did not make any sound (that which we could hear at least) and did not look like anything I had ever seen.

These did not look like searching lights but I ignored them and went back to doing my job because I was getting off early. A while later I was pulling out of my job and I saw the lights again. They were flashing now up on the hills of Ventura up by the two trees. I drove closer but all I could see were the bright green lights. Then I heard a huge noise like a door was slamming but not a regular door, like a metal door. After the loud noise the lights disappeared and there was wind surfacing my car.

I cannot tell you how I was taken onboard, but I can tell you how it looked. The UFO appeared to be circular, but as it got closer to my location, and slowed down to a hover, I could see that it was a triangular shape, and was given its round appearance because it was rotating so fast.  I remember only a few things. I was on a table, but not by force, I felt like I had the option of being there. For various reasons I believe that I was being examined, but only to be released due to their dissatisfaction. To be honest I think they were looking for a female. The next thing I know I was sitting on the step of my porch. If none of the above is true after all, I do not know how I got there, because I am certain that I do not get up and walk over. I also cannot account for 30 minutes of that evening , the same amount of time my friend was in the shower. The thing that made me believe for certain is her description of what she saw dart off right as she was coming outside. Her description was identical to mine, only I had not given mine to her yet.

In the day you can see the silver cylinder of a jet. This was a wide round silver object. I wish I could be more specific. It was only visible for a brief while, and at first was difficult to notice as my girlfriend was pointing it out. She saw it only because she was looking at the moon. If it was large, it was very high up, and moving fast, but not too fast to watch.

We all sat leaning back looking up at the stars. Very clear still and quiet night. We were enjoying being able to see clearly the events of the evening, a rare treat for England we are normally shrouded in cloud. We watched as the meteors made their occasional streaks of light across the night sky. We had been watching for about 50 minutes when from the East at around the 55 degrees mark from the horizon appeared 3 dull orange/Smokey coloured objects. They seem to drop into view rather than approach from a great distance. The object came towards us in a tight V formation. As they got closer they banked to their left giving us a very clear view of their entire underside. They crossed the sky in front and above us travelling from our left to right. At this point I thought I was looking at 3 large gliding birds the objects were completely silent. I quickly dismissed the bird thoughts as I looked closer I saw that the aircraft were similar to boomerangs with a bump or pip in the middle of the concave part of the boomerang which would be the back trailing edge. As the 3 craft soared across the sky heading South West I stood up and walked forward to follow their progress, which would soon have been obscured, by neighbouring houses. I saw the formation head steadily along and then the craft to the left of the V formation seemed to flick into a quick shallow bank away from the other two which maintained exactly the same height and course. This was almost the same type of manoeuvre a pilot in formation may perform if he thought he was getting a bit close to another aircraft this convinced me that the craft were being piloted. I listened for engine noise, there was none. I can only estimate the height they were at as between 1000 and 3000 feet their speed was faster than conventional aircraft maybe a low flying military jet would be about the same sort of speed but would have defend us and woken up the whole street. These things, whatever they were, were like 3 hangliders travelling at jet like speed. They had no collision lighting or any other illumination. The whole body of the craft giving off this dull Smokey orange glow as I've said before. It has taken me a couple of days to make my mind up about reporting this I have always been very sceptical about the majority of reports.

On Sunday night a call came into the OUFOR Hotline regarding the following sighting which happened just after midnight of the same day. The witness got home from work late Saturday night at about 10:30. After showering and eating a bite he decided to go out on the back deck of his house and watch the stars. He writes...""I was watching for falling stars when I noticed a star that was fluctuating in brightness. All of a sudden I saw the star move slightly. That really got my attention. I kept watching and the star move, side to side and then up. I got my binoculars out to get a better look and when I found the star, I noticed a hazy object above the star that had a blinking red light above it (it was 12:15 a.m. by this time). These two objects moved together with the lower object seeming to sway almost like they were connected, but they were clearly separate. I then called the police to see if anyone else had seen this and they said there were no reports. I then woke up my son and made him look since I was having a hard time believing what I was seeing. I watched these objects move around for a while (it's now 12:45 a.m.) parallel to the first star I saw. It was moving at the same time and in the same direction that the other two objects were moving. About a half hour later they appeared to get closer. I could make out the shape of the object that had a red light on it. It was a triangle shape. And the movements of these objects were getting more erratic and moving further distances from side to side, then up, then down, etc. About 1:30 a.m. I thought it was time to get to bed. On my way through the house I decided to step out front to see if it was still there. The objects were still there and after watching for about 10 minutes the objects descended rapidly... So fast that I was alarmed and ran for the door to the house. The two lower lights that were some distance from the triangle disappeared first behind the tree. Then the triangle continued down and I could see it was black. The red light on it wasn't lit. Then it disappeared and I was waiting to hear a crash but it never happened. They had to have either landed or crashed. When the black triangle went down it looked to be about a mile or two away. At this point I was in a state of shock and sat in my front room for about 10 minutes and went to bed."" OUFOR contacted the Bend police department and confirmed that this witness had called. No other sightings have been reported to them within the 24 hours since the sighting. A preliminary investigation has been opened and OUFOR investigator John LaBossiere of Bend has taken on the investigation. He has talked with the witness and is attempting to better verify where this craft appeared to have come down. We will post any future information that comes out of this investigation.",2002-07-26T00:00:00,44.022083283582084,-121.28018388059701

At first I had a difficult time finding the source of the sound.  I looked ahead of the sound - as one does for a jet at altitude - the object was approx. 10 degrees ahead of the returned sound - using 180 degrees from horizon to horizon as the parameter.  The entire event lasted slightly less than 5 minutes.  The object's heading was WNW to ESE.  It also appeared to roll once - outside loop type - not barrel roll.  No vapor trail was present.  My guess at it's altitude was well over 30,000 feet AGL.  It was very large and moving at a constant rate.

It looked kind of like condensed fog or something; solid but opaque It was kind of glowing, but it didn't really give off any light.It zoomed out of the bushes towards the road, veered towards my minivan, and flew right over top. It scared me enough to make me scream out loud, then I sped the hell out of there! My knees were all shaky and I was really freaked out. I wasn't on drugs or anything, and I'm not some wierdo who made this up. I'm embarassed to tell people what I saw, cause they'll think i'm crazy or something!

To our amazement...when these three ""satillites"" crossed the path of a fairly intense star(i forget which now) the star vanished until the ""satillites"" passed our particular line of sight to the star.

On 6/18/01, Tuesday, at between 2045-2115 hours, I was sitting in the parking lot of the local Burger King, which overlooks the lake.  This location looks west and north.  I first noticed the lights in the cloud cover that appeared to be fireworks, but realized it was too high in sky.  The location of the lights were in the North and appeared to over the White Mountain area, possibly the Sandwich, NH, area. After a short while, I used my binoculars to watch, and could clearly see white strobe lights of aircraft.  I realized then it was jet fighters who have often practiced over the White Mountain area.  As seen on tv shows, they were clearly dogfighting or doing practice bombing or straffing runs and dropping the the ""chaff"" or flares, to practice avoiding anti-aircraft fire.  The show lasted about one half hour and they left and flew to the west. I believe there are F-16 fighter places in Vermont with the Air National Guard, and have seen A-10's many, many times in the Sandwich, NH, area. There were several flights coming and going from Laconia Airport, at which time NO planes were aluminated by any strange lights. This was clearly and without question a training flight of some sort and nothing at unusal happened.

I saw a cloud light up (bright orange? color almost like the sun) I asked my husband ""did you see that?"" then proceeded to pull over to look at the cloud. After pulling over the cloud lit up 4 or 5 more times.Not as bright as the initial light that I saw. I could see what appeared to be a ""jet?"" circling the area that lit up. After a few minutes with no more lights I saw the ""jet"" head east out of the cloud. We drove home and within 10 minutes there were fighter jets overhead flying around. The jets continued to fly for roughly an hour and 15 minutes then I no longer heard them. >From husband: My wife asked me did you see that??? I looked up as she was pulling over and I saw what I thought were flares being dropped from a plane but soon realised they wern't flares they were ball shaped lights..yellowish/white that appeared out of nowhere and dropped behind a cloud and dissappeared. 2 fell behind the cloud and dissappeared a third came from out of the cloud and shot upwards into the cloud from low left to high right again going behind the cloud and not reappearing.Another 2 appeared above the cloud and dropped into the cloud and dissappeared.This took approximately 1 minute for all of it to happen.Then the entire cloud lit up and my wife told me it wasn't as bright as the one she had seen then a few minutes later the cloud lit up again. That part of the event was over and then I witnessed the flashing lights of an airplane fly off in an easterly direction.

Location: Gilford, NH, west-shoreline of Lake Winnipesaukee. We were viewing the last beautiful moments of light looking across the lake when my wife exclaimed, &#8220;Look at that!&#8221;  Looking to where she was pointing a glowing yellow light was visible.  It appeared somewhat stationary, though slight movement to the right and to the left was occurring.  The underside of the cloud that the light was in front of appeared illuminated within close proximity to the emitting source.  It lasted for about 2-3 seconds and then disappeared.  I kept waiting for it to emerge from the cloud but to no avail it did not. It was about the size of golf ball, relative to a softball sized Moon. We next witnessed the ""Orb"", for lack of a better word, in front of the next cloud over to the right, which was fairly close to the first yet separated by a light bluish, slight turquoise hewed darkening sky. I never saw a shape depart the first cloud to get in front of the second. The sight was more or less the same, a glowing yellowish Orb that lasted for about 2-3 seconds.  We witnessed this again slightly to the left of the first sighting.  It was then that the first of several ""Linked Orb Movements""  appeared.  The light was ON and then OFF and when it came back on it had moved approximately 10 times the width of the object to another position.  In a skipping fashion we watched the Orb turn OFF&ON each time moving a segment of length across the sky.  We now refer to this type of sighting as a ""Link"", representing the skipping movement that appeared to be in a set of connected links. We most definitely now felt that we were being treated to a spectacular visual occurrence.  From the nearby Laconia airport we heard an airplane approaching.  It was ""healthy""  to hear this plane because we then knew that what we were witnessing was indeed noiseless and NOT A PLANE.  The propeller driven small plane, clearly visible in the sky was climbing, having just taken off. Upon approaching the spot of the second Orb sighting in front of the cloud, another ""Orb"" illumination flashed just below and to the left of the small plane.  This Orb was slightly larger than the others and appeared to be almost doubled, as if two of these Orbs were present with one being slightly behind the other.   The lake area was absolutely noiseless with the exception of the sound of the propeller from the plane.  We were both startled that there was not a collision.  It was very close. Afterwards we saw one of the Orbs in a stationary position and then it simultaneously emitted in perfect-arced unison, four distinct other Orbs.  At no point was there a trail of smoke or cloud associated with any of these sightings. The intensity of the light was constant and the arc formed one quarter of a circle. There was not a trail of light from any other place other than from the Orbs.  Once again all was noiseless.  All of the Orbs had the same yellowish hue.  We witnessed two more of these types of occurrences as well as two or three more of the skipping""Links"", one of which made seven distinct links across the sky, and appeared to be moving towards the South West, across the lake. Lastly we saw to our left (looking westward) two single sightings as well as the last of the emitting type, of which two Orbs were emitted, once again simultaneously. With that the event was over.  At about this time a boat was traveling up the lake and once again it was ""healthy""; to here a sound.  It was loud, certainly identifiable and indeed affirmed that WHAT WE WITNISSED TRULY MADE NO SOUND.  We remained at the lake for another 15-20 minutes with the hopes of seeing something else. We did not. Sound travels well over the relative flat surface of the lake.  Given the size of the objects that we saw the biggest mystery to us other than their incredible movement has to be the complete silence that was associated with all visual sightings.  These without doubt were not flares, helicopters or jet planes. I am a licensed private pilot, completing a B.S. in Meteorology and very much believe in the scientific method.

At the time of the occurrence, it was 9:20 pm and was still fairly light out. as i neared the intersection of route 109 and 25 in Moultonborough New Hampshire, something very bright like a fireball caught the top corner of my eye over a large field with mountains in the distance. i pulled over at the intersection and got out of my car and looked up at the sky and didnt see anything and thought that maybe it was a reflection. with the thought of it still in my head i was driving east down route 25 looking up at the sky and then i saw the fireball flash again. i immediately pulled over and got out of my car and watched where it went. the object then reversed it's direction and went the other way. just as i noticed the object reverse direction,  another object identical to the first at a very fast speed came from behind the trees and went the opposite direction the other object was going. I then observed that each of the objects were circling each other. After standing around for about 2 minutes both objects took a complete 90 degree turn and were bombing toward each other at very high speeds. at the moment they were closest to each other, one of the objects blew up into a huge fireball and and kept on going. That object then turned around and started the same routine with circling the other object. Like the first time, they bombed toward each other and at the closest point, one of the objects blew up into a fireball but this time emitting two(2) smaller aircrafts much smaller than that of the other ones. The object that emitted the two smaller aircrafts suddenly dissapeared. At this point, i knew this was unusual activity and that this was no military practice. It looked as if there was a war going on between the aircrafts. These aircrafts were noticeable as they contained constant flashing white lights. After seeing this activity, i quickly sped off  toward home. before i got to where i live i saw 2 other cars stopped on the other side of the road watching and pointing at the weird activity in the sky. ! i stoppe d breifly and was glad to see that the other people in the cars were seeing what i was seeing.

These lights would stay within the cloud, one circling the whole perimeter of the cloud and the other one back and forth and occasionaly crisscrossing.  Sometimes they appeared to be inside of the cloud and that is why I do not think they were airport lights.  I decided to vidio tape them but due to the city lights around I was not sure I was recording them.   I did get maybe a couple of minutes before I stopped recording and left for work.

BRIGHT CIRCULAR UFO THAT HOVERS OVER CARLTON COUNTY MINNESOTA,Barnum,MN,2001-08-18T22:30:00,circle,5 minutes,"Occurred : 8/18/2001 22:30  (Entered as : 08/18/01 22:30) Reported: 9/13/2002 7:02:22 PM 19:02 Posted: 9/19/2002 Location: Barnum, MN Shape: Circle Duration:5 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25051.html,"BRIGHT CIRCULAR UFO THAT HOVERS OVER CARLTON COUNTY MINNESOTA I was driving north east with a friend from the Barnum fair on a Sunday evening.  We took the Mattawa exit from I35 and were headed due east.  The road probably is about 3-5 miles long until it meets another paved road at an intersection.  Anyways, we were both chatting about the fair and in a relaxed state, when I noticed due east in the sky above a large brilliant bright light.  My friend assumed it was venus, but it looked so low and to big to me.  I drove straight on the same road and we stared at it for about 2 miles straight.  Then I stopped at the stop sign and was preparring to take a left as it is the route home, and just as I stopped the Circle began to move due north across the sky, it moved quicker than a plane, and was such a bright light.  It's motion was not jerky however, it moved very quickly and fluidly to our left (north) and after 5 seconds we lost site of it due to large pines in our obstructing our view.  I looked at my friend and he looked at me like did we really just see that.  I then took the turn left, and drove on the road towards Finks Berry Farm, and on the way we still couldnt see the circle until we drove about a half mile on the road to where the trees end and a large open vield is present.  I slowed down immediatley cause to our suprise the circle was suspended over the field and looked relativly closer and lower than previously.  It remained in sight for at least 5 seconds, because once again we looked at eachother in amazement, and then back at the circle.  Suddenly the brilliantly light object shut off its lights, much like a  flash light, it was light the light sucked in quickly to a focal point, and I could still faintly make out the structure as it was a very stary night.  We both talked later and agreed that after it's lights we're cut off we could still make the outline of a metallic object reflecting light from the heavens, we saw the body of the craft/or whatever it was,, for less than 5 seconds, and then it was gone.  I didn't see it move or anything, it was! like th e lights went out, but we could still make out the outline of it, and then suddenly that just disappeared.  It was the strangest thing in the world and I still am fixed on learning what the hell it was.  I havent seen any strange objects in the night sky since, and I don't know if I want too.  Me and my pal talked about here and there throughout the school year, and our conversation always consisted of man I'm glad you were with, and we know what we saw and we can collaborate that it was real.  We also both agree that what we saw was not a shooting star, because it moved slower than that and it hovered..... It was so odd, I just wish I had a camera on me, but it seems like things like this happen when we're off guard.  Just some quick facts about the area where we saw the UFO.  The carlton county area is a farm area, with many cows and other barn yard animals.  It is an extremely rural area, with woods and some rolling hills, but mainly flat.  Me and my friend also realized that the point in the sky where we first caught sight of this bright light was in a due line with the road.  Interesting thing about this is that at the intersection where I stopped, the craft was roughly a quarter mile ahead of us, and before it moved it was positioned directly over a dirt road in an abandoned area.  See the road is paved in all directions at the intersection except east, or in other words right in front of us.  This is important I believe because there are cattle farms and an abundance of dear near the area.  I'd like to say what we saw was an illusion, but damnit it just wasn't, I know what I saw and so does my pal, and for the rest of my life I will never forget that night.",2002-09-19T00:00:00,46.5412,-92.6262

Last Wednesday, the 18th of September, my sister came to my apartment around 8:45 or so in the evening.  I live on a fairly high floor of an apartment building, facing the city of Harrisburg.  I was eating dinner and looking out my bedroom window, while also talking to my sister.  A bright yellow (almost planet-looking) light appeared in front of my eyes as I glanced out the window, and then just as suddenly, disappeared. I was curious as to what happened, and told my sister to check out the sky.  We both stepped closer to the window, and on the horizon, we both saw the same type of light appear a few inches away from the one I saw initially.  There were three other lights that did essentially the same thing (blink in, stay in plain sight for approx. 5-10 sec., and then dissappear).  About 15 min or so into seeing the yellow lights, a red light appeared to the lower right of the yellow ones.  It then proceeded to split into a triangle of three identical red lights, and then all simultaneously disappear.  The red formation occurred a few times.  During the second red light formation, i called a friend who lives about two miles further down Front St. in Harrisburg, and has access to the second floor.  He was able to see a red light, from his vandtage point, at the same time I was seeing it.  While the red and yellow lights were blinking in and out, there was a white light, that streaked from right to diagonal lower left (approx. 2 inches in length).  The streak occurred in a split sec. and was the only one we witnessed.  While all of these fairly steady, planet-looking lights were appearing, and then disappearing (not streaking, or fading, or even twinkling), there were much smaller (star-like) lights which were zig-zagging across the entire visible expanse of sky.  Initially, they looked like very distant airplanes, until they started erratically bouncing up and down, back and forth, and any which way.  My sister witness these ""bouncing stars"" as well. I have a steady job, friends, and family, all of whom will concede that i'm pretty down to earth.  (i've kept two cats alive for at least a few years).  I do have a fairly liberal view of the world in general, and tend to accept a lot, but not without some proof.  I can hardly believe what I saw, but I've witnessed almost as strange instances in the past.  The friend who I called on the evening of the 18th was the one who checked out this web site, and I felt compelled to send in this info. since other sightings in PA had been reported.  There was apparently a news report this past Sunday (the 22nd) stating that some sort of Airforce testing (flares in the sky so they could test heat-sensitive missiles) was occurring this month.  Whatever.  I 've seen flares in the sky.  They linger, and fade.  These lights DISAPPEARED!!!  I've also seen airplanes turn course in the night sky (they don't just disappear).  Whatever these lights were, I've never seen exactly what i saw on the night of the 18th.  I hope there are those out there who will take credence in (at least) three witnesses of a single event over a bull story from our fabulous government. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from Pennsylvania for this date.  We wonder whether the lights might have been advertising lights, but the witness insisted that such was not the case.

((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.  PD)) ((BEGIN ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ABOUT LAUNCH)) Air Force Test Missile Out West Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. ""The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,"" said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said.

If you know Lake Tahoe, we are on the north shore on the california side in TAhoe City, from our angle it looked like it was over Emerald Bay but a way higher altitude and more to the west. It started as a tighter looking vapor trail comming from a bright white sphere.  Over the next 2-3 minute the vapor became thicker wider.  After about 4 minutes from the initial sighting teh sphere gave off a big puff.  A ring like vapor cloud floated for about the next 3 minutes where it the ""puff"" occured.  From that point on the leading edge of hte sphere was the brightest and the vapors no longer came off only as a tight vapor tail but also as wispy trails arching like a parabola from it.  After about 7 minutes from inital sighting  it disappeared  but the vapor trail still glowed in the sun setting over the western mountains. My wife just came home and traffic in Kings Beach lake tahoe california stopped and many other people observed it. I believe it was a comet that streaked through the upper atmosphere and vaporized.

(AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. ""The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,"" said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. ""We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early,"" Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets.

What caught my attention was that these were the two brightest objects in that portion of the sky. It was a very clear night with no clouds.  The moon was very bright about 45 degrees above the horizon in the Eastern sky.  It did not take me long to realize that the lights which at first appeared as bright stars, one in front of the other, were actually moving on a straight course across the sky towards the Southeast.  At first I thought the two lights might have been connected.  I ran into the house and got binoculars.  By the time I came out there was only one light directly overhead.  Through the binoculars I could vaguely see some kind of structure illuminated by the single bright light.  As I was watching through the binoculars the light gradually faded out.  I assume the same thing happened to the other light (object) while I was getting the binoculars.  Although the speed across the sky was constant and similar to that of an airplane, there was no noise and no other lights.  It's not unusual to see the flashing lights of an airplane and not hear it.  I'm guessing that the objects were about 10 thousand feet elevation.  Could this have been a pair of stealth fighters going into stealth mode? ((NUFORC Note:  The Space Shuttle, followed by the Space Station, passed over Savannah at 20:04 hrs. on October 16, 2002.

It had all the characteristics of being a Satellite, such as altitude, flying in a straight line and speed equivalent to that of a Satellite. What I though odd about this object was that is was quite dim, which made it hard to visually track. I wondered why, being it was so high in the sky, didn't reflect the sun off of it? It most definitely had the altitude for the reflection.

The Space Shuttle, Atlantis, had undocked from the Space Station, and the Shuttle was several minutes ahead of the Station, preparing to return to Cape Kennedy on the following day (October 18, 2002). As we stood, scanning the evening sky to the west, searching for the Space Station, both of us witnessed a peculiar object STREAKING across the sky, covering an estimated 10-15 degrees of arc (from our vantage point), traveling from our right to left, in approximately 2-3 seconds.  The object appeared to have several point sources of light on it, perhaps 3 to 5 of them, each approximately the color of a green LED, and it subtended an arc of approximately one-half a degree, i.e. equal approximately to the width of a thumbnail held at arm's length.  At just about the time both observers commented on the object's appearance, it just faded from our vision in approximately 1 second, or less.  It appeared to travel at a constant angular velocity throughout the sighting, i.e. it did not appear to slow. Since it was just past dusk at the time, the object was not easily visible to us, except for its lights, although it appeared to have ""structure.""  During the short time we witnessed it, the several lights on the side facing us (its port side) did not appear to change position relative to each other.  Both witnesses were left with the distinct impression that they were looking at some kind of unidentifiable, solid object. The object's high angular velocity across the sky rules out any type of conventional aircraft.  Any aircraft moving across the sky at that angular velocity would have had to be close enough to the observers that its engine(s) would have been easily audible.  I have held a commercial pilot's license for over 25 years (flight instructor for 10 of those years), and the object was strikingly unlike anything I have ever witnessed. We discussed whether the object might have been a fragmented meteor in the extreme distance, following its terminal burst in the lower atmospere.  However, both observers felt that what they had witnessed was not consistent with such a scenario; there appeared to be some kind of ""structure"" between the lights of the object.

Within about a minute I saw a triangular group of what I thought was three stars in the northern sky, these were fairly bright compared to others around them. To my surprise, I noticed that all three stars were moving - together. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and looked away. I looked again and realized they were in fact moving and the three ""stars"" or lights maintained their exact distance and relationship to each other, as they moved. The shape was a very large thin triangle. As far as its size, holding my arm straight out the object looked like it measured about and inch and a half long and a half-inch wide at its base. It moved slowly through the sky in a southeast direction, with the single light at the front and the two other lights toward the direction it was moving from. All three lights were white and looked just like bright stars - there was nothing visible between them or it may have just been black. The triangle appeared to be very high up in the sky, above normal airplane elevation. I ran into the house and told my wife to come outside, she did. By this time, about 5 minutes after I first saw it, the triangle shape had moved toward the southeast and was nearly straight up in the sky. My wife also saw it and after another 30 seconds or so we lost sight of the triangle, as if it faded or the lights went out. There was no sound and the shape moved fairly slow. Facing north the cities of Milwaukee, then Kenosha, then Pleasant Prairie were under the objects path.

There was no sound. I was standing outside my apartment looking up at the night sky while the nearby football field lights illuminated and suffused the sky making it difficult to make out if there were a dense body between the lights. At first I assumed it was a single triangular craft, but upon reflection, I realize it  could have been three separate objects flying in formation. However the lights appeared to be disc-shaped and flat with a pale white glow to them more consistent with lights that might be built into the underside of a single craft. There were no usual red or green navigational lights or strobes at all. This group of three white lights would just fit behind my thumbnail held at arm's length or slightly larger. They seemed to slip through the air silently without reguard to their relative positioning along their lateral axis and were far off the normal flight paths of either high altitude passenger jets or of local air traffic. The spacing of the lights remained consistent throughout the viewing. I do not know if anyone else in Santa Barbara saw this. I have been watching for UFOs for over ten years and this is only the second one I have seen that qualifies as unexplained.

When it was almost staight overhead it seemed to slow down. It came to a dead stop almost directly overhead and stayed there about 5-10 minutes. I ran into my apartment and grabbed a cheap disposable camera and took a picture. Then I ran back in and grabbed my binoculars. The sphere was still overhead and I tried once to spot it thru the binoculars but failed. I found it again but before I could bring them up to my eyes the sphere started moving west again. It picked up speed for a short way then blinked in and out of my vision about three times and disapeared. It was a clear blue sky where it was located and I was looking north. It stopped shortly after crossing the north to south chemtrail and seemed to be at a much higher altitude. Size: if I held my hand out at arms length it would be about1/3-1/2 the with of my fingernail.",2002-10-15T00:00:00,39.50650741150443,-119.8174511061947

We had just moved into the county recently from the county just north of where we were driving. We turned down a old road and were heading west when I pointed out a spiral cloud in the sky to my wife. I reminded her of a television show we saw a week or so earlier that talked about spiral shaped clouds that migratory birds use to gain altitude for long journeys. The show also mentioned that these so called twist tubes were said to attract UFOs. Our younger backseat passengers took note and my wife and I ventured into different conversation. About a minute or so later my brother and law's friend said slowly in a calm voice, ""hey guys, I think there's something in the sky by that plane."" We all immediately looked into the sky and I saw an egg shaped disk approximately 1/6 the size of a commercial airliner which the object was following. Frustrated with trying to drive and look I pulled over hoping that this decision would not make me miss the event. When I stepped out I witnessed 9 to 10 seconds of object flight that convinced me that the truth really was out there. I saw the silver slightly elongated craft appear to taunt the jetliner as it moved back and forth quickly under the fuselage and stopping at window level. I would think that someone on the plane would have seen the object. I saw it go left of the plane a to the right of the plane's fuselage once, hesitating directly under the fuselage as it passed under. It then moved behind the tail of the plane, rolled out to the left, and faded up in altitude and out of sight quickly. When we all settled back into the car and took a breathe of air I barely had time before I excitedly pointed out two airplanes coming from the south or Dayton, Ohio area and how much quicker they were traveling than the robust air traffic in the almost crystal clear skies. Noone spoke a word as both! jets cr iss-crossed a path leaving jet fuel above an old aviary secret. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

The news: On Nov 1, 2002, from 2:30 AM to 6:00 AM, a UFO was hanging over the eastern sky of Yi-NING city, XinJiang Province (the province is located in Western China, near Russia). Four journalists observed and photoed this UFO from different angels and areas. On Nov 1 at 2:30 AM, one caller called the hotline of a newspaper and said ""come out, there is a flying saucer in the estern sky!"" One journalist said, over the eastern sky, he saw a bright rice sized object emitted  with yellow, blue, and pink lights. Around 4:20 AM, all fo the sudden, the object became big, the color changed to deep red, the shape is ball-like. The size of the object became 1/4 size of the moon that night. The surface of the object has different cycles. Later, the object moved to the south, a few seconds later, it became a rice size again. Around 6:05 AM, the object became big again, seconds later, it disappeared. A professor at Nanjing Scientific Observation of Chinese Science Academy studied 27 pictures took by the journalists, he believed the object came from somewhere rather than the earth, this is not a natural formation like weather etc. He said the object is NOT a ballon, airplane, cloud, rocket, or lights from skycrapers, neither a satellite because satellite won't be able to seen over the eastern sky of Xinjiang (Russia). He also estimated this object was turning and emitting some small objects, the height of this object was about 10000 meters above the earth.

At first I thought it was a shooting star, but then two more appeared and at first I thought, ""Weill that is odd"" and then a fourth appeared. They were all a glowing orange in a chevron shape and about the size of large stars. The first three flew in a V, one in front and two on either side and slightly behind. The fourth flew to the right of the three and just before disappearing fell into formation and the four were a diamond. I don't think that they were Earthly crafts because of how fast they flew and the odd orage glow they gave off.

While out mountain biking in Morgan Territory my friend and I, both avid sky watchers noticed a small bright object at 45 degrees above the horizon (near celestial equator), due south by southwest from the top of Morgan Territory Road.  The sun hadn't set and there was ample daylight.  The light was perfectly motionless and appeared brighter than any normal celestial object (including Venus).  It was not Venus or a satellite.  It was as bright or brighter than Venus at it crescent phase.  We didn't have binoculars but after 3 minutes or so, it faded and was lost.  Sitting and using a branch as a reference point, no discernable motion was evident.  It was first noticed visible through a cloud (cirrus) and would have never been seen except for the momentary interest of the cloud.  The cloud moved east, but the object didn't.   We were certain it was celestial until it disappeared.  I've found no record of any similar object in any of my web searches and I am a amateur astronomer familiar with most bad identifications of ""possible UFOs"".  It was clearly not a planet or any routine aerial phenomenon.  It was not a geosynchronous satellite flare because it was too bright - these are reported but never as daylight objects - these are night sky telescope objects.  It wasn't an Iridium flare because it was stationary.  I've seen those and the international space station in orbit.  It seems it could be include possible a very high altitude balloon (but seems that it would have remained visible or would have drifted), or it could be a bright, but previously unknown celestial event (such as a nova) but much shorter lived (gamma ray burst?), or ... some other unknown aerial phenomenon.  It would have been unlikely for a casual observer to notice it because of the relative brightness of the sky and small angular extent.  It wasn't until I gave a very explicit set of location information (relative to the cloud shape which attracted my attention) that my companion even could see it.

Camping at Alta Lakes, south of Telluride, CO (a 11,300 foot high lake on the continental divide, San Juan Mts.) Saw a white light with intensity twice that of a star. GPS coordinates of it's approximate location: 108.05 by 37.55. Since I camp all the time, and see things all the time, my first action was to see if it was just a planet, since Venus was out at the time. So I lined it up between two big trees that didn't move in the wind. It definately wobbled as it got closer to me. It was like it was trying to maintain it's position relative to me as it got closer so I wouldn't notice. I paniced and shuffled things into sleep mode, where I can hide locked up in the back of my truck with my .44 Magnum next to me, when all of a sudden three F-15s soared past me about 700 MPH. Two were on the other side of where it was, criss-crossing the area. I looked, and the light was gone. At least five F-15s (a couple could have been F-16s), scoured the area for over an hour after that. I thought I saw what looked like two orange lights comoing out of one, like it was shooting it's guns. Then I went to sleep and nothing else happened. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source.  Note:  If F-15's, or any other plane, flies by a witness at 700 mph, it is not a ""roar.""

We were tending our horses, as we do nearly every night. The horses graze on approx: 5 acres of open field. We usually park our Explorer near the barn, however this evening we parked in the wide open. We set up our chairs facing west,started a small charcoal fire in the Weber in prepartion to roast some hot dogs. We watched as the sunset, the sky grew dark and we began point out the usual constellations. We noticed want we thought be be the ""evening star"" in the lower western sky. As I tended the grill, my companion indicated she saw several shooting stars. At least an hour passed, we finished our meal, poured some coffee and relaxed. As i fiddled with the Weber, my companion said that the ""evening star"" was getting brighter and comming in our direction. As we watched the light grow in size, indicating that it was approaching, small colored lights became visible around the center light. I was the first to leave my lawn chair and got down on my hands and knees, the light had now become two very distinguishable ""head lights"". The lights were now about 300 yards away, just above the tree line which separated the two farms. At this point the head lights turned downward and two beams were now shining on the tree tops. The ""craft"" was now moving straight towards us, the light beams moving down the trees, unto the ground and were then shining on the horse's pond. We were scared!!! We watched and said many things to one another. There was no Sound!! As the beams moved up the hill towards us a third beam shone down from the rear or side of the ""craft"" to light up the earth from which the two front beams had already been. The pond was about 150 to 200 yards away from us and the lights stopped about half way down the hill. There was still no sound. It looked like one of those police helicopter search lights, but there were three of them and no sound. The beams began to move towards us again but now there was a sound like you hear when you are on a jet approaching the runway and the engines have decelerated just b! efore la nding. All the while we are whispering all kinds of scared stuff. The ground was now lit up just 50 yards or so infront of us. Whatever this thing was, it was right on us. Then the beams went off and the blinking could be seen on this black space above us.It slowly began to hover southward, leaving ""our space"" I stood and watched it accelerate as it climbed, not too high and began to head for the horizon. At that moment while facing south, another set of colored lights appeared just southwest of the spot we had/couldn't move from. These lights were alot farther away and they started heading eastward and took the same flight path as the first. We watched the second light cluster disappeared. I started to look around the rest of the sky and now I saw the same distant type light, very far up in the northwest sky. It was the samre light as the first, but it was traveling at a good clip across the northern sky, then the eastern sky and then disappeared on the horizon where the first two had gone.

When I camped there the next night (after scouring the whole area all day looking for a place to camp with a better view of that area so I could see it again, which there wasn't any because the stupid forest people closed all the dirt roads, so there was no way other than mountian climbing to get a better view of this - probably why they chose that area to do their thing so obviously), I saw thunderheads in a lower valley in the same area, so now I'm attributing the flashes to lightning far away in a much lower valley close to Buena Vista. They were also having some kind of celebration in Buena Vista, so they may have been doing fireworks (but why fireworks on Friday night and then none on Staruday? And that was only 12 miles away, and I think fireworks go higher than 10,00 feet, so I would have seen them clearly if that what it was). Anyway, I concluded that the flashes were lightning, even though not once did I hear any thunder, and it's weird that clouds would all be so low - all under 9,000 feet. All that time, while there were bright flashes every ten seconds, in the completely clear, pollution-free, cloudless sky, there were these UFOs going in and out of the area of the flashes. They randomly flashed red and green lights, not p! eriodic like regular planes (and car turn signals). They went into the area with the flashes, and then right after a flash, they came back up. Extremely high speeds - thousdands of MPH with no noise or acceleration time. It looked like the same ones I saw chasing a storm cloud from a commercial airliner in the Sierras in CA July 2001. Several times it looked like one would go and touch another one that was just hovering after it got hit ny lightning. It looked to me that they were sucking up lightning from the storm, then feeding it to ships that were more stationary. This went on for so long that I tried to take pictures. They were moving way too fast to see with binoculars. As soon as I got out the camera, they disappeared. Also, maybe this was just a conincidence since it was almost peak annual meteor shower time, but several shooting stars came from space and disappeared into the same area. They looked like normal shooting stars, but they burnt out and disappeared right where all of the action was. In my opinion, they saw that I got my camera out, and then disappeared. There were a couple of UFOs that didn't look like the gatherers (all you could see where the randomly flashing red and green lights), it was too dark and they didn't emit enough light to see them well enough to describe them. I did manage to get some shots, but I doubt they came out (I have yet to take the film in to get developed.). Got bored and went to sleep. I went back and camped the next night a little higher, 12,200 ft. on the west side of the dirt road so I could get a better view in case it happened again, but absolutely nothing happened, even the thunderheads in the valley, that I couldn't see before, produced no lightning or thunder. Lots of shooting stars, but none that headed into that area again. One of the most obvious and flagrant display of UFO activity I've ever seen, and I see a lot because I camp at high elevations and look about twice a month all over the U.S. I think they didn't care because the only area I know of with l! ess peop le is Canyonlands Nat'l Park, Utah. I need a camera that will record this stuff!!!",2002-08-16T00:00:00,38.875,-106.2531

The flashing light in tthe sky caught my eye, and at first I thought they were spotlights shining up from tbe ground as they do sometimes for movie premiers or grand openings.  I thought it was such a foolish thing to do at 3AM.  The more I watched the more interested I became.  At first I was attracted by the pattern the lights were making, then I realized the lights were not emenating from a completely stationary source, and at about the same time discerned that the beams were not in fact coming up from the ground.  I was sure of this as they were shining through the only cloud I could see in the sky.  the cloud itself was interesting in that it appeared to have a clear though pitch black center and was itself approximately circular shaped.  The lights themselves repeated a pattern; they would efveidently ""cluster"" (for lack of a better word) around a center slightly forward and to the left of the cloudless center and then would shine or fly outward in four or five different directions, evenly spaced apart, forming a circle.  If the spacing of the lights was any indication of an object behind the clouds, the thing would have been huge!  The more I observed the more certain I was that the beams of light were not seperate from an object, as individual light objects forming a pattern and flying independently, but were from a fixed point though I couldn't quite track a beam through the clouds.  That could be explained as lights shining down from the bottom of something moving along a ""track"" and going back to a center point.  I can't think of an analogy.  I bbecame aware tthat the lights were getting closer and that they could actually be coming from something quite low to the ground.  I got scared and went inside.  But I heard one of my neighbors come home and went out front to the parking lot and pointed the lights out to him.  We watched them for a few minutes and he said he had seen them! before, that they were a secret government project ""designed to make us look crazy""., mind you he'd been drinking, so I don't know what to make of his comment.  I looked up again and the lights had again shifted towards the side of the building that the parking lot is on and seemed to be coming closer.  I again went inside.  I was scared an excited and ddidn't know what to think.  The only thing I could hear when I was outside were crickets, absolutely nothing else until my neighbor's car pulled in.  I realized my cats were still outside and stepped out one more time, it was still there and this time started moving closer right away and was almost directly overhead.  That really shook me up.  I debated calling the police or the news but didn't want to sound like a nut.  I was afraid that by the time anyone offical checked it out it would be long gone, it had already been there for at least a half hour.  This time I went on my computer and instant mesaged a freind that had come on line and told her what I was seeing.  After 15 minutes I decided to look and see if it was still there.  It was gone, so was the cloud, and the night was suddenly warm whereas before it been decidely chilly even though the weather forecast had called for a relatively warm night (finally).  I seem to recall reading something about ufos creating clouds but couldn't find any descriptions that matched what I saw.  Especially the distinctive pattern of lights.  They were all white, no other colors.  So are there any logical explanations other than a UFO?  Are these the nice ones or the meanies?  Should I step out and greet them the next time?  If there is? ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM SAME SOURCE, SUBMITTED JULY 27, 2002)) Previous report and update plus one several years ago I reported the sighting already on 5/28/2002.  I wanted to request further information.  I really am curious to see if anyone else has reported anything similar to what I saw.  I'm not convinced it was a craft but for the fact that the light couldn't have been traveling through the cloud from the ground, I would have seen the light path as it passed through.  Secondly the circular clound surrounding the event and the chill as well as the silence and then the sudden disappearance (though I didn't witness it leave) convince me that this was more than just an average light or cloud.  If not a UFO what else could it have been?  I was being facetious about the alien contact comment.  It was late and I was rather ashamed of myself for getting so scared.  I've looked through numerous entries on you site and others and haven't found anything quite like it.  And though I distinctly remember reading something about UFO's hiding in circular clouds I cannot find anything confirming this.  There are numerous UFO sightings in the Tacoma/Lakewood area.  One night several years ago my daughter, a ffriend and I saw lights streaking across the sky betweem Tacoma and Puyallup, then they hovered and took off again, we all agreed it could not have been a plane and that was confirmed when we listened to the rradio, numerous people called the station and saw what we saw.  Interestingly even though we are near an airforce and army base there were no aircraft in pursuit.  We see planes all the time in this area, of all types.  This did not appear to be a plane.  So though a long time skeptic, I'm becoming a believer.  Aliens?  I don't know, but I'd love to find out.

Dawn was imminent and the sky was bright and clear with an intermittent light high cloudiness. The jet was in sunlight, I was not. I was noticing the contrail was made by four engines (wing-mounted), a little more unusual to see these days. So, probably a large airliner or military transport. As I was working this out, I noticed a steady bright spot just east of the contrail, approximately due east of me. Only Venus or maybe Jupiter would shine so brightly, but this was roughly 40 degrees above the horizon and perhaps just a tad larger than Venus at its best. Besides, it's been all over the media that all the bright planets are currently grouped in the west just after sunset. I noticed the object did not seem to move, so it wasn't an airplane or satellite (Later I checked with the Starry Night planetarium program, and no bright planets or stars were in that part of the sky. Any satellites that showed up in the program were moving much too fast.) I noticed the contrail was drifting eastward, toward the object, which appeared stationary. I ran in and grabbed a pair of 20x50 binoculars. By the time I returned, just a few minutes (3?) had passed but the contrail was now east of the object, drifting and spreading. I had the impression the object was much higher altitude than the contrail, but did not witness the one cross the other. The object had not moved. If it were moving as a star or planet, it would not have moved far enough in the short time to be noticeable, however. I leaned against my car to help steady the binocular image. Focus was consistent with a very distant object. It was still small, but not a point source, and appeared to be somewhat rectangular, or possibly a cylinder if it were oriented roughly NW-SE and pointed down about 60 degrees toward the northwest. It was bright white, I assumed by reflection of the coming Sun, but there were two much brighter round spots on the north, lower-facing side. These were so bright they must have been bright lights or direct specular reflections of the Sun. The light was not colored, appearing white. I watched it for a total time of at least ten minutes, during which time I did not perceive any motion, neither gross translation nor wobble nor spin. Angular size was very small, perhaps 5 arcminutes. I returned about an hour later, after the Sun had risen, but between the bright sky and a slight overcast, was unable to reacquire the object. If I had to guess, I'd say the jet I saw was roughly 20,000 feet altitude (did not appear to be on approach to PDX, of which I see plenty), the high thin cloud layer at roughly 25,000, and the object high above the clouds at 45,000 feet (which would make a 5 arcminute object around 65 feet long). Surface winds were still, but according to the weather service winds flowed west to east at 40 knots up at 37,000 feet, slower at lower levels (surface calm, 5,000' < 10 knots; 10,000' 10-20 knots, all W to E). Witness is a licensed pilot, amateur astronomer and space educator, familiar with most things in the sky.",2002-06-12T00:00:00,45.3573,-122.60679999999999

At around 10:00 AM today (8/17/02), I was flying a small RC airplane at about 600 feet when I observed a round bright red object above and north of the model plane. It seemed like the object was much higher in altitude. It may have been up several thousand feet or more.  It appeared to be a round bright red light. The size, relative to arms length was about 0.15 inch in diameter. It was like looking at a really bright LED from 20 feet. The sun was behind me, not obscured by clouds and may have been illuminating the object uniformly, if it was translucent. It seemed to be self-illuminated, it's red light seemed to be brighter than it should have been from ordinary reflected light. The only thing I can think of that would get the same visual effect, would be a large red tinted mirror reflecting the sun directly to me. The light intensity didn't vary at all. When I told the other person at the field to look up at the ""red light"" above my plane, he said ""what is that""? Later, he said it must be a ""weather balloon"".  The object was in view for about 2 to 3 minutes as it moved SE (the direction of the prevailing wind at ground level).  The object suddenly disappeared as it approached almost over head. The object was sighted at about 50 degrees elevation and went to about 80 degrees before vanishing. Since I was keeping an eye on my RC plane, I'm not sure if the object was moving when I first sighted it. For the first 10 or 15 seconds, it didn't seem to be moving. I had an instant fear that it was somthing like a very large meteor heading right at us (since it didn't have a tail). The RC plane is very light and flies very slowly. I was able to orbit the plane between me and the object so I could watch both of them at the same time. If it had not just disappeared, I would be more inclined to believe it was some kind of high visibility weather balloon. We didn't see anything (like a parachute) falling in the area (Burlington MA). I have 20/15 vision and today the sky was clear enough easily to see hawks flying in thermals at several thousand feet AGL. Does the weather bureau use this kind of bright red translucent balloon? Do they release them on Saturday mornings?",2002-08-28T00:00:00,42.505094755244755,-71.20454090909091

I came  up to them and asked why they were looking up in the night sky. They told me that they had heard that there would be a passing of the ISS at 03:55 that AM. I was to clock on at 04:00 so I thought I would whatch the event myself. My understanding was that the ISS would be passing from the SW. We whatched awile and then one of my co-workers said ""There it is!"" It was passing from the SE. It was slightly orange. My friend said that he had seen the ISS pass before and it had been ""a bright white light"" and ""slowly moving"". We watched it move from the SSE towards the NNW we saw that it started to accelerate, maintained its accelaration and shortly after it passed over us it made a radical 180 degree turn of very tight trajectory; almost back on its previous course and continued to accelerate back to the SSE and speed out of sight. The object did not change color coming or going. I was a Naval aircraft mechanic from 1968-1971 and do not believe that this was an aircraft presently in our inventory nor do I believe that we have vehicles that could demonstrate the technology necessary to achieve the air display that I witnessed.

On Christmas Day night at 6:42 p.m. a family of 4 were on their way from Sioux City, Iowa to Omaha, Nebraska on I-29 (southbound, about 3 miles north of the North Omaha Exit which turns west on I-680) when they sighted a lighted object about 1/2 mile ahead of their vehicle.  As their vehicle neared the white-lighted object, they saw that it was hovered near the opposite side of I-29 approximately 500-600 feet ahead and diagonally to their left (SE) of the witnesses' vehicle, at an estimated altitude of 500 feet.  (Investigation shows that the cloud ceiling was 2,200 feet, so we at least know that the object was below 2,200 feet.  Without the ability to be more specific, what seems obvious is that the sighting was close, and at fairly low altitude.)  Traffic on the northbound side of I-29 had slowed down drastically, with 4 vehicles pulled over, and with at least one individual standing outside his vehicle looking up at the object.  The bright lights, seeming to present a visual crown effect, and perceived by the witnesses to be somewhat smaller than an airliner, suddenly did a ""back flip"" - that is, the lights did a 360 degree turn, as the object rose straight up and ascended through the cloud ceiling.  Three (3) of the four (4) witnesses were interviewed at the site, the father and two adolescents, age 11 and 12.  The adult witness is a thoughtful type individual, with no apparent desire to embellish or over-conclude.  The two adolescents are intelligent youth, fascinated and amazed by what they saw and articulately willing to share their perception of the incident.  They exhibited nothing giddy or frivolous as they described and drew sketches of their perceptions of the incident.  As an investigator, I consider this a multiple witness sighting with 3 good witnesses, who from their position in the family van had a good vantage! point f rom which to view an anomalous object.  While this is essentially a ""lights in the sky"" kind of sighting, with only an impression of curved edges, which might suggest a boomerang or disk,the bright lights, the low altitude, the nearness of the object to a heavy trafficway, and the report of a ""back-flip"" as the object rose straight up, make it an interesting case for examination, even though no other reports were called in to local law enforcement, and FAA at Eppley Airfield indicated nothing unusual on radar.",2002-05-14T00:00:00,41.5824,-95.9205

Toward the end of the journey something was said about stoping and visiting a similiar time and place like the one they had picked me up in...and this they did...it was a country desert area and the people were very common and friendly...we didn't stay long...they didn't want to attract attention from any of the local authorities ""they said""...

I was somewhere between Gray Mountain and the Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, when I witnessed a very strange light to my right in the dusk sky that looked like some sort of flying aircraft, but I couldn't really see anything of the craft except an very bright light being emitted from its underside, down in a beam like pattern for perhaps 100 feet, although it is very difficult to judge distances in the sky.  It was not completely dark yet, but the light was certainly bright enough to stand out much more than any faint stars in the distance.  I would estimate the object to be a few thousand feet high, and to the south of the object a mountain peak in the distance gave some sense of depth and height perception.  I was driving about 80 miles per hour and the area is quite flat as you head back to Flagstaff, and I studied the object for about 20 seconds, while trying to determine whether it was a plane or some sort of hovering helicopter.  I thought perhaps the craft was heading back to the Grand Canyon Airport, but it didn't seem to be moving at all. On the horizon, out where the Grand Canyon airport could be, maybe 60-80 miles away, I could see a blinking light that most definitely an airplane off in the distance.  It occurred to me that as I looked at this craft, it looked surprisingly enough just like a ""flying saucer"" would if it were hovering and just emitting a large beam of light from its underside.  The beam spread out from the bottom of the object in a solid ray pattern, and I realized that I should take a picture of it with my digital camera.  As I began to slow down the car, which took about 20 seconds, there were some trees on the side of the highway that kept interrupting my view of the craft slightly.  As I was pulling past the sparsely populated stand of trees I could see that the light was beginning to rise slightly in the sky and a cloudy material was beginning to surround it.  In less that 10 seconds, the light rose probably several hundred feet, and as it did the cloudiness, or smoke, or whatever enveloped it.  Before I even got my camara turned on, it just disappeared in the smoke, the light was gone, and I couldn't see anything else in the twilight, except still the blinking light of an airplane very far in the distance on the horizon.  I sat there mesmerized for a couple of minutes, trying desperately to see something else, but could see nothing, and then I was trying to determine if the cloudiness around the ship was really clouds or not.  There were a few clouds in the distance, but none at all in that area of the sky.  While I watched, the foggy sort of cloudiness eventually dissepated, within about five minutes it was gone and the area where the craft had been was clear and open sky. I was very dissapointed that I didn't get a picture of it, I'm not really sure what I saw, but it was definitely not any sort of flying object I'd ever seen.  I told my fiancee Lorie about it that night, and she didn't really know what to think about it.  I have been very hesitant to submit this report, and was actually waiting for a while to see if anyone else reported seeing the object on the same night.  I felt that I should at least give an account of what I saw in case anyone else witnessed it.  I have no explanation for how it vanished, and I admit that it sounds very skeptical that it disappeared before I could even get a picture of it, but as God is my witness, this is a true account of my experience on that night.  I am a chiropractor in Ontario, Canada, and was actually on a trip to look at offices for sale because I will be relocating to the western United States this year.  I had taken a day off to go to the Grand Canyon and was returning from my sightseeing day there when I witnessed this unidentified flying object.  I will not forget what I saw and it was unlike anything I expect to witness again.",2002-05-14T00:00:00,35.2633131147541,-111.52902404371584

Friday afternoon this witness reports getting out of his truck after getting home from work and seeing an object in the sky. Witness writes...""I stood at the end of the drive and watched as it held it's position for 20 minutes. At that point I ran into the house and grabbed my digital camera. I ran back out to the end of the drive and it was still there in the same position. My neighbor across the street was out in her front yard and I called to her to come look at the object. I asked her if she saw something above the tree line. She replied ""Yes!"" and asked ""What is that?"" I replied ""I have no idea but I am not going to miss an opportunity to photograph it!"" I then proceeded to take the pictures I am sending you. My neighbor noticed that it was not round and that it looked like it had a wobble in it's movement or rotation. I started to take more pictures when my wife pulled in to the drive. I asked her if see saw the object and she said ""Yes."" She also asked what it was. At this time I looked back up at the object and it was starting to move, very slowly, to the East."" The object moved to the east against the wind. There was no noise and as he was looking through the lens of his camera, he noticed the object was ejecting small black objects to the north west...seven total...and then it began to move again. The couple went in the house and returned 45 minutes later to leave for dinner and watched the object from the car. ""As we drove across the hill towards Lake Oswego I noticed that I could still see the object and it still looked to be the same size. After dinner I made a quick scan of the sky and could not find the object"" the witness wrote. It was estimated that the object was at around 10,000 feet because of scale to passing aircraft in the PDX pattern and angle to horizon. Update: June 26, 2002... OUFOR team member and investigator Cameron Johnson followed up this sighting with some phone calls to the NOAA in Portland regarding weather balloons as well as a local police department for other sighting reports. He found that standard weather balloons used in Oregon are 3 to 4 feet in diameter and are taupe (tan) or red in color. The only place that the balloons are released in Oregon is in Salem and, during daylight savings time are released between 4 and 5 p.m. The balloon telemetry recorded the drift being to the South East from Salem. When asked about the possibility of a balloon hanging at a fixed position for a long period of time, he said that it was not possible because the balloons are in a constant state of ascent and the telemetry corroborated his statement. He gave a official statement that it could not have been a NOAA balloon. The attempt at finding other sighting reports from the police department yielded no results.

My brother & I were observing what we thought to be a helicopter coming in from the East.  As it got closer, my brother asked me if that was a helicopter.  I looked back at it, & at first I said yes, just then it changed shape into a triagular shape, I made the comment ""Is that the Stealth"", I had heard that the Stealth had flown over Spokane 2 days prior to that.  Then I commented that it couldn't be the stealth because it was moving far to slow.  At that time it turned back into a sperical shape.  It had moved closer to us.  It was approximately between 40 to 50 degrees in relation to the Earth.  We then observed that there was some kind of a sail on top of it.  The sail would go clockwise for awhile then it would go counter clockwise, it kept doing that.  At the same time, it seemed to be wobbling.  We got the impression that it was having some kind of mechanical problems.  It would also every once in awhile shrink into a smaller sphere, then expand again a few seconds later.  The object was Jet black and had a white aura around it.  Twice that I seen lights blinked on in a circular motion around the object.  One time a beam of light shot straight out from it across the sky.  It made the sound of heavy machinery far off.  We all also felt a vibration from it.  It is strange but the vibration seemed to be very calming.  After the first 5 minutes or so of observing it, I noticed The CNA Wendy at the door.  I called her out to see it.  She came out, & she looked for a while, then ran back inside and grabbed several other CNA's & Nurses to come out & look.  There was approximately 14 of us outside at that time.  They all heard and felt it just the same way as we did.  We discussed all the possiblites of what it could be, & there was no explanation other than UFO that fit.  The object was moving very slowing, from East to West.  When it was almost directly ! overhead it started moving straight up in the sky until it was just a little pin point.  One of the CNA's (she did not observe) was so interested in our siting that she has been checking into it ever since.  She found out that on the 3rd floor of the hospital several patients, nurses, & even 1 doctor had observed the UFO also.

I was loading my truck with a suitcase when I glanced up and saw due north of their home a large dimly lit orange/yellow/red sphere.  My estimate is it had a diameter of at least 200 feet as it was 4 times the size the barn that it was hovering over (barn was 50 ft high) and it was at least 200 fet over the barn.  The object was hovering over the neighbors farmstead, namely the barn.  I quickly ran into the house and told my brother and my sister in law what I had seen, they said it was a helicopter.  When they came out it was gone.  I did not argue with them about it.  Just minutes earler to my sighting the Northwest 10:00 pm flight to Peoria, IL from Minneapolis, MN had flown over my brothers place, but always runs 10-5 minutes so exact time is within 5 minutes (I have flown it frequently on business).

I live on a mountain in Pennsylvania..,  and from time to time i will see one or two large bright lights hovering over the tree tops of the woods a few acres from our house.  The lights will not blink and are one steady bright white light that moves around- often moving fast when it/they decide to shoot upwards. This past May 2002., i've noticed there were two lights.    One would hover over the trees, and then dip into the forest floor and remain there for over 10 minutes. The light is so bright that you could see it through the foilage. The other light remained over the tree tops and remained stationary for several minutes, then moved right in a straight fashion over the trees.   Then it would change direction in mid-air and move left-wards. Then it would raise upwards and shoot up fast into the Universe while the other light remained on the forest floor.       I was too tired to stay and watch if it also would raise. The next night,  I saw nothing.,  and both nights were clear. I usually see just one of these lights moving in these same strange ways..,  and my mother has seen them for decades in the same area.    The last two years were the first times i ever noticed them or had been awake that late. The lights make no noise whatsoever.,   i have seen them while outside of my home. One time i was coming home late from my boyfriend's home., and noticed one light hovering over a newly built house in the farm field- right near the roadside.   It was as close to the ground as a bird flying., and was quiet. The next few minutes later, i'd peek out the window, and it was gone. I've seen many a helicopter at night., but these lights don't move like helicopters or make any sound.   Also, i've seen these lights from 12:30 to 2:30 am.  when the local aircraft isn't aloft. Also,  the lights seem to be interested in the wooded area  near our house and remain hovering throughout that area.   We live in a rural area that used to be a dairy farm nieghborhood.  It has lots of prairie-like fields, and Wetland areas with coyote, deer and bear,herons, and other waterfowl throughout the area. I have to note that i'm not confusing these lights with the planet Venus that is brighter than the other stars..   Because at the time i see the UFO's  Venus is located on the other side of our house. These UFOs are primarly seen in Fall, and Early Spring.  I havent' seen them since May, but have seen them off and on for two years now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date is approximate.

I live 2 miles from the locaton of the possible abduction/death of Todd Sees.  I also live ((deleted)) to someone that knew him well. There seems to be a lot of cover up and misinformation surrounding this case. My friends ((deleted)) work with Todd Sees father. ((deleted)) is related to the ((deleted)) of Todd Sees. The ((deleted)) best friend and Todd's son were part of the search party, and helped retrieve the body.  They are the only eye witness (I've found) so far as to actually viewing the body. The dogs never picked up his scent. nor found his missing clothes.  The body was found on Monday night at 9 pm.  So he'd been out in the heat and humidity for 39 1/2 hours.  He should have been swelling from body gasses at that time.  But he was emaciated (as per the ufo report.  This has not yet been verified). The 4 wheeler was at the top of the ridge.  His body was found face down, 25 yards from his house. He was wearing only his boxers.  There was a spot on his right forehead that was showing signs of decay, the rest of his body was intact.  He was holding his throat (suffocating?)   An allergic reaction to bee venom, could have cause his throat to close and he might have suffocated (but no bee stings found)   And why call in the FBI for bee or snake bite?  He had a red rag tied around his right arm and there was a dead rattlesnake beside him. They expected to find puncture wounds from a snake bite, but there were no puncture wounds any where.  If he'd been snake bit... there would be a good sized blackened area of necrotic tissue, surrounding the punctures.  As far as snake bite goes, this was a strong, athletic, 38 year old male.  Rattlesnake venom, would most likely NOT have killed him at all.  He would have been able to find his way home in time to get to a hospital.  With snake venom, he might have had some nervous system problems... disorientation, tremors etc. The report that I heard yesterday was really bogus; ""We think he was stung by bees, but because his body was so decayed you couldn't see welts from the stings nor find venom in his system.""  His body wasn't decayed.. and a toxicology report has not been filed.  And if he were being stung, why would he remove his clothing?  I'd jump on the 4 wheeler and head down hill. There are two conflicting reports about the one shoe.  UFO report says it was in a tree.  The police report says beside the 4 wheeler.  Why would he take off his shoe, (maybe so he could remove his bibbed cammy pants?)  But if he did this, why would he leave the road?  This is a very wooded area, hard to walk through.  The road would lead straight home, yet he chose to take to the undergrowth and forest.  There were no keys, no other clothing found. When my friends ((deleted)) asked questions of Todd's father, ((deleted)) told her that everyone was told they COULD NOT SPEAK ABOUT IT.   ((deleted)) says his father, the wife, the son the friend (who both saw the body), are not talking and are still just 'stunned'. I was told they're acting very strange.. no expressions, just scared and emotionless.  The father did say that they don't know any more than the general public. Now... here's the worst thing;   If he was stung by bees or snake bit... why were special agents (they say FBI) brought in?   Why did they take over?  Why was no one allowed near the body?  AND... no one was called to identify the remains.  No one, not even the wife was allowed to view the body.   There was a funeral, with a closed coffin.  NO ONE WAS EVERY ALLOWED TO SEE THE BODY.   The family has said they doubt that there was a body in the coffin. As for the reports by the local farmers, and the fishermen on the Susquehanna river:  Pennsylvanian's are VERY simple people.  They don't like change and they live very simple lives.  I haven't found any one, in the 3 years since we moved here, that has a belief in ET's, UFO's etc.  They would just laugh it off if that were ever suggested.  If they made a report of a strange sighting, then you can be sure they were telling the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received other information from this witness.

(AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. ""The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,"" said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. ""We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early,"" Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. ""Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is,"" Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana.

(AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. ""The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly,"" said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. ""We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early,"" Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. ""Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is,"" Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability. ((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS))",2002-09-28T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

Walking at top of Topanga Canyon overlooking Pacific Ocean.  In sky over ocean a huge, spherical, object pushed through the clouds.  It appeared about 100 times larger than a blimp and was primarily bright white.  It emerged from the north, sat high above the horizon, then moved south.  It had a stream of orange flame, as if from a engine.  It also had contrails in all directions as if exploding, almost.  This went on for about 10 minutes, then the white area became triangular and the contrails formed a Z, and then slowly formed other shapes as white shape faded to greenish blue.  All the dogs in the area were howling (except mine, which isn't saying anything as he's slightly retarded). At first I thought this was the moon, but the moon was already appearing in the southern sky.  Then I thought it was a refraction of setting sunlight reflecting off the ocean and through the clouds, but it appeared extremely three dimensional and extremely bright.  If it was refraction, I've never anything quite like it. I've never reported UFO sightings before.  I have never seen one and was frightened and alarmed and turned on the tv to see if we were in trouble.  I am a professional journalist, respectably published, sober, and generally a skeptic.

These were large lights. At one time early in the sighting one of the red lights split into two red lights and faded at the same time. After we had watched these lights for about 10 minutes my husband stood up to to walk down to the surf to reel his fishing line in and suddenly just beyond the surf and very close to us, four white lights lit up one at a time in a row as if they were attached to something, I yelled at my husband to look up and he also witnessed them. These lights stayed lit for about 3 to 5 seonds and faded out. Just after these lights when out the red lights on the horizon lit up again. One at a time the red lights would light up and fade after about 3-5 seconds. I ran into the house to get binoculars and told my father in law to come out and watch. He came out with me and my husband said while I was in the house 2 more red lights had lit up in the sky. As soon as I sat down 2 more red lights lit up and one of the lights emitted a beam from the side of it and within the beam were small white lights in a row.

Assuming it was a rescue helicopter bound for the University of WI Hospitals and Clinics ER, I looked away and finished washing up. When I looked again, I noticed the light had become somewhat brighter, and had not moved from the spot where it had been before. Now, having witnessed something like this before, AND having just seen the movie ""Signs"" several hours before, I wasn't willing to accept that this was anything unusual. As I watched the light, it began to change color and pulsate. I actually spoke out loud and said: ""Oh, not THIS again!"" half in jest, and half in earnest. As I said that, a small, red light poppped out and shot away from the larger light. Zip! And it was gone. At that point, I decided I'd seen enough. I spoke again, out loug, and said: ""Look, you guys...either take me with you or go away!"". Then I went back to bed. I have no explanations.

I was facing south (though I was looking straight up) and the full moon was low in the horizon in the southwest. Suddenly, going from North to South came three objects streaking across the sky.  There were no lights, though the objects were whitish-grey in color.  They were not illuminated.  They were definitely not birds.  Birds flap their wings and cannot completely go across the sky from horizon to horizon in 5 seconds.  These things were moving at supersonic speed, faster than any fighter ever flown on this planet and were slower than shooting stars, somewhere between shooting star and supersonic fighter (speed-wise).  Suddenly, the middle object shot left, then right again, splitting the other two.  No craft on earth can make that turn at those G-forces.  All three objects were gone within 5 seconds.

They were slightly to the west, about 5 to 7 degrees to the west and slightly south of the east-west axis of nearby Colfax Avenue. At first I thought they were planes but were not moving as planes would, almost stationary. I pointed out the high unknowns to a postal worker and two other regulars who pick up mail at the p.o. back door. Over the next few minutes we were busy receiving mail and kibitzing, but periodially looked up at the unknowns. One observer thought they were balloons.  Their height was undetermined but some observers saw a plane in the vicinity (no contrail) which seemed to disappear as it apparently lost an angle for reflecting its image from the sun in the east. Over the next few minutes the lights seemed to move closer together and more easterly (closer to being directly overhead, but still a few degrees to the west). At about 9:08 a.m. when we looked up one of the lights had disappeared and other was a few degrees more to the south. When we looked up around 9:10 a.m. the second bright circular light had disappeared. The FAA in Washington was contacted about 1 p.m. by me and I was referred to the Denver FAA office. The ""watch officer"" I was referred to said no one else had reported anything unusual ove Denver air space.  He was unaware of any balloon launches. (I had earlier contacted someone I know at the Weather Service and they said their balloons are launched hours earlier and expressed doubt the objects observed were theirs). The Weather Service said if their balloons ""pop"" the instruments descend by parachute.  No parachutes were observed after the bright lights dsappeared. The NUFORC was contacted (which the Washington FAA office had suggested as a second contact number) and I was asked if I knew of wind direction and force aloft over Denver at 0900 It was suggested the Denver FAA office would have that info.  I contacted the Denver FAA office a second time to try and obtain this information as it wuld help determine if the unknows were balloons - but my second transfer to the watch officer was answered by automatic voice mail. So I referred to my earlier call, apologized if I was being a nuisance, and asked for wind directions and force for three elevations above ground level and left my work number. As of 18:30 MST my call had not been returned.  (I now know more about what to ask for when initially contacting the FAA).

UFO implies it was an unidentified flying object, not necessarily a craft.  It seems presumptuous to pose the question. What I saw was most likely a meteorite or space junk, but it was the largest and brightest I've ever seen.  Unfortunately I did not have a clear view of it. The sky was covered with thin clouds and the moon was visible through holes in the clouds to the southeast.  The object crossed the sky quickly (like a shooting star) over the course of about 5 seconds, moving from South to Southwest at about 40-45 degrees above the horizon.  Because of the clouds I could not directly see the object, but through the clouds a bright trail was briefly visible, the width of which was the size of a silver dollar held at arms length.  Its likely the clouds diffused the light somewhat, but that the trail was visible at all with the cloud cover is notable.  It seemed as if the object was either very large or passing close to the ground. We were at a bonfire party and a friend and I both saw it.  Other's were present, but not looking in the correct direction at the time.  Coincidentally, several people present at the part (including myself and my wife) got violently ill the next day.  I say coincidentally because it had all the symptoms of a stomach flu bug. My wife got very sick and vomitted throughout Saturday night as did the friend who hosted the party.  I experienced stomach cramps and terrible diahrea but no vomitting.

We saw some large red lights (about the length of a school bus) hovering above the trees over a field.  We were unable to see the body of the craft because it was so dark.  I spotted it for about 5 seconds before I drove on past it.  Then it had ascended high into the sky extremely fast according to my daughter. My daughter had kept her eye on it the entire time until we got to her dad's house about 10 minutes later. (I was unable to because I was driving).  When we arrived she pointed it out to me.  To the naked eye it looked like a very bright star but red lights were twinkling.  We showed it to her dad also.  Through binoculars I saw a space ship.  It was a grey craft with a roundish-octagon shaped flat bottom with flashing red lights, and a domed top.. it was floating/hovering in the same general area for about 1 hour.

The sighting occured at 10:11 pm E.S.T.  With the naked eye, I spotted what looked exactly like a bright satelite moving north to south.  I then noticed that there were three objects in total, moving at the exact same velocity in a slightly elongated right triangle formation.  There was about 25 degrees of separation between the lead object and the others.  These objects did not move relative to each other, staying in perfect formation until they disapeared - first the lead object, then the two trailing objects about 1 second later.  The objects twinkled and then faded quickly.  Immediately after the objects disapeared, I ran into the house and checked the time and got my hiking compass and confirmed the direction of movement, it was dead on magnetic south. Compared to previous observations of satelites, these objects moved at a rate slightly faster, covering about half the night sky in about 45 seconds.  When I looked at them through binoculars, there was no distinction, just points of light, exactly light an orbiting satelite so they were at extreme altitude. The thing that struck me was that there were three of them and the way that they moved in such rigid formation.

It moved first to the north, then very smoothly--no jerkiness at all--it started toward where I was sitting (I was west of it), then again moved in another direction, heading south, and one more time to the north, then it vanished without a sound. I've lived next door to our local airport for 49 years, so I know it wasn't a plane--they're never soundless, nor do they move so smoothly, and obviously cannot change direction so quickly.

I heard the sound of an airplane overhead, and I looked up to spot the airplane as I often do.  I saw the airplane travelling along the usual course that I see airliners take, but before I got back to the task of taking out the trash I spotted a strange, small bright light in the sky.  The light was about 45 degrees from the horizon in the northwest corner of the sky.  At first the light looked stationary like a star, but then I perceived it slowly moving towards me to the east.  The object moved very slowly, almost imperceptively.  As I continued to watch the object, it became clear to me that it was moving to the south.  At this point, the object seemed to start moving slightly more rapidly, but that could have just been my perception.  The object seemed very far away and appeared to reflect light much like a star or a satellite.  The object appeared to be circular to me.  About five minutes into this encounter I ran inside to get my phone and called my neighbor who was out running errands.  As I talked to him I continued to watch the object travel south at a steady pace.  Approximately ten minutes into the encounter my neighbor came home and I pointed out the object to him.  He admitted that he found it strange.  He suggested that it was a balloon, but a balloon would not reflect light like that.  Could I have perhaps seen the space station in orbit? This is not the first strange encounter I have had with unidentified objects in the sky.  Please contact me if you can provide any explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS is not visible during daylight hours, under most circumstances,  and it certainly is not visible from the ground for 15 minutes.  It usually passes out of sight of an observer on the ground within 1-4 minutes.  Moreover, although the ISS was visible over Santa Cruz on this date, it passed over at 04:27 and 06:00 hrs.

I myself did not witness this event as i was asleep on the first level and windows faced opposite direction ( east, event was witnessed to the west ). Early this morning(november 3) my two young daughters aged 5 and 8, along with their friend(9) and my girlfriend(26)woke meto explain to me what they had witnessed just hours ago in the early hours of saturday november 3rd. It unfolded like this: At 2am of november third my oldest daughter and her friend were awaked by a very loud sound, described to me to sound like a rocket leaving the earths atmosphere(lot of thrust), upon looking out the window, which faces west and is right alongside bed, she saw over the trees of our property a rocket shaped craft speeding toward the sky at a reasonably high rate of speed and holding a steady course up. She then awaked her friend who was sharing the bed with her, as well as my girlfriend laying a bed away, to look out the window at the rocket ship ripping through the sky. The window is on the second floor and faces west. The visibility of the area of sky, from top of trees on property to highest visible point of sky is ample as the trees are low and the windows high. Note:  this morning i had both my daughter and her friend both seperately draw what they had seen and they were exactly the same. Also, my girlfriend cooborated the intense rumbling at the time of the sighting, so i know the children weren't fantasizing/dreaming/playing. Description: A perfect rocket shaped craft, long(vertically) shape with a conical tip. 2 to 4 unblinking yellow lights sat at the top area of the craft and did not flash or otherwise blink in such a way the FAA would require of an aircraft. They also described the presence of intense flames shooting from the rear, in true rocket fashion, as well as the possibility of some sort of window(s) along the lateral side of the craft. Lights were also seen at the bottom portion of the craft above the exhaust area. As it moved skyward it created a contrail of either smoke or steam. The entire sighting may have lasted no more than a couple minutes, long enough for it to appear over the treeline until it was no longer visible from the window. Not being a scientist or otherwise, i immediately assumed it was a launch of some type of rocket or military type craft headed for the great void. This after some thinking didn't sit well with me or make any sense for the following reasons. First off there is no known base in this immediate area, the description of the size was that of a large house, this coupledwith the level of detail they described led me to believe it was much closer than any launch from neighboring states etc. Also, my girlfriend, whom never turned to look at it as she was tired, described a dopplereffect. The sound she said began as a low rumble and peaked so loud she believed whatever it was would crash into the house, so it was close. The sound was that of a space shuttle launch on takeoff and not the whine of a passenger jet turbine. The most dramatic feat in question is that of it changind direction i.e altering its course in a marked fashion by turning about 45 degrees and keeping a course more or less straight up. Anyway, first thing after hearing this i phoned the local police station and was promptly accused of making a crank call. I spoke in length with the desk sargeant about this and he soon realized it was no joke an listened. He claimed no one els\e reported the event after checking through the nights log and so on. I also asked him whom i should call to report the event and claimed he didn't know and furthermore there was no reason to as any military activity would have beed reported to them beforehand, which it wasn't. Could you please contact me with any information regarding this event, military rocket activity, etc.? And did anyone else see this in the north jerresy area? I thought maybe it was a Vandenburg rocket launch, but whywould it be so close and so lowhere in new jersey?! thanx and please contact me when you can ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.

It was still very light out but there was an orangish coloration on the mountains (they literally surround Grand Junction but the City is extremely spread out being in a mountain Desert valley). The sky was absolutely completely clear- not a cloud i site and the sky was a lighter hue of blue at this point. Something caught my eye. I looked up and saw and object that at first I thought was a passenger jet. I've never seen a UFO in the two years I've been here so I thought ""eh it's just a jet"". Jets pass that way all the time. But the thing that caught my eye was this ""starish"" shine it had. Then after the that faded (in about ten or so seconds), I could see that it was a metallic object and it appeared to be going away from my position (westward), yet it was somehow slower, a lot slower than a jet. It just kinda ""hung"" there or ""drifted"" in a strange way. Another thing that stood out was that it appeared to be two pods melded together. If you saw the photos on Jeff's site of the ""four pod"" craft  it was similar to that although it was hard to really make out too much detail because it was much further up in the sky . I'd have to say it was a good 7 to 10,000 feet up there. I was still skeptical this was not just a Jet that I wasn't making out too well when to the diagonal lower left of it (closer in my direction) ANOTHER ONE apparently appeared!! I thought I just didn't see it and that it emanated from the direction behind me to my line of sight. But the odd thing was, as I was observing the first object I WAS looking elsewhere around in the sky and saw NO OTHER objects 360 degrees around (the skyline is pretty low along in G.J.-especially on this wide avenue) So I'm looking at the second one now and it looks EXACTLY the same as the first one except closer. Now I did begin to think it was a UFO and checked to see if the other one had ""blinked out"" and that maybe this was the other blinking in somewhere else. The other one was still there but farther away. A couple of times I couldn't see it and then I saw it. Now I looked closely at the second object: still that weirdness to it that didn't quite look like a jet with apparently two pods (although the ""pods"" weren't as vertically cylindrical-like as the one on Jeff's site).It was more horizonal-ish but with those two bubbly portions left and right. Think of a shorter and fatter cigar shapes craft hanging horizontally in the sky but with two pods for each side bulging..very odd. It also appeared to be subtley changing shape too as I observed it.  A closer inspection of the object revealed a slight exhaust coming out of the ""tail"" of it. Very faint spray of fuel exhaust but much lighter than even the lightest jet fuel sprays. O.K. here's the kicker: So I look for the first one and I still see it -after not seeing it for a moment .....I go ""o.k. this is all going to be explainable because that's  jet fuel exhaust""(still thinking about number two while tracking number one). O.k. then I go back number two and It's GONE!!! Then I look for number one and it's GONE!!! There is absolutely nothing in the sky- and there is a whole helluva lotta sky in front of me that believe me I would see stuff up there if there was anything up there. NOTHING NADA. This had me scratching my head. No conventional explanation exists for what I saw today. The objects reflected the very orange color of the setting sun this evening at a few points which tells me they were metallic in nature. As far as I could tell there was no sound, but a major thruway was a block away, so it was hard to tell.",2002-11-04T00:00:00,39.07603153409091,-108.54615767045453

Moved in a south by southwesterly direction at approximately 150kts.  Appeared to be about 1500 feet AGL.  Made no sound, though it appeared close enough to be audible if it had jet enines.  Left no contrails.  Observed maintaining straight and level course for about 5 seconds, then rolled right to a 45 degree angle which caused the downward lights to shine brighter, as they were directed more towards the observer.  After 1 second, object then rolled left back to a straight and level position.  Object never appeared to change course or altitude during this rolling activity.

Saw a very powerful, wide, white light 40 minutes past sunset that must have been playing some unusual tricks with the clouds.  It was dark, and very cloudy (marine layer).   The light was bright as a star, but about 5-10 times bigger to my eye - a bit bigger than a golf ball, but much smaller than the moon. There was an odd shaping of lit clouds or some sort of light trail forming fast off both sides, starting narrow at the ball, and getting wider as it went out, but changing shape rapidly.   I pulled my car over, saw what looked to be what I call a ""God"" effect, with light piercing through a tunnel hole in the clouds, creating sort of a corona on the sides.  I thought it might be the sun going through an unusual hole in the clouds, but it happened at 7:00, well after sunset.  The cloud trails reminded me of missile testing i've seen before, but the sky was too cloudy.  I never thought helicopter because I didn't hear anything - so it's a mystery.  I then continued to see bright light lighting above the clouds in one patch until I got to my house three minutes later.  Then it faded.  I kept checking every 5 minutes or so, but did not see anythiong.  Then, 20 minutes later, I went back outside with my son, who asked what the blue light was above the clouds, which were turning the otherwise gray   marine clouds blue in a small area, which was the same direction I was observing the earlier white light.   (to the West - over the ocean ?)  I told him I didn't know, but 5 minutes later it faded for good.    End of story - do not return e-mail or contact me please. ((Vandenberg rocket launch.

At a certain point the trail began to expand and became a huge expanding circular envelope resembling mist. From the bright centre it seemed like four bright white streaks were spreading. At its maximum the cloud was maybe ten or fifteen moon-widths across. The speed did not seem all that fast. Gradually the bright centre burned out. The phenomenon must have been very high up because it remained white throughout although the sun was well below the horizon. Also, given the height, the white mist cloud must have been really enormous. Parts of the trail became red (presumably as they sank lower) but one part was also green/turquoise. At first I assumed this was a sizeable comet fragment but the four white streaks and the green coloured section makes me think it was maybe man made and the cloud was unused fuel (though I wonder why it was not burning).

I commented about how big it was and asked J. if he thought it could be a satellite.  He said it was too big, he didn't know what it was.  I watched it for about a minute and a half, the time it would normally take us to get from the end our our drive, to the gas station that is a mile away.  The light was hovering stationary in the sky, and had not moved in that minute and a half I was watching.  Then it moved across the sky from a 1 o'clock to a 9 o'clock position.  I am not sure, but I believe the car in front of us was looking at it as well, because as soon as the light began to move, the person driving the car in front of us slammed on his brakes. The object moved very steadily, there was no wobble or anything like that.  It moved across the sky and then stopped and went back into a hover.  We were passing it at about that point in time.  As I caught my last glimpse of it, it appeared that there were now two red lights.  They were only red lights, no other color.  They were not blinking, like the smack lights on an aircraft would do.  For lack of better words, I would say the light was pulsating, but not blinking. The light was about as big as half of my pinky nailbed if I were to hold it at arms distance away from my eye.  That would mean either a very large object, or a very close object.  There were no sounds.  A helicopter would have made a sound. I was a helo mechaninc in the Marine Corps and I would have been able to distinguish which helo by the sound of the engine. There was no sound. The only other craft I know of that can hover like that is a Harrier, and that, too would make a very loud and distinguishable sound.  We continued on along Pala Rd and I lost sight of it once we passed the Pechanga Hotel.  I had it in my site for about 4-5 minutes.

Acceleration and deceleration of craft was great. I was on holiday in Egypt, at the top of Mt Sinai, viewing the sunrise. In the twilight before sunrise I noticed a single, fairly dim white light, which initially appeared to be a star, in the direction of the sunrise position. The light then began moving left to right to left in a mainly horizontal plane. The movement seemed quite random, i.e. the object did not appear to be travelling toward any particular destination. As an example of the motion observed; the craft would sometimes move to the right, stop, then continue moving to the right. Other times it would move to the right, stop, then begin moving to the left. The speed of the craft varied, from a slow drift, to a speed so great that it is difficult to explain how this speed was achieved. The craft accelerated extremely rapidly, from an apparent standstill. The craft also decelerated to a stop almost instantaneously, even after it had just accelerated to a great speed. This rapid motion was all in a horizontal direction. This went on for 20 mins or more. All the while, the craft was very gradually drifting higher in to the sky and to the right. This was happening at the same time as the sun came closer to rising and the twilight became brighter. When the sun rose, the craft seemed to disappear by fading away. I am not sure if this was caused by the brightness of the sun washing out the light from the craft, or if the craft was in fact moving further away. I estimate the craft was 10-20km away, and at least 10,000ft altitude. I take these estimates from the fact that the craft occasionally disappeared behind clouds. The clouds appeared to be at quite high altitude. I took some photographs of what I saw, will need to check the developed pictures to see if the object is clearly visible in the photo as it was quite distant and the camera is only a pocket 35mm type.",2002-11-09T00:00:00,,

She told me it had been seen at Atascadero State Hospital (which I live next to) from the courtyard all night and no one could figure out what it was.

It was then I heard a strange noise, it sounded like a generator or the engine of a diesel truck running but a deeper sound and the interverals were not as fast as you would here the revs of an idle engine.  It was loud but I could tell it was from a distance.  I couldn't pinpoint where it was, so I went in the middle of the cul-de-sac looking down the street thinking that someone had a generator hooked up to thier house or something like that, then I saw some flashing lights in the sky red, white, and I think blue.  I really couldn't tell exactly how high the object was, maybe a mile or two high.  I would have thought it was a jet except I heard the murmur before I saw the object and it did not sound anything like the sound jets make breaking the sound barrier although I never seen jets go this fast before or this low.  My guess it was an experimental aircraft. This thing was fast, I'm in the suburbs so there isn't much light in the sky at night and it was very clear, I could see the star constellation Orion the Hunter without a problem what-so-ever.  I never heard that noise before or seen anything fly  by that fast. Once it came over head I didn't hear the murmur anymore, it made a higher steady pitch sound for a brief moment and then it was out of hearing range.  It was hard to make out the exact shape, however I did see some lines that came together, kind of like a diamond shape but not solid all the way through.  It was really dark and really can't make out the shape all too well, but all the lights were alternating strobes that flashed approximately twice within in a second, although I didn't count them. The object was coming from the Southwest (more West) and heading towards the Northeast (more East) in a straight line. I figured it's probably some test aircraft the Air Force has been working on or something to that nature. I never saw or heard anything like it.  I don't want to sound like a nut or anything but I figured it was weird enough to report it.  The whole experience lasted about 15 seconds. Thank you.

The light was white at all times. We were alarmed at the speed of the approach and that it seemed headed directly toward us (position fixed). The light was too far out to distinguish shape or size. The object remained stationary a few seconds and then began to dim to the relative size and brightness of surrounding stars. The light then began moving what appeared slowly from directly overhead eastward to 45 degrees (2 minutes elapsed).

It was still very much daylight, and I thought to myself that I might be looking at Venus, which is certainly bright enough at times to be visible during the day; I thought this because the object was motionless.  However, upon further consideration I realized that Venus would be much lower in the sky by that time, so I reached inside my sliding glass door and grabbed my binoculars which I keep close by to look at the planes making their final approach to Hartsfield Airport.  It is difficult to say at what altitude the craft was hovering but since I could see no detail with the naked eye I am going to estimate that the craft was at about 10,000 feet) When I centered the object and focused, I saw what looked to be a metallic sphere surrounded (seemingly attached) by three or four smaller spheres which were rotating around the larger, center sphere (imagine a basketball surrounded by three or four bowling balls).  The object drifted slowly to the west, but definitely under control, not at all like a balloon caught in the wind -- it was a very windy day at least at ground level but the object drifted only about two hand lengths during the five minute or so time span that I watched it.  As well as drifting to the west, the object also drifted higher.  The longer I watched it, the less detail I saw.  I finally lost the object after watching it for about five minutes.

Let me start by saying that I am a police officer in Austin Tx.  On 08-28-02 at approximately 3:30pm myself and a friend were at the swimming pool at an apartment complex located at brodie lane and west william cannon drive(austin tx).  The sky was very clear with a few clouds in the distance.  My female friend stated, ""whats that"" and pointed to the northwest.  I looked up and observed a shiny metallic object hovering in the sky.  The object was shaped like a 3 pointed star (like the mitsubishi symbol).  She asked me if I thought it was balloons.  The object then changed formation slowly and began moving towards us.  It is difficult to estimate the altitude of the object when we first observed it, but it would cover about 1"" in size held at my arms length.  The object then came very close over the pool area (almost directly over) where we were.  It had changed shape and was now like a vertical cylindrical object with blurred features.  The altitude had dropped to perhaps 100'.  I knew that something was way out of the ordinary when I observed a metallic object projecting from the right side of the craft (?).  The sun was reflecting on the projecting object and I know without a doubt that it was solid and definately not a balloon.  It appeared to be almost chrome colored.  It also appeared to me that the object was traveling against the wind (moving from northeast to southwest).  We were, up to this point, the only two people at the pool.  Just as the craft was over the pool area 4 teenagers approched (3 males 1 female).  I asked them, ""do you see that...what do you think it is?"".  They all watched the object with us for a few minutes and did not reply.  The object hovered over the pool area for 1-2 minutes and then began moving towards the southwest again.  As it did it changed shape again and started gaining altitude.  I lost sight of the object as the roof of the clubhouse blocked my view.  Let me state that I could hear the noise from the traffic on the roadways, and air traffic in the distance (a ! southwes t airlines plane flew by from east to west) - but at no time did I hear any noise from the object. Based on the slow speed and low altitude of the object I feel confident that many other observations were made in this area.

The center of the island has a mountain called Mt. Benson in the middle approximately 6000-7000 feet in height separating both the East and West coast coast lines.

After viewing this craft for approximately and hour the obejct slowly began to demonstrate ballistic movement and departed the area at a relatively slow speed. I do recall the object slowly began traveling South, then suddenly turned westward and began climbing into the westward sky until it disappeared from sight. We were both curious as to what we had seen, but simply assumed it was some sort of Canadian military project. Since that date I have always wondered what it was that I actually saw that evening. I made an attempt to explain what I had seen to my parents, but they dismissed it as simply a kids fabricated story. What I saw that night is something that has still left an impression in my mind today. I would give anything to know what it what is was that I actually saw that night. The charecteristics that the craft exhibited that evening was nothing similar to any aircraft that I was aware of at that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

As I was playing outside in the yard, I noticed an object flying along a range of hills.  As I watched it, I noticed that it traveling extremely slow.  I thought to myself that this could not be a plane because it was moving too slow, and it could not be a helicopter because it made no noise.  As it got closer, I noticed that it was shaped like a disc.  What really made it seem so strange is that this saucer in the sky was luminous, it glowed like a light bulb in the sky.  I sat there in my yard and couldn't take my eyes off of this object.  It approached a big hill and disappeared behind it.  I looked to the other side of the hill to see if it was going to appear on the other side.

There was no exhaust but heat waves seemed to disapate from metallic surface. There were several different colored lights around perimiter of craft. Also on upper deck there was a rectanguler window which appeared to have 12 yellow lenses or lights behind it, of course as craft would rotate this window would come around once per revolution. I must say it looked very simaliar to many popular craft filmed and photografted many years later in Switzerland.

The object was glossy red on top and black underneath, about three feet long & two feet high.  In shape and color it looked vaguely like a giant ladybug flying without it's wings.  The object was roughly at eye-level when observed from the hiking trail on Dakota Ridge, flying about 150-200 feet above the valley floor. The object was silent and flew at a constant speed of roughly 30MPH, perfectly straight and perfectly level, covering a distance of more than a mile while observed.  Despite erratic breezes, the object moved in an absolutely rock-steady manner with no shifting around or any changes in speed, direction or altitude.   Although breezes were generally blowing in the same direction that the object was moving, the wind's direction was erratic and it's intensity was inconstant during observation.  The object seemed to be moving at a speed and in a manner that the ambient wind conditions would not have allowed if it were free-floating. My first impression upon seeing the object after my companion pointed it out was that it was a small flying device of some kind.

I had noticed an object moveing in a northly direction which I could not identify.  I then brought it to the attention of my neighbors the object then appeared to become stationary it held it's position for several minutes.  At this point my neighbor went and got her binoculars at this point we were able to see some detail of the object it appeard to have 3 very bright red/orange lights on it that were in a triangle formation.   I then got my camcorder and began videoing the object I recorded about a minute and a half of this object I could not see much detail with the camcorder the object appears as a small white object on video.   There is one interresting point on the video where the object simply dissapears and then reappears in a different area of the sky.  I have good footage of it dissapearing but not reappearing as I could not focus on it after it dissapeard from my screen but it could still be seen with the naked eye for another few minutes.  I had the object perfectly at center on my camcorder when it just dissapeard I did not move the camcorder or touch the focus at this point also autofocus was turned off.

At first I thought it was atop a radio tower (although I must admit I have never seen a blue lite on a tower before).   Within a second or two I observed what I initially thought was a second blue light, but in fact what I was seeing was the original blue lite moving rapidly to the southwest roughly parallel with the interstate hiway.   Although it isw impossible to accurately guage distances without a benchmark it is my estimate that the blue lite was not more than 10 miles north of the interstate at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft.  I had this lite in my view for approximately 8-10 seconds and saw it move at a speed that I believe was in excess of 500 mph.  I was driving northeasterly on the interstate at approx 80 mph so the lite and my car were more or less passing each other in opposite directions.  I called my wife's attention to the lite (she was a front seat passenger) and she was able to see the lite momentarily by looking over her shoulder through the back window of the car (something I could not do as a driver)   She saw the lite for only an instant before it disappeared into the west.   All of these events took place approximately opposite the Colorado DOT truck inspection station on the south side of the interstate several miles west of Ft. Morgan Colo.  I am convinced that the blue lite that I saw was not on an aircraft given its speed of movement and its relatively lo altitude.  In fact I have never seen an aircraft display a blue lite while in flight.I don't have a lot else to add to this report, but would be happy to answer additional questions if someone wishes to call me.

The thing was, however, that the lights didn't look like any lights I've seen on a helicopter at night.  They were a bluish white and made out the shape of an oval, as it was dark, I could not make out the shape, I would assume it was some sort of disk, however, the lights only gave me a 2 dimensional feel of the object.  I rolled down the window of the car to try to hear the rotors of a helicopterm by it's distance, it should have been audible, however, I didn't hear a thing.

As we were traveling at freeway speed, we got closer and I could see some detail that made me think otherwise. The object's shape reminded me of the torso of the constellation Orion with a narrow bottom, wide middle and narrow top.  It was not curved and the shape was not symetrical.  There were no extensions of wings or rotors and there was no smoke, exhaust, or flame coming from any side of it.  As well, there was no ""basket"" attachment like a balloon. I kept my eye on the object and it continued to hover as we got closer.  I alerted my father and he took a better look.  He said it reminded him of a large garbage bag with no reflective surface, though- and he agreed it was not a helicopter. I returned my concentration to my driving as there were many other cars on the road and stopped watching the object.  This is when my father discovered the second object, two white discs attached to each other side-to-side.  It was much smaller and stayed about 40 feet away from the black object, higher up and to the north. The 2 seperate objects stayed close together and continued to hover. They made no movement, did not drift, and we saw no wires attaching them to the ground. At 8:51 am, 5 minutes into the sighting, the objects vanished.  We exited the expressway at Pine Valley Drive and headed south on this local road.  This put me on the east side of the car and my father's window facing the objects.  The objects  were now about 3 kilometres away and we could see them very clearly. Moments after we made that exit the objects vanished, which alarmed by father and he looked franitcally across the sky for signs of them.  I slowed the car to about 30 km/h and looked directly out his window in the direction we saw them last. I re-aquired visual contact about 10 seconds after they vanished and saw only the black object, now 15-20 kilometres away, hovering again.  There was no way it could have traveled that distance and slowed to a hover again.  My father got one last look at the object to confirm the new distance and then the city landscape and buildings prevented our vision. Additonal facts: -Visibility that morning was perfect and the sun was shining -No sound determination because car windows were closed -A 767 was traveling west towards Pearson Airport, about 15 kilometres to the south -The carft were intially hovering near a massive North-South powerline grid before they moved -Other cars did not take notice of the object -the event lasted 5.5 minutes. -Both objects were dull in colour and did not shine light (non-metallic) -They would definitely be on Airport radar at their location (even tower visibility) What intrigued me about this sighting is the lack of wings or rotors on the object, the ability to hover without ANY movement, and the speed at which the object moved from 3 to at about 15 kilometres away to another hover.",2002-07-26T00:00:00,43.83266195652174,-79.51935434782608
Light Invasion In The Sky,Baltimore,MD,2002-07-11T21:15:00,flash,22:15,"Occurred : 7/11/2002 21:15  (Entered as : 7/11/02 21:15) Reported: 7/11/2002 8:20:15 PM 20:20 Posted: 7/26/2002 Location: Baltimore, MD Shape: Flash Duration:22:15",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/023/S23714.html,"Light Invasion In The Sky I live in the city in an urban area and I'm 19 years old.  It all started when my dog as well as the neighbors dogs were barking histerically.  I was sitting watching tv in my room which is in the back of the house on the second floor.  I noticed a light out of my window hovering.  The sky was bareley getting dark and I just wondered why this really bright star was out so early. I mean this this thing was brighter than a star but far a enough away to appear to look like one.  I said what the hey, it's only a star. Then it blinked a few times. I grabbed my binoculars. First there was only one object. A Plane flew by as I was looking thru binoculars, and Object 1 was joined by another object. Both immeadiately went dim. So dim I couldn't see them with my naked eyes, only with binnoculars or maybe with a video cam which I don't have. The only other way to see them was if you caught their occasional blink. They were positioned diagonal from each other, like if they were dots on a square one would be on the top left corner and the other on the bottom right. Then Object 1 moved very slowly to the top right corner of this invisible box, while Object 2 moved at the same speed to the bottom left. They moved so slow it was like they weren't moving. By now it was 21:30. I called my mother to look while I was still keeping an eye on these things. I asked her to get her notebook to write all of this down as it happened, but somehow the notebook was never retrieved.(I later drew everything on paper.) Still in the same slow manner they switched positions. So Object 1 is now in the bottom left. Then Object 2 slowly kept going in the right direction in a straight line until it disappeared into the trees. Object 1 started to blink and was joined by another which was also blinking(maybe Object 2 again I don't know). I don't know why I did it, but things got extrodinary when I grabbed a flashlight and started turning it on and off trying to mimic their blinking. They (Object 1 and Object 3) started to move slowly over top of m! y house still far away as a star. I was Looking up towards the roof, hanging out the window. At this point my mother couldn't see what I saw. Then my mother shouted look! And directly in a straight line parallel to my window as I looked straight out there were about 13 blinking lights. At this time 21:45 several planes have already passed by in which we compared the blinking lights to, but none matched. I kept on blinking my flashlight. I don't even know why. In the back of my mind I really thought they couldn't see it because it was too high up. But still more appeared. Too many to count because of the annoying blinking. Two of the blinking objects moved left in which I followed with my naked eyes only to see them meet up with a really bright one, about as bright as the very first one I saw. It was there up until 22:45 but I stopped looking at 22:15 because I got board. It was just hovering there with the other 2. The rest had gone. My mother checked on it twice, up until 22:45 til she couldn't see the bright one anymore. The first two objects had a yellow/reddish color. The bright ones were the same only brighter. The others were dim as stars but blinking enough to get your attention. Probably 1 blink every 2 seconds.",2002-07-26T00:00:00,39.31307269413052,-76.61182201968647

Tropicana) when I noticed a strange slightly illuminated shape in the distance. My first impression due to the object's shape and speed was that someone had let off a large cluster of helium party balloons and the wind was carrying them. I thought the hotel and street lights along The Strip were illuminating the object. A few minutes later, I looked up and noticed the object was a bit closer and I became a bit more curious as I began to see some detail. First, rather than being a cluster of objects (aka balloons), it seemed like a more continuous mass where parts of the object had a dull glow of various intensity that changed, as if there were slowly moving parts that were rotating as the object moved forward. The object was about half the size of a fist at arm's length at the closest point as it passed. The object's flight path seem to run parallel along The Strip during the first 10-15 minutes after I first spotted it. And its velocity seemed constant - it moved very slow. In fact, it was pretty breezy outside, so I would think a mass of balloons would be drifting by faster and moving erratically assuming the wind speed was constant higher up. The precise movement of this object gave me the impression as if ""it"" was spying on the activity of The Strip below. It seemed to be positioned right above The Strip but fairly high up. As the object moved further north along The Strip, passing by the building I was on, the lights remained about the same intensity. Again, it's as though certain parts of the object would move every once in a while, causing some of the lights to shift. I could see where from a distance, someone would classify the shape as a diamond at times due to the main illuminated areas being on the ends of the object. However, the shape seemed to change as the lights moved (or illuminated parts moved?). If I were to assign a color to the object, it was a dull mottled color, lighter than a gray, almost like a tan or light brown.! I point ed out the object to a few friends and joked around that it was a UFO coming to join our party. However, my friends were not very sober and lost interest quickly. I, on the hand, was completely sober. I had celebrated a friend's event the night before, so I had decided to take it easy and drink non-alcoholic beverages all night. I noticed at some point, the object made an abrupt turn and started heading westward. The lights did not change as the object moved over an area off The Strip which was not as illuminated, again suggesting the object had its own light source. As the object went further west, it became too small to see and was out of view eventually. The entire sighting was about 20 minutes. Being the rational person I am (I have a B.S. in Biology from a top university) and with all the literature I've read on the UFO phenomenom and common explanations such as military craft, I thought this might have been one of those private, experimental craft that some hobbyists like to build (they look like hang-gliders with propellers). I've read a couple stories where some jokers flew in unison with these craft with lights stringed across and tried to fool the public into believing they saw an extraterrestrial UFO sighting.

After arriving back at my apartment complex, and as I was walking back to my apartment at around 8:30 pm, I stopped to chat with one of the maintenance folks who was standing outside the laundry room with his girl friend. Since it was a very clear night sky, I mentioned to them how bright the stars were, especially with all the evening fog we had been having.   As we were looking up at the moon and stars (we were facing west and looking Northwest), we noticed two very bright white objects - which at first I mistook for stars.  As we watched them though, we noticed that the bright white objects were moving from the northwest towards the south about the speed which airlines normally travel from LAX to SFO.  One was trailing the other very close - too close for conventional commercial aircraft in air corridors. As a matter of fact, these objects were traveling in the vicinity of the air corridor for air traffic flying between LAX and SFO, with the exception that they appeared very high in the sky - higher then normal air traffic would be.  Since I have a commercial pilots license (in-active pilot), I was trying to see the red and green wing tip lights that would determine they were either private or commercial aircraft.  After watching for a minute, I could never make out the shape of the object or see any wingtip lights.  After concluding that they must be commercial aircraft, I went up to my apartment and turned on the TV. Unfortunately, that was not the end of the story.  The next morning I saw the maintenance man who had watched the objects with me the previous evening.  He told me that had I stayed another 1 1/2 minutes and watched,  I would have seen something unexplainable for an ordinary aircraft to do.  Evidently, as the bright white objects were getting closer towards LAX, they separated with one shooting straight up and the other going up and out-of-sight at a very steep angle.  He thought that it might be a ""stealth"" aircraft but I told him that ""known"" military aircraft cannot achieve those kinds of speed. I have read other reports for April 17th which seem to mirror the events we witnesed. I have also read that what we witnessed may have been the ISS and Space Shuttle passing overhead.",2002-05-14T00:00:00,34.19450050251256,-119.16316080402011

A McMinnville father reports that his 9 year old son witnessed some strange aerial phenomenon from his bedroom window. The boy described to his parents a yellow, ""glowing"" oval shaped object slowly passing from west to east in front of his window. As the boy began to watch the object, it quickly accelerated its speed and left the area. About three seconds later, a triangular shaped object appeared in the same airspace as the oval object had seconds before, following the same path. Update... During the weekend of May 10th and 11th of the UFO Fest in Mcminnville, I was fortunate enough to meet this very charming and polite 9 year old boy. I sat and talked with him about his sighting and he spoke of it in a very no nonsense manner as a child this age would when recalling an event from memory. I was extremely impressed by his sincerity and feel that this boy saw exactly what he described to me as seeing. In my many years of interviewing people I have become very good at noticing the difference of how a story is presented from actual memory compared to a fabricated story told more than once. With younger people like this boy, the details searched for during the interviewing process are even more profoundly different as boys this age are much better at telling you the details of what really happened rather than repeating a scenario created in story form in their head. At one point during his testimony, I asked about the second craft and how it followed in the same path as the first oval shaped object, and he corrected me in that the second triangle shaped craft actually followed a little lower than the altitude of the first object, a detail that could have been easily left out of a made up story but came out when pressed, a good sign that the story was in fact being recalled from memory. I find this sighting of a very credible nature. This report was previously reported to NUFORC and this is a follow up to that report. Eric Byler - Assistant Director, Oregon UFO Research.

At approxmately 8:15pm while washing dishes, I saw a light in the sky through the windowindow over my kitchen sink. Then right behind it came another light and then another. I went out onto our back deck and these three lights slowly (it seemed) glided silently and circled back over the trees. After a few minutes, they came over the trees again and two arched to the left and one to the right until they were out of my range of vision. I ran upstairs to get my sons's binoculars and went back out. Again two white lights this time came over the trees and throught the binoculars I could make out blue and red lights on either side of the white light (which was in the middle). Again they went over my house and out of my view. This Friday we had sudden and violent storm activity and as it darkened, there was periodic clouds and clearing. After the 3rd time, there were two-three more sightings-always in sets of two or three. Because it was dark, I could not make out the shape, but could through the binoculars see the blinking of the blue and red lights on either side of the white light. During this span of time, I called the State Trooper barracks in Wurtsboro to find out who I could report this to and they gave me the # for the FAA in Newburgh-I tried several times but it was always busy; I also called our friends the next road over from us being the lights went in that direction and asked her to go out and look; I grabbed my Kodak ""throw-away: camera and took as many pictures as was left on it but haven't had it developed yet. Unfortunately, my husband was at a meeting that night and didn't get home until 10:30pm. At some point during the night or early am, I awoke because the house and my bed was vibrating. It felt like a tremor and stopped shortly after and I fell back to sleep. The next day (Saturday), my friend called to say she didn't see anything when she went outside the night before but there was an earthquake further upstate. The newspaper reported a 5.2 quake in Jay, NY, and that two years ago on th! e same d ay in the same place (Jay, NY) there had been an earthquake of approximately the same magnitude. I do not believe this was a coincidence. In last Monday's newspaper there was an article that a man in Pine Bush (the next town over from me) videotaped a ""ufo"" he saw ""early in April"" (the paper did not give the exact date). Amazingly, when I shared this information with my family members, friends, and co-workers I was surprised how many believe that there is intelligence ""out there"". To say the least, I am astounded by all this and every night since my sightings I go out on my deck several times to look up into the sky. Also, since that night we have had numerous fast and sometimes furious storm activity. Thank you for letting me document this episode with you.",2002-05-14T00:00:00,,

We were on our way home from meeting some friends in Albion and we had gotten on the highway.  As we got to Kalamazoo I noticed this light in the sky towards the west.  The UFO had lights all over it although it was pretty far up, the lights looked to be red, white and a bluish-green color, I also noticed an orangey color.  There was no noticeable sound. It looked like other smaller craft were maybe coming out of it or beams of light were shooting off.  It seemed to speed up as I sped up and slow down when I slowed down on the highway.  It pretty much stayed with us for about 2 hours.  As we neared Muskegon it looked as though it was going towards Lake Michigan and we lost it, it just got smaller and smaller and disappeared by the lake.  As it got smaller it looked orange to me.  Then the next night we spotted the same thing at my fathers house in North Muskegon.  My father had told me that it looked like the same thing he saw 30 years ago, he saw 2 of them and one of them shot like a laser or something and hit the other one, then they both disappeared.  The one we saw the second night though was in a different part of the sky.  This time it was in the South almost by the moon.  Well since the first night, we have been seeing the same thing, by the 3rd night we were watching as it just twirled around and moved a little but mostly stayed in the same area, a plane came over us and it left but later that night as we were back at our home in muskegon we saw it again, this time with more of them....we saw what looked to be around 3-5 of them, we looked through telescope and saw like 3 circular things under it twirling in a clockwise motion, almost like balls of fire.  Last night (6/26) we went to Lake Michigan by Rothbury/Montague area and spotted 2 lights on the lake that seemed to be hovering just over the water. Dark clouds spread over us, due to stormy weather so we went back up towards the woods.  I went back down to see if they were there and they were gone.  I'm sure they will be out tonight also, we! plan on watching for them again.... so I will probably be writing some more.",2002-07-01T00:00:00,,

It was weird i questioned it to myself i dont know about the other three because it was daytime so i didnt think it was real so my brother brought out his camera and it continued to sway back and forth it looked black and shiny, moving direction quick and a couple times it stopped and froze. So my sister and i were tripping out on this than my brother and my friend went into the house and i told my sister i was going to get my binoculars for a closer view so i went inside looked around and couldnt find them so i sat down on the couch and kind of doubted what i was looking at. Then my sister said ""what are you doing arent you getting your binoculars"" then something inside me told me to go check it out again so i went outide to see where the object was reminding you it was daylight so i walked outside by myself and my sister was inside for some reason so i scanned the sky looking for that object floating around it was gone but i kept looking for some reason looking in the same spot than suddenly out of knowhere i see a black disc shaped object diving, now at first i thought it was a bird swooping but that changed after i saw it go up again repeating the same movement but getting faster and higher bouncing in the air it amazed me and still is ,it reminded me of somebody skipping a stone in the sky down than up and everytime it would get faster and higher and each time, i heard no sound  then it was gone i think it was building its momentum with our atmosphere to get back to where it came, even my brother came out and i tried to point it out but it was too fast im still wondering about this but i know for a fact what i saw was real and not my imagination i wish somebody was there with me to see that hopefully there will be a report about this, ! i did se e a couple helicopters circling around that area after i wonder if they got a report but all i know is what i saw i will never forget.",2002-07-01T00:00:00,34.25238827586207,-118.53934206896552

It was obviously a craft of some sort, light grey in color, it was difficullt to call it a specific form.  There were no lights on but it was deffinitely there in the light of the moon.  The craft was moving in a southern direction toward me.  When it got closer, it was obviously the strangest thing I had ever seen, so I called to my roommate, who was inside the house working, that he had to see something strange.  He came out and watched it with me for about ten minutes, then went back in the house to finish working.  As it went higher it became more illuminated by the moon, but the image still wasn't clear. At first it was moving slowely, but then all at once shot up toward the star South of the handle of the Big Dipper.  For at least 20 seconds it  was stationary. Then moved North toward the second star down from the top of the Big Dipper's handle. Next it moved up between the top and next to the top star of the handle, making it appear the there were 4 stars on the handle, instead of 3. It stayed stationary for 5 to 10 seconds, then it started moving North, then finally faided out of  view.

At first, I thought it was a formation of jets, but the precise turn and lack of engine noises, proved otherwise; there was no sign of engine glow (after burners, etc.), only the six amber lights.  Once the object was overhead, I could tell it was a single craft.  I watched it turn, without banking, and immediately head west, until it went over the mountains.  It is difficult to determine the size of the craft, but based on the speed and position in the sky, I would estimate it to be 300' on each size.

I said to my passenger, ""I don't remember there being a water tower here?"" and when I looked again I noticed that this watertower had no legs.  The next thing I noticed was that there was no sounds.  This was especially odd as we were next to a small lake and dam where the water could be heard almost all the time.  There was no cricket or frog noices.  It was the loudest quite I had ever heard.  My friend became hysterically screaming and pounding on the dashboard of my car saying ""Let's get out of here!""  Then I was compelled to get out of the car.  I remember thinking to myself that this was incredible and I wanted to remember it.  There was an old fence around the field that had some vine type growth on it and although I don't recall crossing it, I remember standing very near to the circle of light on the ground and noticing that the hairs on my arms were standing up and I was not cold.  I also noticed that there was no filteration of light from its source to the ground.  I could look across the circle of light into the woods at the edge of the field and it would appear as if no light was around.  There was no spreading of the light.  I wanted to remember this.  I looked up into the light source and saw what appeared to be a circler light the size of the stars in the sky.  However, it was only about 50 feet off the ground and the other stars seem to only be visible in a circle around the object, which was black as the sky, approximatley 50 feet from the center.  The light source had a 50 feet diameter length of blackness the same color as the sky around it and then you could see the other stars in the sky, so the craft was vertually invisible.  I looked over at my! friend, who was perfectly still in a pose that looked as if she stopped in mid stride of hitting the dashboard of the car.   I looked back and noticed grooves on the underside of the craft along with what appeared to be a flag and symbols and then the crafts light went out or it shot straight up until it looked exactly like its surrounding stars, no blackness around it any longer that was unusal compared to its neighboring stars anyway.  Then the star did a criss cross toward the north until I could no longer see it.  I was very excited about it and wanted to discuss it when we got home.

It went directly over. I had posted this at another site previously so this is an copy of that. It was the summer of 1981 I believe. Carnes, MS.(35 miles SW of Hattiesburg) About 8pm. My wife and I were walking around outside and talking. It was a clear cloudless night so I was looking at the stars. As we turned to go in I noticed it. It was coming from a West-North Westerly direction. It was moving at approximately 10-15 mph and maybe 10-15 ft above the pines. It was a 3 sided and I think a little longer than wide ( my wife says diamond shaped) with white lights spaced around the sides. Maybe 6 lights per side. Of course I was excited to see this and was making funny comments about being ""beamed up"" but my wife was terrified so I took her in and calmed her. As quickly as I could I went to the front door and looked in the direction the object should have gone. Seeing nothing I turned to go in and saw it (actually another like it) going back in the direction it had come but it was 1/4 mile north of where it should have been. As it went out of sight I turned to go in again and realized why it wasnt where I expected it to be. There was another (or the original) moving in a Northerly direction about 1/4 mile south-east of me. Just then it makes a turn (more like a stop and turn) back to the same direction it had come from in the beginning; about a 20 degree turn. As it turned the light at the front of the object got brighter, just as a flashlight seems to brighten as it sweeps past your face. This time I stayed outside and watched it, over my wifes objections. It went directly over my home, just above the tree tops, 10-15 mph and at no time did I hear any noise from it. Since it did go directly over my home I was able to estimate it to be about 60-70 ft wide and maybe 80-100 ft long. As close as it was, I could still not make out any other features. Except for the lights, it blended in with the darkness because of its color. It continued at the same speed and altitude till out of sight.

But as soon as they started bouncing around, foward, reverse, left, right we new we were veiwing something none of us had ever seen before.  While in flight they seemed to make hard angle turns as if from one point to another in any direction.  I guesed they may have been as far as 100 miles out to sea at times. And maybe up to 6000 feet elevation all the way down to 500 feet in as little as a secound.  They cleared a set of coastal mountains that looked to be quite far away to the left of our horizon but then were instantaniously back centered over our feild of vision.  I guesed the experience lasted close to 20 to 30 secounds because my freinds and I had time to look at one another and ask each other if we were all seeing the same thing, which was confirmed.  At the time of the sighting I had a sense of feeling priveleged to be seeing what we were seeing.  My other freind shared a similiar feeling.  The kid stsnding to the right of me was terrified and refused to go camping the following weekend with his family.  The discs did have some sort of running lights, they circled the disc none seemed to stay a consistent color changing from red,green,yellow,white, and maybe blue every couple of secounds.  This event took place 20 years ago but is still crystal clear in my memory.  We were all in 5th grade not to young and not to old, we all new what we had seen. I know I saw a UFO that night to this day.  Years later I ran into my Freind Jeff with whom I veiwed the UFO with.  I just had to bring the incident back up, it had been 16 years since I had even seen him, he recalled the experience just as I had remembered it.  My guese is the ufos were either silver or a silver white it was dark but I could see the running lights reflecting off the craft.  They didn't appear to be to big maybe the width of a 10 person leer jet.  The ufos were silent from where we stood.... 20 years ago, but it doesn’t ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I had this strange feeling. I looked in the yard -nothing. I looked up, and there, to my left, above the trees was a ufo. This was what I remember; the craft was hovering, not too high, at an angle. The side closest to the ocean tilted slightly down. The house itself was three blocks from the  water, and the craft appeared to be just a bit closer than that. It  was  saucer like, fat in the middle, and I remember  thinking how it looked very sleek. The moonlight reflected off the craft, illuminating it's shape. It might even have  been a full moon that night  which inspired me to look out the window. The  craft had lights (round)  encircling it. They  would seemilngly rotate around the craft, changing colors on the way back around. I remember seeing blue and red, aswell as orange. I casually told my friend there was a ufo outside, to impress her with my blase  attitude. She didn't believe me at first, but then she saw it. We sat in her bed for a while staring at it. W e  thought about waking her  grandparents, we  joked  about very tiny green men marching in the house if  we didn't  wake them. My friend went to  sleep shortly afterward. I would occasionaly check to make sure the craft was still there:it was reassuring.  The next thing I  remember is  realizing I had fallen asleep.

I was struck by a dim moving shape coming from my left (that is from north). Though this is a quite inhabited area, the sky was very bright and the stars quite visible. It was a chevron formed by several dim lights (10 more or less), just like stars, but with a litlle less brilliance, moving together towards south (in between the lights it was plain black). It just moved slowly, and calculating through the angular disposition of the chevron, it was high in the sky, more or less at the same altitude as cruising airline airplanes . Nevertheless it had none of the usual characteristics of an airplane (no red or white flickering lights, which I usually see either in low altitude during landing procedures in the nearby airport, or at high altitude since in Lisbon it appears to exist an important radio reference). I noticed, however, that one of the snmall lights got out of the formation and disapeared. That is to say that I've never seen nothing like it. Of course, it hadn´t any specularity. It continued to move slowly towards south (I thought to wake up my wife, but I knew that the shape would soon run out of view).

Shortly before the Villlage of Oak Creek my 10 year old son who was in the back seat said ""What is that thing in the sky?"".  I said it was probably a plane but he seemed insistent so I strained my neck to look where he was pointing.  At that time I noticed what appeared to be a shiny metallic-like object that seemed to be halfway between a round and disc shape.  It was high in the sky, about where a small plane would normally fly.  It was not moving, just hovering.  As the road I was on is very winding I couldn't keep my eyes on it for very long at a time.  My son, however continued to observe it for at least 4 minutes.  It didn't appear to do anything except hover high above the rocks until I looked up the last time.  Then it appeared to get physically smaller and smaller over a period of about 15 seconds until it completely disappeared.  Shortly after this I stopped in the Village of Oak Creek to get a coffee, all the while marveling with my son over what we had just seen.  After about 5 minutes we proceeded to get back on the road at which time my son said ""There is is again"".  It had moved position slightly and seemed a bit lower this time.  A jet plane flew almost directly over it at that time and it gave us a bit of perspective as to the size.  It seemed to be about a quarter of the size of a large plane.  Once again, it just hovered and did not make any movements. (or sound that we could tell)  We continued to watch it for another 3 or 4 minutes (myself in between looking at the road of course)and because of the enormous rocks and cliffs around Sedona we then lost sight of it.

This occurred in a brightly lit meadow near the summit of Mt. Shasta at about 4:30 in the afternoon. The light was intense, pure, and very small (about dime sized). It appeared in front of the trunk of a Spruce tree not more than 100 feet away, slightly above head level (about 6 feet up). The light would slowly transition from one solid color to the next, and then it would remain an intensely bright pure color for about a minute before slowly transitioning to the next color. I approached the tree and examined the trunk, limbs and foliage. I could find nothing that could have emanated that sort of light. I toyed with the idea of pitch oozing slowly out and while solidifying changed the reflected color, but the pitch I observed was cloudy white and in huge dried clumps. The pitch was to the right of the location of the light I pinpointed while using binoculars (I observed the light with the naked eye and binoculars). I had a camera and didn't use it; I couldn't see the light in the viewfinder. The light could only be viewed in one direction, and as I approached the tree, the light would disappear. I have no idea of where the source of the light was in relation to the distance between me and the tree except that it was in front of the trunk about 6 feet above ground level as viewed from ground level. ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT BY SAME WITNESS)) With regard to the lights on Shasta, unfortunately I have no theories as to what the lights were. Here is the whole boring story: I was asleep in the meadow when I opened my eyes to find a red light shining into them. I closed my eyes, thinking ""Oh its just a reflection from tensile on the tree"", thinking better of that, I reopened them to find the light changing from red to orange. I sat up and thought that was strange. When I sat up the light disappeared, so I lay back down and discovered that the light was directional. I had to be careful how I moved to keep the light in view. The 'now orange' light was intense and pure and I couldn't write it off as a reflection. I stared at it for awhile, enjoying the beauty of it; then it started transitioning to yellow. Well that really piqued my curiosity. As the light grew in intensity and purity to a very bright lemon yellow, I took out my binoculars and isolated the position on the tree where it appeared to be coming from. I stood up to investigate but discovered that I was ill. I had a hard time going to the tree as waves of nausea were sweeping over me. As I approached the tree, I lost sight of the light as I was no longer in it's line of site, for the moment I was sure that an examination of the tree would yield the answer. At the tree, I couldn't find anything that could cause it except for maybe pitch, but the pitch was in the wrong location and none of it was fresh. I went back to my original position on the ground and found the light transitioning from yellow to green. I admired the green light for awhile and tried to take a picture of it, since I couldn't find it in the viewfinder I gave up. I tried again to find the source, to no avail. When I returned again to my original position, the light had transitioned to blue. Again I tried to approach the tree this time keeping the light in sight, but as soon as I'd get close, I'd loose the light. When I returned to the original position to regain it, the light was gone. Although I said the whole thing lasted 5 minutes, it could have been longer.  I had time to sit and stare at it, take out binoculars and stare at it, run back and forth to the tree, and finally tried to get a picture of it. The camera I had was just a digital camera-not my camcorder. My camcorder would have been able to zoom in on the light no problem as it has a fantastic zoom. The camera I had with me doesn't have a very good zoom. I regret that I didn't take pictures anyway, as it may have shown up in the picture. At this point, my guess would be pretty far out at to what it could be. I have the impression that some unseen person or thing was standing there shining lights in my eyes.

Height estimate is based on height of constant overhead airplane traffic over Omaha which I would imagine to be at roughly 37,000 feet.

(100 miles west of Oklahoma City on I-40). I noticed the object was perfectly round, and it was extremely bright- almost too bright to look at directly at first. I also noted a unusual white ""florescence"" to it. On closer examination with my 10 x 50 binoculars, it appeared to have 2-3 internal lights of some kind that were clearly visible, similar to a hot air balloon would have. However, it was not a balloon. No other details were noted. It flew in a westerly direction roughly following I-40 toward Amarillo. After it flew from overhead, and at about a 45 degree angle to the horizon, it started to rapidly change colors to a yellow, then a bright red and finally to a deep blue-purple internal glow that it maintained until it disappeared. I was able to estimate the object to be at about 5,000 feet, and moving at about 25-30 miles per hour, and it was moving steadily to the west. At the time of the sighting we had a SE wind at 5-7 mph. The object was in sight until about 8:15 PM when it ""winked"" out as I was watching it through binoculars. It went from about a 80 degree overhead angle to about 20 degrees above the horizon in that time. At it's closest it was about 1/2 the size of the full moon, or about the size of your thumb at arm's length. I have eliminated weather balloons, planets, stars, aircraft and blimps as a possible explanation. I did notice Venus in the southwest sky about 10-15 degrees above the horizon. The object did not resemble Venus or a star. There were no aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.",2002-09-28T00:00:00,35.394,-99.45295625

My husband, a geologist, and I enjoy watching the sky -- eclipses as well as auroras. We currently live in a rural area where skies are often clear and the stars are very bright.  Upon awakening at roughly 4 a.m. 09/23/02, my attention was immediately drawn out the window to a brilliant star-like object to the SE, approximately 15 degrees up. It seemed exceptionally bright, especially since the landscape was flooded with competing moonlight. The object was flashing and pulsing red, green and white light --occasionally a flash would light up the immediate sky around it.  It first seemed motionless, yet very slowly passed from view behind the pines that surround this location. (I was keeping my head stationary on the same place on my pillow.) I had binoculars by the bed and trained them on this object as it reappeared through the trees, as I lay still. Well, through the binoculars the object seemed to change shape. At one point it was like a v-shaped pale pink blob, at another point it changed to a thin horizontal line, and at another stage a thin vertical line. This was peculiar and puzzling!  (In my mystification, I have been searching for explanations ...possibly the changes were created by the optics of the window glass?? Or atmospheric effects?) The intensity of the light faded, and when it passed behind another ponderosa, I waited for it to re-appear, but it did not. There was no sound associated with this object.  Other than the surrounding forest, which blocks some of the sky, thanks to our elevation and sparse population we have very good night sky viewing conditions --we've spotted the ISS and enjoyed the Perseids.  I have not seen anything to compare with the brilliancy, flashings, colors and odd shape/behavior of this object.  I emailed staff at the Bruneau Dunes Observatory, who responded that I probably saw a planet or giant red star, though they couldn't really say without a better location.

I saw a commercial air plane flying East at high altitude. The plane was leaving a dissapating contrail. I saw a very white object that I first thought was a lone white crane (bird). I thought it was this type of bird because it was so white. The sun was obviously upon it. At first sight it also seemed to be 'flapping'. I have to rule out this object as a bird. Due to several reasons:  1. The 'flapping' was very irregular. 2. The 'bird' reached the far horizon in 60 seconds. 3. It was still visible through the haze of the horizon, towards the sun. (No bird could reflect that much light.) 3. The speed it reached the horizon combined with its altitude. 4. Odd pattern of flight. I rule out an aircraft. 1. No contrail.  2. Obviously different when compared to the airliner we saw at the same moment in the sky. 3. Path of flight was SE with several fairly rapid curves more easterly then more southerly then back to the SE. 4. The speed of the object.  5. The apparent 'flapping' which now can only be described as 'shape changing' as it went into the horizon. I rule out a satelite in orbit, or the space station, or space shuttle.  1.  The sky was still blue and the sun shining. Only something the size of the current space station could have reflected so much light.   2. The path of flight was not a staight line.  3. The space shuttles have been grounded for months. Across the street from me two spanish speaking gentlemen also witnessed the object.

I had spent more time out in the woods than I had planned on, and the sun had already set as I made my way back to my Jeep, when I noticed a bright light in the sky moving in my direction. At first I thought it was just an airplane and thought nothing of it. But then it suddenly stopped moving and began to pulsate, getting brighter and then fainter.  I noticed at this time that there appeared to be a slight haze surrounding the object. The pulsating increased in tempo until the object was flickering at a very rapid rate, when suddenly, a bright beam of light shot down from the bottom of the object to the ground below.  This was no searchlight.  Even a well focused searchlight tends to diffuse with distance, but this light was a tight, bright beam from top to bottom. As suddenly as the pulsating began, it stopped, and the beam also turned off.  The object just sat there motionless in the sky.  My Jeep was only about 100 yards away when all this happened, so I ran to it to get my camera.  I took a picture of the object as it hovered, and as I got ready to take another picture the object it began moving around slowly in a tight circle.  I took another picture, but before I could take a third, it suddenly shot straight up in the air at fantastic speed and was gone from sight!

I went north filled with curiosity about this object and turned right on some road in a comercial area eventualy the object was directly above. Other cars in the area were all driving slow and gazing on up at the sky. I then found the object getting closer and closer above me i looked up and the object was giant probably around 300 yards it was all i could see above me naturaly this is when my fear set in. I then turned a u turned and the object continued north. During this whole event i heard a deep low frequency rumbling noise. After the object left my site i returned home and called my friend. The next day went by and we decided to go out and look for it again. We went out a little later then i had the night before and we saw lights off in the west. Shooting from one area to another with great speed. He then became very excited we drove around the area for two hours but failed to see anything else besides that first initial light. We will be back tomorrow night around the same time with a camera to see what we can.

My husband and I are avid campers and we camp quite a bit in a nearby town called Guntersville at a campground called Honeycomb Campground.  We were situated in our boat just above the Guntersville Dam on the Tennessee River.  My husband and I have both witnessed some unidentified objects in the sky and on the ground before, but we never really talk about them much until this weekend when something strange happened to us.  We were out at about 23:00 pm doing some catfishing.  We witnessed an object that appeared to be round fly across the sky just about 200 yards above some treetops.  It appeared to be comet-like in appearance but the trail it left behind did not fan out like most comets do.  By no means am I an expert, but I am quite sure this was not a comet.  It went horizontally straight across the sky above the treetops.  It appeared out of nowhere and continued for a long distance across the sky to only disappear in thin air.  It has an orange ""trail-like"" glow behind it, but the circular part up front did not appear to have any glow around it, it was just in front of this trail.  It was faster than any jet that we know of.  My hubby is an Army brat so he has seen a few up close up and personal.  There was NO sound whatsoever.  Okay, we were trying to convince ourselves that it must be a comet...however, it never descended toward Earth.  Then about 15 seconds later, ANOTHER one, but only this one came from below at the edge of the treetops and ascended into the sky.  It had a blue flame and it was almost on top of our heads when it appeared.  It had a shorter trip than the first one, but it was just as spectacular.  I have never seen a shooting star ascended from that far down into the sky and that quickly to boot.  I didn't think a comet could do that either.  Had we only seen the first one, we would have wrote the event off as being maybe a meteroid but the mystery was it remained completely horizontal across the sky to disappear as quickly as it appeared.  I would have thought had it been a co! met, we would have seen it coming from the distance and approach and then pass by.  The altitude at which this occurred seemed to be odd for a jet, but a jet cannot fly this fast.",2002-09-13T00:00:00,34.3196,-86.2735

About maybe half a minute after I started, a very bright, well defined ""greenish-white"" light passed through my field of view, moving quickly, but steadily....not like an aircraft. I presumed it was a low orbiting satellite, but as I watched, it split into two distinct lights, one red, the other green. As I kept looking, the lights merged back into the original  ""greenish-white"" light originally spotted. I also thought it might be a fighter jet just banking with respect to my line of sight, but I would have seen the green (starboard) light first, then green and red, then back to green. The first, original color was a very pale green...almost white, the ""split color"" a much deeper green, (alot like a navigation light). The object travelled from northeast to southwest, and was spotted about 45 degrees up from the horizon to where I lost it over the house. No sound was heard during or after the object passed, and I listened for about 60 seconds afterwards in the event it was a high altitude jet. No sound. About 10 minutes later, I heard what sounded alot like fighter aircraft flying high up. This sighting lasted about 10 seconds from when I caught it until I lost it.

Earlier in the evening (from 10 - 11pm) we watched an impressive display of the Northern lights. I fell asleep on the couch and awoke around 3am Sunday and decided to take my sleeping bag and pad onto the deck to fall asleep under the stars. While stargazing I noticed what appeared to me as a satellite tracking from south to north. Upon further observation I noticed that the object was being followed by two additional lights of the same size. All three were equidistant forming a very distinct triangle pattern. The lights were about 1.5 - 2x brighter than the surrounding stars. Lying on my back they appeared to be about one hand width distance from each other from my perspective. The lights were white only with no accompaning marker lights such as those on an airplane. I grabbed binoculars from the house but was unable to focus on the target objects. I continued to follow the objects with my naked eye as they tracked steadily to the north. The lights held the distinct triangular pattern and faded into the horizon. I have seen many satellites in the past but never three in such a distinct formation. I became motivated to file this report after talking to several friends and realizing that it seemed quite odd for three satellites to be moving in what appeared to be formation. Additionally, I am accustomed to seeing satellites much earlier in the evening. An interesting side note is that after the sighting I observed two brief flashes, similar to a mirror at a great distance reflecting sunlight. The flashes were quite brief but 3-4x brighter than the stars. These occured about a minute apart from each other and were overhead in the area through which the objects had passed. At this point i was all set with skywatching for the evening and promptly closed my eyes and eventually drifted off. ((NUFORC Note:  We are aware of the U. S. Navy ""NOSS"" satellites which currently are in orbit, but they are not in a polar orbit, to the best of our knowledge.

At approximately 1600 hours on the 8th of September I witnessed a number of UFO's with another person. We were in Central Park in NYC and I was laying down in the shade looking straight up in to the sky. I noticed one object that looked to be circular and white, I thought it was a satellite or maybe a planet. I didn't think much of it until I noticed that it had not moved for several minutes. I pointed the object out to my friend and asked if it could have been the planet Venus since sometimes you can see it during the day and it obviously was not a satellite since it had not moved. As we were both discussing it we noticed that it had started to move. Then my friend pointed out another one in a different part of the sky. As we looked around we started to see more and more. We watched as the slowly moved in different directions and at one point three of the objects formed in a shape of a triangle (probably several miles apart) and then slowly moved back into a straight line and then went in completely different directions. The most interesting event was when one of the objects looked as though it completely changed form and turned from a sphere into a longer thinner object. This object moved at a high rate of speed across the sky in a movement that  could most closely be described as  ""sperm-like.""  Due to it's speed, this object was only seen for about 45 seconds before it moved out of sight. The rest of the objects very slowly moved apart from each other or too high for us to see.  The final talley of the objects was eleven. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  We spoke with him over the telephone, and found him to be serious-minded and quite credible.

I clocked it at approximately mach 3 (2250 mph), which is well beyond the bounds of civil aviation. It then pulled up and lost speed faster than I have ever seen a human aircraft do. When it slowed to a stop, it simply slid backwards until it was behind a building in the distance. Obviously, this surpasses the capabilities of *any* human-built aircraft. It either landed or sped of at ground level, because we neither heard nor saw an impact or an explosion.

At first I thought it was a train (there is a track approximately 1/4 mile from my house). After about thirty seconds it became clear that it was a helicopter. I thought at the time that it was quite strange for two reasons: first, I don't remember seeing any helicopters at the lake before, and two, it was dark. A friend and I ran down my steps and into the clearing near the water. We then saw that there were two helicopters flying very low and fairly fast. There was enough ambient light that we could clearly see the silhouettes of the helicopters. It was several seconds before I noticed that they appeared to be chasing two ""points of light"" that were traveling equally as low and fast, staying about 750 feet in front of the helicopters. They were moving independent of each other and the helicopters, but there was no ""silhouette"" of any kind associated with the two objects that I would estimate as being 3-5 feet in diameter.

It seemed every inch was perfectly lit, as if the object itself was glowing.  The color was a pale greenish.  there seemed to be a ring around the disk that was a darker color, perhaps black, though it still was completely visible against the night sky.  The moon was not out, as it was hidden behind the clouds.  The only light source I can imagine was from the UFO itself.  It hovered stationary, it seemed, though we were in a car.  When we pulled into our driveway, the tree line in our neighborhood blocked our view, so we lost sight.  If the UFO was moving, it was doing so very slowly and in a kind of sliding manner.  I am going to go and look for it again.  Hopefully i will have more to add, along with photos, in a short while.  Oh, one more thing.  As soon as we got out of the car, we heard jets roaring.  We live near an air station, so that is not abnormal.  However, the jets were flying in 2 pairs, away from the direction we saw the craft.

Traveling west on Craig in N.Vegas Nevada, my girlfriend and I witnessed a very large and bright, glowing sphere traveling at fairly high speed in a steep trajectory, emerging over Sunset Mountain.  Somewhat like a rocket launching, but with a glowing trail of exhaust and no visible fire coming from the rear.  It was just after dark, there were some clouds visible, but they were not glowing, even though they were in the same area and plane as the object. The object traveled at a constant trajectory for approximately 10 seconds, then appeared to slow dramatically, emitted a bright aura, somewhat like a firework just before the big 'pow,' then appeared to change trajectory and disappear straight up into the clouds.  It didn't vanish suddenly.  It was more like it faded out.  Like a flashlight in the fog. The glowing trail remained for about 10-15 minutes.  It was extremely bright.  It did gradually dissipate.  As it did, it emitted several different colors around the edges of the trail. (Blue, green, purple) The moon was south of us, the object west.  They were not close together. I am not a Trekkie or UFO freak, I am only reporting what I saw.  Living near Nellis AFB I have seen many aircraft ranging from the Stealth, to F15's to single props.  I have never seen anything as large as this, or traveling in such a manner.   The glowing trail and sudden trajectory change to me is unexplainable.  The nearest thing I have seen is a space shuttle launching, but this was much different. There was no visible ship, just a very bright corona/aura. What the hell would the space shuttle be doing in Pahrump, Nevada?  Did anyone else see this?  It wasn't late and Vegas is a big town.  Surely someone else saw this other than my girlfriend and I.

They seemed to possibly be about 1 mile away from us I suppose (it was hard to tell this). They hovered for a while. Eventually, as time went by, at least 7 lights were seen by both of us. I used binoculars to try and see more, but all I could make out was the orange lights and nothing else, except for what seemed like smoke/steam/exhaust? coming from them at times. This stream of exhaust seemed to go up into the sky quite a ways. We heard no sound and the night air was calm.

It suddenly slowed down, then wobbled and went slightly sideways, and at that point it changed to more of a white colour briefly, then it tilted back to a horizontal position and started moving again to the north. I ran inside and yelled to some CSRs (who were just 15 feet inside the door), ""Come tell me if this isn't a flying saucer!"" and they all 4 ran out.  One of them could also see it, but the other 3 couldn't.  It was flying rapidly to the north, seeming to fly faster all the time.  It was still an elongated dark object.

It was a triangle shape, and had numerous white lights. It was hovering approx. 200-300 feet off the ground, and didn't make a sound. I was about 6 or 7 miles from the Dover Air Force base, but no craft I know of could hover still like this. After about two minutes it very slowly made its way across the road, heading NE. I quickly hopped in my car and made a U-turn, but it disappeared over some trees. Many other people were on the road and I'm sure someone else saw it. I didn't report it to the local police, because I didn't think anyone would believe me. I arrived at my house an hour later, where my stepbrother and his girlfriend were waiting.

I am a component engineer in the electronics design industry and am 46. The craft stayed - not hovering with movement - in one place and had two lights shine down to the water in cone shape with the wide part of the cone illuminating the water. The craft appeared to be a helicopter but had no wop wop sound. It shined a light toward our direction in the direction of east that was very bright as if to hide the outline of the craft while lighting up the water in an alternate sequence with each beam lasting about 2-3 seconds before switching to the other beam and often more rapidly then that. There were two red lights seen on the  craft separate from each other but close - if it were a private plane the red lights were about 10 feet apart. We watched the craft stay in one place doing all this for about 2 minutes. It then turned off the beams down to the water and the light shining east and came slowly east toward our direction for about a minute or so as if on a tightrope and then turned southerly angling toward Seatac airport at which time I saw a strobing white light in front of the craft, the two red lights, and then heard prop sounds typical of prop private airplanes and it continued flying toward Seatac.

Though I wanted to go to my house for a camera to take a photo, my friend was afraid to return to the spot.  We did go to a nearby corner store and called police to report it.  No one took us seriously at either the store or the police.  We did not return to that location again that night.  There were no reports in the paper about the sighting, though it seems apparent that others must have seen it also. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I still don't know why I suddenly had the urge to turn and take a picture due south as there wasn't anything there we could use in our work.  When the slide was processed and I looked at it through an eye loop, I saw the UFO just  above the horizon just right of center.  I have been a professional pilot for many years and knew it wasn't an airplane.  A close friend who sold million dollar photo and printing eguipment, sent the slide to Kodak labs--the ones that do work for the FBI to have it analyzed to see if it was an error on the film. Their report said it was something in the air flying at tremdous speed.  In the enlargement you can see by the light it was really moving.  My logs showed I was using 25 ASA film and shot the picture at F4 at 1000th of a second.  We have since seen other UFO's but have not gotten photos of them.  Being a long time pilot, I'm always looking up to the sky. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for the report, and for the photographs.  It is very difficult to establish what the light is in the photo.  Given that it is not possible to know its distance from the camera, facts such as the object's size, velocity, etc., are all not able to be calculated, in my opinion.  I do not know how even Kodak would have been able to determine that the object was moving at a high velocity. Hence, given the information available to us from your report, the object remains just an unidentified light, to the best of my knowledge. Did you note the object at the time of your sighting, or see it later while examining your photos.  Also, was your camera on a tripod, at the time of the shot? Thanks, again, for sharing the information with our Center!  Cordially,  Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Yes, it was on a tripod. When I took the picture I was unaware of the  object.  Kodak measured the light trail and compared it with known flying or moving objects.  This was not the regular Kodak lab that you have access to. I have in many years of flying all over the world seen many other flying objects and about 6 years ago I was driving into town and saw a bright red orb that I felt was over the area of my house.  At this time the cloud layer was about a thousand feet and decending as it ofthen does here in the valley. I was five miles away and having flown thosands of hours I'm a pretty good judge of where things in the air are around here.  I called my wife and she went outside and saw it several hundred yards from our house over new construction on the I-5 freeway.  When I got home it was still hovering in place below the cloud layer.  About twenty people were outside watching it.  It was bright red, the light coming from within.  It did not pulse, just glowed.  I called the tower chief at the airport 2 miles away.  The cloud base was 300 feet.  As I pulled off the freeway going north at Market street it was directly ahead of me over the roadway.  When I got home it was directly east of my house. Allowing me to see it from three sides. It stayed there for another half an hour for a total time since I saw it of about 45 minutes.  It appeared to be about the size of a large auto.  It did not fly away, it just seemed to implode into itself. No noise. Just hovered there.  I have seen enough of them in my 56 years to not be bothered by them, I just assume they're here and have been here for thosands of years.  The first one I saw was about twenty miles south of here in 1956.  It flew over our farm at slow speed.  The newspaper said it was seen all over Oregon that night. ((NAME DELETED)).  P.S for many years I flew at least 4 days a week at night.  You see many things flying over the mountains around here at night.  If you need names of others who saw the red orb over the freeway, just ask. ((END CORRESPONDENCE))",2002-07-30T00:00:00,44.5034,-123.9951

Something about the light did not seem right so I pulled over to the side of the road. I was headed north towards Springfield, MO and was very close to the MO border. The sun was setting and the craft was in shadow at the northern edge of a field below me. The beam of light turned into the visible exhaust of an engine. As the craft ascended vertically the rocket-shaped object turned north-northeast so that I could see that the engine emitting exhaust was a central engine surrounded by five or six other engines that were firing intermittently. The craft seemed to be a mat black in that as it got to tree top level (and was flying horizontally by this time) the sun did not reflect on it at all--even though the sun was SW of me and the rocket was north. It had been standing upright at the edge of the field and as it rose it turned on it's side and also rotated slowly. I could see, as it turned, that it had no FAA regulation lights or markings of any kind. The only lights on it were small white non-strobe placed at various points so I could determine the shape of the whole object. It flew over the trees and disappeared beyond them traveling very slowly--between 20 and 40 mph it seemed--moving in a NE direction. I noticed the time--it was between 5 and 6 pm. I did not ""lose"" any time. There was no traffic on this stretch of the road even though there was before and after the sighting. There were houses up on a ridge to the right of me and I saw no one observing from any of the houses. I checked my engine--it was on--but everything was quiet enough to realize the craft had made no noise whatsoever. As I drove on to Springfield, hoping to stop in time for the 10 o'clock news, there was one ""report"" on the radio when I heard a woman call in to a sports talk show on AM and ask for advice to reporting the sighting of the craft. She was agitated and confused and the host and guest on the show (talking about the Houston Atsrodome) did not know what to say. After some silence, the host reminded her that she had called in to a sports talk show and asked if she had a question about the dome. When she said 'no' he put her off the air. I arrived in my motel room at 10 pm and watched the news [I don't recall the station Id. any longer] and the very last piece was a video a farmer had sent in that evening that showed the craft flying over his field. While the anchors laughed and joked about the video, they relayed that the farmer has said that he was doing some night plowing and he jumped off his tractor when it seemed the craft was so low it might fly into the tractor. The video showed the same object I saw still flying slowly and horizantally in an east-north east direction. The anchors reported that the object had been seen along the Arkansas and Missouri border that evening [and a few other states that I no longer recall]. However, when the station checked with the nearest military base they were told that radar had detected nothing and that what people were probably seeing was lights from the burning debris of a Soviet satellite that was re-entering the atmosphere. It was quite obvious from my observation and the video that what we saw was not any kind of satellite and that no satellite [that looked like a rocket?] would have been able to fly above treetop level, below radar, maintain a constant speed and not crash anywhere. The debris from the actual satellite burned up upon entering the atmoshpere, was miles up in the night sky and looked momentarily like a falling star--as reported by other news sources.",2002-07-30T00:00:00,34.737536276849646,-92.3631923627685

I was standing about knee deep in the Pacific Ocean, about 25 feet south of the Marine Street Lifeguard Stattion.  I noticed a cigar shaped silver metallic craft about 100 yards to the north, travelling south .  It was silent and seemed to float in the air eeirely.  It moved very slowly.  The craft was approximately 25 feet long and 10 feet high at its highest point (the middle of the craft).  It was symmetrical in shape, and in classic flying saucer shape.  It had no visible windows or markings. It was aluminum or bright siver in color.  It was approximately 500 yards off shore over the Pacific Ocen in Manhattan Beach.  Once it came to a point directly in front of me off the coast it began to wobble in a strange slow wobbling motion.  At that point I became alarmed with internal emotion and recognized it to be 100% conclusively a flying saucer or UFO.  I probably stopped beathing. In an instant, the craft took off in a blur.  It became a pinpoint of orange-yellow light, similar to a minature sun.  It seemed to be imprinted as this light in the far distant horizon.  the duration of this fixed pinpoint of light was approximayely 10 seconds.  It then vanished. Minutes later, shaken up and returning to my towel I noticed a whilpool of water about the same distace (500 yard off the coast) but probably just caused by the wind and tidal conditions.

Suddenly all the lights went out.   A power outage.   I quickly decided ""time for bed!""  So I went through my new custom of walking throughout the first floor rooms, closing the windows before retiring upstairs to the master bedroom.  Only this time, it was pitch dark.   As I went to the little rear left bedroom, I went to the open window which faced east and watched as the whole area was without lights.   I could see the large light standards near the high school about 1.5 miles away which were the only operating lights that I could see.  I could hear an occasional vehicle go by on Volcano Highway three blocks to my left (Northwest).   I stood there enjoying the wonderful, sultry trade winds blowing directly into my window on this beautiful, mostly clear evening.  The moon had risen to my right (Southeast) Suddenly, slightly to the left (North) I saw a sphere of blue-white light coming in this general direction.   I figured it was a helicopter with a searchlight coming to investigate the power outage situation...maybe to locate a transformer out of commission.   But I have seen MANY helicopters with searchlights, having lived in Pasadena, CA, where the police use them nightly; and in New York City, which has more choppers than any city in the world.   They have a definite beam of light (this didn't) and, of course, helicopters make lots of noise (this was totally silent). I could still hear the traffic go by on Volcano Highway and this object was ""hugging the treeline"" as it made somewhat acrobatic moves and an ""S-turn"" or two.   As I looked at it, I figured that it was no more than 1/4 mile from me and the light source had three distinct ""spike-like"" beams emanating from it.   Almost like an astronomical image with a diffraction pattern.  One beam went straight up (0 degrees), another to the lower right (120 degrees) and another to the lower left (240 degrees).   As it kept moving, I was aware that I would shortly lose sight of it as it passed behind the outcroppings of my neighbors' properties across and down the street.  So I ran upstairs where I should get a longer view of it.   It took perhaps 6-7 seconds to get upstairs, but alas, it was gone.  I never saw it again. I was anxious to see an explanation of the power outage.   In the Hilo Tribune-Herald of two days' hence there was an article.   At 11:30PM a blown transformer caused a power outage in Kurtistown, Mountain View, Keaau, and the Kawailani section of Hilo.   The Kawailani section of Hilo had its power restored at 11:41PM (which is right after I saw it) and the other areas (including mine) had their power restored around 12:45AM. I have looked for anomalous objects all of my life, and this is the first one that I have seen fairly close by that I really could not explain.

Education-BA Liberal Studies and an MA in Educ Avid back yard astronmer and ufologist for over 15 years.  This report details the sighting of 3 anomalous objects. Date of report: 6/1/02 Preliminary information: On May 29, at 10:32PM (three days ago), I was at roughly the 6800ft elevation in the California mountains up along highway 108 in California, north of Yosemite past the Dardanelles, near a resort called Kennedy meadows.  We were staying at a private cabin and I was using a 4"" refractor telescope and binoculars to view the crystal clear, high country night sky.  It was moderately cool with no haze or weather -- a great night for viewing. There were only two of us.  As we spotted a number of clusters, a couple of distant galaxies and nebula, we also concentrated on counting satellites that silently trekked across the sky.  We also spotted what ostensibly was a military craft flying quite a bit higher than the commercial planes that occasionally went by.  I figured it was military because it flew like a plane but did not display the standard red and green wing tip lights.  this presumed military craft had a single white strobe that blinked about once only every five seconds.  Satellites are uniquely different from other objects in the sky.  They are distinctive since they are small spots of light, obviously very high, even beyond the high-flying military craft and soundless. Satellites also move quickly across the sky and should appear to move more slowly since they are further away, yet due to their high speed, they are still noticeably faster -- orbital velocity is roughly 17,500 mph.  Not all satellites however travel at the same speed -- some seem to be faster than others but this may be attributable to the altitude of their individual orbit -- some are further out into space than others and apparent speed becomes difficult to discern.  They also often change their light intensity since they are so high, reflecting sunlight that shines from far over the horizon.  If they are spinning, they will seem to slowly flicker as their surfaces reflect light in different directions, or their trajectory might not be conducive to good reflectivity of sunlight.  To the best of my knowledge, satellites don't emit much light of their own; this is something I need to confirm with someone who knows.  The altitudes and trajectories of satellites vary greatly, yet they all share the same features of being small, fast moving, silent points of light, well beyond the altitude of other craft. Sighting details: After spotting over 12 satellites, most travelling in a north to south or south to north orbit, I spotted another.  It was noticeably bright white, more so than most of the other satellites but I didn't think it unusual since it had virtually all  the features of satellites previously described, with a few exceptions.  I would rate its brightness to be roughly between a magnitude of 3 to 4 (using star magnitude rating). To compare it with something familiar, it was about as bright as the star Orion, (even though I don't know Orion's specific magnitude rating).  I noticed the object's intensity was constant and I thought ""this is a good one"", since often times satellites can fade quickly or come in and out of view based upon their reflective properties and surface features.  Again, it was in the same area of the sky that we had spotted many others and nothing seemed odd. However, within about two seconds of spotting it I saw two more flying behind it adjacent to one another.  They were all the exact same intensity and the three formed a perfectly symmetrical triangle.  Their exact position to one another could not be determined due to their distance from me and the effects of parallax, but I quickly went to my scope and was able to spot the lead light.  I was using a high quality 19mm eyepiece that provides about 50x magnification with my scope.  I tracked it briefly then held the scope still.  The following two lights flew right through my field of view.  They were all shaped identical, somewhat like orbs with a slight teardrop shape to them.  I wouldn't call them disks though.  I wasn't getting any significant resolution to determine specific details. Their speed was faster than some of the slow satellites we saw earlier in the evening and slower than fast ones. The entire sighting seemed to last about 4 minutes -- longer than usual satellite sightings.  I did have enough time to repeatedly track them using just my eyes, the binoculars (regular 7x35), and my 4"" telescope.  My companion also saw the objects both through the binoculars, and with his bare eyes. The formation was perfectly symmetrical in that, they moved as one unit, in the shape of a triangle, however it is important to note that the space between them did not occlude stars behind them as a solid object would do. Therefore, it can be inferred that they were three distinctly separate lights moving together as one, hence, flying in formation. The amount of sky occupied by this formation can be described as such: Hold your arm out at length, close your fist and hold up your thumb (as if you were giving a ""thumbs-up"" to someone).  Place the lead light on the tip of your thumb and the trailing lights at the base of your thumb and separate the trailing lights by the width of your thumb -- this forms the size and the triangle of their formation.  At the apparent distance of these objects, this would constitute a formation that was considerably wide apart, yet they maintained perfect symmetry from one another and continued that way with the same heading (north to south in this case) throughout the sighting. After they finally moved low enough to the horizon, they became occluded by trees, however it is important to note that they maintained their intensity of white light throughout the entire sighting. The area of the horizon into which they disappeared, was a region that no satellites were spotted.  Every other satellite heading south disappeared long before this area due to lack of direct line of sight with the sun. As we speculated about that which we had seen, we continued to watch for a few more hours until about 3:30am.  We were particularly vigilant for the next 90 minutes after the initial sighting since, if they were satellites, we might have caught a second glimpse and dismissed the event as ordinary satellites -- (they should have reappeared as they orbited the planet once again) -- however, they never reappeared. Are there any ""ordinary"" satellites that have been placed into a synchronous orbit with one another, so as to move in perfect formation through their orbits? No other unusual lights were seen throughout the rest of the evening or the next night of viewing.

PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),  Thank you very much for the excellent report!  You certainly are a very good witness, and you have reported the event excellent well, I believe.  My suspicion is that you may have witnessed the U. S. Navy's N.O.S.S. satellite trio, which has been reported to our Center since approximately July 1996.  Although the Navy will not talk about them, they were first investigated by Dr. Terence Dickerson, an astronomer (I believe), who writes for the Toronto Star.  He had received many reports of three ""satellites,"" which appeared to maintain formation over the course of several weeks' time, and which exhibited characteristics of typical man-made satellites.  There are many such reports of the phenomenon, which can be seen on our website.  Interestingly, most of the reports seem to be from the summer months.  We will post your report in the near future.  Thanks again for sharing the information with our Center!  May I forward your report to another investigator, Linda Howe, who has been interested in the phenomenon??  Cordially, Peter ((RESPONSE)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Thank you for your swift reply.  I knew the sighting was odd, but could not say for certain that they were not satellites.  Thank you for clarifying; it sounds that they may indeed have been the N.O.S.S trio of which you wrote. I would like to know more about them; the mysteries seem to be unending. I noticed that the lead light of this trio had a small protrusion of red light pointing downward towards the horizon.  It was constant, in that it was not flickering, flashing nor did it have any strobe-like modulation in any way, and had no visible means of connection to the main sphere.  However, at such a great distance, I doubt any support structure could be seen, even through my telescope.  I intentionally omitted this aspect from the report since I only caught a brief glimpse of this feature and could not described it with any accuracy other than what I just mentioned.   Yes, you may use my report and/or forward it to Linda Howe -- I am quite familiar with her fine work.  You may also include my contact information thereby allowing her to contact me if she deems necessary. You are an exceptional and dedicated Ufologist and I have had the pleasure of listening to many of your contributions to the Jeff Rense program.  I wish you continued success, and you can be assured I will be listening in the future as I have been for so long.  If I have the fortune to see anything of interest in the future you'll be the first I contact.  After 15 years of studying the subject and scouring the skies as an amateur astronomer, this recent event is the first legitimate anomalous sighting I've ever had.  Hopefully, we'll have good reason to speak again sometime. best regards, sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END))",2002-06-12T00:00:00,,

I had gone approximately 40 foot just getting ready to look with the binoculars when the lights went out.  Just like flipping a switch.

Both departments said, no.  We lived in a rural area.  Very small and very quiet.  We have lived here for 2 years we go out at nigjt to listen. There is wildlife in this area and we have livestock.

The total footage time is about 20 secs, but I shortened the film so it could be sent via e-mail.  The important parts are included, though. This object was spotted when I was filming dust particles near the sun from my third floor balcony - the sun light reflects off and amplifies flying particles in the atmosphere, when looked from a certain vantage point.  However, this object behaved unusual in the sense that it didn’t follow the air currents. All particles in the air fly either in the same direction of the wind, or erratically when there are gusty winds.  This one seemed to have a mind of its own. The object was traveling northeast, then it stopped and came back again, disappearing overhead on top of the building.  It was difficult to determine its altitude, but I estimate it to have been at least 6000 feet. Short after I began filming, I used 20X zoom, which unfortunately made the footage very shaky.

They may be landing lights on aircraft, or perhaps celestial bodies.  PD)) Constantly recurring Light (over years) that changes direction too fast to be anyhting known. This is a recurring sight.  Nights vary, but over the past few years (first seen by myself Spring 1999) in the eastern sky, a very, very bright light frequently appears.  This light regardless of the season will always show up in the same general area of the sky.  It will go from being stationary to moving in figure eights, to north& south in the sky changing direction too fast to be anything I know of.  It will some times swing like a toy tied to a pole down left then down up, reversing direction and then doing so to the right.  Some nights it will stay out for hours (like tonight) some nights for minutes after being observed. Tonight, my friend and I were out enjoying a cigarette out side and I told him about the sightings and its general reliability.  Not believing me, we walked out into the street where it can be seen through the trees and it happened to be there.  Tonight we saw more movement on it than I have ever seen before.  We watched it for about an hour and it eventually worked itself so low on the horizon we had to go to another location to see it.  At about 00:15 on 04/25/02 we made it to South Kitsap School district #402's John Sedgwick Jr. High school and observed it from the football field.  It continued its bizarre movements, sometimes none, sometimes very violent and distant (about 4-6 inches in less than 2 seconds).  It worked its way down the sky (we marked our original position with Pepsi cans) and continued to walk backwards until it was too low to be seen over the hill.  I have fixed various telescopes and binoculars on it when it seems to be stationary and nothing signifigant can be made out about it.  It just becomes a larger bright light in the sky.  I know it cannot be a planet because its always is in the same general place in the sky no matter the season, it is too bright, and it moves so visibly.  Tonight it was only myself and my friend who viewed it, but my father and another friend of mine have all seen it over the years.  Just randomly assuming this object is only 150 miles away (and it has to be further because of the attempts to view it through magnification yields nothing) its movement variation is so radical, I know that nothing known can reverse direction, turn, or even move that fast.

I thoughtthat I had located one of the planets but after watching for a few seconds,the light appearedto be moving.

The movement was quick and seemed to be wavering and moving in an upward/downward(occasionallateral movement) pattern--watching this movement made me feel a little dizzy.  The light was definitely not a planet or star.I thought about an airplane or the medical helicopter but this light did not move in the same pattern as a plane.  The light seeemed to stay in the same general area and the movement was quick and erratic. I went to get my husband and he also saw it briefly. It seemed to fade(into a yellowish color) and was gone.

I had been out in the yard with nothing seen but the usual commerical/private traffic. At around 21:45 I got in my car and proceeded to take a ride. Went south down co. rd. 47 (Rabun Rd.)and turned right onto co. rd. 96 traveling west. At the end of co. rd. 96 I took a left on hwy 59 and proceeded south several miles to co. rd. 94 (may tower rd.)where I turned left. Now I'm heading back east torward county rd 47. After traveling a short distance down 94 i noticed a car back behind me and thought to myself ""thats all i need , a car riding my butt"" . About 2 miles down 94 there is a curve to the right. As I rounded the curve there the damn thing was.....just sitting there...right in front of me ....in a hover. A triangluar craft about 200 ft are less off the ground and about 500 feet from my position. It had a white light in the bottom at each apex and no strobes could be seen. I was traveling at a slow speed (aprox 35 to 40 mph) and at this time the car behind me had caught up (about 200 yds max behind me). About 200 yds up on the left is a drive which leads to a friends house so pulled into the drive and stopped to allow the car behind to go by. Durning this i'm still looking at this craft sitting in a hover. AS the car behind me passes by i backed out into the road. The front of my car is now facing the object ( now I'm facing west again). This quick turn around must have alerted the craft to the fact that I had seen it because at this point it starts moving off to the SW. I gave chase hoping it would stop again but it proceeded to gain speed until it was out of sight. The craft clearly was triangular in shape and made no noise. I will send a detailed map via e-mail shortly. Also as stated above I turned around in a drive which leads to a friends house. This thing had to pass right over his house prior to me seeing it. I will call him this afternoon whe! n he get s in from work to see if he may have seen it. Also at this time let me state when turning around in the drive i noticed a car coming down the drive as coming from my friends house. But at this point I was giving chase so did not stay to see who it was. I would estimate the craft to be 50 to 70 ft from point to point.

However it was layed in a true S to N stream.The third chem-contrail was layed more than 50 miles away from the previous two.This chem-contrail appeared much more rapidly than the others. I believe this was not a chem-contrail.There are several reasons for this. 1) As the first two C-Trails dissipated and became more cloud like the third did not change in opacity or refraction. 2) The third C-Trail seemed to move at an extremely slow rate of speed toward the southern horizon WHILE REMAINING INTACT. 3) The third C-Trail cast a huge shadow that left a shaft of dark blue from the darkened underside to the ground that was as the tho the C-Trail was a solid object.This shadow was cast from above Toma south past Madison moving with the object south,but also spreading to the East as the Sun approached the western horizon.I would estimate the size of the shadow to be at least 200 miles long and 100 miles wide at its widest spread, before twilight.I noticed one individual at a rest area,MP 115 on I90 that was observing the phenomena with a small telescope from a rifle. I am a long haul trucker and I have seen a number of unexplainable situations and phenomena over the years. I have seen fire balls that explode in silence within a few hundred feet of the ground.

Perhaps these are naturally occurring events that I am not familiar with but,I wonder if we are not being observed by someone or something that has learned how to camouflage their activities. There is a hidden air base at Camp McCoy and Camp Douglas Wis. that is protected from view by a small range of mountains that run paralel to I 90/94.I have seen Fighters and B-52s shoot from behind those mountains in the pre-dawn hours when traffic and other activity seems to be slow.",2002-05-14T00:00:00,,

We were done riding for the day. 2 of the guys were inside cleaning off, my friend was loading up the pickup truck with the bikes and equipment. I was cleaning the surrounding yard where we had a bonfire the night previous. Weather Conditions: Clear/Sunny, Temp 56 degrees, Wind 8-10 mph out of the NW, Unusually clear day, as was the night before, No clouds, no Chemtrails. Sighting: The time was about 12:50 pm when this sighting occurred. I was looking up at the sky, at a passing jet plane. Normal contrail formation that rapidly disapated. Jet looked to be at about 10,000 feet up or about the size of a dime at arms length? As I was looking at the jet, I noticed some white flower petals, or something similar floating through the sky about 50-100 feet up, so that my field of focus switched to that for a moment. Thought nothing of it until I noticed one white object sitting in the sky. Object was at 85 degrees above me, (90 being directly overhead). Sun would have been at 80 degrees towards my back or 15 degrees from this objects position. This object remained stationary and looked to be spherical in shape. Color white, size undetermined, however this is where I got lucky and determined that this was in fact a ufo. Another jet passed over the same flight path of the last and crossed over this object. Now I was able to determine that this thing was below the plane. By how much, I do not know. The object remained stationary for 1 minute, then moved quickly about 2 feet over to the left. 2 feet relative to where I was staring if you were to point your finger on the object. The distance up there could be a few hundred to a thousand feet then? I continued to stare at this thing, it began to circle, in a spiral pattern, which made me think, ""Is this perhaps a local weather ballon caught in a wind pattern?"" Then it began to glide back to the right to it's original position, and ZOOM - it took off to the west, GONE!

I went outside to investigate whether some rumblings I was hearing was a storm approaching or just a military exercise off in the distance. It was just a military exercise as the sky was quite clear. As I was looking around in the sky for signs of any approaching storm I noticed a bright light that moved at a fairly quick pace (I would estimate the speed of the object to be a little faster than a fighter jet). At first I thought that this was an airplane approaching me directly as the intensity of the light would have been about right. But I quickly ruled this out as the object moved along a perfectly vertical path. I would estimate the object to have been somewhere in the range (+/- a couple miles) of 5 miles from my position. The object rose rapidly in altitude and then came to an abrupt stop. The distance it traversed was about just over a foot (estimating 15 inches) in about 1 second. The light then disappeared for about 1/2 second. When the light came back on the object was about 4 inches above where I last spotted it. The object then remained stationary for 1 to 2 seconds. At this point the intensity of the light was about the same as when I first noticed it. The light then began to change. It started dimming until it again disappeared. As the light dimmed it seemed that the object became smaller but this could have been due to the reduction in the intensity of the light. The light then reappeared (the object still had not moved) with the same intensity as it had at the begining and the dimming sequence was repeated except at a much quicker pace. I called my wife outside and continued to look for the object to reappear.

I was going to my parked car when I happened to look up and noticed a sphere of light moving above the clouds in what at first looked like a circular pattern.  I was looking at the object at first trying to determine what it actually is.  As I kept watching it, I was taken aback that I couldn't figure out what it was.  At this point I glanced at the clock on my cell phone and it read 12:10 am.  What struck me as irregular is that the object illuminated the clouds below it as you would expect a flood light to do.  But, a floodlight does this from the ground up.  This was occurring from above the clouds down to the ground.  As I followed the path of the moving object, I noticed that there was no floodlight from the ground up that could be illuminating the clouds in what at first was a circular motion.  I watched the object move repeatedly in a circular pattern for about five minutes.  I was mesmerized that this object was not a plane, nor a helicopter, nor a weather balloon, or any object that I've ever seen in my experience.  As I continued to look at this sphere move in a circular motion, it changed its path and now began to move in zigzag irregular path.  I had to keep my eyes carefully on the object because it was moving in and out from the cloud cover about 10,000-15000 feet up in the air where one would expect to see a commercial airliner.  It then proceeded in its irregular pattern for another 10 minutes. In this time frame, there was an opening where there was no cloud cover and the object would move into this area of the sky and then back into an area where there were clouds.  You could see the object through the clouds as it illuminated the area around itself above and below the clouds. The object then changed its flight speed and slowed down considerably and then would speed up or accelerate and again slow down.  The entire time it was doing this, it appeared as a white sphere bigger than the moon illuminating the area around itself with a tremendous amount of white light.  It continued to move erratically in and out and now changing its altitude and appearing to move closer to the ground at about the height one sees an airliner on a flight path to land at an airport. It then stopped in the air for about thirty seconds, the sphere light went out (this in an open space with no clouds around it) and then the sphere lit up with pure bright white light like a flash bulb but the light stayed on for about 15 seconds.  Just before it moved away at a fantastic acceleration, the bright light that illuminated the sphere goes out but I could still see the dark shape of the outline of a sphere exactly in  the same place and standing still in the sky.   After about 5 seconds, it zipped up and moved away in a southerly direction  at an acceleration that to me does not seem possible. It just took off and in a second, you could not see it any more. I glanced at my cell phone clock and it was 12:30 am. I am trained in the sciences and in mathematics. What this object did when it left is something which you would see maybe in special effects in a  science fiction movie but not something that at this time our technology is capable of doing.  I have never seen anything like this nor ever seen anything move like this. The entire time I was seeing this my mind was incredulous at what I could be seeing. I'm still perplexed.

It went from 60 degrees (southwest)  to 30 degrees (west)  in the duration of 20:15 to 22:15.  The white throbbing brilliance and shape varied in randomness.  The shape separates into 2 circular light and then unites. The starlike object is moving steadily closer (the size of object gets bigger and luminosity increases- my estimate is that it hovered over southwest of Manhattan -at least 3 times). and backs away at unbelievable speed.  During these times at about 21:00, I noticed an increase in military surveillance planes fly by.  At least there was more than 10-20 aircrafts/jets with surveillance capability flying by in increasing regularity.  At about 21:20, I called my male neighbor, to validate what I was seeing.  He saw the steady starlke object descend and ascend. He also noticed that it cannot be a manmade object because of the fact that it remained stationary for a long period at a time compared to our constantly moving military aircraft hovering around it.  The wife of my neighbor joined in at 21:35 followed by another woman neighbor.  They all saw the the starlike object move toward us (from west to east) and backward at tremendous speed.  We witness a light display (luminace) and (color shift - red blue yellow and white) and shape morphing.  The luminace of the starlike object penetrates through cloud covering. There were 3 or 4 military aicrafts passing by every 5 minutes coming from south, north, east and west by 21:35 to 22:30.  There were 3 times that the starlike object shuts off its luminace and hides behind the clouds in the heightened pursuit and surveillanc by military aircarfts.  It was an amazing display of light and flight technology by the starlike object.  I was also glad that I have 3 eyewitness to validate the spectacular air show.

I remember thinking if these people that I saw were seeing it to cause to the north of the parking lot there was a trailor park and one trailor had a bunch of people on the deck and I could hear them chattering about something.  I decided to take off and get a closer view of the object.  So I got in my car and went north to the point were I thought the object was only to find out it disappeared.  The next day I was going to work and I saw a fighter jet go over the same area flying low which is wierd cause it was the first fighter jet I have ever seen.  They just dont fly around low where you can see the camo paint job.  Another wierd point that I discovered was that it could of been hovering over an electric sub-station for Consumers Energy.",2002-04-25T00:00:00,,

We were standing facing East and the objects were a little to the South East of us.My recollection of details may not be 100% accurate at this point. We were watching two amber lights, the top one was stationary and the bottom one was slowly dropping down from the top light. The lights would get very bright and then dim, flicker out and then reappear. The top light finally went out completly. The second light started pulsating and then all of the sudden split into 2. The light that broke away shot straight out to the right and a very high rate of speed meeting up with about 4 or 5 other lights that were barely visable and eventually dimmed from sight. On the end of the video we see a large ball of white light that again gets very bright and dims. We can be heard discussing weather or not it is a plane but eventually decide that we do not know what it was either.

Wenatchee, WA Shape : Light It was a ball of light that was orange in the center with a red haze around it. When it passed overhead it broke in two and continued on, and broke into other pieces. The object which was a ball of light that had an orange center and a red haze around it, was approx. 4,000 ft. up because it just barely cleared the mountains (Cascades? Leavenworth area), as it was traveling from west to east, at a constant speed, little faster than a cessna. As the object was overhead, it broke into 2 pieces. The second piece broke away at a 90 degree angle and remained at a distance approx. 500 ft. from the first object and continued parallel through the sky. Both objects sent smaller objects toward one another and continued east when we lost the object over badger mountain. The sky was clear, no clouds, it was night. There was another aircraft in the vicinity but it was not chasing the object. The object produced no noise, no tail and no sparks. The other witness, contacted the local airport and was informed that nothing was seen. I contacted McChord Airforce base in Tacoma, WA and was told to contact the local police. I have also contacted MUFON and no answer has ever been given. I can tell the difference between an object re-entering the earth, like a rocket or falling satelite, this object maintained this altitude, and there was no tail at all.

Three researchers of the investigative group ""Citizens for U.N. Base Disclosure"" planned an all-night long research event on the nights of Jan. 30th and 31st of 1998. In an area known for unusual UFO activity, the researchers set up their equipment on an isolated hilltop near the Bradshaw Ranch (which has been featured on the TV show ""Sightings""). One man driving a Jeep Laredo, and a married couple in a Suzuki sport-utility eventually joined our party, and we built a camp fire as we gazed the night skies. The first sighting came at dusk, with a few stars beginning to show up. An object, descending from the east, was spotted. The object was bright white in color, approximately 10,000ft. in altitude, and about three times the size of Venus. It seemed to be a solid object. Adjacent to the object, at an est. distance of 1,000 ft. was a smaller object traveling synchronously with the larger object. We all witnessed these objects travel for about 1 minute, until they disappeared behind 6,500ft. Bear Mountain (3 miles to the east of where we were). The objects were very unusual, and did not look like any conventional aircraft. The second ""sighting"" was witnessed throughout the night: a bright light flashing numerous colors was seen low on the horizon near Camp Verde, a town about 15 to 20 miles south of our location. The light was quite clear, thus suggesting that it could not have been very far away (maybe 20 miles in distance from us). The light, when first seen, was moving up, and left and right slowly. Then it ABRUPTLY vanished. The light would then reappear in the same location...then it would eventually vanish. This activity went on throughout the night. The light simply was not an airplane due to the bright blinking colors it emitted, what's more, the light was not located near any known flight path for airplanes or near any known airport.

Leduc is a relatively small town with a population of around 15,000 situated just south of Edmonton. The area is dominated by residential housing, schools, religious centers and surrounded by farmlands. At roughly 2:45 am I decided to step outside for a breath of fresh air. The night was clear and windless. As I gazed upon the stars a grouping of them began to move. My first thought was that I was having a dizzy spell so I gave my head a shake and refocused my gaze upon the sky. I soon realized that I wasn’t dizzy at all when three points of light, forming a triangle made their way from south to north. The triangle of lights moved at a speed similar to satellites but unlike ""satellites"" this grouping changed directions 30 seconds into the sighting. The triangle began to move east. The object was either very large or very low and appeared to blot out passing stars. The object was completely silent. The lights on each tip were solid white but of very low intensity. There was a distinct impression that this object was doing its best not to be seen as it moved across the star field. As I realized what I was seeing It occurred to me that I should attempt to make record of the sighting. Very quickly I entered the house and grabbed my digital video camera. I returned to the front of the house and began filming the object as it made its way towards the northeast. I soon lost sight of the object behind a neighbor’s home and quickly ran to the backyard to resume filming. I was unable to find the object from that point on. Shortly after the object had disappeared a number of dogs in the neighborhood began howling and barking. This was all captured on video but the triangular formation of lights (or any stars for that matter) could not be resolved on film. I am willing to send you the footage in the hopes that you can somehow enhance what is there. Leduc is southeast of the Edmonton International Airport and I can tell you with the authority of living near the strip for over 10 years that this was NOT A PLANE and if it was it was heading in the wrong direction for a landing. The lights did not blink nor did they form any standard aircraft lighting array that I am aware of. The lights were not bright enough to be considered effective or safe landing lights. The bottom line is that the object in question was far too huge to be compared to anything I've seen in our local skies. It was more like the corner lights were used to camouflage the object into the surrounding star field. I consulted the ""Heavens Above"" satellite tracking system for my area (www.heavens-above.com) to attempt to confirm the satellite theory but there was nothing in the sky at that time that would even remotely account for a tight triangular formation I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting may have been caused by the three NOSS satellites, but we do not know if satellites would be visible above Alberta at that time of the morning.   For positive identification of NOSS, we recommend the following website, to which we were only recently introduced:   http://home.earthlink.net/~sigma04/NOSS_UFO_Identification.html PD))",2002-09-19T00:00:00,53.266799999999996,-113.552

Triangular shaped crafts just south of Montreal,Montreal,QC,2002-09-15T20:00:00,triangle,15-20 mins,"Occurred : 9/15/2002 20:00  (Entered as : 09/15/02 20:00) Reported: 9/15/2002 9:20:13 PM 21:20 Posted: 9/19/2002 Location: Montreal (Canada), PQ Shape: Triangle Duration:15-20 mins",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25083.html,"Triangular shaped crafts just south of Montreal To whom it may concern, The following events occured on Sunday the 15th of September, 2002. We (my husband, myself and our two children) were on our way home from our country place near Huntington, QC to our home in Montreal.  As we were driving down the road just outside of Mercier I saw what appeared to be really bright stars in the distance.  After a few minutes I asked my husband "" Are those airplanes up ahead, or really bright stars?""  Considering that tonight was overcast and no other stars were visible in the sky he resopnded that they were probably helicopters looking for pot fields. After about 5 minutes the two lights ahead in the sky changed posistion.  The one that was higher up, and to the right remained in the same place, but the lower one to the left began to move westward at a fast pace.  Now we were very curious as it was moving far too quickly to be a helicopter.  Our 8 year old son who was in the back seat pointed out another one to the right of our vehicle visible from the passenger side. ( the other one was still immobile in front of us)  While we were stopped at a light ( around 8 pm) the one on the passenger side slowly flew over head.  I unrolled my window and stuck my head out for a better view...what I saw gave me shivers...this was no plane or helicopter.  The object was triangular with lights at all three corners. I have seen thousand of airplane and helicopters at night, and never have I ever seen light formations such as these on an aircraft, nor have I ever seen an aircraft first be stationary in the sky then move quickly such as these.  We saw them for about 10 - 15 minutes, and there were about 5 different craft in the sky at the time...all of this same type though we only saw two of them fly directly overhead.  My husband, son and myself all saw the distinct triangle...and my husband swears he could see the sky through the center of the triangle.  This object appeared to be larger than a 747, and flying quite low for us to see it's shape so clearly.  There was not a star in the sky as it was over cast. After we crossed the Mercier bridge and passed the  Dorval airport we saw many other airplanes ...some flying directly overhead...and I did not see anything that looked like this triangular object. ( Not to our surprize as I had previously mentioned it moved like no other aircraft we had ever seen.)  Our son said it might be  a stealth bomber..which I refute due to the fact that it was much larger than the stealth...much more triangular, had lights and as far as I know Stealths do not remain stationary in the air. Surely someone else has seen these lights...when we were stopped at the lights there were many other cars around, but noone seemed to be gazing at the sky..... Once we got home my husband and myself decided to  do a little investigation on the internet, apparently there have been a few sightings in Quebec along the St. Laurence river ( one even in the exact area we were in ) most involving triangular, or chevron shaped anomalies in the sky. Is the Canadian government testing any aircraft ( at night ) that would fit this description?  Or are they as I fear ( I'm a big chicken) U.F.O's? In the hopes from getting feed back from people who have seen these aircraft, or at the very least know more about U.F.O's than we do, we are posting this account on pertinent web sites, and sending it out to some local enthusiasts.",2002-09-19T00:00:00,45.51408695464828,-73.58579954756006

So the  sound went chuk chuk chuk whishzzzz, it was very mechanical, I thought mabe a helicopter, but the whishzz confirmed negative on the helicopter, so I looked out the second story window to the east from downtown spokane. I first noticed a cat on the front lawn who was uncannily looking up at the sky toward the east, thats when I saw what looked like a planet, solid white light. Then I noticed it moving towards me (westerly) I thought maybe a plane ,until the light made some loops, half moons, figure eight, and right angles, by then I was waking my girlfriend on the couch, saying listen carefully to the freeway, and notice the other noise, she heard it and then I said look at this, and pointed. So I went downstairs to get a better look outside, I sat down for about 20 minutes watching, it then hovered in place (bobbing motion I could slightly detect, I then seen the second obect which was to the southeast of me, or south of the first obective. The both stopped for about 6-10 minutes, leaving me to wonder if I was seeing anything at all but stars and planets. Then the starting moving again, The first one did some pretty impossible moves and angles, and then I saw the additonal lights come on. There where three in all, One at the top and two and the bottom. It then went back to one light, and cycled to 2 lights before returing to one light. It then appeared to move far away and fade and then move close and brighten, this happened numerous times, before stopping and freezing again. Then the second light which was flashing different colors, blue white and green I think, it was flashing very quickly, and making some very acrobat movements which are not possible in our technology, right angles, etc.  It stopped moving at the same time as the first obect, I then seen the ! third ob ect briefly, it was further away, and appeard between the first two, and then faded away and disappeared. I watched for a while longer as the two objects appeard to stand still hovering. I got up and went upstairs, looked out the window and the first object was gone, the colored was moving away rapidly towards the south, then the first object reappeared, disappeared, and the reappeared again. I wached as it disappeared again, this time in blink it reappeared a large distance east of its origINAL position for a blink and then blinked in again to the north of the second postion. Thus going point to point in a triangle disappearing and reappearing like it teleported almost, and then disappeared altogether, the second object was still moving, and then it two just vanished. 2 - 5 minutes after that, I saw a very high speed jet come through the direct path heading west, like it was in pursuit. Then about 7:30 I noticed more jets in the sky, I thought the where moving through, as they went to the East, then I saw some coming back the other way, thats when I noticed nothing but jet trails from horizon to horizon in parrellell and criss cross patterns. There was a lot o them and they preceeded to do this for about 5 - 6 hours.",2002-09-19T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

I have just seen something I have never in my life witnessed.  At about 9:35 I was driving to return a movie and saw a brilliant bright light streaking across the sky in my sight, I had to stop the van and look.  As the object traveled across at an extremely high rate of speed it disappeared.  I couldn't believe it.  It was something unexplainable.  I returned home and contacted Langley Air Force Base who confirmed that they had no testing or aircraft up tonight. (we have cloudy conditions here as the tropical depression approaches) I also contacted the local TV station to see if it was perhaps a meteor of some kind or if perhaps someone else had called in about this incredible sight.  They informed that they had any calls yet but that they would check for the possibility of a meteor or whatever else it might be. I have NEVER seen anything like this, this bright object was traveling at an incredibly high rate of speed and just disappeared in mid air.  I wish to God I had a camcorder or camera with me at the time.  Proof is always better with a photo or picture. I hope you check this out or at least find this as interesting as I do.  ((name deleted)) ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS)) It was more than likely less than a minute. I stopped my van in the street to watch it.  I did see it though.  I am not some nut case who thinks green men are invading. I was driving my vehicle and noticed the object through the windshield on my left hand side (the front left side).  It was very bright and was traveling extremely fast.  It was at this point I stopped the van (there wasn't any traffic in my lane).  As I watched the object soar through the sky, I tried to see if it could be one of Langley's aircraft, but the object disappeared as it was traveling from NE to NW.   There was no trail that I saw behind it, it just disappeared mid air.  I was shocked.  I still can't believe I saw it all.   This did however occur and I immediately called Langley AFB/NASA to ask if there was any type of testing or flights in the air.  They assured me there were none.  I spoke with 2 people there and told them what I had observed.  I also contacted the local news to check on the possibility of a meteor or if perhaps other people had phoned in about the object as well.  They said I was the first so far but they would check it out.  No meteor reporting so far. Anyway, you can choose to believe what you want, but I did see this happen.  I really wish I could have captured the whole thing on film for irrefutable proof, but that just isn't the case. Thank-You again for your time.
