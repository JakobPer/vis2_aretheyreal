Myself and my father, I was 8yrs old he was 38yrs old, the year was 1979. The small hamlet of East Orange, VT.  Was the location that the event was witnessed. The time was approximately between 1am-2am, early on a Saturday, opening day of deer season (rifle). We had departed from our home in Chelmsford, MA, earlier in the evening, around 9pm.   This was more or less an annual event for us.  We would leave after my father returned from his plumbing job on Friday night, this time of year was the opening of hunting season in Vermont and we’d want to be ready to go for opening morning at sunrise the next morning. We arrived in the village of East Orange, VT, sometime around 1am.  Of note we passed the home of a local who was having a loud party often a normal occurrence during the excitement of hunting season.  Our property and trailer are about ¾ of mile outside of the village, but because of the terrain, we can’t see the village from our property (about 1500ft above sea level).  Instead we have a beautiful view of the distant White Mountains in New Hampshire. As was my father’s habit, he decided to make pit-stop at another hunting camp, even before we went to our trailer.  The camp was call Heartbreak and was the haunt of some of his buddies from back home where he grew up in Lowell, MA.  Over the years, I would come to understand that the pull of catching up and throwing a few back with one's buddies has a strong macho pull, especially in times before constant cell and email contact, although these were some of his best and longest held friends he had gone several months since last seeing them.   Heartbreak was only about a ½ mile from our trailer and as we drove up the road to Heartbreak we have always been able to look across the valley (about 300 yards as the crow flies) and see our little red trailer.   As it happened on this night the all that was visible was the barren scar of the “flat spot” that we had recently carved out of the side of the mountain just above (30 feet) where our trailer sits, this flat spot was cut out! in the preparation for us to start to construct our “mountain house” the following spring , it would be a Swiss chalet, but for now it was a large 150 x 75 flat open area, a strange site on such a mountains topography. Upon arrival at Heartbreak, we were surprised to find all was quiet and still at this normally ruckus hunting camp.  Although close in association to those within, my father thought it was respectful to leave the inhabitants in peace and that maybe we, too, should finally head to our trailer and get some sleep as for as too the alarm clock would ring and we’d be amongst the early morning hunters.  As we descended town the same road we had ascended only minutes earlier, our attention was taken buy an unexpected site. Across the valley we now see the lights of our trailer blazing, to me this was a very surprising sight, I had no idea who or why our trailer has come to life.  It is mid-November and the trailer has been dormant since the summer season ended after Labor Day weekend.  As we paused and looked across the valley at the now sparkling lights on an otherwise dark foreboding mountain, I asked my father who is at our trailer.  My father, not the leased alarmed, quickly realized that the unknown occupant could be none other than Uncle Eddie, uncle Eddie had for years been a on again off again regular during hunting season.  He never actually hunted but would go camping, by camping I mean he’d visit camp after camp and  camp, all the while careful not to” bruise the booze” with any food, his only substance would be Pepsi and an assortment of alcohols for the weekend.  I was disappointed at this turn of events, as a young boy I idolized my father and relished our alone time together.  My father was well liked and loved by almost everyone thought out his life and more so than ever in these early days I had to compete more often than not for my father’s time.  Seeing my disappointment at this loved but unwelcomed (at least to me) guest my father consoled me by reminding me we would soon be in the woods hunting, just the two of use and that “Eddie” had always been fun and good humored and only added to the fabric of a good hunting camp. After our brief discussion regarding Uncle Eddie, we proceeded down the road, the distance was only about another 100 yards to the end of the road where it met East Orange Road (Heartbreak was and still is at the end of Notch End Road).  At the end of the Notch End Road we had to simple make a right turn and our road (driveway) would be a switch back on the right, maybe ¼ mile up.  At the time it was simple “our road”, since it has been named in honor of the farm from which much of the surrounding camps had acquired their land from Delmar Hutchinson, the driveway is now Hutchinson Way. My father for some reason paused at the bottom of the road and pondered if he wanted to in fact head to the trailer.  He to my surprise decided to take a left and head back to the village where the local party was in full swing.  I don’t know if he thought that maybe some of his buddies were there?  Or did he just want to drop in.  As Flatlanders (people from the lower part of New England, we were from Mass, some would simple call us Massholes) we were somewhat shunned, maybe a type of modern “carpetbagger” but my father being a down to earth plumber and having over the previous 10years installed a number of “in-door plumbing” was more or less accepted, for whatever the reason it was only a short ride, maybe ¼ mile and to our surprise the ruckus party had all but completely dissipated, the “party house” was dead quiet, no lights, no activity, nothing,  both of us were more than surprised at this turn of events.  It had only been maybe 10 minutes since we passed by this very ! same house with half a dozen pickup trucks and whooping and hollering.   With no options left my father begrudgingly headed for the trailer. Upon our arrival at the trailer, or shall I say “almost” arrival.   The fall rains had taken a tremendous toll on last of our driveway.  The last part of our driveway was a sharp left turn up a rocky hill, maybe only 50 yards, but steep and even in the best of conditions a challenged, never mind that we were in his work van (if I remember it was a Ford E350, not a 100% on that, but surely a van), so which was pretty common we ended up walking the last 30yards to the trailer up the hill. The trailer was some model that was old when I was young, maybe from the 1950’s I can’t be sure, but it was our beloved weekend get-a-way.   My father upon reaching the trailer when to the power box on the back of the trailer and switch the power main on,  tomorrow he’d fire up the water heater and prime the pump, but for tonight we’d go with the electric heat and many blankets as November in Vermont can be cold very cold.   We unlocked and removed the padlock from the trailer door, and swept aside the cobwebs.  The trailer always had a stale smell when we would arrive for the weekend, but soon with the burps and farts of hunting camp we would long wish for that staleness again.   I found my bunk in the rear of the trailer and my father took his familiar position at the head of the trailer on the couch (the bunks did not offer much comfort for a large adult man, my father stood at 6’ and maybe 240-250lbs). Come the early morning the weekend went as expected, we didn’t shoot a deer, in reality in all of our years hunting (lasting until the early 2000’s) we only got one deer , it was always about a father and son spending quality time with each other.    This weekend like many others ended with no spent rounds and we closed up Sunday afternoon as the winter sun slid behind the mountain in early afternoon we headed home, empty handed but fully satisfied with our time together.   The ride home usually about 3hrs saw nothing out of the ordinary.    Arriving home and dangerously close to my bed time I exchanged a loving hug with my mother and held off with an recanting of our weekend till the following day. Arriving home from school about 330pm Monday afternoon I walked into the kitchen to find my mother and father sitting at the kitchen table.  As I stepped into the room my father glanced in my direction stood up and walked into the other room.   My mother instructed me sit down with her at the table.  My mind raced with all the mischief that my nickname Ricky the wreaker earned me, nothing that would rise to this level of interrogation came to mind.        My mother in a calm voice began questioning me in a most impressive Socratic manner.   She wanted me to talk her through the details of our hunting trip, starting when we left Chelmsford and ending when we returned.    As I weaved through the narrative of the weekend I came upon the part of seeing the trailer lights a blaze and the discussion with my father about Uncle Eddie’s unexpected visit….. It was then that it occurred to me that there never was any Uncle Eddie,  that the trailer lights could not have been “ablaze”, t! hat something else was there, something else was present.     She asked me to describe what the trailer look like with these lights on, I said “a passenger train at night,” several windows all lit up.  At this my mother called in my father, she indicated that our stories match exactly even down to our description of the “object” we had seen , then she dropped a bombshell and confirmed a thought that was slowly formulating with in me, she said in a most excited declaration “ You’ve seen a UFO!!”   It turned out that Sunday night as my mother and father discussed the weekend she mentioned that she had visited with Eddie and Aunt Flora, it was when my father hear this that he recalled the pause and discussion with me regarding the visiting Uncle Eddie, who actually never visited and was in Massachusetts the entire weekend.   My mother always the sharp pencil devised the interrogation the next day in large part to assuage her own skepticism. The obvious implication in this account should be obvious, but here are my major conclusion points. 1.	Uncle Eddie never actually came to Vermont, but yet we clearly saw a significant non-natural object on the side of the mountain.  The only man made object was our trailer. 2.	There is no evidence but I surmise that the “flat spot we had cleared for the Chalet construction in the spring of 1980 was the likely landing spot for this UFO.” 3.	We feel there was a time issue, we found it unusual that the “local party” disappeared so quickly, although not itself much, taken in the totality of the evening it is suspicious. 4.	The trailer driveway wasn’t accessible via vehicle, we could only get within 30yards, and the Flat spot was another 75yards up a steep unimproved driveway further up. This eliminates the possibility that we saw a bus or some other man made vehicle.  Ok, well that is pretty much it.  In the decades since I’ve often talked with my father about that night, we needed to remind each other from time to time that what we saw really happened.  A few years back I put an idea to him that maybe when we got to the bottom of Notch End Road, that maybe we turned right after all, that we came upon whatever was there at the trailer, he would just nod and same maybe.   Well that’s it, do with this as you please.",2017-01-12T00:00:00,,

Many nights, I sit out looking at the stars, moon and planets—I’ve been doing this for decades (I am 53).  In the past year I acquired a good pair of binoculars, Zeiss 15x60 that are excellent for observing.  I was curious if I would witness any meteors tonight, so I had the binoculars hanging from my neck, was leaning back, just letting my eyes adjust to the dark.  I had my eyes closed for brief a few moments, maybe a minute to give them a rest—when I opened them I was looking up at about 80 degrees, looking south when I saw what I automatically assumed was a satellite (a common sight at night—I have seen as many as 6-9 in a couple hours.)  This time was different—it was not one, but two—that seemed to be moving in tandem.  The one further west was ahead by a few degrees, but there were certainly two, traveling together.  I raised the binoculars to look for any possible detail that might identify them as just high flying aircraft.  I observed no flashing lights, just somewhat steady, white light, that faded as the hurriedly traveled southwest-toward and past where the moon was in the sky. This was the first time I’ve witnessed two, so I rationalized this may have been two very, very high and fast moving military aircraft (I discounted any idea that these were civilian aircraft)—that would be illogical to assume they were civilian as civilian aircraft are nearly always commercial in nature, and fly to make money. 2nd incident Roughly 30 minutes later I was sitting in the same spot just outside my garage door facing south.  I was looking directly overhead into the dark sky looking for a satellite to pass.  At 1925 hrs (PST) I observed a faint moving light, extremely high in the sky that I identified as a satellite moving directly south.  I brought my binoculars to bear on the object and observed it moving rapidly, the field of stars in the background clearly visible. I did this for maybe 10 seconds and as it passed through a field of stars I noticed what first appeared to be flickering lights/stars just to the east by maybe 1 degree.  I stopped following the satellite as that appeared fairly routine but focused on the flickering lights.  What struck me was these lights were not moving quickly—they in fact appeared stationary in the sky (as compared to surrounding stars)—I have seen countless aircraft at night—they are easy to identify—usually almost always you can see 2-3 lights, 1 green, 1 red on either wingtip—sometimes if low enough you can see steady lights from the fuselage-this group of lights—flickering faintly, appeared to not fit this pattern at all. I kept watching the group of lights for well over a minute—they did move—slightly, and slowly—but there was no uniformity or consistency to it.  I compared it to what you witness when you see artillery or even lighting far in the distance.  No sound, random sudden brightness with no real pattern-purely random.  Like I say, the light “pattern” moved but was very high, much higher than I am used to seeing flying aircraft-and as mentioned aircraft lights flicker or blink as well as appear steady as they move across the sky.  On a clear night you can even see contrails—none of this applied to these ‘lights’.  I even remarked to myself that it appeared to be a moving battle---but in the atmosphere.  Very high up in the atmosphere. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Mr. Davenport—I was reading your announcement on the NUFORC website about looking out for hoaxes etc—just wanted to clarify that mine was not.  My sighting/report was from 4 Nov out of Kingman AZ.  I just didn’t feel like an interview-but it was legit—and actually surprising, as I was just casually observing that night through my binoculars, and was simply surprised at what I saw.

"Saw a cluster of 5-6 lights, fading in and out, slowly moving within proximity to each other but also moving as a pack.",Ithaca,NY,2016-11-05T21:45:00,light,30 minutes,"Occurred : 11/5/2016 21:45  (Entered as : 11/05/16 21:45) Reported: 11/10/2016 11:12:14 AM 11:12 Posted: 11/11/2016 Location: Ithaca, NY Shape: Light Duration:30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/131/S131137.html,"Saw a cluster of 5-6 lights, fading in and out, slowly moving within proximity to each other but also moving as a pack. I am writing this on Thursday, November 10th, regarding a strange occurrence I witness Saturday, November 5th, between roughly 9:45 and 10:15 and again, briefly, on Sunday, November 11th. Last Saturday, my wife and I were getting ready to watch a movie.  As she normally does when we watch a movie, my wife began making popcorn.  I went outside to walk around.  This last summer I purchased a FitBit (pedometer) and I sometimes walk up and down our long driveway to meet my step count goal.  We live just outside the city, on the margins of town, so while we are not completely in the country we usually have a clear view, if it is not too cloudy, of the sky.   On this Saturday night, many of the constellations were out, it was so clear.  Pacing back and forth on my driveway, listening to a podcast on my phone, with my earbuds in, I was struck by a set of, what appeared to be, constellations roughly 30 degrees north east of our location.  This pattern of what I presumed to be stars were among the lowest and closest to Earth of all the stars in the sky. What struck me upon given these “stars” a  second look was that they were fading and reappearing with increments of maybe 3-5 second.  Had it only been one light doing this, I would have quickly assumed it was a satellite, but this appeared different because satellites are never clustered.  There were five, possibly six, of these lights, fading in and out of visibility, out of sync with one another.  There was no specific clear pattern or shape to them, although they were spread out from each other in what looked like a skewed pentagon (like a small child attempting to draw a pentagon).  One of the lights was somewhat more central to the others and the fading in and out appeared a second slower than the others, although it was hard to tell because, again, they were out of sync. Staring at this with some disbelief, I moved into the road for a clearer view.  There was a large tree in the distance which I was using to gage the location and movement of this cluster.  No movement was visible to the eye, but after about ten minutes I could see that this cluster had indeed moved northbound and lower toward the ground.  Using my phone, I called my wife inside the house and asked her to please come outside to look at something. When my wife walked outside the door, I flagged for her to come over toward the road.  I pointed to the cluster saying, “there is a cluster of what looks like stars over there”, while pointing vaguely toward their direction.  I stopped myself, however, realizing this might plant a seed in her mind of what I wanted her to see.  I wanted her view to be as objective as possible.  My wife is much more of a skeptic than myself.  She almost immediately noticed what it was I was talking about.  She, too, found it very curious and unusual.  Assuming there was probably an explanation, quickly getting cold (the temperature was in the lower-to-mid 30s), and hungry for popcorn, my wife, after a couple of minutes, went inside.  I stayed a few minutes longer, so that I could store in my memory what I was seeing. After watching the movie, which I had trouble focusing on at first, I popped back outside to see if I’d notice anything else unusual.  By this point, the sky had become so foggy that no stars or anything else were visible. I would have written this experience closer to the date it occurred, but having a 2-year-old, being a teacher, and on the cusp of an election, I had not found time to sit and write this until now. It is worth noting that the next night I did go out to observe.  I noticed one light, slightly stronger than any I’d seen the previous night similarly fading in and out.  On this night, unlike the night before, I was intoxicated and became anxious and panicked pretty quickly, so I only looked long enough (30-60 seconds) to confirm with myself what I was seeing, but otherwise went back inside rather abruptly.   I have always had a long interest in UFOs and stories of encounters, so I am very familiar with phenomenon stories, though, prior to this, had none of my own.  Knowing that I am prone to believe such events, it was important to me to get confirmation from my wife that the pattern I observed was both real and unusual.  She agreed.  Even this morning, when I told my wife I would document my experience, she again confirmed for me that this pattern was uncanny.  Additionally, several dogs in the neighborhood were barking or howling.  Also worth noting is that the pattern I witness was placed, more or less, over the vicinity of our local airport.",2016-11-11T00:00:00,42.41041894736843,-76.51318263157894

We’d watched TV, talked about video games, the usual for our age group.  A normal Sunday night.  I was the last one to leave.  I didn’t expect to see something in the sky, but then again, I don’t think anyone does. It was one of those rare cloudless nights where LA’s famous light pollution doesn’t ruin a decent view of the stars over the suburbs.  I’m originally from a very small town, so I don’t take celestial beauty for granted.  I looked up at the sky to admire the stars, and that’s when I saw it. My first thought was “airplane,” but this was immediately replaced by “drone?” because it was too fast for a commercial flight, and completely silent.  And then I thought that it couldn’t have been a drone, because again, it was completely silent, and the most common drones are quadcopters.  This thing was in the shape of a chevron, and dark gray.  It was a little larger than the moon, which was slightly farther away.   Another thing that perplexed me besides the speed were the lights.  Three of them, one on each wing end and one under the middle corner, unblinking, and a dim gray.  I’ve never seen gray lights in my life. The chevron was headed southeast, when suddenly, without slowing down, it made a sharp, tight U-turn, pivoted, and disappeared before my eyes.  I didn’t blink, I didn’t look away for a second, and there were no clouds for it to hide behind.  It was there, and then it was gone. I don't think we have the technology to make planes turn the way this thing did. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the young woman who submitted the report, as well as two high-quality illustrations.

From my viewpoint, I saw four lights in a square formation, to the left and just below the North Star.  They were only as bright as evening stars and constant, not blinking or flickering.  I watched them as they move in formation from the right side of the North Star to the left side.  They stayed in a square, for the most part, moving simultaneously closer to each other then away from each other making the square smaller then again larger.  While doing this, they did change places, moving from corner to corner in a clockwise direction. The west to east movement of the formation ended when at the lower right hand corner light moved out further away from being square, the only time the formation was not square.  Then all four of the lights disappeared at the same time. I did not time how long it was, but estimate it was about one to two minutes in duration.

My cousin and I went fishing at a local pond in Jefferson Hills, PA. The Iron Bridge Ponds was the spot, tucked in a valley along Peters Creek Rd. near PA 43. 	We arrived at the spot and my cousin Mike pointed out what he claimed to be “imposter stars” in the sky.  They were in the area near Orion’s Belt.  They flashed in many different colors, mostly greens at this particular sighting.  We walked back to the ponds, which sit in between the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad line and the steep embankment carrying PA 43.  Once we arrived near the water I noticed a white light atop the hill above said embankment, on the opposite side of the highway.   At first glance it looked like a street light, but upon further examination I realized that it was not behind the trees, but rather within them. It was a bright white, similar to the color of a 6000K LED. As it hovered in the trees he pointed out a second light that appeared suddenly in the canopy of a small patch of woods  along the opposite shore of the pond, roughly 100 yards away from us. Also white, this light was very dim in comparison to the one atop the hill, which had now moved down to t! he crest of the highway embankment. The embankment is probably 100 feet high and treeless. The light appeared to be an orb or orb-like, much smaller than any aircraft I’ve encountered. This was also the case with the second, dimly lit light.Atop the embankment, the first orb hovered silently for about 5 minutes before vanishing. Almost instantly it appeared in a different location about 200 yards north and roughly 150 feet in the sky over the highway.  Shortly after, the dimly lit one in the woods below vanished, as if it just fizzled out or faded away.  Eventually the original light made its way higher and eventually left the area after it reached a fairly high level off the ground. As the twilight approached we stood along the shore opposite of where we were when we witnessed the phenomena, but in the same general location.  Heavy fogs would roll in and dissipate in very short periods and the cirrus clouds above were illuminated by the sun in a unique shade of pink.  Shortly thereafter, just before the sun was about to peek over the horizon, another larger light, similar in color to a traditional incandescent light rose out of the valley about ½ a mile in front of us and advanced toward us over the treeline along the railroad tracks, which were about 75-100 yards away.  It flew straight toward us silently, still ascending slowly. It flew over the pond and made a quick southward turn in front of us, probably only 200-300 feet above the water.  As it turned, the sound of what I can only explain as a very quiet jet turbine, so quiet that most people wouldn’t even notice on a normal day It continued south, before ascending into the wispy layer of cirrus clouds! , then disappeared  into the distance.

It was small and if not for the direction it was going you couldn't tell which was the front.  The ends each had a light, front/green, two back/yellow, top w/ antenna/flashing red.

The noise was not a regular sounding engine. It was more smooth and was like a loud humming. We could hear it for about 5 sec. before it was visible.  It moved rather slowly.

The video I am sending is the third lap this thing took that we watched from start to finish.  Please disregard the audio and I apologize for the poor, poor quality of the video.

1 dozen light orbs seen over 20 minutes travelling through sky,Santa Cruz,CA,2016-12-03T16:00:00,light,21 minutes,"Occurred : 12/3/2016 16:00  (Entered as : 12/03/16 16:00) Reported: 12/3/2016 11:19:15 PM 23:19 Posted: 12/5/2016 Location: Santa Cruz, CA Shape: Light Duration:21 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/131/S131607.html,"1 dozen light orbs seen over 20 minutes travelling through sky Santa Cruz, California, USA 95060  Approximately 4:00pm (16:00) Dec 3, 2016.  The Place and Time, Weather, Orb Count and Equipment  I was standing in my back yard on the Westside of Santa Cruz, California, December 3rd, 2016.  This approximately places me at the Santa Cruz Lighthouse on the cliffs overlooking the Monterey Bay.  It was approximately 4:00pm (having checked my watch a few minutes later at 4:05pm). The sky was mostly clear, and sunset was about an hour away; though the sun, close to the horizon in the west, was hidden behind hazy cloud cover, which I believe I have now identified as wispy Cirrus or Cirrostratus clouds.  These clouds covered about half the sky in the west, breaking up overhead. A couple of wispy Cirrus (I believe) clouds lay 40 degrees over the horizon, East by North East, opposite the low sun, and it was from one of these I saw three bright orbs, seemingly lights, appear, heading South, to the right.  They traversed the distance from my first sight of them to out of sight behind various trees at about East by Southeast, so I had a view of them in the sky for about 45 degrees of the horizon.  They traversed this distance in about 15 seconds. At this time, I called for my girlfriend to get my glasses from inside, my astigmatism causing the first sighting to look distorted and fuzzy.  Bringing them out immediately, she also left and returned briefly with a pair of binoculars (Sans & Streiffe #889 Viking, 8x30mm, field 10& #730;).  We waited for a bit, and then at approximately 4:06pm we saw another single light orb leave the same cloud, heading in the same southerly direction of the others.  This too passed out of sight in about 15 seconds. The next 25 minutes were spent in their entirety by myself scanning the sky for more orbs/lights, and my girlfriend coming outside intermittently and surprisingly being present for most of the orbs.  At no time during this period did I think to take more than one image with my phone, as its picture quality is notoriously awful.  The one I took at approximately 4:04pm was not of orbs, but of the first of two clouds that the orbs apparently came from.  This was for reference, in hopes of understanding how high up they were by the cloud type.  As I mentioned before, I thought these were Cirrus, but they may be medium level clouds. They lacked any of the “fluffy” features found in low level clouds though.  The clouds were clearly either obscuring the orbs as the orbs flew behind them, or in fact were the source of the orbs.  I should say, every time we saw any orbs during this event, they either appeared from behind/within the clouds, or as I'll mention later, materialized next to exi! sting orbs. Every couple of minutes from 4:06pm until approximately 4:15pm, a single orb, or two orbs would appear from within/behind one of the two clouds (whichever was approximately in the position of the first sighting) traveling South, to our right, for about 15 seconds until passing out of sight from our narrow, 45&#730; field of view.  At the end of this period we waited another 5 minutes until it was about 4:20pm without any further sightings in that area of the sky.  My girlfriend headed inside again and I stayed to watch the whole sky now. At approximately 4:21pm, looking directly above me, at the zenith of the sky, I saw the brightest of the orbs, a single orb, also heading South, materialize from within a high cloud bank: these clouds I have researched and I suggest they are Cirrostratus.  Because of the place in the sky it arrived, this orb remained in my view for longer than 20 seconds, being lost to sight behind trees to the south.  From 4:00pm to 4:21pm, both my girlfriend and I guessed that we had seen about 1 dozen orbs, with two groups of three, two groups of two, and the rest single orbs. The Orbs, Their Properties, and the Binoculars   With my glasses on and the Binoculars well adjusted, I watched the orbs singly or in their small flights of two and three. The first group of three, though I didn't have my glasses or the binoculars then, flew in a loose pattern, one ahead of the others by twice the distance from the second and third.  The two that trailed followed at perfect distance, but approximately half way through their short 15 seconds in my field of view, one of the rear objects overflew the other, switching positions.  This appeared to be an smooth, non-linear acceleration and deceleration.  As this was the first sighting, and I didn't have on my glasses to be sure, I thought perhaps they were stunt planes far up, and one was performing a maneuver.  The rapid change of location in the formation however made me second guess my assumption. I'll state here, I have never before seen a UFO; that is, a saucer, ship, craft or other phenomenon which I took to be extraterrestrial or black-ops in origin.  I am, however, keenly interested in the subject of UFO phenomena, and I have researched how these assumed extra terrestrial and/or government vehicles and phenomena behave and move.  What I saw in the first sighting from one of the three orbs immediately alerted me to very improbable behavior for a conventional aircraft. With my glasses on and the binoculars in hand, the third or fourth sighting of orbs, a pair, were clearly visible.  At first, only a single orb flew Southward from the second of the two drifting clouds, but at near half its distance in my field of view, another object appeared next to it; without a snap, more of a quick “fade in”.  It was flying in unison with the first orb, but unlike the first orb, or any of the other orbs seen in this report, it was not totally a ball of light, but had physical definition.  At a distance it looked less bright, and seemed to have a physical form. My perception (through the binoculars) was that it was a dark, hard, physical object, but with a glowing orb obscuring its center.  From my vantage point, given the angle from which I was viewing it, it looked like a glowing orb with two rounded “wings” or structures coming from either side of it, (as the physical parts were extending from the light orb perpendicular to the object's flight path, and seemingly level with the ground plane). On second consideration, I think I was seeing either an oval shaped craft flying parallel to its short axis, or more likely, a disc at an oblique angle.  Either way, it had a bright light in the center which obscured all but the outer thirds of it.  This was all in very small detail on the less-than-powerful binoculars, but allowed for at least some observation. Like the first observation at approximately 4:00pm, this darker, “physical” object changed attitudes from behind to in-front-of the other orb in the flight, though the latter never cha! nged speed or direction. The rest of the dozen orbs before 4:21pm were regular in their appearance every couple of minutes; appearing in the same part of the sky to the East by North East, stable in their aspect of bright orb without physical form, straight travel paths, 15 seconds in view in a 45&#730; field of view of the sky, at presumedly high altitudes. At 4:21pm, the last of the orbs that I saw in this report was the orb that passed directly overhead. It, unlike the others, seemed to strobe in light intensity over a cycle of a few seconds. Perhaps growing bright then dim in 3 or 4 seconds. I was careful to consider whether I thought it was the orb passing within cloud layers, a light (totally unlike an aircraft's multiple lights and colors), or the glow of the haze-covered sun reflecting off of a tumbling object. I felt that an oscillating light was the best impression. Other Observations in the Area, and Thoughts on Speed  During this half hour that I stood in my back yard and made the sighting observations, I also decided to note as much as I could about the normal everyday sky and its more mundane occupants. Many air corridors exist over Santa Cruz, and I spotted jetliners and cargo jets flying several times. I used one jet as the object to focus my binoculars on, at around 4:10pm, and another that was invisible to the naked eye, but which left a long set of contrails that indicated it was there. My observations were:  if the orbs were flying at the altitude of the highest of the jets, they were traveling in excess of the speed of sound, perhaps more. Whatever the speed of the highest jets leaving contrails, the orbs were many times faster than that. The lowest flight corridor of jets, flying north to San Jose airport, made the distance in the orbs' field of view in about the same amount of time as the orbs. If the orbs were at this altitude, (pretty low as jets fly considering it's an approach run to an airport, though 30 miles out), then they would be going at least several hundred miles per hour, but would have been vehicles without visible wings, no more than 10 feet across, and glowing white. Stars, no. Birds, I considered. Could the sun, however diffused from the hazy western clouds, have lit up the white bodies of Southerly migrating birds? I've seen many a bird here, and at the distance at which a bird's wings or head would be blurred out by its glowing body, I imagine these birds would have been traveling in speeds in excess of a hundred miles per hour, while interacting with clouds that seem to be  high altitude sorts, and in two cases performing abrupt acceleration and deceleration. Satellites, for some of the same reason as birds, seems unlikely to me. Balloons, while arguably traveling in the direction of the wind, would be hard pressed to have one of their number twice in the sighting change position rapidly and then regain its original speed. And certainly the orb I saw above me was an actual light of some sort, and given its integration with the cloud layer, would have constituted a balloon drifting at many hundreds of miles an hour. Final Thoughts   It is my opinion, from what I know of conventional aircraft and my hometown's air corridors, and the size and speed of jets flying at various altitudes, that these orbs were not conventional craft. I do not think they were birds, and they weren't satellites to the best of my understanding of how satellites work.  One had a physical form, though obscured with a bright light in the center.  Another strobed in what looked to be an artificial manner.  They all flew in a solid, smooth path, save the two that performed rapid formation changes.  All but one seemed to appear out of the same stretch of sky, without having first traversed the path of sky to get to that point.  They all moved in the same direction, along the same corridor (save for the one I saw directly above me), and they appeared at regular intervals.  I have seen images and video in the past that approximated what I saw today, and I'm placing this report here to help others make some sense of what they too might have seen.",2016-12-05T00:00:00,37.011256646216765,-122.04450858895706

It reminded me of the shape of a crown.  I could see the bottom and sides of it. It was moving slightly faster than the planes that come from the north towards Williams airport.  It had only once color of lights.  It had two horizontal rows of bright green lights around it, and around the craft, there were some vertical bright green lights in sections. The top and bottoms of the vertical lights seemed to extend from the craft.  As it moved, I saw a sudden flash of the lights getting brighter, then back to the original green.  It continued moving, and when in mid sky, in reference to my vantage point, the lights flashed brighter a second time.  After they flashed, I saw only sky and stars in its place. There was no sign of the aircraft. Also, there was a rough, low sound during the time I sa! w the air craft, but myself and the other person who wasn’t looking at the craft thought it was a car or some machine in the neighborhood, although an odd sound.  When the aircraft disappeared, the sound stopped. I've seen strange lights over years, rarely, but this was an actual aircraft unlike any that I've ever seen.

As I turned the corner at the light, there is a group or a very large palm tree right at the corner on my left as I start up the street.  To the right of the palm tree, I observed something in the sky that I had never seen before.  There was a white rectangular object hanging in the sky. It looked like a flat screen TV.  I slowed down and rolled down my window to see if there was any sound and there wasn’t.  I was expecting it would move but it didn’t. I thought it might be an ad on a blimp and I would see writing but I didn’t.  I looked back several times over my left shoulder, and could tell it wasn’t attached to anything, nor did it produce any advertisements.  There were no lights attached. I was curious that it had a mist behind it, as well as a clumpy looking cloud on the left hand side.  I can’t remember if it was upper or lower but was on the left hand side.  I was so focused on the object that I don’t recall any other vehicles around the area.  I was concerned about causing an accident, so, I started driving faster and paying attention to the road. Further up the road, before reaching my left turn I thought I would take one last look over my left shoulder and see if I could see it. I was startled to see a black one directly to my left.  Same exact shape, mist behind it, as well as the exact same clump of cloud appearance, only this cloud was darker.  The mist and clouds did not look a real cloud produced by nature.  I slowed down almost to a stop and stared. It didn’t move.  Once again I felt I was a hazard so drove to my left turn to get home.  I thought I would never see it again, but, took one last look back. my sight was obstructed by tall trees and houses so, I couldn’t see it if it was still there. I thought, I will just focus on getting home safely. I proceeded to my last left turn to get home and as I looked to the right to see if there were any cars coming I saw a grey one. It was moving fast an! d was already quite a distance away. It was headed northeast. ! Instead of turning on my street, I followed the road to the right and was going to stop and get a picture. By the time I stopped it was moving so fast I couldn’t get my cell phone out to take a picture. I couldn’t see any dimension to the objects other than they were rectangular, and they were not shiny. They were more of a matte.  When I first saw the white object, I voice texted my sister and told her, “I am looking at the closest thing to a UFO I have ever seen.”  Neither of us had ever heard of any rectangular UFO sightings before my event.

After clearing the warning buoys in the bay we proceeded out and head due west at full speed. We were heading for the 2 large islands on the west end of the lake. The trip would take apx 35-40 minutes. The sun had not come up yet but as it did begin to rise we took a few pics (Iphone 5S) (while moving). I was driving the boat, but at a slow speed. I turned around to snap a few pics of the sun which was in full beautiful view, and ended up with an excellent picture of the sunrise. at this point we were well out on the lake with only the water around us and the sky above. A week later as I was reviewing my pictures and posting them to facebook, I noticed that I had captured something in the picture that we were not aware of during the fishing trip. The object is on the far left middle of the pic, and appears higher than us and above the water. The picture does not show the entire craft, only a portion of it...but you can see structure to it, and It has  definite angles to the design, and you can see the rising sun shining on it / illuminating it. We heard nothing that morning except the wind, waves and the roar of the boats motor. We saw nothing other than the sunrise... I have zoomed in on the object and it is not a ""normal"" saucer shaped UFO, but it does have well defined surfaces that reflect light. The ufo appears to be following or passing us on the starboard side of the boat and behind us apx 100 yards?. There were 3 others in the boat with me, and subsequently i requested copies of their pics. In 1 of those other pictures taken apx 3 mins prior to my photo i found a picture of the sunrise that also includes the skies and the clouds behind us. Upon zooming in there appears to be an octagon shaped object in the clouds. I ""theorize"" it traveled from the clouds to a position behind us in a matter of 3 minutes.

Two UFO / UAP Sightings North Of Toronto, Canada — Sunday, Aug 28, 2016. Did anyone else have a sighting in Toronto, Sunday night between 10-10:30PM? Approximately 10PM EST, Sunday August 28, 2016 over Newmarket, north of Toronto, Canada, two of us were sitting in the backyard facing East (see the photo below where the sun is rising the next morning with StarTracker Lite App superimposed to show the sky from Sunday night).  Traveling from North to South (left to right in the picture above) across the eastern sky at a speed that was like a shooting star was a craft that was oval in appearance, seemingly wide like a plane, at a height approximating what a commercial jet would be flying overhead.  From our sitting position on the backyard deck, it passed slightly above the trees as it sped South for a count of “1 and 2 and...” then continued with its view obstructed by the trees in a slightly wider field of view than the photo above. Initially we asked ourselves if this could be a meteorite but having already seen two a little earlier, it was clearly uncharacteristic of a meteorite. It was oval as if it might have wings but they were not perceptible wings. It was more like an energy pulse extending to each side like wings. It appeared as a quickly pulsating, oscillation with long, oval arch to each side. The rapid pulsing to each side of its center was extremely fast.  Imagine for a moment, as if the pattern of a tiger’s stripes was energetically oscillating at an extremely fast rate. That is how it appeared to me, though to Alison sitting beside me, it was more like a subdued yet oval light swishing across the sky in a dark halo surrounding it. Unlike the meteorite that arched down from the sky towards the horizon like the two meteorites that we witnessed earlier, this UAP flew straight across the sky at a speed that is comparable to a meteorite. The energy was electric. The sky was the clearest we have seen all summer.  Approximately 30-minutes later, at 10:32pm, we saw exactly the same phenomenon in the same exact line of vision, but this time traveling from South to North. Notably, it was moving approximately at half the speed of the original sighting for a count of “1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and...” then the trees obstructed our view. At that speed, it was speeding much faster than a jet fighter would across the sky. There was no sound at all. Again, there was an electric, energetic feel to the energy filling the air, possibly our own excitement from what we saw. ((deleted))",2016-09-09T00:00:00,44.056298091603054,-79.47185496183207

All light shadows are from house. Using the camera exposure recorded ( see settings below) the 'Beam' would have saturated the entire photograph, or would have automatically adjusted the exposure settings.

The four were in a diamond formation. 11 hours missing time. Christmas Eve 12:19 AM. 2016. Getting ready for bed. I'm home alone because I don't travel well. I remember the time, because I was hearing the words ""Help. Please Help. Need assistance"". Over and over again. As I have studied the phenomenon for decades now, I knew there were things I needed to do. I jotted down the time (To see if I could find a normal explanation later). I responded in my head, ""I am coming to give whatever help I can"". STRANGENESS And from 1 moment to the next.  I was PHYSICALLY IN MY YARD.  But I am a disabled man.  I can stand, I just can't move very quickly.  It was bitterly cold that night, yet I was perfectly warm. THE OBJECTS I found myself looking up at four ""objects"" in a formation that was very ""Clock-like"", except that there were diamond shaped craft where the numbers usually are.  The craft that was virtually screaming for assistance was at the 9 o clock position.  This craft seemed to be having difficulty maintaining altitude, as it would change color from the brilliant blue that lit up my entire backyard, to almost a blood red type of color.  Every time it shifted color, it dropped straight down out of formation.  It got lower and lower. I was fully awake and alarmed at this time as I was full aware of what might be happening right in front of me!  Every time it dropped, the other 3 craft would brighten in intensity and the ""distressed"" craft would begin to rise again.  I projected nothing but positive thoughts and hopes as I would do at an airshow when it would look like a craft was in danger.  I was rooting for it's safety as I would ANY other living beings. At that point, a FIFTH ship appeared out of nowhere right next to the craft that was in distress.  I felt waves of gratitude from every ship and it was over. STRANGENESS When I realized I was getting cold, I also realized something else. It was approximately 11 hours later and the Sun was out. (You'll read I have adopted the ""Strangeness"" nomenclature. So far, the Military Industrial Complex has not been able to do many things our ""friends"" can.  Tracking for these things help me form my own opinion). It had now gone from 12:19 Am to 10:40AM with the daylight shining.  I had lost 11 hours I have no recollection of. STRANGENESS  Every TV in the house was on! EVEN THE TV's that had no electricity.  The TV sets that actually had remote controls would turn off as normal when I pressed the power button.  It took me a few minutes due to being rattled, but I finally figured out if I plugged the set into any outlet, and then unplugged it again, the set would remain off. Notes At NO TIME did I have any fear for my safety. I could not make much detail out other than color and general shape. I thought they might be Sikorski's latest sports model so I want to know ON if I saw one again. During the 11 missing hours.  No question about it.  I would have died from exposure.  Like I said, I made the decision to help at the same time I grabbed my robe.  That remained the only clothes I had on. What I am hoping to do is to give other witnesses of this event, or ones like it, to come foreword. I wish to assure you that what you think you saw happen, really happened (That's what's emotionally bothering me the most right now).  The solitude is crushing at times, not being able to speak to anyone that also experienced what I had. I am a dabbler in Greer's CE5 Protocols.

On the morning of October 2, 2016, at just before 1:30 AM, I wandered over to the open shipping door at my workplace to grab a bit of fresh air.   I was looking outside when an orange light caught my attention.  The light was to the southeast of where I was standing.  I assumed it was an aircraft coming in to land at the airport—this is something that I see at night all the time as my workplace is just to the east of the airport.  The light was about the same size and color as the incandescent street lamps that were across the street, maybe 100 feet away. 	As the light approached I became very curious.  When normal aircraft do their approaches you often start out seeing just the bright white 'headlight' but you eventually see the red and green lights on the wings and tail.  This object did not display any other lights.  The light continued heading directly towards me, flying on a northwest course.  As it was going to pass directly over the building I went outside into the parking lot so I could continue observing it. 	The light passed directly over me at what I assumed was the normal altitude for landing aircraft.  I did not see any other lights—just the orange light.  I did not see the shape of an aircraft which is very strange to me as at that altitude I would have seen at least the outline of a conventional aircraft, even at night.  There was no sound.  The light did not change shape or luminosity.  It moved at roughly the same speed as a normal aircraft.  There was a light breeze at the time but I don't recall the direction. 	As the light passed overhead I saw what looked to me like a 'shock-wave' in front of the light.  This was the only time I saw anything other than the light itself.  The light continued on its northwest course, moving past the roof-line of the building.  I backed up in the parking lot to try to regain sight of it but failed to do so.  The total time spent observing the light was 1-2 minutes. 	I do not know what to think of this light.  I have worked nights at this location for over 5 years and have never seen anything like this.  I see normal aircraft in the sky at night all the time, several times a night.  This thing did not look like a normal aircraft.  I suppose it could have been a meteor but I feel it was moving too slowly for that.  I feel it was moving too precisely to be a balloon, flare or firework, and the light was too consistent and bright for that, unless I drastically overestimated its altitude.  I have a feeling that this is just a conventional phenomenon but it was weird enough to me and something I've certainly never seen before so I felt I should report it.",2016-10-11T00:00:00,49.891260040733194,-97.15285022403258

About ten seconds later a black jet/plane flew across the same area, moving in from the right. Initially I thought the light I saw was coming from the jet/plane.  Then logic kicked in and I knew from seeing thousands of planes and jets flying in the sky my entire life that during the day, even if it’s cloudy, a plane or jet doesn’t need a bright light to be seen in the sky.  The plane that I saw after the light disappeared had very low lighting, if any.  Besides, the plane moved in seconds AFTER I saw the orange light.

I saw lights below us in the distance toward monroe area and said ""oh look, fireworks"", as the lights were many and obscured by tree branches in the foreground.  Then the lights continued coming up the valley toward stevens pass, out in the open sky. at first i thought maybe a cluster of helicopters with huge lights flying in formation, however there was no sound.  as the moving lights continued getting closer and were more at what seemed the elevation where we were, they appeared as two parallel rows with the upper row protruding ahead of  the lower row of lights, and the front of each row appearing a little brighter.   (These images were captured in the Puget sound area on camera and reported on local TV news channels, which was all over the news when we returned home)  From the puget sound area, the lights appeared yellowish orange.  From our view point in the moun! tains, above the pollution, the lights were clear white.   We kept our eyes on the lights, questioning what we were witnessing, having nothing in our memory to compare it with. as it got closer, it appeared as though each row of lights were actually on two circular planes, with each light source identical to the other.  each light source may have been in size between 1-3 football fields, projecting the light forward a distance, where it then reflected back from whatever it was shinning against, and beyond the origin of the light source. there were hundreds of lights, all the same.  the craft spanned beyond the mountain tops on both sides of the valley through which highway 2 runs, leading us to believe it could have been 2-3 miles in diameter.  It blocked out the starry sky, but the moon did not reflect on any surface of the craft. No out line or shape was obvious to detect. Only the lights in a circular formation, on two planes. When it was directly overhead, it rotated an! d continued its travel toward the east as it disappeared behin! d us ove r and beyond the mountains.  There were 5 in our group that saw this, along with other attendees at the hot springs.  We were able to stop them from yelling ""beam me Up Scotty"" and ""Aliens, Aliens"" only for 2-3 seconds, since we were trying to determine if there was any noise.  We could not detect any sound, nor was there any displacement of air after it passed.  If anyone else were to tell me of this i may have difficulty believing them.

Summer 1997.  I went camping off of Old Kane Springs Road, Borrego Springs, California, just south of Highway 78, and north of El Centro in the Anza Borrego Desert BLM lands.  Arriving just before sundown to meet up with a friend who had arrived earlier in the day. My friend carried on and on about unmarked gun metal blue jets flying very low passes at very high speed over the area since early afternoon.  I did notice jets flying upon arrival but it wasn’t surprising since I knew the Navy’s proving grounds (mysteriously called Superstition Hills) was just a mile or so southeast of our campsite.  You could see the chalky white hills slightly poking up from the desert floor with commercial air traffic from El Centro Airport in the background. After setting up my tent and popping a beer we enjoyed talking and watching the full moon rise from the southwest as El Centro’s plane traffic was visible to the southeast.  Within 15 minutes of sundown, out of the blue, two gun metal blue F18s whizzed over us at extremely high speed and extremely low--lower than I’ve ever seen.  And they came around again, criss-crossing each other in the skies at least three more times.  My friend went bonkers, proclaiming he wasn’t a liar and I couldn’t argue with him.  This was amazing and I ran to get my binoculars. With binoculars readily in hand I chased them around the sky as my friend frantically searched for his pair.  At one point, the two jets lined up together side-by-side very low bearing southwest towards the direction of Table Mountain easily zooming directly overhead at over 400 mph.  On approach, they split up and disappeared over the first set foothills.  My friend was still searching for his specs as I watched, totally stunned, as a large glowing presence rising from them where the planes disappeared.  I had no idea what I was witnessing as the entire side of Table Mountain lit up and then I freaked – small red orbs started to manifest below the whitish glow. As the glow grew brighter these red orbs crested the mountain in formation of a huge clock.  The lights continued to rise together in a fixed circular formation until an entire ‘clock’ formation was visible. In the middle of the clock of red lights, a nebulous blob glowed brightly when all of a sudden, two smaller red lights at 4 and 7 split away and flew off in opposite directions at enormous speed, disappearing over and around Table Mountain.  I surmised they were the jets I had just seen, but it was hard to tell.  The shimmering red orb clock formation then rose up over the crest entirely in view and disappeared over another ridge and the lights dimmed into darkness.  The hillsides went back to normal moon lit desert and I was screaming aloud that this was the wildest thing I have ever witnessed.  But then it got wilder. The strange giant ‘clock lights’ had appeared and then disappeared into the mountain landscape in less than a minute – all occurring as my friend finally found his binoculars in a futile attempt to zero on the subject of my pointers.  All he could make out was the glowing mountains, but I excitedly recounted in detail what I had just seen.  We relayed the experience to one another for perhaps 10 or 15 minutes as we scoured the sky and landscape with our binoculars.  We got tired of looking with the binoculars and grabbed another beer to begin settling into camping, when very casually my friend suddenly pointed about in 70 degree ups towards the southerly sky and said, “what the *** is that?”  I looked to where he was pointing but I couldn’t see anything.  I was looking past it!  The moon was full and bright and not a cloud in the sky, a billion stars, and right there about 1000 feet off the ground was an “invisible” moving object.  It was very nebulous with no hard visible edges.  Within or perhaps attached to it were a random arrangement of lights in varying brightness – virtually indistinguishable from stars in the sky.  It was insane we could not make out the actual shape.  This nebulous blob of sparkly lights appeared to about 2000 feet off the ground and about 2000 feet away – perhaps the size of a smallish blimp.  It was also totally silent.  We grabbed our binoculars, if you looked directly at it, it essentially disappeared into the background.  You could really only see it if you looked to the side or below or above it, reminding me of how we were told to view Andromeda by looking to the side of it, allowing our peripheral vision to ascertain the galaxy.  This was! clearly some form of cloaking technology, but the shape of the cloaked craft was indiscernible. Moving extremely slowly from the northwest to the southeast, at various points it would just stop in the air, hovering silent, and discharge what appeared to be a bunch of flashbulbs going off in random order as if it was trying to blend into the sea of stars behind a full moon night sky.  We continued watching this “cloaked” air machine for at least 15 minutes. It moved ever so slowly stopping at least three more times to “impersonate the night sky” light show as it moved over Superstition Hills and stopped again.  We noticed at this point there were no more jets; in fact, El Centro’s plane traffic had completely stopped with only this smallish nebulous sparkly cloud in the southeastern sky.  We wondered aloud if the Navy had told the airport to hold off takeoffs and landings. We were actually getting bored of watching it through our binoculars when all of a sudden it took off like a streak of light towards the southeast edge of El Centro.  It had to have moved at several hundred miles an hour – or faster - from a dead stop and then made a dead stop right at the edge of Highway 78 about a mile southeast of us.  All this time is moved so slow, it was stunning how it suddenly moved and stopped so fast. While we stood there trying to process what this hovering nebulous sparkly blob thing was, it made another light show and suddenly in a blink of an eye it streaked away disappearing into the horizon towards the Yuma proving grounds.  We couldn’t make any sense of it but I’ll never forget it.  A minute or two later the El Centro air traffic started up again. I was a skeptic of UFO stories until this happened.  Was this aliens?

Each time the electicity went out. Incident lasted under 5 mins. On December 6, 2016, at approx 10pm or 11pm 4 Separate households housing 5 witnesses and 2 witnesses sitting outside in a motor vehicle saw the ENTIRE night sky change into a neon blue flash 3 times in a row.  I would compare the flash to lightening, very bright, very blue, very vast and without a strike or thunder.  Three residence are each a several miles in proximity to each other, and certainly not walking distance.  They are too far from each each other for this to have been a simple transformer malfunction and it is no exaggeration that the ENTIRE sky lit up neon blue.  The two people in the car were sitting outside of one of the residence.  This happened as follows: -The entire night sky became a brief Neon flash  accompanied by a vibration (felt by one household) a loud humming (heard by another household)and immediately following the flash the electricity went out. This was experienced by each witness that was at home. After about 15-20 seconds the elect! ric returned. 20 seconds after that the sky flashed neon blue again and the exact things were heard and felt and the electric again went out in the entire area, for approx 15 seconds and then came back on. The third time it happened, which was about 10 seconds later, the lights were off for even lesser of a time, maybe 5 seconds. Each time it seemed as though the flashes and the length of time between flashes and time the electric stayed off and took to come back on got shorter. I myself expected there to be a write up about it in the newspaper the next day.  NOTHING. Nothing on the news.  One observers house rests way up upon a hill overlooking the entire city.  It has giant glass windows in the 'great room'. He said he was fortunate enough to see it happen and view all of the lights in the city area that he is able to see, which is quite large, go out each time the sky flashed.  He also stated that he saw no object in the sky and that the blue light WAS the entire sky and tha! t the blue flash did not appear to have an epicenter.  The following day, December 7, 2016, I contacted New York State Electric and Gas and they told me they had no record of ANY power outages in the area what so ever for the date of December 6, 2016, in Binghamton, NY. (Description of background of observers: #1 whom also heard the loud hum, is a college educated 54 year old female Medical Record Tech. Mother of 2, Grandmother of 7. Has large bedroom window overlooking a small field and then the river. She leaves curtains open due to nice view. #2 and #3 Stay at home mom 26 years old and her 7 year old son, she felt the strong vibration. I am unclear if her son felt the vibration as well, but he came out of his room to tell his mom about the light but she had already seen it. The power outage had interrupted his gaming and he saw the light through black colored room darkening curtains. #4 Successful business owner, 29 year old married male, father of 2.

It was a clear day and the sun was just going down and it was close to civil twilight.  I noticed a bunched of planes in the sky, then spotted a larger, brighter light just above the horizon.  I quickly grabbed my phone and started recording, as I realized this object seemed stationary, and it was pulsing like no other identifiable craft I have seen.  I watched it for a few minutes and tracked it as it moved in a straight line heading northwest over my head.  I observed and filmed this pulsing object for about six minutes and watched it slowly travel on a straight trajectory heading north west. I looked at other planes in the sky nearby and compared it to what I was watching.  On the planes in the sky you could just barely see the red and green strobe lights and you could see the plane body still lit up by the existing daylight.  This brighter pulsing light  had no visible coloured lights like navigation lights that strobed like aviation lights.  At first I accepted the possibility that it was an aircraft heading straight towards me with the landing lights or collision lights on.  But then noticed it was constantly pulsing, moving very slowly upwards, almost stationary.  I also thought this bright pulsing object was a satellite or maybe the ISS, but it was only 5:16 pm and in the stage civil twilight, it was still not dark enough to see any stars.  This light was as bright as Jupiter or Venus but a bit larger. After watching the video over a couple of times I noticed a peculiar movement as it got over head and thought that the strobing frequency changed but couldn't really calculate it accurately.  At about 30 seconds in, the light seems to changing its speed and direction.  I could calculate that the light deviated from its original straight trajectory.  Judging the distance from the electrical cord hanging down from the eave-trough of the roof that is visible in the second video, you can see that the pulsing object appears to slow down, and then dives down to the left, and then zips back down to the right, and then zips up to the left on its former trajectory. I later stabilized the shaky camera footage and the zig zag movement becomes very clear. I could not see the object clearly at all times while filming the second video as it was over head.  It was heading into some cloud cover and just pointed the phone camera at where I saw it last.  It seemed to be completely behind some clouds so I stopped filming. I had to report this to you at NUFOC.  I heard you on Podcast UFO and think you are the most hardworking guy in the field!  Thanks for all your years or dedication and service!

My husband had walked slightly around the side of the house and called me over saying, “I think there’s something here you would like to see.”  I walked over to my husband and we were both standing in the dark.  He pointed to the sky.  We both observed a group of approximately 12 to 15 orange lights drifting from east to north about 200 feet above the ground. It was a clear sky. There was no noise connected with this sighting, only silence. We did not observe any breeze or wind at ground level. The dog did not react in any way. We did not feel frightened or threatened. We did not receive any mental images or any thoughts of being contacted. We did not experience any missing time. We did not experience any further aerial or other phenomena that evening. We did not experience any strange dreams.  When I first saw them, I said “Are those Chinese lanterns? I hope not because we are under extreme drought conditions.” I then went inside and got my Canon digital camera. My husband stayed outside, observing while I got my camera.  We were standing in the dark. The backlit screen on my camera was extremely bright and annoying and was so bright that I could not put my eye up to the view finder in order to get good photos. Because we were in the dark, I could not find the movie feature. After a futile attempt to take some still photos, I gave up. The light from the backlit screen was too frustrating to deal with. I have not yet gone back to see if I captured anything on my camera. I turned the camera off and my husband and I stood there, observing.  The lights glowed steady. They did not flicker or blink on/off. They seemed to drift as a group and did not seem to bob up and down or sideways. They drifted steadily together. The lights did not form any sort of discernible shape or pattern. The lights did not seem to be piloted or under intelligent control. Nor did they weave, bob, or dart around.  To me, the lights were not round orbs. To me, they looked as if they had a vertical portion, with a brighter glow at the bottom (toward the earth) section of the vertical portion and due to that extra brightness, the bottom portion sort of appeared like more of a roundish light.  The time noted after the lights drifted out of view was 8:08 p.m. This was the first day of standard eastern time as daylight savings time had ended at 2 a.m. the morning of Nov. 6 and I had set the downstairs clock to the “new” time earlier in the day on Nov. 6.

Didn't think much because the bus stop is near a airport and helicopter pad, but then I notice that the way it move could not have been either since it was moving in a wired motion.  Soon one orb got bright then the other and then the other dies out.  Then 2 more showed up and the one that Burt out showed itself again.  I watched for 15 minutes straight watching.  At first they made a line and then kind of broke off.  After then I didn't see them anymore.",2016-11-11T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

Right out my front windshield.   I immediately radioed my wife (we had picked up some 2-way radios for the trip) and said, ""Quick!  Look in front of us at that shooting-..."".  I didn't finish my sentence because as I was speaking, it began to slow down without fading.   It then came to a stop, pulsated or barely flashed (not very bright, though) and then another one appeared to the right (east) of the original light/object.  About a second later, a third one appeared (again, on the right) and now there were three of them! in a line.  Almost like Orion's Belt.   About a second or two after the appearance of the third and final light, the original one disappeared (like someone turning off a light switch), then the second one followed suite.

This light, however, was very active.  It moved, pretty rapidly, in a horseshoe pattern (from west to east) and then started heading back west before I lost sight of it directly above my truck.   Right after its horseshoe maneuver, I saw a white light (a lot smaller than the amber one) shooting from east to west at an incredible speed, where it disappeared near an aircraft (it was slow moving with the usual green/red blinking lights) that I hadn't noticed until that moment.

It was positioned just off the side of the road about 20-30 feet above the tree line (but not behind the trees, closer to the road). It had to be as big as my car since it appeared the same size that far up.   I paused under it briefly in wonder.  The clouds behind it were lit by the moon perfect, so I could make out the shape.  It was like nothing I've seen or heard described.  It had very short, stout wings, the front end (i guess the cockpit) was bulbous shaped and the back end was shaped like that of a jet (like where the air would come out).  I guess it was shaped like a jet but severely squished.  It had two white lights (like car headlights, but the y didn't shine outward, they just lit up) on each side of the cockpit.  It had a band of read light that went across the middle with a small! red light on each side and the light appeared to move back and forth across that area.  The craft was dark in color.  You could have drawn a parallelogram around the outside of it, if you had to place it in a tangible shape category.  It just stayed in the air, no sound, above me.  I really thought somebody has got to be playing a joke, perhaps so.  There was a car coming and it was late so I started to drive.  I watched in my rear view until I couldn't see it anymore.  Just before it went out of view it began to move to my left back towards the wooded area.  I called my husband and he told me to go get a picture (a decision I regret not making immediately now).  So I turned down the back roads.  I believe I saw it again, moving really slow, staying at the same altitude, across a horse pasture (it was too far to get a picture with my phone).  It looked like it was just exploring or observing.  I don't know.  Then it was gone.   I got home immediately and tried to find a drawing or image of the shape I saw.

There was roof tops in my way but it appeared to be shooting up from ground maybe 500 feet away from me.  They were orange/yellow color.  After shooting up and the lights moving down the sky, forming a chevron like pattern, I was able to snap 2 different photos from my cell.  I then decided to drive towards where this was happening, because I wanted to get a closer look, and also was trying to figure out what it was that I was seeing.  So as I was driving towards it, the lights went into triangle shapes, and then I saw a HUGE V.  The V was stationary.  By that time I had pulled into another parking lot and had a great view, got out of my car and went to take a photo, the lights from the V then shut off, only 1 remained.  I snapped a photo of that.  The one light remained for about 5-10 minutes before phasing out.  I could clearly see what looked like a mothership above the V lights.  The other lights I saw that took formation, different formations, seem to be like smaller craft going to the bigger craft.

I showed them the photos, and they have all said they have never seen anything like it and that when you zoom in the photos I have, it is pretty crazy and creepy.  You can clearly see several smaller aircraft.  I can say it's left me a little unsettled, as I KNOW what I saw, but still can't believe what I saw!",2016-10-21T00:00:00,39.4411,-81.3466

Please read full story of what we saw My boyfriend and I went to see Tech N9ne at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado on October 9th, 2016. When we got there we stood outside of the concert to smoke a cigarette when we noticed a helicopter flying over. I thought it seemed odd because you could not actually see what the helicopter looked like, but based off of it's lights and sound you could tell how close it was. The first time it went by I hardly heard it until it had gone by, but the second time it flew directly above us and hovered for a minute or two. It was very loud, very big for what I've seen news type helicopters look like, but again, I could still not actually see the helicopter itself, I only state this based off of where it's lights were placed.  After a minute of it sitting there and me watching this, a man came over the security guards walkie-talkie who happened to be standing on the staircase we were at the bottom of, and he stated ""Looks like our helicopter 'friend' i! s back"". I then looked up at the security guard who was staring up at the helicopter almost concerned and confused. I continued to watch him and judge his reaction before he glanced down and noticed me watching for reassurance, he then just walked down the stairs, into the building.  The helicopter came back maybe one more time after that, but it wasn't as weird as before, and it did not hover again. After this incident we heard the music kicking up and decided to go jump back into the crowd, when we got to our spot we noticed tons of unusual activity happening in the skies above the Red Rocks stage.  Off to the left of where we were looking there was about 5 lights spaced out sporadically in the same general vacinity, but they didn't move. We then noticed 3 off to the right of the stage that were just as bright as the other 5, and didn't move.  The five off to the left would get brighter and dimmer, some dimmed out and ""flew"" away as if a plane would.. some would just completely dim out and disappear.  The 3 off to the left did the same, until they all disappeared.  But the ones on the right dimmed and moved until there were 3 left, which eventually all dimmed out to nothing once again. We watched this happen multiple times, in different ways.  At one point we saw one light flying through the sky which seemed to have an LED light shinning from it, it didn't look li! ke the normal plane lights, it was much brighter.  We continued to watch and witness these ""strange"" flying objects, or just sitting lights at points.  At another point towards the end I noticed that there was this much larger strange orange glowing orb which seemed to be on the surface of some hills way off in the distance more towards Castle Rock, and it would flash and disappear, then reappear on the hill next to it.  This happened 3 different times before it stayed on the 3rd hill, where it flashed rarely, but it continued to still flash occasionally. The unknown activity seemed to slow down more and more until the concert ended, and then I no longer noticed them.  We just thought it was all very strange and thought we would share our experience since many others may have witnessed this too.

He actually did not notice that he captured a video of a UFO until later when he was doing a slow motion effect to his footage. He told me he couldn't see the object at all at normal speed. The first object appears flying through the sky and slightly banking to its right extremely fast (even while in slow motion) and completely silent, the second one is barely visible but it appears shortly after the first one from the top right and continues to the top left, near the end of its flight path the footage returns to normal speed and if stepped forward you can see it start to ascend.  I noticed that the second one sort of wobbles as it flies, like a balancing plate. We were both in the military together and agreed that as far as we knew, our aircraft technology hadn't gotten so good to be THAT fast AND SILENT at the same time.

I am a Air Force vet and my job was airborne radar and this was no airplane or balloon.  You could clearly see that the object was round with this funny tail.

The object was metallic in nature and appeared to glow and pulse in a bright white light.  It hovered and move slowly from west to east in a very straight but smooth line, very different from a commercial jet.  It also had no marker lights where all of the commercial jets around it blinked with red, green and white lights.  It moved almost like a drone, smooth and deliberate, yet was much larger, solid metallic and disc shaped with a very distinct bright glow.  The object moved East until it was over the ocean and then it just disappeared.  In comparison to the full moon that was rising, it was about a quarter of the size.

Officials apologized for the inconvenience and are warning residents the early morning flights will continue this week and possibly other times in the near future. ""These are not practice, they are in the fight,"" Lt. Col. James Bishop, chief of public affairs for Westover, said. ""They are supporting operations overseas.""  For security reasons,  Bishop could not say where the F-15 fighter jets are heading, but he said Westover is simply a stop-over spot for them.  The crews are also coming from different bases, including Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, and some may be returning from Europe as well. Bishop said he has not received a schedule beyond this week and could not release specifics on when the jets will be flying overhead this week for security reasons. Westover is the closest base in the United States to Europe, so crews are stopping at the base to refuel and allow pilots to get some sleep.  The base is a common location for stopovers of a wide variety of planes because of its location, Bishop said. Westover is not involved with the mission, and officials have limited information about it. The base is really just serving as a ""garage"" for the planes, he said. The complaints are mainly because of the 5 a.m. takeoffs that are waking people up and have also frightened people because they are so loud and atypical.  The actual flight paths vary depending on wind conditions and many other factors, Bishop said. Pilots are taking off so early because of the time difference between here and Europe. When they leave at 5 a.m., it is already 10 a.m. in England, Bishop said. http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/10/westover_5_am_fighter_jets_hea.html",2016-10-11T00:00:00,42.2723,-72.402

December 26, 2016.  While on a routine flight from New York to Miami, we saw a very unusual light.  We were in cruise at FL410, Mach .80, unlimited visibility with a temp of -55c, approximately 100NM off the coast near Atlantic City (close to Philadelphia), and on a true course of around 160.  Between 2130-2200 EST. I looked up I saw a very large and bright flashing light, which I brought to the other pilot’s attention.  His response when seeing it was pretty much the same as mine…. “What in the hell”… “What is that?”   The size of course is hard to tell.  The other pilot explains it as 3-4 times the size of the largest star around.  I think it was 4-5x.   The object was approximately 25-30 degrees up from our line of sight when I first saw it.  Its range of motion was between the horizon (from what I could see) to around 35 degrees up from our line of sight.  At first sight the light was approximately at our 1 o’clock position.  It moved to 12, 10, 11, back to 12.  At that time, the light appeared to move North, then south, at a pretty rapid rate.  Or I would describe it as closer and further from our position as the size seemed to get larger and smaller.  The light ended in the 1st position and then moved out east and once at our 10 o’clock position disappeared.  The other pilot stated he could see an! orange/red flash in between the white flashes.   We did flash our lights at it a few times and the other pilot believes it flashed back in sequence, I felt the return flashes were probably coincidental, but possible.  The flashing didn’t really appear to have any pattern.  The whole incident lasted a minimum of 10 minutes. Neither one of use have ever seen and/or heard of an occurrence like this.  We were going to report it to ATC, but mutually decided to let it be.  I have no explanation for what we saw nor does the other pilot.  We did try to video the incident, but it wasn't possible.

Odd sighting on the night of November 7, 2016.  Time about 2200 local, 0300Z.  Viewer location: Bethlehem, GA, about 45 miles NE of Atlanta GA. Observation time: minute or less. Bright, moving light in the NE sky makes short u-turn, erratic motion, then lost from sight. Looking up at the night sky to the NE towards Auriga, I noticed a bright object moving to the Northeast.  We have a tremendous amount of traffic in the North Georgia skies, and I watch it a lot.  First impressions were “Is that the ISS?”, but at that location it may have been in the shadow by then.  It was farther East than I thought I should still be able to see it because of the Earth’s shadow, and I could not be sure whether or not it was blinking, but the light was not steady.  Might have been twinkling if it was far enough away.  The velocity looked just a little fast for the ISS.  There was no separation in the light and any flashing that may have been there, as in Wing lights.  Distance looked to be many miles. Over abut a 10 second period, it slowed down a little and changed course slightly to the East.  Then, in period of 3 to 4 second, made a 180 degree U-turn in the space of 1, not more than 2 finger widths held at arm’s length.  It continued towards the SW, and made 2 or 3 small deviations in path, sped up and slowed down a lot, and came to what looked like a stop. It was too far away and/or too high to be a helicopter I thought, and there was no sound as it appeared to be hovering from my perspective. The brightness was about that of Capella, the bright star in Auriga.  Motion then resumed but slower. I am not sure of the position of the object to the nearby stars at that point.  I called for my wife to come look, and lost track of it for about 10 seconds.  I thought it was there, but when I looked back to where I thought it was, the only thing like it was Capella. This was definitely moving in a very odd pattern for an airplane, and at that distance had to be moving pretty fast.  The quick, tight U-turn and erratic motions were not like a passenger airplane would make.  I think it was too high for a helicopter, and far enough away to not be audible. I continued to watch for several more minutes, but realized it had disappeared or faded out, and the only thing of comparable magnitude was Capella.. The strange thing was this was able to do a U-turn very quickly - within 3 seconds I'd guess, and it seemed to make changes in direction without the usual ""curved"" trajectory.  It also stopped moving.  It appeared to be rather far away.  My son said ""It could be a drone"", but at 2200, and by the distance, it appeared to be with no noise I doubt it was.",2016-11-11T00:00:00,33.9297,-83.7447

On October 13, 2016, my friend and I were camping at the Spearhead Point Campground in Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in WI, we were camping at the P4 camp site.  This was our fourth night at the campground, and the first night since we had been there that the sky was clear.  It was about 7:00 pm, and we had just finished eating supper.   I had been looking at the sky, because I enjoy looking at the stars when there is little light pollution.  I had noticed a bright, white sphere in the eastern sky, and I had been trying to figure out what it was.  It was too big for a star, and I thought that it might be a planet.  I periodically glanced at the object trying to figure out what planet it could be. My friend and I were talking about the events of the week, and I was sitting at the picnic table looking at the object, when all of the sudden it started to move, slowly at first, then faster.  I told my friend what I was seeing (my friend is blind).  It was moving south-southeast, and had become obscured by some evergreen trees.  I ran from the picnic table, down the steps to the dock at the campground, because I thought that would give me a better view as the object moved SSE.  When I got to the dock, the object was gone.  I walked back up the stairs to the picnic table where my friend was still standing.  I told her that the object was gone by the time I got down to the dock.  I was describing the sphere to my friend, when I looked to the east again, the sphere was back. I told my friend that the sphere was back, and was describing it to her.  While I was describing the sphere, and scrambling to find a camera or our video recorder, the sphere split forming two spheres.  When it split, it appeared as though the new sphere dripped off the original sphere.  These spheres were originally aligned vertically, and then the lower sphere moved upward to be aligned horizontally.  Once the spheres were aligned horizontally, one of the spheres split again.  There were now there spheres aligned horizontally.  Each time there was a split, the spheres became smaller, and they were all bright white.  The two sphere on either side, just seemed to turn off, leaving the sphere in the middle.  That sphere began to change colors, cycling through white to red to red-orange.  This continued for about a minute, and then that sphere just turned off.  The original sphere was slightly bigger than a BB held at arm’s length, and it was oriented approximately 45 degrees above the horizon.  Since I’m not familiar with the area, I don’t have an estimate of how far away the object might have been from the campground.  The object(s) did not make any noise, and I didn’t see anything like an exhaust trail.  The overall sighting lasted around 40-50 minutes.  About 20 minutes after all of the objects had disappeared, a plane flew over our campground.  It was easy to hear the plane’s engine, you could see the outline of the plane in the sky, as well as see the aviation lights blinking on and off.  Unfortunately, we did not get a photo of the object(s).  My camera had fallen out of my backpack on to the ground under the picnic table, and I didn’t see it there until the next morning.  We did get the video camera out, but were unable to record the object(s) due to a camera malfunction (?).  Both my friend and I are in our early 50s, and have postgraduate degrees.  I work in law enforcement, and my friend is not currently employed. We grew up together in Northeast Iowa.  My friend still lives in Iowa, and I live in Tennessee.",2016-10-21T00:00:00,,

The point of light, as I looked at it more closely, was composed of three smaller lights, moving in and around one another.

In early April 2000, I went camping with my best friend and her husband in the four corners area.  We arrived at Hovenweep National Monument at nightfall when the park was closing and used the camp site there for the evening.  After eating dinner we sat out watching the stars.  It was a perfectly clear new moon night.  We were able to see miles and miles of the sky completely unobstructed by trees or clouds.  Hovenweep sits at the top of a large canyon and the landscape is desert.  There were no tall structures or mountains to block any part of the horizon. Slowly a huge and almost silent craft came into sight overhead.  It was hard to discern how low it was to the earth because of the darkness, but it was much closer than commercial jets fly.  It was the size of many commercial jets as well.  It was absolutely enormous. It’s shape was interesting, It appeared to have a main circle shape which connected to what I would describe as an upper-case T with the vertical portion of the T attached to the circle. The body of the craft was completely matte and dark, it reflected nothing (probably because there was no moonlight).  It blackened out the stars as it went overhead as well.  There were many lights on the craft in red, white, blue/purple hues.  The circle portion of the craft had several rings of varying lights in gradually smaller circles.  The T portion also had lights along the sides and bottom.  I recall there being variation in the lights, but not flashing.  They were very easily seen, almost a spectacle, not inconspicuous at all. What really baffled us was how quiet it was.  There were no engine sounds or apparent exhaust.  The air sound it made almost sounded like a hot air balloon, a whooshing sort of sound. It continued to travel overhead slowly for several minutes.  We were all watching and commenting on it the entire time.  We didn’t take any photographs, this was before cell phones were a normal thing to carry.   We were mostly in awe of what we were seeing.  After it traveled a considerable distance it appeared to rotate so that the circle and the T were now parallel instead of the circle leading.  It then detached the T from the circle slowly.  It stayed in a stationary position separated like that for around 30 seconds. Then both portions of the craft flew off at incredibly high speeds in opposite directions past the horizon of our visibility in a mere second.  It streaked the sky in both directions as if they were meteors.  The lights looked to be an orange type of color, as if all the colors blended together because of the speed of travel.",2016-09-30T00:00:00,37.3363,-108.7271

About 15 years ago at apx. 2-3 am in the Wichita Mountain Range north of Lawton Oklahoma, while goofing off with friends at a camp site, we all stretched out on the large cement picnic tables around our campsite.  It then began to rain. It was odd because I clearly remember hearing the fat drops landing on the ground clutter and foliage around us in a full 360 degrees, however not a drop had fallen on me and none of my friends reacted as if they were getting rained on.  Even more bizarre, as we had just been acting foolish and giggling like school girls before the rain came in, all of us had grown completely silent. At this time, it felt as if about 2 to 3 mins had passed, when directly above us where there had been black sky and stars, appeared a large ""triangular"" shaped object, closer to a Pontiac logo or Star Trek emblem, with ""notch"" inset on one of the 3 sides. It faintly glowed of a pale blue hue, and I could not make out any fine detail.  It seemed to be resting stationary just about 20-30 feet above the clearing in the trees, and as the slab of the camp site occupied about 20 x 20 sq ft. I can only estimate the size of the object to roughly 30-50 ft from the ""front"" to the tips of the ""rear"" and about 15-25 ft. from tip to tip on the ""rear""  What stands out to me the most, is that after about 20-30 secs of processing what I was seeing, at almost the exact same time 3 of us uttered phases that amounted to, ""do you...?"" ""ummm?"" and ""Anybody else...?"".  Then, as if it heard us, the object ""flew"" away. I use quotes there because it was so fast it could have just vanished, but I seem to recall a split second where it seemed to move forward before leaving my sight.  At that exact moment we were soaked by the heavy rain we had just been listening to all around us. The object never made a sound.  I remember in the silence feeling a kind of calm come over me, and after the event we even discussed how after seeing this this we all sat motionless in silence instead of freaking out at the sight. I am an airforce brat, my father served almost 30 years combined active duty and civil service after retirement, and have lived on or near air fields my whole life.

I'm making a turn when I see an object in the sky, straight ahead of me, in the distance, above the tree lines.  Now, of course, I see planes all the time but this caught my attention because of two things:  It wasn't moving at all & it was circular or spherical in shape.  There is no tail or wings like a regular aircraft.  And it's not flying in any direction.  It's just sitting there, in the air.  But another major thing that caught my eye was how bright it was.  From what I could see, the entire object was covered in bright lights.  Also, the object was far enough away that it was clearly above & beyond the tree line but large enough that I could see the individual lights on the body.  And they were BRIGHT.   I pulled over & was opening the camera app on my phone but when I looked back up it was descending down behind the tree line!  I figured I could catch it around the next bend if I could just get there fast enough but it was nowhere in sight after that.  I even went all the way back to drive that same road again but saw nothing.  About 20-25 minutes later (I made sure to keep a close eye on the clock), there were numerous (actual) planes in the sky. Way more than normal in my opinion.  As if they were searching for something.  About 5-10 after that, I called my brother & mom because I just HAD to tell someone.

September 16, 2016.  I am an artist living in Bigfork, Montana.  At approximately 9:45 p.m. on the evening of September 15, 2016, I was out with my dog walking across my parking lot to go into my home.  I happened to look up to admire the night sky and see if the moon was on the rise.  When I did this, there was what I thought to be a firework going straight up into the sky from the Flathead Lake.  It was a large yellow ball with a tail which appeared to be at least 6 times the diameter in length of the object.   Since my dog is afraid of the firework noise, I stood waiting for it to explode when it appeared to stop in midair and began to travel at a consistent speed horizontally on a north east route.  There was absolutely no sound.  I kept walking along the road to make sure to watch it without tree line interference.  It appeared to be headed in the direction of Glacier Park.  I watched until it disappeared from my sight.  With the consistent but slow speed, I calculated I was watching it for approximately 23 seconds.  At no time did the shape or tail change in appearance. When it didn’t explode, I thought it was a comet, but the tail never changed length/shape and the glow remained consistent.  There was absolutely no sound.  By 11:00 p.m., I researched several local news channels in the hopes of finding a newscast about a comet passing over the State of Montana.  I have searched for several more hours throughout the day today trying to see if there were any reports of comet – meteor sightings and have not discovered any reports. Initially I felt initially that is was not a meteor but a comet due the consistent color and tail.  I shared this event with several people I know and one individual recommended that I report it to this organization since now I am convinced it was some sort of UFO due to the behavior and flight.  I have witnessed UFO sightings a couple of times in my life in other states and always have seen objects that are traveling at high rates of speed which I believe were not aircraft.  Before becoming an artist 17 years ago, I worked in the aviation field and am familiar with various aircraft noise and behavior. In summary, I am submitting this as possibly I may not be the only individual who witnessed this event.  As an aside, this is the second event that I have witnessed around the Flathead Lake since moving here 10 years ago. Thank you.",2016-09-22T00:00:00,47.88739999999999,-113.8725

As a native Cape Codder, I have witness several of these UFOs over the years.  I think that it is important to note that there is a Naval Air Staition on Cape Cod.  If you come to the Cape, after coming over the Sagamore Bridge, there was once a military sight directly off of the first exit, for years the sign in front of a small gate was called “Space Command”. (Yup!) the name has since been changed.  The site has been dubbed “Pave Paws”, and is now said to be a hub for drone command. What it is really used for, truthfully,  I do not know. Growing up on the Cape, there was not much to do.  It is a small suburb of Boston for those adventurous enough to make the hour and a half plus commute in the morning, and it is also a well known summer resort area.  For those of us who lived here outside of the season, which runs from Memorial Day through Labor Day, there is not much to do.  We have some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, so that is were we go.  You sit and look at the horizon, you count the waves, you enjoy amazing views, and when the horizon gets boring, you look to the skies.  I can’t tell you how much of my younger days included good friends, a couple of beers, and a day or night at the beach. Most of my high school weekends included at least one bonfire on an empty beach, looking up at the sky.  We used to look for “shooting stars”.   We had a lot of them.  Big, bright, bluish-green balls of light that would regularly, though not often, streak across the sky. It did not take too many seasons of looking to realize that these shooting stars ran in a familiar pattern depending on where on the Cape that you were watching from.in the area of the “upper cape” they tended to run West to East.  If you lived east of “Otis, AFB” they ran West to East. Curious. Fast forward ten or so years, and I was living in my first real home of my own, Cotuit Bay Condos, lying with my wife in bed ,”spooning”, looking out our sliding glass doors towards the north. on a regular basis we watch jets take off from Otis AFB on a West to East trajectory. on this night, circa 1993, we watched a glowing ball of blue-green light “take off” from the same location and travel the same path.  The size of the orb was 2-3 times the size of a fighter jet, and its speed was much faster.  MUCH FASTER!  It got to the point about halfway across the horizon, quickly paused, dropped bit, and then took off almost straight up at an even faster speed and was gone. I have witnessed these balls of light all my life.  Several years after the previous sighting, I was visiting my brother at his house in East Falmouth, MA, I was staying there while recovering from surgery.  I was bed ridden and from my bed I had a view of the sky to the North of the house.  Several times during my stay there I witnessed, mostly at dusk, these orbs flying across the sky in a West to East path.  I casually mentioned them and it was laughed off by most.  One afternoon, the mailman, Phil, (Yes, in small town America we still have them.) came running in the house, yelling about how we wouldn’t believe what he just saw.  We swapped stories, and sure enough, they matched. The last time that I was at my brothers house we sat and watched the sky looking for them but all we saw, seriously, were two Marine-1’s (the President’s helicopter) and a couple Osprey aircraft.(Barack Obama had been vacationing on the Vineyard.)  They ran in a South to North Pattern which intersected the UFO’s regular path. Fast forward to tonight September 15th, 2016, I am living in Hyannis, MA, by the airport.  Out of my bedroom window I can see the take of flight path from Hyannis Airport.  I watch them take off regularly from North to South. I saw the glowing balls, greener this time, but still a bluish green.  They travelled east to west so much faster than the jets that take off. and were only a few hundred yards from the end of the runway, this time, I was looking up at them, not across.  I was able to watch them for only a second or two and they disappeared into the canopy above. the time was 9:55 P.M.",2016-09-22T00:00:00,41.6529,-70.2828

At approximately 20:00 on October 30, 2016, I was taking my dogs out in my yard for a bathroom break.  It was a crisp, clear, starry night and as I am a nightly sky watcher, I turned my eyes upwards. I play little games with myself while I sky gaze such as finding and greeting constellations, planets and stars that I know and finding clusters of stars which may appear very faint (I live inside the city so there is light pollution) with my naked eye.  It was this exact thing that drew my attention to what I saw next. As I was scanning the skies and engaging in my usual entertainment, I noticed above me a very faint, small cluster of what I thought at first were stars, but as I continued to look at them, I was confused to see them moving slowly in a straight line approximately North to South above me. My thought in that moment was, ""Why are those stars moving?"" and I actually did a kind of double-take because I thought my eyes were mistaking the movement.  They were not.  The object appeared like a very far away, faint, moving cluster of tiny white stars (no idea how many but a fair amount) and the only reason I could discern it's shape was not from any outline against the sky, but from the shape of this ""star cluster"" itself. It moved slowly (a little slower than an average plane) and was soundless.  I cannot even begin to estimate either its distance or size but I had the very real impression it was both VERY LARGE and VERY FAR AWAY.  The size dwarfed that of any planes that I see over my yard.  There was also no discernable sound I could associate with it and it appeared silent to my ears. I watched it move Southward until my line of sight became obscured by the trees at my back fence, but I was able to keep my eyes on it for what seemed like quite awhile (mere seconds, but I was pretty focused on it and it seemed much longer).  My dogs noticed nothing. Then I ran into the house super excited to tell my husband what I had seen and make a social media post about my excitement!  I have seen many unexplained objects in the skies over the years that could not be explained away or mistaken for anything identifiable, but this was far different even than any of those!",2016-11-04T00:00:00,,

Issues with electronics near these lights. Military craft present. On September 2nd my fiancé and I were driving south on Providence Highway in Dedham, MA when we saw four lights in the sky in a perfect straight line, equal distance from each other.  They didn't appear to be moving and we got it on video.  I have definitely seen interesting lights in the sky in this area several times before so I did not think much of it... The following evening I was with my fiancé and a friend.  We were driving on I-95 south in Dedham (a mile or so from the lights the night before) when we saw the same 4 lights in the sky.  This time the light furthest to the right was brighter than the rest.  We decided to stay on the highway to continue watching these lights.  At one point we were heading directly underneath the brightest light.  When we got real close I observed a diamond shaped craft with four big lights on the bottom in a diamond pattern. In between those lights were a bunch of smaller white lights.  When we were directly under it my fiancé's phone screen froze and gray lines showed up across the screen.  Then my car radio went static.  There had to be other witnesses, everyone driving on the highway was slowing down to stare at these lights.  Once we were no longer directly underneath the ufo we witnessed 2 military aircraft show up out of nowhere and begin flying toward the lights.  One got close to the brightes! t one and quickly changed direction and flew away.  We started having trouble seeing the lights for a few minutes due to trees and stuff but by the time we got a decent view again the 2 aircraft were flying next to each other in the opposite direction of the lights..I got a good look and it was definitely a military aircraft...they flew away until we could not see them anymore.  The lights remained unmoving for another hour or so and we went home.  I looked for the lights again last night and didn't see them. I'd look again tonight but there's a storm and it's super cloudy.  I will continue to keep an eye out and report if I see these lights again.  Thanks for your time reading this.",2016-09-09T00:00:00,42.2451,-71.184

After looking at it for several minutes, it seemed that I might be seeing a gigantic triangle, many miles across with lights at each corner.  I say that because I could not see stars in the area of the triangle. I have looked for the ""form"" for the past two evenings at different times and seen nothing, so I am more convinced it was a UFO as opposed to three planets or bright stars aligned. I have been hoping that others would report this because of the size, but I haven't found any reports so far... If it was a triangular UFO, it was at least a couple of hundred miles away and if you folded a standard postcard to make a triangle and held it at arm's length, it would have shown a border around it, making it gigantic.

But then it began to move and i realized it was shaped like a cresent moon, leading from the center. When it finally moved, it zoomed by so fast that you'd miss it if u didnt know what to look for. I thought that was it until I saw it fly around again and again, making passes around the sky above my townhouse. This continued for a few hrs and at around 3:30AM or so, it stopped making the wide circular passes and zoomed across the sky, disappearing from few after it was over a middle townhouse in the next combined set of homes.

The night sky is something I spend a lot of time staring up at. Stars, planets, our solar system, the universe, etc. has been of interest to me as long as I can remember.  I also might mention that I live almost at the very top of a hill referred to locally as Eagle's Point, which provides a significantly unaltered view of the Lehigh Valley below me, as well as the many airplanes that come and go from its international airport (ABE). Quite often I find myself trying to distinguish between celestial bodies and man made aircraft - and what I saw this evening was neither of the two.  If it was man made, then it's some kind of black technology or secret NASA project. As I stood in my driveway I looked up and saw something shimmering or flashing in the eastern sky low to the horizon.  This is not what I wish to report.  As I looked away to gain perspective by looking at stars, I noticed what I thought was at first a slower moving shooting star.  But as I focused both of my eyes, the only way I can describe what I saw fly directly over my head and home was a low-flying craft that was either utilizing some sort of malfunctioning invisibility device or was just initializing this device as it flew overhead.  It was completely silent and, though I feel I am struggling again to explain this correctly, it seemed like it was only visible from below.  Do you know how it is when a large plane flies low overhead (like at an airport) and is so low that you struggle to make out the whole form until it is moving further away from you?  It was like that, except as it moved further from me (at a quick pace), though I kept expecting that I'd be able to get a better view, it just seemed to vanish. It was the strangest thing.  It wasn't like I could see an actual craft or anything. It was more like... a disambiguation(?) of the sky in what I can best describe as an aerodynamic form.  Maybe like the shape of a triangle, but not a perfect one; a longer one. I'm honestly not sure.  My instincts are telling me to question what I saw, but this is not something that I'm in any way unsure of seeing. Feel free to contact me. I feel like I will never find out for sure what I saw tonight, but I'm quite sure it won't leave my thoughts any time soon.   I'm a college-educated guy, pretty well-rounded in my own opinion.

There, in the light of the setting sun which had just gone down below the horizon, the witness saw an object at approximately the height of a light cumulus cloud layer.  These were not high altitude clouds and only partially covered the sky. The object was brightly shining in the sunlight remaining at that higher altitude, looked like two light colored triangles aligned to each other and pointing vertically upward (further description may be added later with drawing if possible).  The object was very steady and did not waver or bob about; it was as steady as a rock, seemed to be firmly controlled.  No noise was heard from the object. The witness said the object was emitting two light beams or columns of light extending downward from the object a few times its length.  It looked as though these two beams or columns of light were propelling the object upward. The light beams were not flames but more like pillars of light, very geometrical and shaped like cylinders, extended downward as stated, but did not trail off but rather seemed to have a strictly limited beam length. The object began moving upward slowly; then after a few seconds the object seemed to either accelerate rapidly upward in that direction or simply ""disappeared."" It was not covered by clouds but seemed to either zoom out of sight with incredible speed or ""wink out.""  This description is written secondhand and will be corrected later if need be.  Will try to get a drawing and indication of apparent size, altitude etc.  The object was not moving horizontally but only moved upward, it did not drift in the air.  The object was sighted almost directly over the witness's head.  Not at the level of high cirrus but rather at the lowest extent of moderate altitude cumulus clouds. Witness, mid sixties in age, wanted to get another witness but the other person was busy so just observed as closely as possible.  No camera was available at the time.  Witness has excellent distance vision and says will create a small drawing with colors such as pastel etc. which will be provided by photo scan via email at a later time.  Witness is in excellent health, with excellent eyesight, does not require distance correction, and is not under any medication, nor does the witness use any alcohol or other drugs; is a nonsmoker.

From the viewpoint of the north end of Muldoon area near the Glenn Hwy, at 10 minutes after midnight (Happy New year's, guys!) we saw 5 or 6 clusters of what looked like small orange steady lights, 3 to a group, each group of three kept a perfectly tight triangle pattern/formation.  They came up from the south at a medium speed, too slow for a firework rockets or flares, but faster than most airplanes. They slowed to a stop still in formation & still due south, hard to guess the distance being dark, but my guess would be about 500-800'in altitude & maybe 5-8 miles due south from us. The groups of three seemed to keep perfectly together within each group as if there was one object with three lights each but the different groups of three would vary slightly in position relative to the other groups.  Once they stopped they were still moving slightly around but staying in the same rough area.  There were no flashing lights but the Orange balls seemed to slightly pulse with a subtle color shift from almost yellow to deep reddish orange.   After watching for 2-3 minutes, I ran inside to grab my camera but when I got back less than a minute later, they were gone or moved too low to see due to a 2 story apartment blocking my view.  At first I thought they were part of the neighborhood fireworks, but after watching, it was clear that they weren't. We were joking about the fact that they SEEMED to act like they came in close to watch the midnight fireworks show, then left when the fireworks were thinning to a close. Also, they made no sound that could be heard.  That could have been because of the distance and/or the fireworks' noise.

At approximately, 8:41PM on December 10, 2016, I exited my car to enter my house in Virginia Beach, VA.  I was facing east and I saw something moving across the sky in a south by southwest direction, so it was moving from my left to my right at an angle from in front of me to behind me.  It stopped me in my tracks because I had never seen anything like it in the sky before. The object appeared to be the size and shape of a Tylenol extra strength tablet. It had lights on the front and back.  The lights appeared to be fluttering like in a haze.  The object appeared to be gliding across the sky at a pretty high speed, and there was no noise that I could hear. It took me a few seconds to compute what I was looking at, and I was able to rule out many explanations in my mind.  It was not an airlines jet, it was to big in the sky and no airport in that direction.  I thought maybe it was a helicopter behind the clouds, but a quick look around and I could see many stars and constellations, so I quickly ruled out cloud cover.  The absence of noise also helped me rule out a helicopter, as well as a military jet, which do fly in our area but are very noisy.  The lights were not flashing like the normal air traffic in the sky.  The lights were dull and hazy like they were fluttering. I then got my cellphone out to video.  While trying to keep my eyes on the quick moving target I also tried to zoom.  By the time I got the camera on the object, it was far off to my right and I only was able to film the back side of the object. The entire event was less than 1 minute about 10 seconds for me to process and decide to video and the 31 seconds of footage. I had just returned from dinner with my mother.  I had not been drinking and was not under the influence of any narcotics.

I was driving on Hwy-30 coming from the West of Lahaina, Hawaii, travelling toward the East to Kahului, Hawaii, when I spotted one rectangular object above the Pacific Ocean with solid white running lights across the length of it, and streaming blue lights below the white running lights.  The solid white lights were very bright.  The streaming blue lights below as if toward the ocean, were the color blue police cars use on top of their vehicles. I spotted it, then it was out of my vision for a few seconds, until I got down from the bypass to the highway and it appeared again.  It seemed to be travelling West above the Pacific Ocean. When I got to my destination on the other side of the island, I asked the security guard if anyone coming from Lahaina, Hawaii, reported seeing anything strange in the sky.  The security guard told me 4 people mentioned it to him. I am a retired wordprocessor. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Aloha Peter Thanks for getting back to me. As far as size, the best I can compare it to is the length of a plane, at least as long as a plane or maybe a bit longer.  To me, the big bright round lights I would compare to a round floodlight, probably not as large as the moon, but from far away I compare it to a round floodlight.  I hope this helps.   When I was looking at the object while driving, I didn't have to cock my head up high in the sky.  It seemed as if I could just look out at the top of my passenger window to see it.  Another words, I didn't have to look straight up into the sky.  Hope this helps also as to exactly where it appeared to me in the sky. Also, my astrology teacher got back to me and said no one reported the incident to her, darn.  She was really excited about what I saw. Thank you for your help with this exciting object I saw in the night's sky.  Keep up your good work, as I know it takes many, many hours to investigate, but I appreciate what you do Peter!!

On December 10th, 2016, at approx. 18:45 hrs., a co-worker and I working at a secure site approx. 3 miles north of Kayenta, AZ, Noticed a series of parallel, pulsating lights in columns covering the entire horizon headed northeast toward Monument Valley, UT.  The objects disappeared and then a gigantic disk shaped object rimmed with spinning lights appeared where the previous lights disappeared, also moving slowly in the same direction.  The size of the object covered approx. 1/2 of the horizon and did not change size as it moved behind the mountain in the distance.  Pre-paid Verizon mobile phone camera not powerful enough to capture anything but a bright planet. I drew pictures of the site and the craft on a piece of notepad paper.  No cloud cover, clear sky, just after sunset. While sitting in my patrol vehicle at the secure site, my coworker exclaimed suddenly to turn out my lights and look behind me.  I noticed the strange pulsating lights moving in an apparent formation to the north.  We both exited our vehicles to watch the lights.  They appeared to cover the entire horizon moving in alternating patterns.  After approx. 3 minutes they all disappeared and at this time we noticed that new lights began to light up, one after another and begin to ""spin"" rapidly.  Each individual light had a trail behind it, and was a blue flame color.  As all of the spinning lights were lit a large ""disc"" shaped object became apparent.  The lights all moved to the left, then right, then from the left side and right side to the center, then left and right again, in apparent patterns.  The ""disc"" was so immense in scale I can only compare it to the ridiculous size of the craft in the movie independence day.  We both realized its size because it ! took up approx. 1/2 of the horizon and its size did not change as it moved behind the mountain (mesa?).  The entire event lasted approx. 10 minutes.

On the night of Friday, October 14, 2016 , I observed the strangest thing that I have ever seen in my life.  It was approximately 7:45 pm when I got into my car and started driving over to my girlfriend’s apartment.  There was not a cloud in the sky and the Moon was completely full, actually appearing more full than I have ever seen it.  No less than five minutes into driving I noticed some strange lights in the sky that immediately caught my eye.  Straight ahead in the sky above were several strange lights scattered everywhere.  Four lights in particular intrigued me so much that I could not stop swerving in and out of my lane, due to the fact that I couldn’t take my eyes off the sky.  Four lights arranged themselves very close to each other and seemed to be pulsating, fading in and out. It  appears to be a disc shaped flying saucer.  As I continue to watch it I noticed several more lights in the sky.  There were lights glowing to the left and to the right of the d! isc, and a pretty good distance away from it.  These lights moved in ways that are impossible for any aircraft we know today.  One light shot straight up at an incredible rate of speed.  The other light zigzagged and changed directions instantly.  More lights then appear on the left side of the sky darting off at high rates of speed.  At this point there are so many different glowing lights in the sky I don’t know which ones to look at.  All the while the four lights in the center of the sky continued to pulsate and stay in the same position, never moving from their original location.  At this point I take out my phone and record a video of the sky.  The video is seven seconds long, this is only because while I was recording I looked at the screen and it didn’t appear that the lights were showing up on the video.  I then became extremely disappointed and stopped recording the video.  It took 15 minutes to get to my girlfriends apartment and I could see these lights the entire time th! at I was driving.  After that I went into her apartment and did! n’t look at the sky anymore that night.  I tried telling my girlfriend about it and she didn’t really understand what I had just saw and didn't show too much interest. I didn’t even try to show her the video because I was sure it didn’t record anything.  After that we watched a movie and went to bed.  The next day I was scrolling through my photos and decided to watch the video, I was stunned. I will share the video my phone recorded with everyone, take a look yourself.  Also, the video is  even more amazing if you turn the brightness up and play it in slow motion.  I also saved a version of the video in slow-motion with the brightness turned up.  I will also share that one. I’m not sure what these lights were and I’m not even assuming they were extraterrestrial.  All I know is they were not human made lights and they were anything but ordinary and completely not  normal. In addition,  I have never been a person who exaggerates, lies, or seeks attention.  Everybody who knows me would tell you that. I am 29 years old, I have a college degree from a very good university and I have no history of any medical or psychological problems.  Anybody driving on the road at night would have seen these lights, yet nothing was mentioned on the news, and nobody I've come across saw them.  I've shown a few people in my family the video, and they are puzzled too.  Unlike me, they didn’t see what I did so they pretty much forget about it.  On the other hand I can't forget about it or stop thinking about it.  I will share the video.  Watch it closely and don’t just watch it once.  Trust me you will start to notice more and more strangeness when you watch it again and again.  Lastly, free to tell me what you think, or even guess this might be.",2016-10-21T00:00:00,38.8022,-90.627

While watching the helicopter, I caught sight of a group of objects much higher and further away in the sky.  They appeared as 5 off white oval or disk shaped objects flying in a V pattern coming towards me from the NE.   As I watched, the objects shifted position, from a close V formation, then more space between them, a straight line with objects abreast, a diagonal line with one object in the lead, then a random group while they went back to a V formation.   The sun was to my back and almost directly overhead, when the objects were almost overhead, it became more difficult to see them, only a small part of the leading edge was illuminated by the sun, the underside disappeared as it blended in with the hazy blue sky, finally disappearing as they passed close to the sun. It is my opinion the objects were solid and being illuminated by the sun on their upper surface. No noise that could be attributed to the objects was heard.  Other aircraft were in the sky at the time, both civil and commercial.  The weather was clear of clouds, but there was haze or smoke in the sky.

Sighting on Saturday, October 15, 2016:  At approximately 7:40 PM EST I heard an extremely loud, very low-flying helicopter somewhere over the woods behind my apartment in southern Nashua. My wife and two sons were present, and we grew increasingly alarmed as it grew louder and louder.  My oldest son (14) and I stepped out onto the balcony to look for the helicopter – it sounded like it was practically on top of us, but too low and close to see it over the tree line.  It was dark, the full moon was still on the opposite horizon behind our building. My first thought was that it might be the police tracking someone on the ground in the woods, except this helicopter was SO loud – sounded more like a Black Hawk than the standard choppers that police/news uses.  And we couldn’t see searchlights of any kind over the woods. Suddenly we saw a reddish/orange light break over the tree line headed South.  Our balcony faces West and this light was running straight & perpendicular across our view.  It was a large orb shape, flying very fast in a perfectly straight line – skimming above the trees no more than a few hundred feet off the ground, and a few hundred yards from us.  We had a clear view of it for just a couple of seconds before it was lost behind the trees again.  It didn’t weave or change course, didn’t wobble, or change colors/size/shape.  There were no other lights on it, and it didn’t appear to pulse. Following just behind it was a large military helicopter which appeared to be pursuing the object.  The helicopter was large and dark colored, either black or gray with only a couple of small red lights on it and no visible markings that I could see. The orb appeared to accelerate slightly while it was in view but then backed off a bit, as if it was trying to stay just out of reach of the helicopter.  We had a clear view of both the object and the chopper together in the sky for a moment, and the orb appeared to be about 1/3 to ½ as large as the helicopter. The whole incident lasted no more than about 30-45 seconds from first hearing the helicopter to when the object and helicopter disappeared over the trees headed South.  The object and helicopter were visible for just a couple seconds of that time.  Wild!",2016-10-21T00:00:00,42.74402106339468,-71.48120613496933

Only the center light was illuminated brighter and blinked like a slow beat.  It hovered above my head about 300ft, for about 2 or so minutes.  The object did not appear to make any noise, but I could feel like a low frequency  vibration or energy in the air. It then proceeded to head North into the sky, about a mile away.  I ran inside to get my girlfriend to see, and it was about 20 miles away, maybe hovering over the city of Hurricane. It remained there for about 5 or so mins.  We tried to get a picture and a video, but our cell phone camera was not good enough to pick it up.  At that time it moved upward into the northern sky and disappeared. We called her local police department in St. George, Utah.  They had no other reports a sighting.

White and orange lights that seemed to be intelligent/intelligently controlled followed us all night.,South Park Township,PA,2016-09-05T20:00:00,light,6 hours,"Occurred : 9/5/2016 20:00  (Entered as : 09/05/16 20:00) Reported: 9/24/2016 7:23:45 PM 19:23 Posted: 9/30/2016 Location: South Park Township, PA Shape: Light Duration:6 hours",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/130/S130176.html,"White and Orange lights that seemed to be intelligent/intelligently controlled followed us all night. The evening of September 5, my cousin and I once again found ourselves in the general vicinity of an incident from the previous morning.  We were about 3 miles upstream from the previous morning, at a small swimming hole along Piney Fork Rd in South Park Township, PA.  Just after dark we noticed what looked like flashlights descending the hill on the opposite shore of the small third-order stream.  The hill is particularly steep and would not be anyone’s chosen route to the bottom of the hill, especially since there’s a bike trail atop the hill with a trailhead within sight from there.  It became weird once we couldn’t see any of the people who would be carrying the lights, nor did we hear anything or anyone walking down the forested slope.  I remember seeing four different lights, which somewhat resembled incandescent flashlights, only as they seemed to get closer there were no flashlight beams shining through any of the trees.  These lights appeared to only ill! uminate a very localized area of leaves in front of them.  Also, as they grew closer, one would be near the top of the hill again, their beam also unnaturally contained.  My cousin and I got a little freaked out and  walked to the road near my truck, only about fifty yards away through a small patch of riparian forest. We gathered our thoughts and decided to head back down to the creekside.   “After all,” we said, “who cares who those people are, we aren’t on private property.”  As we approached the creek it looked as though the “people” had finally reached the bottom of the hill near the water. My cousin had grabbed my 12-volt spotlight and a portable power pack from the truck and he shined all 20-million candlepower toward them, trying to see who they were and also as a type of passive intimidation tactic since we had no idea of the visitors’ intentions. After all, they had just chosen the most difficult way possible down the hill, which no s ane person would do in any normal c! ase.  We got to the streambank and stood on the small beach.  There was nobody there.  After seeing the lights only moments before near the creek, nothing, nobody in sight. We were now even more freaked out. It felt as though they were hiding under cloak of darkness stalking us or something. Thinking we may be at the mercy of a team of psychopaths or something, we stood there quiet and in total darkness, no flashlights, just listening. As we stood there a township police car drove up to where I had parked, stopped and shined their spotlight on the vehicle and into the woods toward us. They wouldn’t have been able to see us if they wanted to anyway because of where we were at. The light went out and it appeared as though the police cruiser had parked and shut off their headlights. We assumed they were coming over to investigate or something. So a sense of both relief and irritation set in, because we now thought that maybe the lights were other police officers instead of killers. We also were kinda pissed because we were about to be harassed by so! me bored rural policemen for no reason…. But then I saw the police car cross the small bridge right upstream of our location and continue up the road. It was puzzling. We assumed there must have been two cars or something originally but one had left…. So we stood there, making sure to talk so they’d know where we were and that we weren’t a threat. But no flashlights, no footsteps in the woods. Suddenly the whole energy changed around us, and a very unsettling feeling overcame me. Mike also conveyed his feeling of unease. We stood there, and I heard maybe two very small sticks crack in the woods. There was also a beam of orangeish light shining down the streambank from the road up near the bridge, as if someone was looking for someone or something. But we hadn’t seen anyone leave the woods and it had been a long enough time since seeing the police car that the cops would have made their presence known, even if they had tried sneaking up on us. At precisely that moment, we sa! id screw this and gathered our stuff so we could dip outta the! re as fa st as possible. Still thinking that we were now surrounded by possible killers or freaks we walked to the road with the spotlight on full blast just in case someone had tried hiding, planning to pounce on us. But nobody was around. Just us. We put our things in the back of the Blazer, shined the spotlight around quickly, and were getting in the truck when the same lights appeared in the woods right where they had originally been. Only there was also a very bright yellow ball of light over there as well, in the treetops. Then one more, an orange-lighted craft or orb, whatever it was flew across the road clearing about a quarter mile in front of us and probably no more than 200 feet off the ground.. We were frantic. We high-tailed it outta there as fast as we could! After leaving we drove up the road and stopped in a random neighborhood cul-de-sac off of Connor Rd. What appeared to be a formation of some type was to the left of the very bright half-crescent moon. It was comprised of singular, small lights but covered a very large area of the sky, not across but upward. The lights appeared as though they were stars, only they were red. I think they may have been trying to camouflage themselves in the sky amongst some real stars because not all of them were odd, just a handful. We sat there and caught our breath. Right before we were about to drive away my cousin pointed out a small white light in a tree near someone’s house. I didn’t see it as anything more than a high-mounted exterior light. So we didn’t really give it too much more thought. It may or may not have been an orb, who knows...We ended up stopping in Finleyville for cigarettes, then drove toward home. As we passed an old chapel/cemetery, Mike had a sudden urge to stop there ! for some reason. It’s weird because I had thought of it while still in Finleyville but didn’t say anything. The place we stopped is called “James Chapel and Cemetery”, and is located at one of the highest points for miles looking north. The top of Pittsburgh’s UPMC building is even visible. That’s a pretty far view for this area due to the topography. Anyway, we ended up sitting in the cemetery behind the church under the moonlight. The atmosphere was actually very comforting  and serene, a welcome contrast to what we had been experiencing ever since leaving Piney Fork. Just being there felt safe and mellow. We ended up sitting in that old cemetary for a couple of hours. The vibes were good there, a peaceful oasis in the center of pure madness. It seemed as though the church had some type of repellant effect on them. We were still able to see many orb-like lights in the sky, but many more were either in the semi-distant treetops, along the power lines, and especially in the! area where we had come from. We were able to clearly see acro! ss the P iney Fork and Peters Creek Valleys from there. The amount of unexplained lights in that valley was astonishing. They were either white, orange, or yellowish in color. While sitting there I witnessed one of the orange lights split into two separate orange lights in the treetops. There were also some that would pulsate, becoming very bright for awhile, then dim, and sometimes even not visible, as if their lights faded out how a bad wire connection would fade out. They all did their things  for varying amounts of time. The oddest part of our experience near this chapel and in the cemetery was how the orbs that had been moving seemingly became “frozen” in place or something. None of them came anywhere remotely close to us or even moved at all for that matter. Only pulsating, vanishing, or splitting as the one did. Once we left we took a different way home. We ended up seeing some nice things someone had left out for the trash, possibly a cleanout or something. So we stopped to look through it. This was about three miles from the chapel, at the intersection of Scheinbach Rd. and Bedell Rd. in Jefferson Hills, PA. In being a very rural area, it is very uncommon for people to leave stuff by the side of the road like that. After looking through the many things that were there, probably 10 minutes after arrival, the unmistakeable sound of the jet engine suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Exactly the sound we had heard coming from the light over the pond the previous morning. Although very quiet, the engine’s sound just filled the whole valley. We were out in the sticks after all. I couldn’t find the source, looking all around, sky, woods, fields….. But he spotted the source. I asked “where is it?” Mike replied “you don’t even wanna know. Like really, dude. You don’t… Do you?” Of course I sa! id “yes, where is it?!!” He walked me over about 10 feet and pointed. “Right there”, he said. Much to my surprise it was closer than I even imagined it would come. It was a white light, very white, hovering within the woods, behind the branches of a silver maple tree directly across the road, no more than 50-75 feet away. Needless to say we dipped outta there quick! We ended up going home and didn’t see anything else that night.",2016-09-30T00:00:00,40.294,-79.9993

So i kept looking and I told my girlfriend to look at it to swearing that I had just seen it appear.  We both started looking at the star for about 3 or 4 minutes when the star just disappeared.  We kept looking at the spot where the star was until it re appeared again. it appeared and disappeared every 3 or 4 minutes for about 15 minutes staying in the same spot the entire time.

I was looking at it and all of a sudden it flashed brightly three times, to then dim away to more of a dim orange light and immediately started moving south, hovering all over jasper slowly and appeared to be loosing altitude but was traveling a straight line, getting so close and so low that I could almost make a shape. it disappeared almost directly over our car.  For about five minutes, I kept looking to see if it would re appear right where in was, almost directly over our car on the East side of town.

And then we turned to each other asking if had both heard the noise, we thought maybe it was an animal but our trunk was facing the water and the noise was far to loud for it to be a small animal. then we heard more noises coming from out trunk, so I jumped in the drivers seat to leave.  When I turned on lights and started driving my girlfriend looked in the mirror and said that there was nothing she could see.

Two friends picked me up at the airport in Savannah and as we were traveling north on the Bluffton Parkway toward Hilton Head, we all saw a meteorite, or shooting star, go low across the night sky.  We all laughed and said, “Good luck, make a wish.”   A little bit later, we had turned into the Moss Creek community and were about a quarter of a mile down the fairway talking and laughing, when a ball of light came from the right, zoomed across the windshield and then disappeared to the left off into a grove of trees. Two of us saw it and said, “What was that!?”  At first, I thought it might be a weird huge bird, but thinking about it a minute later, I realized it seemed completely round, about 6” to 8” in diameter.  It was really bright white in the middle as though it was glowing from within and it moved very fast without any wings.  There was no sound either (although we did have the windows up in the car).  It looked like it zoomed over the hood of the car, about 3 feet from the windshield.  It went from right to left and then swooped off into the distance, making an ""s""-curve across what I later found out was a clearing in the golf course.  From there, it flew into a grove of tall trees on the left side of the clearing. We immediately turned the car around and drove back about 20 feet to the clearing and trees to see if we could still see it.  I did see two dim lights, one brighter than the other, in the trees about 8 ft from the ground.  However, these may have been lights from houses behind the trees, but until we look at that area again, I don’t know that for sure.  I’ve been told that’s all golf course and there are no houses there. Later, we wondered if the “shooting star” and the “ball of light” were connected.  Maybe, maybe not, either way this was an exciting start to my vacation and I don’t know how to explain it, so I believe it was truly a UFO. A little history on me: I have investigated light anomalies in the past, including the Marfa lights and the Brown Mountain lights.  (This light didn’t look anything like those lights and took me totally by surprise.)  Also, I have taken photos and videos of mists and unexplained lights in séances, cemeteries and buildings.

Made impossible movements with quick moving and sudden stops. Beginning on the night of 9/19/16, a large orange light appeared stationary to the south of my home.  It appeared approximately 2 or 3 times the size of a regular star & had a light orange glow.  It would move very quickly in a direction and then come to an immediate stop and become stationary.  There were also 2 white lights to the west of the orange light making similar movements.  This continued until one white light slowly moved to the southwest until out of sight, then the 2nd white light moved west until out of sight, and the orange light moved south until out of sight after about 3 hours of hovering in the same area of the sky.   These same lights came back to the same area for the next 4 days and did the same things.   The 2nd & 3rd  night the orange light wasnt as large as the 1st night because I believe it was a little higher altitude or farther from me.  The 3rd night after the 3 lights began to move away I noticed a large white sparkling light coming from the Northwest towards my property.  It then stopped and began with the same movements and sudden stops as the others. The 4th night the orange light was larger again and there were several more of the white lights, I recall probably 6 or 7, that were in all directions in the sky.  Each night the was an unusual amount of planes that kept flying in the general area of the orange light.  My property may get the random plane, but this was 7-12 planes per night.  The last night I was out watching it was a crystal clear night.  Not a cloud in the sky. I noticed a strangely shaped ""cloud"" to the northeast right above my property.  There was a large white orb shaped light moving around in the ""cloud"" and it began changing strange colors as the orb moved.  It eventually went completely dark. I will send the video I took of this incident because it seemed to be the strangest of all.  Nights 5 & 6 were cloudy,so I plan to go and see if there is any activity going on tonight.

When I got to the airport entrance, I noticed that it was still in the same location but was actually a bit off to the east of the airport.  The car behind me had pulled off to the side of the road and the driver got out to look at it as did the people in the truck two cars in front of me.  I quickly grabbed my iPhone to get some pictures, all the while checking to ensure the object had not moved. I snapped four shots of the object within approximately 500 yard section of Airport Rd and when I looked back after taking them, the object had vanished.  I then pulled over to scan the horizon to see which direction it had gone, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I checked my phone pics to ensure I actually captured the object, but though I had captured the correct area of the sky in which the object was located, there was nothing in any of the photos!

In the early seventies my family moved into a run down Civil War mansion in Hancock, Maryland. It was on the C&O Railroad with the C&O canal, tow path and Potomac river within a short walk.  It was an amazing place to spend many years as a child.  It was surrounded by orchards and the Tow Path from Washington, D.C., to the Paw Paw Tunnel was our personal playground. There were five children and two grown ups that lived together. Every child had their own room in this 31 room mansion.  All the children with rooms on the east side of the house saw a cigar shaped craft one night hover over an old ornamental fountain in the yard and suck water from it.  The next morning at the breakfast table they all drew pictures of the craft.  It was cigar shaped with orange windows in it. That morning the headline in the local news paper reported many people seeing strange lights above Lovers Leap which was a historical sight directly across the Potomac from the mansion in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia. We all had chores and that night mine was to feed the cats out on the patio.  The doors that lead out to the patio were french doors with a broken door nob.  If the door latched behind you, you would need to use a near by screw driver to open it.  It was a large screened in patio with terracotta tile floors.  We were hippies and had stuff all over the place including a mini fridge in one of the corners.  I went out to feed the cats and on my way back to the door I felt terror up my back.  I turned around to see a small being standing next to the minifridge with a look of fear on her face.  She was crouched with her hands clasped in front of her torso.  I knew she was a she.  And I knew she was as afraid as I was, like she was caught.  She was glowing amber, stood no taller than the mini fridge and looked exactly like the grays from Close and Encounters of the Third Kind but was much shorter and glowing amber. I was stunned and full of terror.  With container of cat food in one hand I pushed on the latched french door to run inside.  Without considering it had latched shut my hand went through the window as the door slammed open.  I skidded along the floor and ended up in a small pile of glass and dry cat food.  In the chaos I had sliced the palm of my right hand on the broken window and was bleeding pretty bad. No one believed me.  Everyone thought I was copying the other children who saw the craft. I hope that little biological entity found her way home.  The scar on my right palm is my proof of that experience.  This experience opened me to a life spent researching and reading about UFO's and ancient mysteries. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It flew about arms length in front of me.  It did not have wings or rotors that I could see, but it flew and maneuvered as a helicopter would.  I did not hear any noise from it.  I didn’t see any windows, etc., but it must have had some type of sensors.  It turned by pivoting in its space and started to fly away toward the wall in front of me.

Large chevron shaped craft, no lights and completely silent   I was outside on my balcony at around 6:40PM on a cold evening in December looking at objects in the sky through my telescope.  There was a moon above and wispy clouds, and the night was exceptionally clear.  I was late for a dinner date, but I wanted to get as much observing as I could before I left, so I was just about to go inside and I stood up and walked backwards to my balcony door, still looking at the clear night and stars.  My balcony door was propped open to my living room and the lights were dim, I was at the door threshold when I saw a distinct shape, like a chevron, or delta-winged shape, it looked like a hang-glider.  I said to myself, “cool, a hang-glider”, and I went inside.  I stopped and said to myself, “why is there a hang-glider flying? Where did he jump from?” it is flat in Fresno until the foothills about 11 miles away. I went back on the balcony and the craft was right in the middle of the square of Pegasus constellation and the wingspan was almost as wide ! as the diagonal stars across the square. I estimate that the craft was about 800 to 1200 feet in altitude, completely silent, no lights and was moving at a slow pace. It looked as though it was moving back and forth, or left and right as if it were scanning the area, it was low enough to see that there were no windows, the color of it looked as though it was changing from black, charcoal grey and the color shapes were not clear and seemed to be matte, no reflections of any sort. I tried to make out an insignia, a logo, an American military branch, an identifiable anything, there was nothing. The craft seemed to have an underbelly of some sort, like a rounded belly with no other shapes or cutouts that looked like landing gear. The edges of the craft were geometrical and sharp, like a wedge cut around at 45 degrees, it moved right over my head and from west to east towards the foothills and slightly north. The craft flew over me and it was in my view for approximately 30 seco! nds to a minute. I kept repeating to myself, “what the F*** is! that? w hat the f**k is that? What the f*** is that?!”, over and over again. I knew that my camera was just inside and it had been charging all night and I wanted to grab it, but I didn’t want to blink and I wanted to ‘see’ this thing as long as I could. I grabbed a notepad and pen that I use when observing and immediately started to draw what I was seeing. There were two people outside, one walking their dog and another throwing trash, but I didn’t alert them, I just noticed that they had no idea that a large craft was flying just over head. I estimate that the wingspan was about the size of a football field in width at the height that it was flying. It seemed to glide in the air, perfectly and parallel to the ground and never tilted so much as a degree, it flew in a straight line at a slow steady pace. Slower than an airplane would fly and faster than a hang-glider would, but it seemed to float or glide through the air. High enough to push little wispy clouds out of its path, if the moon was not out, I don’t think I would have been able to see the craft as it reflected hardly any light and seemed to absorb light. It flew over a baseball field about a half mile away and the high-voltage lights were on and I could then see that the craft’s underbelly was lower than I thought and that the craft’s shape was just a thin line. I then ran to retrieve my camera and I thought to myself, “I bet this thing won’t work”, like every UFO reenactment that I have seen on television. I turned it on, and the camera was dead in th! e water, no lights, no sounds, no nothing, dead battery. So I continued to observe it as it disappeared in the horizon. I was shocked by my reaction of seeing an unidentified craft, my first and very up-close and personal, I was excited, but at the same time, I was in total fear of what I was witnessing. It brought tears to my eyes that something this ubiquitous could fly directly over Fresno, at rush hour during Christmas season and shopping, fairly low and whomever is piloting this craft, was so blatant and not worried if anyone could see that this craft was something like no other. To me the craft looked as though it was unpiloted, maybe remotely piloted like a drone, it seemed to be scanning the area and moved in such a way that seemed to be autonomous or artificially controlled with GPS or machine logic. After it was gone and out of sight, I was frightened and shocked, concerned and worried that it could be ours, or one of theirs, perhaps an invasion, or reconnaissance before the military strike. I held back tears, and I thought of turning the camera on again to see if it worked, I flipp! ed the ‘on’ switch and the camera lit up ready to shoot, that is when I started to cry realizing that there are things in this world that are kept from us, and I believed in all the conspiracies and every UFO sighting. I was enraged and sad that we are kept from knowing this technology, what else is out there that we don’t know that could possibly harm us? Whatever this thing was, it was magnificent and huge, black, silent, had no lights and stealthy enough to fly over Fresno, CA in the bustle of Christmas season and only one person, myself actually saw it flying overhead. I am hoping that this craft was one of our own military’s and that it is online to protect our urban areas from threats from any enemies. I have the drawings that I made and detailed maps of its trajectory. As a crow flies, it was headed directly towards Area 51 in Nevada, which is very close to Fresno, CA if you look on a map, any crafts that fly out of there, would fly right over Fresno to get to the ocean to do any maneuvers, over Fresno is the shortest route. I hesitated writing this report because I thought I was delusional, but after seeing all of the reports of a similar craft in this area, I thought I would add my event sighting to the database so that everyone can read and maybe someone else thinks they are seeing things, but I saw what I saw, and I can’t explain what it was.",2016-10-27T00:00:00,36.78825093333334,-119.78947053333333

I am on two medications, ((deleted)) and ((deleted)), which are used to treat ((deleted)).  These medications have not caused hallucinations during the 2+ years I have been taking them.  This is my first sighting of something like this, although I've read very much about UFOs and seen many photos and videos of strange objects in the sky, but no videos I've seen match exactly what I saw. Very early this morning (Oct. 31 2016) I was sitting at my desk, which faces a window, while watching videos on my laptop.  Sitting at my desk and looking up, the sky takes up about 40% of my window, with my neighbor's house and yard toward the left side of the window taking up the other 60%. At about 12:25 AM (00:25), a sudden moving light in the sky caused me to be distracted from what I was doing and tilt my head to get a better view of the light, adding about 10% more of the sky to my view. The light was an orb/circle shape and was moving very fast, much faster than any plane I've seen in person, including military jets (at high altitudes).  It was bright orange in color. The orb was, from my perspective, about the size of a quarter.  I can't accurately estimate the altitude because the sky was dark at the time of the sighting. The orb flew into my view from the area of the sky to the right of my house and seemed to curve in a flattened, inverted U shape, like a ball being thrown, while moving away towards the horizon. The light disappeared after about 1 second of flight from where I saw it; it could have been in flight longer but I can't be sure because I only saw it once it came into my view of the sky.   After 3 hours, I have seen no other lights.",2016-11-04T00:00:00,34.02910563770795,-80.99284038817005

At 0530 on October 31, 2016, I took our dachshund outside for his morning constitutional.  We live on a farm, so I go out with him because of coyotes.  While waiting, a very distant speeding green orb caught my eye the same way a shooting star catches your attention, but you aren’t quick enough to see it.  It was in the South Western sky.  That caused me to notice a VERY bright star that looked unusual.  It seemed to be pulsating red, blue, and green.  It was VERY far away, but I watched it for about ten minutes to see if it was plane.  It stayed in exactly the same spot. I was very curious, so I went in to get the binoculars to study this phenomenon.  I watched it carefully, trying to think of scientific or man-made reasons behind what I was looking at.  Then, through the binoculars and with the naked eye, I could see the green orb near it.  Then, I saw a blue orb move around it.  I ran to get my son who is 17 and quite skilled with a telescope.  I continued observing the pulsating bright light which now seemed to incorporate the blue and green flashing pulses while my son was setting up the telescope.  The light was so bright it was illuminating the moisture in the atmosphere in its vicinity.  It was too bright for the telescope to see without a filter.  By the time we got the telescope figured out, there was too much light pollution from the sun to get a better look using the telescope.  I snapped a few photos, but it is so far away that they look jiggly.  One photo clearly shows a blue orb near the star-like object. I really think I saw a craft that was using a star as camouflage.  It was lined up with Sirius perfectly.  I watched it until 0700 and light out when I had to get ready for work.  It continued to pulsate with the addition of some red flashing.  My son and husband also saw the phenomenon with the naked eye and through the binoculars.  The only natural explanation I can think of was maybe I saw balls of plasma illuminated by Sirius as the blue and green were the same type of color as the Northern Lights.  I really do believe it was a craft though, trying to hide in the light and position of Sirius.  My son is convinced that it was outside of our atmosphere.  I think it was closer because of the clarity I could see the flashing colors through the binoculars. I know this sounds really strange, but please know that my husband and I are both college educated professionals who are also very conservative Christians.

It traveled from the Southwest to the Northeast in a straight line at what I estimate at about 150mph until it disappeared from sight.

He thought he was having a heart attack and “going into the light”. Then, to his surprise, the lights left, he started his car up and drove onto work very shook up.  His radio never did work again, and it took him a week or more to finally tell me about this sighting, and he was still visibly shaken. My father never ever believed in anything paranormal or extraterrestrial.  It was a very big deal for him to admit such an occurrence.  He would never admit to any missing time, or seeing anything other than the blinding lights.    The most interesting part for me is that several years later, he was told he had some kind of small mass in the very front of his brain, behind his forehead.  But, he was never treated for any brain tumor or similar.  As far as I know, he simply ignored that.    He passed away 5 years ago at age 83 from unrelated cancer.  Right after his death, he visited me in plain sight and I don’t know if there’s anything related to those who’ve had UFO contacts and the afterlife, but in any case, I find both extraordinary.     Thanks for taking this information, maybe it corresponds with another sighting, I know that general area has documented cases.     Thank you, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This object which I thought was an meteor was emitting a trail-com of dark smoke above and white smoke below.  As the object traveled rather slow around 50 MPH I saw an aviation blue green intermediate light blinking from the aft of object and dark rotating cylinder that was turning counterclockwise which obscured the blue-green light somewhat.  The leading edge of the bow of the object was dark and I could see the wake it produced as it traveled south.  At that point the size of the bow or leading edge was about the size of the front clip of VW beetle.  As the object continued to travel it appeared to be getting smaller as if it was burning up like a traditional meteor.  However, object than started to speed up and continue to get smaller until it disappeared completely.  I continued t! o look down the trajectory of the direction traveled when it reappeared into a white flash as if it was a tracer round the size of 80 caliber bullet.  The object speed up to around 80 Mph and disappeared into the dark worm hole in the sky, and out blurted a double ring of triangle light, and inverted and the border were in aquamarine light blue.

The hole that it passed into sky was black or darker than the night sky.  I believe I witness E.T. object traveling either forwards in time or back in time.  Unknown but unusual nothing of meteorite burning up could produce such a vast array of triangle lights.

Crescent shape Watched for 30 sec. or so Amer / orange lights. I have seen many strange unexplained objects moving in the night sky for years, only because I like to star gaze.  But I have never seen anything like this and so up close.  It was a perfectly calm and clear early morning,  I was taking my dogs out to do their morning duties,  (I get up very early because of my work schedule I start at 4:00AM) when I looked up and out of the corner of my eye, to the southeast, I noticed a light.  When I turned and focused on it, it was moving silently northwest, completely void of audible sound.  My dogs were oblivious of the craft.  This craft was very close, the best way to describe it, was if you were to take both hands and hold them above and in front of your head about 12 - 16 inches apart, that is how large it looked.  It was a quarter moon crescent shape (as far as I could tell by the possition of the lights) and had 7 amber/orange lights on the forward moving part of the craft. We have some very tall, large pine trees in our back yard, and I had to walk to the north to look past them when it flew by and over.  It all happened in a matter of about 30 seconds.  My mind was racing trying to comprehend what I have just seen.  I know what I saw because I am a believer, but my mind was telling me differently. I was trying so hard to debunk it in my head.  So many different explanations were going through my head.  But I couldn't explain it.  I hurried my dogs up and by the time I was back in the house I was shaking.  I don't get shook, I'm 6 foot 2, 300 lbs.  But this got me going. Now it gets even more interesting...  The following day I am on the beginning of my 5 day off shift change.  I am doing my normal early morning rituals to stay on schedule, letting the dogs out so on and so on, etc. etc.  The first 2 days off were uneventful mornings for star gazing.  It was cloudy and overcast.  But on the third day it was very clear so I was looking up and about like a mad man trying to see another UFO.  To my amazement (because I was just hoping not really thinking I would see anything) I saw to the southwest, towards Milwaukee, very high in the sky 4 objects moving about.  These objects looked like stars but were moving in all directions.  I kept an eye on them and scanned the sky with the other and there it was, the same object I saw 3 days earlier but much farther away. It was to the northwest, towards West Bend.  This time it was moving very erratically, up, down, left to right, in circles and in a figure eight type pattern.  This time it was about the size of a pea because I believe it was much farther away.  I watched it for about a minute or so, then it moved very quickly to the north and just faded out of sight.  I thought this may just be a drone but for as fast as it moved and with no sound I have to rule that out. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was out working out in the backyard of my home at around 1am while listening to Coast to Coast am. My backyard faces north, the house faces south. I had a clear view of the northern sky, Nellis AFB is to my north east at about less than 7 miles from my home. I have seen many terrestrial and known objects in the skies: satellites, fireballs, shooting stars and even unique aircraft like the stealth bomber, all within the city limits. Tonight, I saw something that was very unconventional to the aforementioned objects. The object was simply two lights, one bright light and another less bright light at around the 11 o'clock mark above the brighter light. The object just appeared out of nowhere towards the north and not anywhere near the AFB, I would say the AFB is more north easterly while this object was straight north. The distance between the 2 lights was greater than the distance of an airplane's wingspan, that is what caught my eye. As I saw the object, the lights seemed to hoover and then eventually glide in perfect unison at an angle, the reason I think I was seeing it at an angle, is because I was assuming I was looking at a solid object but looking it at while it was making some sort of turn. The object glided and it seemed to move east at first and then eventually turned north and disappeared, the disappearance was odd because it seemed like it disappeared into some sort of haze or fog, but there were no clouds that night. It might have disappeared behind the mountain, but that does not explain how both lights just vanished, as if flying into a cloud, which I have seen aircraft do flying behind mountains and clouds. This was definitely the closest thing to a UFO I have seen. I did take a video of the even, but the image is too dark to see anything.",2016-09-09T00:00:00,36.24365929919138,-115.14496307277629

As I settled into my seat and started scanning the evening skies out of the dark 3 brilliant glowing white lights suddenly appeared. No slow build in intensity they just appeared. The 3 lights were in the shape of a perfect triangle. One on the top and two forming the bottom line of the triangle. My first thought was how interesting it is that 3 satellites suddenly appeared. I picked up my Nikon binoculars and focused on all 3. As I watched all 3 moved in a uniform pattern and never moved from the triangle shape they appeared in. My best guess is they appeared approximately 25 degrees above the skyline and close to 38 degrees north north east. As the triangle moved to the east the light intensity was consistent and brilliant. I continued to observe the 3 uniform lights for approximately 10 more seconds. By this time the lights rapidly faded to black at around 58 degrees north east. And as quickly as they appeared it's like someone hit the light switch. All 3 disappeared. Mr. Davenport, I perform this ritual nightly and have done so for at least 15 years. I know what satellites look like...I understand the way they move through the night skies and slowly faded out of view as the sun reflection passes.

This is a report of what I just witnessed at 8:46pm PDT, and again at 9:06pm PDT, on the evening of Saturday, Sept. 3, 2016, while watching two cruise ships on a web cam. While watching a cruise ship go past a web cam, situated at Columbia Beach, Parksville, BC, Canada; I saw, at first one, and then at least two more, lights flying across the sky from right to left, which would be roughly east to west.  The camera faces more or less north.  Here is a link to the camera:  http://www.bigwavedave.ca/webcams.php?cam=2   The first cruise ship was the 'Nieuw Amsterdam' at 8:46pm.  (Yes that's how they spell it) Moments after the last light went to the west, it appeared as though several (Perhaps 3) dimmer lights went from west to east, or left to right, directly over the ship. I hope to include a file (PeterD.zip) with representative photos of the day and night view from this camera, as well as the paths that the lights took. As the second cruise ship, the 'Coral Princess' passed, at 9:06pm, a similar display occurred, but with only one light. It also passed in both directions. As you will see from the edited photos (Sorry no actual shots of the lights), the lights did not stay illuminated across the entire field of the camera. It appeared as though they were only interested in /illuminated when close to, the cruise ships. As this camera switches from normal colour to low light when darkness falls, the actual brightness of the objects/lights is impossible to gauge. All I can say, is that I thought I had seen a meteor at first. But after the entire display, I can't imagine how that many meteors traveling in both directions could have occurred in such quick succession. This report is true and factual to the best of my ability to recall. ((name deleted)) in Nanaimo.",2016-09-09T00:00:00,49.32069473684211,-124.3202052631579

Lemmon.  Thought it must be a planet just rising over horizon of mountain, though it seemed too far north for a planet, and the sky was overcast so other stars were hazy but this was super bright and pulsing clearly (like a star on the horizon does). Then saw to right of object, probably several miles to the east along top of mountain, a faint small white light rheostat in slowly, then grow brighter, then rheostat to a deep ruby red, get really bright, then switch off suddenly as if a light switch turned it off.  This happened multiple times in sequence of about 1-3 minutes apart.  Occasional flashes of similar red light on the opposite side of the large white/yellow orb, like a light ‘echo’, not as ‘solid’ but there just the same.  The phenomena was persisting so long, I drove up to Sabino Canyon for a closer look but the sky there was dark and couldn’t get as panoramic a view of the range.  Nothing happening there.  Around 8pm when I returned to original location of siting (farther from the range where you can get a broader view of entire top of Mt. Lemmon), there it was again, the bright orb, as if it hadn’t moved (and a planet would have moved in 2 hours)! My memory isn’t precise but for the next 5 minutes or so, what a light show!  The bright white orb blinked out, then suddenly reappeared.  Blinked out then reappeared.  Then moved super-fast to the right about ¼ inch (viewed from several miles distant).  Then blinked out.   Then reappeared.  There was almost a dance between this larger light and the smaller red lights. A lot of movement, blinking in and out.  It is hard to recall details but all I could think was “this ain’t no planet”.  There are radio signal towers on Mt Lemon but they pulse and stay turned on all the time, and they are in a different location from where I saw the red lights.  These smaller red lights were shutting off completely, then phasing back in first as white lights, then as ruby red lights. Then blinking off instantaneously.  The last thing I saw was the white orb rheostat to a beautiful golden yellow, 2x or even 3x its original size and then it looked like it split in half and then it simply disappeared, along with the red lights.  Poof.  Gone.  The overriding perception I got was that there was some kind of transdimensional shape shifting happening. I wonder if anybody else saw this in Tucson.

The light at the center of object changed brightness. My cousin and I were driving around our ranch 30 miles south of the town of Texhoma in the Panhandle of Texas on the night of December 27th, 2016, from about 7:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.  Below is a detailed account of an object we saw in the sky that night. I will email videos. At about 7:15 p.m., I commented on how bright the stars were to my cousin and while looking at the sky I noticed a bright light in the west-northwest direction from us that was too large and too bright to be a star in the sky.  I commented on it, but my cousin and I didn’t think too much of it as we thought it was a plane passing through.  A few minutes passed by, and I turned my attention back to the stars and noticed the light again.  It didn’t appear to have moved from when I initially saw it just a few minutes before.  We talked about how that was kind of odd so we watched it for maybe 2-3 minutes.  It was hard to gauge the distance between us and the object being that it was already dark outside.  I would estimate it was somewhere around 5-10 miles away.  The object appeared to be moving but at a pretty slow pace.  At this point in the night the object looked like a big circular bright light in the sky.   ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Venus.  PD)) We quickly lost interest in the object again and ended up driving about 40 miles north to another ranch of ours located on the north side of Texhoma.  It was about 8:15 p.m. and I looked up to the sky and saw the object again.  It was in the west-southwest part of the sky at this point, which makes me think it did not move a whole lot.  It was noticeably closer making it much bigger and brighter than just an hour before.  My cousin and I both witnessed this and we also noticed that there appeared to be something spinning around the light.  It appeared to be like a fan or a mill and it was moving very fast around the circular light but it was not lit up so it wasn’t as clear.  This really got our attention so we pulled over and got out to watch it for around 20 minutes.  It was moving back and forth at the same slow pace but not getting much closer to us or following any sort of pattern.  The light was a whitish yellow with instances of slow and subtle hues of red and orange.  It appeared to change brightness and sometimes the circle would get bigger and the light would be less concentrated and then it would almost insta! ntly shr ink to about half its size and at the same time become much brighter.  After looking at it in awe for around 20 minutes we got back in the vehicle and started driving back to town.  We began going west directly at the light but it appeared further and further away as we headed directly toward it.  We then hit the main highway and hopped on it going south back to town for the night.  The object faded off into the distance behind us. The only thing that I can think of in this part of the world that would be that high in the sky are the grain elevators, which have lights on them.  However they have many lights all over them.  I am stumped.  I can confidently say it was a flying object.  However, I have never seen anything like it and I have seen thousands of planes go over our land in the day and at night in complete darkness.  I was able to snap a couple pictures and videos of the object while at the ranch north of town.  I will email to the address provided on the site.  The email will be labeled “UFO TEXAS PANHANDLE”.

I noticed a strange flash of white light towards the southwest part of the sky and began watching for it again.  It flashed again around 10 seconds later but flashed in an irregular way now in a blue and red beam of movement like a very slow motion trail.  It continued to flash mostly either faint or extremely bright flashes of white light with no pattern or rhythm of flashing, and once in a blue moon it had the flash of blue and red again similar to a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere but in a more controlled way.  It inched slowly across the sky from west to east in a horizontal direction until disappearing behind the trees. It moved much too slow to be an airplane, satellite, or the ISS.  It was clearly in the sky and not out in space, and guessing roughly it was probably 5-10,000 feet off the ground; perhaps a 1/2 a mile to a mile from our location.  In about 15-20 minutes it had moved so slowly that it only covered about 10 feet of the sky from our point of view.  Any passenger or military plane or helicopters I've seen here would cover that distance in under 20 seconds.  The B-2s fly out here quite often too with Whiteman AFB being so close.

Then it slowly reversed course and headed back towards the west-northwest, and at the same time it changed course it also dimmed greatly and became hard to see, and now appeared whitish and very dim, slowly fading to where I could no longer see it.

Having never seen anything like this before, I feel like I may be a bit crazy.  I have been watching a lot of Ancient Aliens and listening to Coast To Coast nightly, but that fact has no bearing on what I actually saw this morning. 	I am a truck driver, and I drive the same route every night, which takes me from Bloomington, Illinois, up Interstate 39 to Plover, Wisconsin, and back.  This gives an idea of approximately where I may have been in relation to towns or cities, as I wasn’t exactly sure what towns are around the objects I saw.  I do know that the first one was seen in southern Wisconsin, close to the border, probably around the 170-mile-marker or so, before getting on the toll way. 	As I have not seen anything like this, it’s difficult to describe, but I will admit that the first and third objects could have easily been airplanes seen from a distance, but I do not think they were.   All three objects were orange in color, all seen from a distance as I was driving, so I couldn’t keep my eyes fully trained on them. 	The first one, which was seen around 4:30 A.M. CST, at first did look like it was possibly an airplane coming in for a landing, as it was descending, but when it did a zigzag movement while in descent, I realized I may have seen something not operated by humans.   I know that some military airplanes could pull off a zigzag pattern, but the way it moved while also descending was a bit strange.  I spent 4 years in the Marine Corps, and being an air winger, I frequently witnessed maneuvers by Hornets, EA-6Bs, Harriers, Ospreys, and others.  I never saw any of those things, including helicopters, do anything like what I saw.  Eventually, it got too low and was hidden behind the tree line of the Interstate.  I tried to keep an eye out for it to pop up again, but it didn’t. 	The second object was much higher in the night sky, around 5:15 A.M. CST, and was much further away from me than the first was.  I was driving south, and I first saw it almost directly in front of me.  It seemed at first to be moving very slowly east, then sped up a bit.  Up until this point, I didn’t think the first object was enough to file a report, as I stated that it could have easily been an airplane, even with the odd zigzag move, but what happened while watching the second one actually astonished me quite a bit.  After it sped up a bit, I saw a quick shaft of light.  This light was not bright or flashy, and it only lasted a split second, maybe a quarter of a second at the most.  It was like a lightning bolt, but rather than going from the ground to the sky, this bolt came from the sky and was aimed directly at the craft.  Also, it wasn’t jagged like a bolt of lightning, but rather it was straight, like something was beamed from space to the craft.  I have never hear! d or read of anyone seeing anything like this before, so maybe I really am crazy.  Anyway, after this beam to the craft, it kept on moving in an easterly direction and I lost it as it kept going. The third object was spotted around 5:45 A.M. CST, and this was the least eventful of the three.  I also saw this one coming from the south, or at least that’s where I spotted it since I was driving south.  This one traveled at a leisurely pace for the most part, speeding up one time, but slowing back down soon after.  This one didn’t do anything odd, but also went in an east direction, where I lost it in the twilight of the rising sun. 	Honestly, of the three things I saw, I really don’t know if any of them was actually extra terrestrial, but they could be.  That’s why I wanted to report them.  I’m truly interested if anyone else saw the shaft of light to the second craft I saw, or if anyone has ever reported such a thing before.",2016-12-30T00:00:00,,

Thursday, October 6, 1:07 AM, Ottawa, Canada.  I got up to look out my bedroom window.  I have logged two UFO sightings on previous occasions within the last couple of years from this same bedroom window but did not keep any records, myself.  I have reported one to MUFON and another to National UFO Reporting Center.  I have seen about four other sightings over the years directly over the city of Ottawa and Gatineau.   I sometimes look out the bedroom window to check for UFO's especially at sundown and during the night.  There is usually one red air-ambulance helicopter go close by once or twice a day with pulsating red and white lights with characteristic sound.  One of the previous UFO sightings was of a very large white light and with a definite round-shaped red light of same size in its center which looked something like a spot light from a short distance away vantage point. This was about 2-3 miles away.  The reason I am saying this is that these UFO's could be trying to imitate helicopter lights!   Anyway, I looked out my bedroom window and the Western sky was misty.  There was one large star to be seen, probably Mars or Venus at about 30 degrees.  I looked out of the corner of my eye, as I sometimes do, to see if there were any fainter stars near-by.  I thought I saw a couple and one of them was red.  They were very small and faint, and much smaller than the first star seen.  As I kept looking, the red one seemed to get bigger.  Then, I detected it to be moving West to North.  It came to be within about 5-10 miles, I think, no sound, window open.  The red light kept flashing at about once a second as it moved across the sky.  It was fluttering up and down and would lunge forward at tremendous speed every 3-4 seconds.  It came as close as to within 3-5 miles, I think, before going out of view because of the window frame.

Continued rising and forming staggered lines with apparently random numbers of lights. Lights travelled in a roughly straight line northerly direction proceeding across the approach path to a Naval Air Station and adjacent bay continuing in direction of major airport.  Lights appeared to be miniature candle-powered hot air balloons but travelled too fast to be propelled by wind only.  Objects accelerated and decelerated.  Some made minor directional changes.  After crossing the bay and before reaching the main airport, objects varyingly:  disappeared, turned to the east and faded, seemed to morph into a small collection of red and green lights so as to appear like a small aircraft, or did all three (3).  Display continued for 10-15 minutes possibly including 30+ objects. After a brief pause, the lights began again coming from a more westerly direction, closer to the beach and rising from behind high-rise condos, this time proceeding more directly perpendicular to aircraft approach and travelling on what might have been a rendezvous path with the previous strings of lights.  Light from the new direction lasted less than 5 minutes. Observers were part of local family, working professionals, former military, graduate level educations.

INTRODUCTION: As witnessed once before  on 05-04-2012 at approx. 2225 hours by myself (see report submitted 05/13/2012 – Santa Fe, Texas) under the same ideal circumstances, while on my way to work as a police officer in Galveston, Texas, I see these strange lights in the eastern sky again. DETAILS:  As stated above, it was after dark at approx. 7:30 P.M.  While on my way to work an extra (side) job this time as a police officer from my home 23 miles away.  I have watched the sky's ever since the first time I saw these things, perplexed for the longest time and wondering if I'd ever see them again?  There's a whole lot of increased air traffic than ever before these days including military being this close to N.A.S.A. and the commercial air ports, etc. in and around Houston, Texas, which is what's always draws my attention especially after dark.  This is what initially got my attention tonight, more than usual of which I was able to tell the difference between fixed wing air craft and helicopter's circling and crisscrossing the night sky in a grid search like pattern would be the only way I could put it?  As if they were obviously attempting to either identify, locate, photograph, video, intercept, engage if necessary/even possible, or even perhaps the source themselves for these strange lights?  I'm not saying they were, however I strongly suspect said air craft seeking out these strange lights were of our  military in nature rather than commercial?  Especially regarding the recent crash 3-5 days  ago of one of The U.S. Army's Apache I believe it was,  Helicopter's , killing the only two Air National Guardsmen aboard, either in The Galveston Bay or The Gulf itself I cant recall at this time? I have yet to follow up on whats to be known of that?  One of several flying routine patrol's it appears post 911 and awful  low along the edge's of The Gulf at night as if they're either expecting or suspecting something?  I was on a different road way (State Highway 517 in Dickinson) this time, the next town to the north of Santa Fe but parallel's High Way 1764 regarding where I saw the strange lights in 2012.  Trying to pay attention to my driving and watch the night sky's at the same time in scanning the south eastern sky's  at, about, or over The Gu! lf of Mexico, BAM!  There they were again.  Only this time I was! some wh at prepared.  I had a camera in the car for this very reason of which I will work on getting a copy of a 55 second some what  decent video to you at N.U.F.O.R.C., you tube, etc.  if I can the first chance I get . DISCRIPTION OF STRANGE LIGHTS:  The only thing different regarding these strange “orbs of light” - “fire balls”, etc. were the formation and color.  As personally seen before and by hundred's of others world wide it seems, were some of the very same “orange” in color.  This time, they appeared predominantly all white, to green and orange forming two separate triangular in nature type pattern's of 5 each with approx. another 8-9 that I could count from the video I took scattered about all of which, acting in what has become an all too familiar way as described, photographed, videoed, etc. in the way they come and go and distinct formations.  I personally am so tired of seeing and/or hearing main stream media and other obstructionist type individuals all to often willing to write something off they can not easily explain away as these stupid “Chinese Lantern's”, ""flare's"" of some sort, etc. being the reason why I took the time in constructing and submitting this report.  I feel safe in stating in what we do know is, THIS IS NOT, what they are, period.  Something definitely appears to be going on whether meant to be secretive in nature or not in these strange lights showing themselves and frequency cited since 2012 in the ""well written article"" linked to this home page.

I was at home going upstairs to bed around 9:10 pm. I looked out the window at the top of the stairs and saw a bright white light pulsating. I went to my room to get my binoculars.  I saw a round disk shape that I was thinking looked like a holographic form because of all the tiny white lights and connecting lines of white.  It was hovering over and began changing colors, red, green, white. I yelled for my daughter downstairs. She also viewed the object.  We then went outside in the front yard.  I looked through the binoculars while she was trying to take pictures and record off my phone.  The object was higher than a plane ( one of our videos has a plane flying underneath the obiect) and was higher than a cloud  , but not as high as a star or the moon.  We took turns looking.  I observed it changing shapes from circle to triangle.  It was moving up and down and would also go from side to side.  I would see it spilt and was describing as pie shapes, it would split ! and then pull back together as a solid circle shape.  We watched for about 45 mins and decided to go inside. I continued watching upstairs out the window where I originally saw it.  It continued doing the same actions but the shapes were changing into like a fish shape and what seemed like a cylinder shape.  The only thing I could see was lights connected by a white line, these are the shapes  I am describing.  I continued to watch from there until about 10:20 pm.  The object then zipped further away in the distance toward the south and out of my view.  I have a big window facing South and was able to view the object from there.  It was further away in the distance. I continued to watch the same patterns, but I was able to see a separate white light moving around the bigger circle, this light had even tinier white lights falling down from the sky.  I continued to watch till 12am when it was even further in distance and harder to see with the binoculars. Daughter Cassie’s detailed description:  It was about 9pm on 1/8/2017 I was downstairs watching Tv.  My mom went upstairs for bed.  About 5 min later she’s yelling my name telling me to come upstairs.  She said she saw a ufo outside!  So I took a look in the binoculars and got focused on what she was looking at!  Once I did I saw a holographic diamond shape in the sky!  I looked around at all the other bright lights I saw in the sky of course because I was really wasn't  believing what I was seeing!  Nothing else up there looked like this so We went outside to get a better look!  I watched and watched this thing for a good hr.! it was just hovering over one area until it disappeared and went to a new spot about 2 hrs later. While looking at this threw the binoculars I could see it rapidly changing colors. I’m not sure how else to describe it other than the colors just blended together & you could see all of them at one time. It also kept changing shapes. I’m not sure if it was turning and I was just seeing a different side of it or if it was actually changing the shape of its self. I did see something open up from the bottom and a bright ray of purple light came out of the bottom of it! It did not last long though I would say it was there for what felt about a minute then the purple slowly disappeared. When looking at this threw the binoculars I did get a little freaked out & thought something was watching me so I felt I needed to stop looking. When looking at this with your naked eye it was just a really bright ! light. While recording it on the phone with no flash on it was a bright light that quickly moved from one spot to another without any explanation. I have never seen anything like this before! it was absolutely amazing to see! At one point an airplane flew by and this object was above the plane level but below the stars! I later looked up imagines of a satellite & this object looked nothing like any satellite!",2017-01-12T00:00:00,27.927325837320573,-82.23285933014354

As I was driving, in the corner of my eye, I saw a bright light speeding in a half circle, like it was changing directions.  I automatically looked out my window and noticed that it was much closer to the ground almost as far down as an airplane would go.  The object looked like a hollow triangle with circle like bulbs on each point with bright yellow lights that alternated from yellow to red to stark white.  The object was heading towards Issaquah, Washington and it went out of my vision really fast.   After seeing that I was telling myself, ""Okay, maybe i'm just tired"" but when I got off exit 11 and when I was waiting for the stop light to turn green I saw the object speed back into my sight and then stopped.  Now this confirmed that I wasn't just tired because there is no way that an airplane could turn around that fast and just stop moving unless the pilot was on crack. Wh! en the light turned green and I took my left turn the object started to move again at a steady pace toward Seattle, Washington (opposite direction of Issaquah).   I decided to follow the object but it kept moving in random directions and I had to get to class so I turned my car around but when I looked in my rear view mirror the object was gone.  Whatever this is, I keep seeing it at around 7:05-7:20am randomly heading from Seattle going into the Issaquah area.

It was already dark but there was a particularly bright moon and yet I couldn't make out the shape or size of the aircraft's what so ever.  They were flying very, very low at this point and when I stuck my head out of my car window I couldn't hear any noises coming from them.  There were 4 flashing red lights and 4 solid soft white lights.  I couldn't determine if it was one per aircraft or not due to the strange movement.   When the lights were above us they appeared vertically but as they moved in front of us they/it rotated to a more horizontal position.  The back lights mimicked the front ones but with a slight delay.  I was sure they were helicopters but could hear no sounds from them and I have never witnessed military helicopters that fly over our area to fly in such a close square-like formation.   They left south-east of where we were which is the usual path or military aircraft but they continued to fly oddly low for the rest of the time we could see them.

I was driving home on High Drive around 9:30 pm Wednesday Nov. 9, 2016, after having dinner in downtown Spokane when this incident occurred. I was headed east on High Drive and approaching the intersection of High Drive and Grand Boulevard when I saw this giant incredibly bright object in the sky that was immediately above the treetops about four blocks away. At first, I wasn't sure if it was a panel of stadium lights, but there's no stadium anywhere nearby. I live just a short distance from where this incident occurred, and I have been there thousands of times over the past 17 years, and I have never once seen a light like that anywhere in the neighborhood. I drove toward the object, and pulled over on the south side of East 43rd Avenue, between South Scott and South Garfield Streets. What I saw was a giant triangle that was only 50 feet or so above me, and hovering above some trees in a residential neighborhood. The object appeared to be about 180 feet long (half the distance between Scott Street and Garfield Street on 43rd Avenue) and 90 feet wide. There were white lights all the way around the sides of the triangle, and it was hovering in one place and didn't make any noise. Where I pulled over by the side of the road was almost directly underneath this triangle object, and I could see dark black circles on the underside. I turned my engine off, and watched this triangle object. There was absolutely no noise coming from it. Right after I pulled over, the thing started moving slowly from east to west. I reached in my purse to grab my cell phone so that I could take a picture, and I kept looking back at the triangle when suddenly it took off faster than anything ever seen my life. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen. When the object took off, it went west. It's speed was so fast that had I blinked my eyes, I would've missed it. The entire incident lasted about 10 minutes (9:30 to 9:40 pm). I know this because I had just looked at my dashboard clock as I approached the intersection of High Drive and Grand Boulevard, and I called my mother immediately afterward to tell her what I had seen. If I was to compare the size of the triangle from my perspective it to the size of a full moon, it was dozens if not hundreds of times bigger. If I was to compare the size of the triangle to my clenched fist held at arm's length, it was much, much larger. Although I was alone in my car, I am absolutely certain that there were other witnesses to this incident. When I reached the intersection of Grand Boulevard and High Drive at 9:30 pm, there were several Spokane Police officers standing in the flowerbeds of a private residence and talking to an older gentleman. They were parked in the driveway of the house on the north side of High Drive. They appeared to be looking for something in the flowerbeds adjacent to the roadway at a private home on the south side of High Drive. While I was parked on 43rd Avenue and watching the triangle, another car (vehicle #2) drove by my car. Vehicle #2 was headed east to west on 43rd Ave. and passed directly under this giant lighted triangle. I am absolutely certain the driver of Vehicle #2 saw the triangle, because it was brighter than any light I have ever seen. When I got home, I went to the Spokane News page on Facebook to see if anyone had posted anything about this. The only thing I found was a post about a car accident that occurred at 6 pm that night at the intersection of Grand Boulevard and High Drive. However, was no sign of any vehicle collision at that intersection at 9:30 pm, so I don't think the  triangle object is related to the car accident earlier that evening.

But, then realized that it was 1/4 the size of the moon.  As I drove into San Rafael, on the freeway, I was very confused trying to figure out what the h this object was.  It lit up the top half of the mountainside in San Rafael.  It was a round glowing thing.  As I got closer, it began to look like a white glowing hot air balloon, minus the top half, and it seemed like a person was hanging below it, air glider style.  Could it have been a helicopter at night?  But, I've seen a million helicopters at night, and it wasn't a helicopter.  As I rounded the 90degree bend in the highway, and continued north, the object was then behind the mountain, and I could no longer see it. Just then I realized that the moon was almost directly above me, so it was definitely not the moon.  The cars were all driving slowly, so other d! rivers surely saw this.

After a day of skiing at Stevens Pass, I was staying the night at the ski resort with some friends in the RV lot so we could ski the following day.  Around 7:00p.m we left our camper and walked to the main base area of the resort.  Skiing operations closed at 4:00 that day and the mountain was dark, but the base area was illuminated, and we used this lighting to play a game of cornhole (beanbag toss game) right in the main courtyard area next to the lodge and clock tower.  It was a very cold night with broken clouds and occasional snow showers.  We were the only ones outside in the area.  It was the night before a full moon and the moon looked amazing with the small broken clouds moving quickly past it.   Having the place to ourselves with the resort lodges and clock tower decorated in Christmas lights and the full moon in the backdrop, I tried my best to get a picture with my phone that captured the whole scene.  To do this I stepped about thirty feet away from my friends, took a knee and held my phone at an angle that got all three of my friends in the frame as well as the moon (this was tricky and you will see that in a couple shots either a friend or the moon gets cut off).  Once I had the correct angle I waited for gaps in the clouds as they passed over the moon.  After snapping a couple photos, I first noticed the object in the screen of my phone. 	The object first appeared as a blotch of white light in the screen of my phone.  It seemed like a morphing light ball with a bright core surrounded by a duller light and was very fluid yet erratic in its movements.  If I had to guess I would say the core was the size of a large grapefruit and the outer layer the size of a beach ball.  It was like a luminescent aerial jellyfish.  The object first appeared in the sky around the trees in the background and moved toward us.  It came as close as the clock tower (the photo showing the object in front of the lodge verifies its proximity).   At this point, I looked up from the camera, where the image was very bright, however with my bare eyes I could only see the outer dull light, but the inner bright sphere was still visible in the screen of my phone.  Put another way:  With my bare eyes, the object was not very noticeable and I might have not noticed it.  At the same time it was glowing even brighter than what was captured by the camera on the screen of my phone.  At one point most of my screen went white.  I was really confused and rendered speechless.   At this point I stood up and pivoted my whole focus to the object.  As soon as I did the object shot off to the trees behind the lodge, paused near the top for one to two seconds and then shot off over Big Chief Mountain at impossible speed and was gone.  As you can see in the pictures, my friends were oblivious of its presence and I wasn’t able to process what I was seeing in time to verbalize what I was seeing.  By the time I did, it was gone.  I still really have no idea what I saw and the photos just add to the mystery. 	Likely unrelated, we did see multiple F/A-18 or F15s (looked like they had 2 vertical stabilizers) jets flying at low altitude over the resort the following morning.",2016-12-15T00:00:00,,

I was letting my roommate's dog outside, when I saw a group of fluorescent green lights in the form of a chevron.  This was observed a few minutes after 23:30 MST approximately 4 blocks south of CSU Fort Collins campus.  The event lasted for 5 to 10 seconds.  It was a clear night with no clouds, stars were visible.  I was the only witness who saw this. I am a senior at Colorado State studying Civil Engineering and have a good understanding of physics, optics, and trigonometry. There were 5 to 7 lights in the formation, and were first seen 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon. I was looking south when I first sighted them, and watched them move north almost directly overhead; they were 20 degrees from vertical to the east of me.  As the chevron passed over head, it started accelerating and gaining altitude, before the lights disappeared 40 to 50 degrees above the horizon looking north.  The lights were observed for a total of 100 to 120 degrees in the sky.  As the lights passed from south to north, they changed shape from a chevron into a straight line.  I live on a N-S-E-W street grid, and I can determine that the lights were traveling within 10 degrees of the N-S axis. From the observation point, the lights appeared relatively small, but much larger than a star.  The individual lights were round, with a hazy edge and appeared to be about 1/6 the size of the moon.  The chevron formation had a span of 3 moons, and stayed approximately this size for the entire duration, as they changed shape.  As the object passed overhead, it made no sounds.  The dog I was letting out did not respond to the event. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be eloquent, and sober-minded.  In part, because of his technical training, we suspect he is a very capable witness.  He has submitted a very nice graphic, which illustrates the sighting, and which is posted to the NUFORC website.

Also, of note was a cruise ship that had departed and been in the channel fairly close by at the time. There were no clouds, but I could not make out any stars prior to or during the event; winds minimal and temperature mild. The lights moved at a steady speed, approximately 50-70 knots, a steady altitude, and in full unison towards the North. No sounds could be heard emanating from them, or other lights.  Shape and exact size could not be determined. The lights/what they were attached to were clearly under intelligent control whether it is ours or not I can not say. I was able to get two cell phone videos but they did not catch very well the extent of what I saw. I did notice that after all of the lights had passed, a helicopter had followed close behind and proceeded towards the North, but avoiding Logan airspace-it did not appear military and was plainly visible.  It should be noted that these lights continued through Logan airspace without regard to it. Of note is that a line of landing airplanes could be seen coming from the North and landing at Logan-very close together and I had not seen them do this for the two months I had been here-once the objects passed, some planes had refrained from touching down and began to gain altitude to continue their flights.",2016-09-30T00:00:00,42.3416629506008,-71.06563371161549

The lights were reddish orange in color and appeared to flicker or shimmer but did not blink or flash. The lights rose one by one and followed a similar trajectory through the sky, rising from behind a hill about 2 miles away, and leveled off at varying, yet similar, altitudes while moving west to east. Their speed seemed to be much slower than that of a typical airplane; the objects had a floating quality to their movement.

We could see the fire flickering as they rose in the air.  There were several already in the air and a few were just going over the street. As we continued on Pike Street I took more pictures and watched until I could no longer see them as we continued driving.

The flags at the Texaco station were flying/blowing to the North and the object was moving at a steady pace in a South East direction.  It is also noted that this cool, crisp clear morning at approximately 10:10 am.  The object was silver in color and changed from a circle to an oval shape.  It was a solid object and you could see the outline of the object, but at the same time you could see the object change shape.

At times the object reflected sunlight as it was a sunny afternoon.  I observed the object for about 7 to 10 minutes.  The object was moving at a steady rate of speed in the direction of Atlanta.  It did not move in an erratic way. There were no visible lights on the object.  It appeared to be the exact same color as the white clouds.  Eventually the object disappeared as I could no longer see it due to it's height and distance from me. The object was not easy to see.  I happened to notice it as I was watching an aircraft overfly my location.  The aircraft that overflew my location was a fly-over not on approach to Atlanta. The spherical shape just happened to catch my eye as it was bright white and well above the fly-over aircraft.

Outside smoking and checking out the sky, like I do every night. Been a while since I've seen anything worth reporting. I live a 20 minute drive from a major airport, so I'm constantly seeing commercial and personal aircraft coming and going all over the place.  This thing was not one of those things. There was no sound.  I only noticed it because I was looking up at the few stars I could see through the lite cloud cover.  First saw it right above me, and it had to have been at commercial aircraft level, so it was quite a ways away.  At first I just thought it was a commercial flight that had just taken off, but the lights weren't anything I'd seen before. Maybe it's something new, I don't know.  But instead of the usual flood-lights in from and small blinking white and read lights, I saw one long bar of white light pulsing at a steady, moderate, constant rate that did not change, accompanied by a pulsating round red light to the left of the white bar. I've never seen a white pulsating bar on any aircraft in my life.  So, I kept watching, wondering what it might be, and as it moved away, I noticed it appeared to sort of wobble left to right as it went, but it's extremely hard to tell when it's so dark out.  That could very well have just been my eyes not having any focal points.  I've seen stars appear to jump and wobble, so I can't say it was wobbling for sure. Other than that, it was on a fairly straight path North to South.  Right from the direction of the airport (North.)  As I watched it, that's when I realized I heard no sound. There's no way I would have missed sound from any commercial or private aircraft.  Just doesn't happen.  Any time I see a plane, I know the sound will hit after the usual delay.  Or I hear the plane and know where to find it by the sound.  This thing... no sound at all... none.  Not normal.  And it was moving at a pretty slow pace compared to major aircraft leaving the airport.  About the speed of a small aircraft. Unfortunately, in the dark, I couldn't tell how high it was, or what its size might be. Another I'll mention because it was very odd, although it may not be related at all... earlier in the day I heard a helicopter outside hanging around for a while... at least 3-5 minutes. I've lived here for a year and half and in this city for nearly a decade now, and I've never seen or heard any helicopter do that.  Every helicopter I've ever seen was headed somewhere and never hung around.  Maybe not be related, and it was at least a couple hours before I saw these lights, but I thought it was worth mentioning.",2016-11-04T00:00:00,38.04475955882353,-78.53657691176471

Location of the full moon was in the northern sky as well.  The moon was at about 45DEG.  It was difficult to see at first because it was directly behind, but a little above a streetlight. I would say the object was approximately 15DEG above the horizon.   The object was moving westward slowly, effortlessly, and quietly.  It was blimp like in movement and shape. I lost vision of it behind a large tree.  The object then looped to the south and was directly in front of me at 26 5’ 40.66N 80 15’32.45W  At this point the object was almost stationary.  It was ultra-bright white.  So bright my eyes had a hard time focusing.  However, I did notice that there was a square to rectangular shaped area on the bottom that was black.  Hand drawn picture will be sent to email referenced on website.  In addition, the object was equal to the horizon and less than 1/4 (.25) miles from my observation location east of coordinates. Object began an accelerate movement to the SSW where it crossed a major commercial airline flight path.  I believe an inbound commercial airliner made an abrupt turn and deceleration. I searched the internet for pictures of blimp at night, and the object had no resemblance of the pictures I viewed.  I thought if it was a blimp heading south it would be going to Perry Airport.  I got in my vehicle and drove in that direction.  I spotted the object again, in the distance.  I drove all the way to Perry Airport, but did not see the object in the area.

I was driving 45 mph southwest down Cherokee road at 8:30PM, just passing Cherokee elementary school and there was a large object a little to my right and behind the school with little to no noticeable motion.  It was a good distance away in the sky with 4 bright white lights (2 on each wing) and a small orange pulsing light in the middle.  The white lights weren't blindingly bright, but was noticeably brighter than a normal aircraft. I kept driving for maybe a tenth of a mile and the trees started to block my view, once I could see it again somehow it was already over to my left, and it seemed just a little further away. Still driving now at about 40 mph for maybe another tenth of a mile, I could tell the object was now directly over the road, but now it was a lot closer to me than it had been.  This is when I noticed the orange light and the shape of it.  For a few seconds the object was basically flying right above my car, like it was matching my speed.  I had my head over my steering wheeling looking up at it as much as I could, while still watching the road.  I rolled down my right windows, but I couldn't hear it making any noise.  I think if it was a helicopter or plane I would have heard it with as low as it was.  The shape of it reminded me of a U.S. B-2 stealth plane, but the object was narrower than that. It never had any jerky motion, it always seemed like it was kind of hovering but moving horizontally.  Also it was flying low, but it's size seemed relatively small. I lost sight of it when it was above my car and never saw it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Last night I took my dog outside around 10 pm.  I live on the edge of the city near a heavily wooded area, so it’s usually pretty dark as we don’t have street lights.  A few moments after stepping outside, I noticed there was a light blinking through the tree line at the very top towards the south.  I thought it might have been an airplane or helicopter passing by.  I disregarded it, really, until a few minutes later when the lights and object finally appeared over the trees.  The best way I can describe it that the 3 lights on it formed a triangle.  The lights pulsed very softly and would change between a bright white and blue every few seconds.  The lights hovered there for around an hour until they started blinking more rapidly and the craft started moving in a wide circle around the trees.  I would guess that it was making a ½ mile loop.  I ended up taking my dog inside because he was so unsettled that he started to shake and at one point tried to slip out of his collar to get off the leash. I bring this up because he's a very well-mannered, calm dog and usually enjoys being outside. A few minutes later, a second triangle shape approached from the north.  The two triangles approached each other and hoovered very close to each other for just a few minutes before the first triangle completely blinked out.  The second triangle then moved closer to the tree line (where the first one had sat after coming out from behind the trees).  It stayed there for around 45 minutes, pulsing softly.  Around midnight, the lights started glowing brighter and then all three lights seemed to move and meet until they formed one bright light that blinked out. While I do believe in aliens and the like, I normally wouldn’t say anything, except that my neighbors also witnessed this and brought it up this morning as I was leaving for work.  They said that their child had woken them up very disturbed by the lights and had cried until both sets had disappeared.

Around 1:01AM on Friday, December 30th, 2016, I witnessed multiple flying objects in the night sky.  I was up watching a show, when all of a sudden I heard a loud and peculiar noise, not one of an airplane but it was louder and more high pitched.   I looked out of my bedroom window and noticed a flying, lit-up diamond shaped object coming from across the sky, so I watched it.  Curiously, I stayed until it was out of sight, then right as I was about to turn around, I saw another one coming from the same area where the first one had come from.   So I waited for that one to pass, but before I knew it I was there for over 45 minutes just watching these objects go from one side of my window to the other.   Finally I had gotten tired of waiting for another one after about the 15th one so I headed to bed.  There was a gap between the 15th,16th and 17th ones.   Around 1:55AM, I went to lay down in bed whenever I heard the noise get louder.  Two of the objects flew close to each other a! nd stopped.  About 15-20 seconds later they left one going one way and the other the other way.   I thought it was finally over until I heard the noise coming back again, but shortly after that, a train came at 2:02AM, and after that train, there were no more flying objects that were seen.

We were all freaking out at this point and did not have any idea what we were looking at.  We spent only a short amount of time looking at the crashed saucer because a hatch opened at the bottom revealing a creature that was most definitely NOT HUMAN.

We came to a consensus that the creature looked like Yoda from star wars just without the pointy ears.  I swear this is a true story and I have friends that saw the same thing as me.

It kind of looked like multiple lights clustered closely together.  That is what caught my eye initially. While looking at that, I noticed 2 fainter lights (about as bright as a far away star) appeared to be moving relative to the bright light.  Meaning the spacing between the 3 was varying.

I actually thought this might be the International Space Station, but the other 2 lights made that not likely, and they were moving to slow.

Turned to purple moved horizontally and quickly vanished. Event location:  Euless Texas (just southwest of DFW Airport)  Weather: Scattered high clouds but clear in the area of the observation  Light:  No external house lights on.  Early evening just after sunset (dark)  Observation:  Looked to northern sky and saw a white object approaching.  At first I thought it was an aircraft but then it stopped moving and held a fixed position.  Seconds later, the object turned to a brilliant red light (no aircraft navigation lights or beacon). Physical location of object from my position:  It was 12 degrees (slightly east of north).  The object was approximately at a 30-45-degree angle upward from my observation area.  The object was west of the DFW airport and not in any known traffic pattern for DFW aircraft (west of approach/departure for runway 18L and 18R)  DFW ATC:  Arrivals from north and departures to south  Observation:  After approximately 30-45 seconds in a stationary position, the object changed color from brilliant red to purple (looked like a LED light). Size of observed sighting: The object was smaller than the moon yet larger than a bright star.   I compare the size to slightly smaller than my smallest fingernail. Observation:  Shortly after the object changed color to purple (approximately 5 seconds), it moved horizontally to the east toward DFW.  The object did not move far (approximately 12 degrees to 20 degrees) and did not get close to DFW air traffic.  Once again it stopped but was somewhat obscured from my view due to trees. Observation:  The object stayed in the obscured location for a very short time (maybe 3 seconds) and then appeared to move upward and north at a fast pace until it was out of sight. Notifications:  Contacted a former college who works with DFW ATC.  Contacted local media KTVT at 7:10PM.  Reported event to UFO Center via telephone.  FYI- media asked for a photo or video (no time to think fast enough to get a camera).  Media stated they could not report on the event without any physical evidence. Total event time: 6:40PM for approximate 1.5 to 2 minutes (was hard to tell how long exactly). My background: 40 years aviation (Operational Control, Emergency Response, Internal Evaluation, Airport Management).   Private pilot and aviation safety consultant.

I told them that I just wanted the sighting on record in the event others call them with a similar observation. I failed to mention the distance away in my report.  Because of the darkness, it was very difficult to estimate the distance and accurately state the size of the object. Thanks for the good work your team is doing.

I went outside the front of my house around 7pm on November 10, 2016 to retrieve a tool from my truck.  As I closed my trucks back door, I noticed 3 very bright stars that were vertical of each other similar to orions belt, but perfectly straight up and down, and perfectly spaced apart from one another.  They were brighter than every star in the sky.  I thought this was very unusual, so I went back to my front door of my house and yelled for my wife to come out and look at this as well. We both came back to our driveway next to my truck, and I showed my wife the 3 stars.  As we looked at these 3 stars they had moved farther down from the sky, and they were now turning themselves off and on separately in order, like one two three, one two three, and they were definitely moving lower and further away in the sky. Although they were very high in the sky like where the stars are.  My wife could not explain them as well.  We watched them for a couple of minutes.  My wife went inside and I grabbed my phone and called the fox 10 news station and talked to a guy and told him what I was looking at. He said he would check into it. I then went to get our son from his room to show him as well.  He came outside within 1 minute or so and we all looked at the 3 stars/lights still staying in that same formation, but getting farther away and lower in the sky, but also maintaining the off and on sequence.  Our son couldn’t explain what he was seeing as well.  This was know going on for approximately 7 to 10 minutes.  We all went inside to get our telescope, it took about 2 to 3 minutes to locate the lenses for the scope, and then we went back outside to see if we could center the telescope on the moving stars.  They were now a lot further away and lower in the sky, and getting very faint.  We couldn’t lock the telescope onto the lights as they disappeared into night sky.  We stayed out a little longer to see if anything else in the sky was similar, but their was nothing else. When I first noticed the 3 stars/lights I was facing almost due west, and as they disappeared into the sky they all were at the northwest part of the sky.  The whole sighting lasted approximately 15 minutes, and throughout the entire time, all 3 objects maintained their exact spacing from one another and the exact order and timing of turning off and on.  They must have been very high in the sky, since the entire time they looked like stars in the sky except they were moving and turning off and on, and we’re always in formation.",2016-11-11T00:00:00,33.535380550607286,-112.04946

I could see it through the tree line in the distance.  At first I thought maybe it was a light you would see on top of a radio tower although I have never seen a radio tower light in that direction.  Then the light appeared above the tree line followed by another very bright blinking red light about 5 seconds later directly in line behind the first light.  They would blink alternating about one second apart and did that the entire time I saw this.  I noticed it coming toward me.  As the first blinking red light passed overhead I saw only the light and heard no sound.  The second light seemed to be following the exact same path as the first light and when it was overhead I could see what looked like a normal aircraft with wings and the blinking red light on the nose.  I'm pretty good ! at estimating distance and would guess it was a few thousand feet in altitude.  The distance between the red lights were probably 3000-4000 feet.  They did not look like they were independent of each other, it appeared as if the first light was guiding the second light/craft or almost like a tractor beam.  Between the first light and second there was nothing visible, just dark sky but seemed to be attached to each other.  It proceeded toward the South/Southwest and then the first light banked to the left about 60-90 degrees and the second light did the same as if it was attached to the first light.

At first I thought it was a shooting star and i shouted for my little brother in the back seat to look because my mother was driving, but it moved too slowly for the first few seconds to be a shooting star and then in the blink of an eye (a split second) it shot away from us (rough estimate) 65 degree angle and disappeared.   The strangest thing I noticed was that the emerald green light looked different than a light you normally would see at night.  It had no glare or beams of light coming off it like a street light at night normally would.  It was a solid green teardrop shaped ball of light abo! ut the size of a bowling ball that was extremely bright and yet had no light emanating from it.  The trail looked to be 4 1/2ft to 6ft long from our location with a very slight downward curve.  It was solid white in the center with golden/orange sparks surrounding the center.

Today it happened again, had thank god I was not alone this time!   My mother and I were driving northbound on I-75 heading toward Home and taking notice of the sunset to our left (west) and the moon rising on our right (east).  I was compelled to look up the moon cycle and see if it was a full moon... it was ""Cold Moon"" full moon according to the iPhone ... I watched it as it got higher in the sky.   As our driving and conversing continued, I kept watching the moon; by the time we got off the expressway and had made our way to US-23/M-65 for a bathroom break it was pretty bright, but smaller and it had lost its reddish tint.  Northbound on M-65 I kept my eye on it.  I remember commenting on it as it was so bright that it appeared to be in front of the clouds - I could imagine primitive earth dwellers staring in awe thinking this ball of moon was actually in our sky.  This was not at all the strange part, that I am about to tell you... We were just about home.  We had been through town, and were nearing the section of M-65 within the mile or so before the road we live on.  I was still keeping my eye on the moon, it was real pretty tonight.  I spotted what I thought was a plane, but its flashing pattern was in short bursts, almost like a camera flashing.  It was coming from the west, but its flight was also not ""straight,"" so I mentioned to my mom who was driving that I though there might be a drone up there taking pictures (also thinking it was a silly time for a drone to take pictures - its dark out)... and then as I was adjusting my head to try to see better I saw a brighter orange light almost above us.  I was seeing it through the windshield and in the part of the window at the very top where it was almost out of view and I almost passed it off as a trick of light from another car.  I looked back to where I had seen the drone/plane and it was still in the general place it was, but not exactly, like I said, its flight pattern was odd and certainly not just heading east to west.  Then I saw the orange light again and this time it was half the distance toward the other objects direction... it disappeared almost as quickly  as I saw it.  We were real close to ponderosa drive now and slowing down. It reappeared.  Not in the same spot, but close.  The other object is still flashing like a camera. The pattern of the flash was very random.  I asked my mom to stop on the corner so I can look without the car moving... by this time she has become aware of what I am seeing and has seen the orange light appear and disappear I believe at least once. We start heading back down ponderosa the rest of the way and the light has become more than one light counting 2, 3, ?  Disappearing and there is clear subtle movement between the orange lights.  I ask my mom to stop the car again an I got out to watch it from outside the car and try to get the iPhone to video it... we have both witnessed the light reappear and become three lights and move a little - I'm saying to mom out loud at this point ""this is just like the stuff we see on the UFO shows on TV ma"" - she's replying to me but I won't try and quote it cause I'm too busy trying to get the video and this is when I notice the two jets from westerly and northeasterly sky (I hear them more than I see them) - at this point I am taking mental note of the following objects I have seen... the drone/plane which at this point I believe to have seen more than one, however the orange reappearing lights have become my main concern... and the two jets. I tell my mom that I am glad she was here to witness this with me. I'm so glad you know that I am not crazy.  I'm am so glad that someone saw this with me.  We are also locking the doors tonight.

One very bright (orange in color), the other seemed to be orbiting around it slowly at first.  I thought maybe it was just a satellite and a planet because I am a big star gazer and can identify different objects in the sky fairly well. I kept watching and as I drove close the one very bright star got brighter and there was a third star that appeared which made the triangular shape.  I gasped because the shape was slightly darker than the rest of the sky. The size was unmeasurable.  It was so big.  I have seen a lot of planes fly through our small part of the woods, but nothing like this. My heart sank.  I was so frightened.  It only lasted a moment, and the lights faded leaving only the bright star and the first smaller star dimly lit in the night sky. As I drove, the tree line took over my view.  I kept watching and calculating where the object or stars…things would be in the sky when my car turned in that direction again, but I was unable to locate it.

I was looking eastward from my balcony, and the light appeared to be maybe a couple of miles or so off the shore of Lake Michigan out over the water. I initially assumed this was a plane, but it was definitely stationary so I ruled that out.  Then I figured it must be Mars or Jupiter because the object had a reddish hue to it and was relatively low on the horizon, but after checking a star gazing app, I confirmed both Mars and Jupiter were in opposite skies from the object.   Next, I assumed a Chinese lantern, but this didn't seem likely from the start. The object was extremely bright and looked like a flickering flame. There were very strong wind gusts on the night of 10/17, so this object remaining stationary for an extended period rules out the lantern because it certainly would not have sat still given the strong winds.

The door was unlocked but shut but I opened the door & looked out side for a moment but didn't see anything. I closed the door & locked it & never told anyone about what I saw.

My report date of this incident is an approximation, as I cannot recall it precisely.  I had to be away this particular week-end to attend an aunt’s funeral.  When my husband joined me the day of the funeral, he told me that he was in the upstairs bathroom of our little, country house, the night before, when something outside the window caught his eye.  I believe it was a warm month (summer?) but am not positive. We lived very close to a large, provincial park as well as an army base.  We often saw and heard large planes flying overhead, mostly during the day, but sometimes at night.  They were heavy and very loud.  I mention these things in case it is relevant to the sighting. Terry said that when he went to the bathroom window to see what had passed, he saw the back end of a large, black object, which I believe he said it was a triangular shape.  He said it was flying just above the tree line that surrounded our 1 acre property.  It moved slowly, steadily and very silently.  There were lights across the back of the object, that lit up sequentially (if memory serves).  We lived beside a field of hydro-power lines/towers and he immediately thought that it was flying so low that he was sure it would hit them, but it didn’t.  He continued to watch as it moved over the hydro lines towards the provincial park, and lost sight of it eventually.  He assumed it may have been headed to the army base. This is all the information I can recall.  If you need more detail please reply and my husband may be able to add a bit more detail. I could not believe that he was the one to witness this and during a time when I happened to be away.  Best, ((name deleted)) Ontario, Canada ((AMENDMENT FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Here’s my husbands version of the UFO sighting.   *AMENDMENT TO ORIGINAL REPORT: UFO SIGHTING REPORT AMENDMENT: This is the recollection of the experiencer (husband) as he remembers it:  (Around Easter, 2001 probably the Tuesday after Easter Sunday) * I was standing in the upstairs bathroom one evening after dark. The window was partly open. For some reason, which I cannot recall, I looked out the window. There above me in the dark was a long horizontal array of circular lights like old headlights. The craft was not moving very fast and made no sound. It seemed to be very close to the roof of the house. Nearby in the direction it was flying was a row of fir trees about 60 feet high. I thought for sure that the craft would strike them and I waited. Nothing!. Then I thought that although it got by the trees somehow there are even taller hydro-electric towers in the direction of the flight path. Once again I waited for a crash but nothing. Then it was over. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2016-09-15T00:00:00,43.96751914893617,-80.03946382978724

We were laying on camping cots so we were focused on the same spot in the sky.  Looking about 15 degrees from directly overhead, facing west, over the lake.  I now know this shape to be the torso of pegasus. This was a multi-faceted event. First we saw a couple typical satellites pin-points moving in a straight line. (My thoughts, satellites)  Next we noticed heat lightning, but later both recognized it was more like subtle bands of white moving across the ecliptic east-west and became semi-regular.  15 to 20 minutes would pass.  Three stars began to move in perfect unison shape of a triangle – after 1-2 sec. the bottom most star got 3-5 times brighter before shrinking back to its original size, all the while keeping the shape of the triangle.  This group moved out of view. Next,the most perfect shooting star i have ever seen, traveling a distance i had not seen. Two rails of Gold sparkle streamers followed behind it. Next, faint lights appeared in the torso, tens at a times, all moving in random, like koi fish in a pond coming to the surface to eat. Then it got good. The sky seemed to turn blue-dark almost flourescent. All but one star faded out and it began to oscillate. I became extremely emotional – i could feel – not sure if i was being ""told"" – but i told my friend,""they are going to give us the show we wanted to see"". At that point, smaller white stars began to shoot about 1-2 degrees away from the oscillating star and loop back.  I started telling my friend ""it's like they are telling me i can go with them"", but i wasn't hearing voices. It was a feeling. I told my friend that they understood that he had a family and could not come.  I became very scared. I know in my head, there was a break away from this type of communication.  The star seemd to rise higher in the sky and i wept more.  My friend tried to comfort me telling me to take it in.  It was now the most beautiful feeling i had ever felt.  The sky began to ""woosh"" colors of what seemed like thick liquid clouds.  Purple, blue, black, gold, silver were swooshing at incredible speed. At one point it became calm again (though there was no noise associated with this even). We are laying there on our cots. I dont think there was a presence, but i was terrified to look around. First for fear that I would end the event, but i didnt think i could handle seeing an extra terrestrial. During this calm, i felt a blue glow coming from behind us, almost like what was making the sky this strange color. I remembered seeing this blue glow on my nose as i continued looking out over the lake. I told my friend "" i dont think we are on earth anymore"". Almost like that seen from contact when Jodi Foster meets the dad-form of the being. The sky picked back up, i wept more at the beauty. Then it stopped again. The sky went black, the stars came back…but the sun was also coming up now and within minutes we are in dusk. We both stood up and jumped for joy knowing we had seen a unique event. Looking out over the dock, we saw a plane but quickly realized no. It was a small cigar shaped craft, too far to make out detail. But obvious it had no wings and no tail and was such a shined piece of metal that it was almost white. It was at least a mile away laterally and a couple thousand feet up. It glided, silently toward our position but latterly away, like a fly by….we both got that ""hello, goodbye"" feeling. It made its right turn parallel to our position and kept going up until it was a star and then vanished. Afterward, trey and i both noticed a sort of electricity left the air. I made note of black floaters in my eye, so big that it was like news print letters – like globs of oil. He said he had the same thing. We sat down for a minute and knew the event was over. During this even i never told my friend what i saw. I only asked him what he saw. He was always able to describe precisely what i saw. We are both educators – so obviously , its not my first way to help my career to talk about UFO's. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We normally see quite a bit of air craft from J.B.L.M. But what we saw yesterday was definitely unusual. Flying at what seemed to be about the same altitude as a military helicopter might fly, we saw a craft that had 2 rows of parallel lights.  Each row had perhaps 4 or 5 lights.  The top row was at first a bright pink. Then changed to turquoise, then red.  The bottom row remained white. The brightness and size of the lights were all we saw.  There was no body of a vehicle visible. Though the lights were a bit odd, the speed of the vehicle and it's ability to change or reverse directions without slowing down, and it's silence were truly unusual. Sitting in our back yard facing west, the object flew at about a 45% angle from the horizon, flying north to south, back and forth, turning sharp angles and reversing directions without slowing down. This took place just south of the Thompson Place/Tanglewilde area of Lacey WA.  After flying north to south, back and forth for about 4 minutes + or – it disappeared behind the treeline to the north and was gone.

My grand daughter was in her upstairs bedroom around 9:00 pm.  She was looking out of the north window of which she looks out of every night.  Suddenly a disc object flew past the window about 1/2 mile in the night sky.   She was so startled she didn't take a picture, but screamed for me, her grandmother.  I ran in and saw the back of the object go by my bedroom window.  I ran outside, but only saw the object faintly through the trees.  I ran back inside and stood on my bed and watched it leave the area. We then ran down to the car and drove trying to catch up to it or at least get closer.  We live in the mountains and lost it as it went over the mountains to the North. There was no noise.  A plane and helicopter make a noise. Again, it was a disc, bright lights.  It was not an airplane or helicopter. Just about every night we see lights in the North.  Bright lights.  The object we see just sits still and smaller lights fly up to it and then disappears.  We've sat on the front porch with binoculars for a very long time watching this happen and just are in awe. It was a very weird day.  the sky was covered with chemtrails and they were still in the sky that night, which made it very eerie.

I picked it up and began walking toward the entrance of the business I manage.  I looked up and saw an object off to my forward right that seemed to be gliding silently in a soft arc over the North side of the building.  It remained in view from that point until it disappeared as a speck over the Atlantic Ocean.  After making the turn over the building it remained in a perfect straight path directly out over the ocean.  The sun had risen to the right of the direction in which the object flew. On first seeing it, I wondered what it was.  It was dark gray in color and appeared to be what I would describe as two offset discs connected in the middle somehow.  From the angle I was observing from, what appeared to me to be the bottom portion of the object was perfectly round and mainly flat, with the top portion mainly obscured except a small section that seemed to be projecting forward, in the direction the object was flying.  As it banked it appeared similar to the Nazi “SS” symbol.  It was as though the two discs were connected with some space in between. The object was small.  It may have been thirty six to forty eight inches across.  At first I thought it could be a balloon or something being carried on the wind, but there was absolutely no wind at all, and it was moving steadily at maybe fifteen or twenty miles per hour.  At no point did the speed deviate and at no point the elevation change.  It did not move from side to side at all.  Once it turned out toward the ocean it seemed to fly in a perfectly straight line until it was out of sight. As it banked I called out to an employee who was in the parking lot.  He was able to observe it as it flew away.  To him it was just a spec that flew silently and very straight.  I told him I was not freaking out but that I did not know what it was.  I told him that if it shoots off at an angle at Mach 6 I would freak out. It was not a bird or any earthly creature.  I got the sense that it was a drone, given its size.  After going to my office for a few minutes I went out to the beach to see if I could see anything.  On the extreme horizon I did see a shape that looked rectangular like a ship would at that distance.  I have no reason to believe there is a correlation between that ship and the object. If it was some sort of high tech military drone then they have developed technology to fly objects in complete silence. The weather was perfectly clear with few clouds in the sky and the sun low on the horizon to the east. I photographed it using my cell phone as it flew away.  I also tried to photograph the ship on the horizon.  I also sketched it from the two angles I saw it from.  I am not happy with the “SS” angle sketch but think it is as close as I can get to what I saw.  The double disk sketch is very accurate.

I observed 2 large, circular, bright, white lights in the evening sky tonight, after sunset and before any stars were shining.  I had been walking down the sidewalk for an hour, and was looking at the sky after I noticed some thin noctilucent clouds directly overhead.  The two white, circular lights caught my attention where there were no clouds, about 20 degrees above the horizon.  They were of equal size (I estimate 60 feet diameter) and equal brightness, about 3 fingers apart with my arm outstretched in front of my eyes.  That is way too far apart from each other to be aircraft landing lights from a single aircraft, at what seemed like a distance of about 3 miles, South-East of downtown. I watched the 2 lights closely for 4 seconds, and noted they seemed absolutely motionless.   Then, I looked down at my cell phone for 3 seconds, in order to start my camera application, and by the time I looked back up to take a photo, both lights had disappeared.  I continued walking home and watching that section of the sky for another half an hour, and they did not re-appear, neither did any stars.  During that following half an hour, any approaching aircraft would have already arrived and landed at the city airport, which was on the other side of me from the lights, and I would have easily seen any aircraft landing lights approaching and heard aircraft engines, because they would have had to pass over me to get to the airport.  Besides, aircraft do not approach the city airport from the South-East. I am a U.S. Navy Veteran Seaman of Deck Department, a trained look-out watch, having spent 3 years at sea, and experienced at identifying stars, planets, satellites, aircraft lights, etc.  There are never military fighter jets operating in this area, and only rarely are there lone military helicopters, and never flying in pairs.
