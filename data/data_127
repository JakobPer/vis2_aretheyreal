I was driving from Santa Fe to Albuquerque in the late morning, around noonish.  Driving on I-25, I looked out the side window of my car and noticed a white orb in the distance.  Over the next 10 minutes, it slowly approached the highway, with no signs of exhaust, wings, windows, or sound.  Eventually, it reached the highway directly about, probably about 500ft above my vehicle.  I noticed there was a hazy aura around the object and it was egg shaped.  Shortly after coasting above the highway, I noticed a military jet fly by in the distance, followed by a military helicopter that was heading straight for the UFO.  As I took my exit, I went around the ramp and proceeded to look back up in the sky.  I saw the helicopter above the highway, but the UFO was completely out of sight.

Thought it may have been really bright lights on a 4x4 at the top of the mountain. Then I saw it moving up in the air and this is when I got very curious. I went and setup my 50x spotting scope on a tripod and zoomed in on the light. This is when I started saying out loud “what the f$@! Is that!!!”  With my eye it just looked like 1 bright light. Through the spotting scope it was 2 concentric rings.  Both rings had a number of round lights/spheres. 6 to 8 equally spaced lights on the outer ring. 4 to 6 equally spaced lights on the inner ring.  All the lights appeared to be the same size. It appeared to be hovering just over the treetops moving around in the same general area. At times it would quickly squiggle up mayb! e 100 feet or more then squiggle down to where it was. After a couple of hours of hovering and moving around a bit, it seemed to have landed as it was now stationary and the light was filtered through the trees. Although there still seemed to be a little movement. My two buddies were all witness to this. We were all very perplexed as to what we were seeing. Watched this for a total of 6 hours.

The entire sky. I was driving to work this morning, and keep in mind, I take this way to the freeway almost every morning at the same exact time, and I’ve never seen anything like this.  Also, I live sort of in the country, there’s not a lot of activity around this time, and it remains relatively dark out.  So, as I was passing this small intersection thing, I looked down at my phone, and about a second after I looked up, there was this green light that illuminated the entire sky in that direction.  There was a lot of precipitation in the air, so it wasn’t as bright as it would have been without it.  I thought I was imagining it for a second, it looked like it shot from the ground up and when I say the entire sky was a mellow shade of green, I mean THE ENTIRE SKY was green.  And after about 3-4 seconds, maybe longer, the light shrank back down, and looking in my rear view, it didn’t happen again.   Normally, I’d brush something like this off, but about two years prior, in the same general area that I was driving past, I had been out for a walk.  I took a wrong turn down this trail (keep in mind, it was about 3 or 4 in the morning, I was walking thru the woods and I had my phone flashlight to help guide me a little bit), and about ten feet down this trail, I had woods on one side of me, and an open field on the other and in the field, I noticed (you know how when you shine a flashlight on an animals eyes they illuminate a shade of orange or red?) my flashlight illuminated two orangey eyeballs.  I knew it wasn’t a normal animal because it was TALL and it sent chills up my entire body.  And you know when you make accidental eye contact with someone or something, you feel it?  I felt it alright.   I backed away slowly until I got to the main trail and started sprinting home.  The point of backing up rather than immediately running away was to ensure that I wasn’t being followed.  Now, the thing that confirmed my eerie feelings, was once I hit the road, I looked up at the sky, saw a white flash of light slightly grow and then quickly shrink, disappearing completely.  It felt like something out of a movie.   Since then, I haven’t been on any more night walks.  I wish I had pictures because I feel absolutely insane trying to explain this with no physical evidence.  But as I experience things, my first thought is never to take a picture, it’s always either panic, or “WHAT IN GOD'S NAME WAS THAT THING?”",2019-06-07T00:00:00,42.7945,-88.3994

The area I live in is relatively rural, so on clear evenings like last night I usually stare at the stars while I smoke.  If the direction I was facing is 12 o'clock, then to my 1 o'clock I thought I saw a light (the size and brightness of a star) move 'next' to a relatively bright star.  I assumed it was my eyes playing tricks on me and adjusting to the dark.   Scanning that general area a few minutes later, I saw a single dot of light moving from right to left.  Roughly to my 12 o'clock. To clarify this was up in the sky, but 12 o'clock to where I was facing. The dot of light was the brightness of a medium brightness star.  Definitely not twinkling, and I was watching it intently for flashing (indicating an aircraft) and there was none.  There was also no noise whatsoever.  I served two years in the USAF and can confirm that if you can see an aircraft, you'll be able to hear it.  And I also know that if it were an aircraft that was far enough away that the running lights would appear that small, it would have been moving much much slower, to the eye of an observer on the ground, than this was. After maybe 15-20 seconds of watching this point move from right to left, it seemed to stop for half a breath, and started again just before disappearing completely.  The way you might expect something to ""zip"" away. Needless to say my heart went into my throat and I could feel my eyes go wide. I stood there scanning the sky where the light had been when I first saw it moving, where it disappeared, and further to the left to see if it was still there, for several minutes.  Trying to rationalize what I'd just seen. I probably could have shrugged it off as just being something weird, if it weren't for what followed . I can't say how long it was, definitely less than 10 minutes, that I heard air craft engines.  Looking up I saw running lights (red, green) so this was definitely an aircraft.  There were two of them, one coming from my six o'clock, and one my 12 o'clock.  Both appeared to move fast enough that I knew they were essentially directly above me, and from the distance of the lights that they were high up.  They passed each other in a 'two lanes of traffic' style.  There was also a third aircraft off to my two o'clock, some distance off. The two aircraft that passed each other traversed the roughly exact area (meaning the one coming towards me was coming from it, and the one coming from behind me was heading towards it) where the spot of light had been. Given the proximity (chart-wise) of where I am to the airport in Bangor (Bangor International Airport, BIA), seeing aircraft especially at that time of night isn't an anomaly.  But the flight paths are ALWAYS either to the left or 10 o'clock to where I was standing or to the right or 2 o'clockish to where I was standing.  Depending on whether they're departures or arrivals respectively. To the best of my memory and knowledge, aircraft never fly in a path directly over the house, one way or the other.  And especially not at the same time. I continued to scan the sky for another 10-15 minutes before I came back inside.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,44.5211,-68.8704

I really hope somebody else saw this object in the sky as this sighting kind of freaked me out.  Something that big moving through the sky has had a profound effect on me as this was most likely a once in a life time event.

It was a group of 4, including myself, driving back from the Davis Mountains in Fort Davis. We were driving back to Marfa and had the encounter during the stretch between Fort Davis and Marfa. Between this stretch there is the desert and the mountains in the back; we noticed the unidentified figure hovering over the desert and initially assumed it was a plane.  I was the one who noticed that it was in the same spot and didn’t seem to be moving. It initially looked like a dot in the sky (almost like a really dark and tiny cloud) and I asked everyone in the car if they could see the same thing. All of us agreed we saw it and then continued our conversation in the car. I looked again and this time it looked more circular and in the same spot, again, I asked and everyone saw the same figure. It then took on a cigar like shape and just hovered the whole duration of our drive and we all kept looking over to it at this point as it was still in the same spot (a bit closer now) and just seemed to linger over the desert. During this time we lost all reception and one of my friend’s phone said “something mysterious stopped Maps from searching this area” with a photo of a UFO. We also noticed two small planes that were flying overhead that looked like they were chasing each other, but were closer than usual.  When we returned to our campsite we couldn’t stop talking about what we saw and are still baffled by what we saw over the desert. We also noticed a slight change to how we felt (headache, eery feeling, paranoia).",2019-12-01T00:00:00,30.7587,-103.9249

When following each of these lights from one side to the other, there would then be a shooting star at a 45 degree angle outward that would happen.  This same thing happened 3 clear times.  There were other high flying US planes to compare speed, trajectory etc. as well.  Locater in the PNW, I was facing westerly centering myself with a bright star I later determined to be Zenith.  The more complex part is that while trying to telepathically communicate with this star, when showing emotion the object were responding to my feeble attemps at communication.  I dont drink or use drugs.  I was sober.  I absolutely believe we all should be looking up.  Not just for a moment or two.  But spend and hour go sit under the stars.  Let your eyes adjust. You CAN communicate with it all if you let it happen.  This is also the first of any such article I have ever written on this or any similar subject.

It went across the entire sky and when it was between 2 stars it stopped.  It held its position for 2-3 minutes.  During this time I was telling at my fiance that it stopped.

It was up high in the sky, a little to right of center and far away. (More details to come). It continued traveling to the west as I started walking to go check the mail (we live in a mobile home park where we can walk to our outdoor post office boxes), but I kept looking up at the sky and I kept seeing it until it was blocked by the mailboxes for about 8 seconds. I was a little afraid because I was alone with this experience. My heart was pounding and my breathing was rapid. My eyes were wide open for the next couple of hours after it was over. After it was out of sight, I went inside and immediately told my boyfriend about everything I’d just seen, then I wrote all of it down. Then I Googled “airplane lights” and “airplane light patterns” and none of them came even close to what I saw. Details: All the lights were the same color, very bright yellowish-white but mostly white, the size of airplane lights, I think they were all the same size, but the end-lights might’ve been a little larger. (This is the only detail I’m not sure of). In the 5 minutes or so that I stared at it, I observed that it was traveling from east to west, which for me, was from left to right, and judging from the distance away, it seemed as though it was moving at about the same speed as an airplane.  Steady movement, never stopping or changing direction. About the size of an airplane.  Pretty far away, couldn’t hear any sounds coming from it. Because there were so many lights coming from it, I could almost see a shape but not quite. The lights at either end were higher up than the lights in the middle section.  The lower, middle lights were not in a level straight line across, but in a right-side-up bowl shape. After watching it for a minute or so, the lights gradually turned off from right to left to the halfway point, they stopped for a second, then they continued to go off all the way to the end at a faster rate than the previous action except for the last light on the left, then that one went off separately, then immediately they all went on again one by one, but quickly this time, from left to right. The light “show” lasted for about 5 seconds. I hesitated to report this because I kept thinking that no one would believe my story.  This is why I haven’t reported it until now.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,37.705,-121.45771535947712

I wrote off what I’d seen as being a very high tech low flying blimp and redirected my thoughts. About five minutes later on the same car ride I saw a saucer shaped (much smaller) craft moving quickly overhead near McMillan and Heinz street in Dearborn Heights. (It appeared to be maybe half a mile from where I was viewing it). The lights, speed, and possibly shape were changing. It eventually stopped moving and hovered for a moment in place before lowering towards the ground at a ninety degree angle.  I pulled down the street to my destination, ran inside, and about twenty minutes later left again to go to the gas station. Upon leaving the gas station I saw the same very large cigar shaped craft I had initially witnessed now hovering above ford road near Golfview! . I took the car home and took the dog for a walk about ten minutes later to see if I could see anything else. In the same spot near McMillan and Heinz where I saw the small saucer shaped craft I now witnessed what appeared to be a white circular light appearing almost like a hole in the sky. It was very bright and emitting rays similar to a small moon moving overhead. Eventually the white orb appeared to change shape and now appeared as a horizontally moving craft with rgb lights blinking.

The moon was full or almost full and very breath taking with a few small scattered clouds around it so I thought about grabbing my telescope to get a closer look when suddenly I saw a blue-ish orb hovering  or even “dancing” around the moon.  It’s movement varied from hovering and slowly circling the moon to erratic movements like quick reversals and 90 degree turns at incredible speeds.  The orb, blue with what looked like some type of small white-ish circles on top had no trail or beam of light connected to it and it was very bright and visible despite the fullness and brightness of the moon.  I work w/ lasers moving heads and spotlights for a living so I knew it wasn’t either of those.  As the orb danced around the moon it moved under some static clouds yet didn’t extend it’s light to reflect onto the clouds.  So with no light t! rail leading from the ground up to the orb and no light reflection on the low lying clouds (that were in between the orb and the moon), I determined that it was self-luminous. And the orb’s brightness and color were not diminished when it moved around in closer visual proximity to the moon (yet still very far from the moon distance-wise), which again, was very, very bright. I took out my new iPhone XR and recorded some video of the incident which I’ve posted and shown other lighting professionals and they have no idea what it could be either.  I only recorded about 4 minutes of video but it’s quite compelling. Let me know if you’d like a copy. I’d love to have professionals look at it to help determine what it was.

I'd estimate they were in the shipping lanes so maybe at the minimum thirteen nautical miles off the coast. My first impression being they were a sort of SOS flares, but they didn't hang that long in the air.  Also, they appeared to ""jump"", disappear and reappear.  The light show lasted maybe two minutes at most. The main light appeared to be in a tight quadrant of four separate lights. Thursday, September 19th :  Then this from a friend last night, Thursday, September 19th, 2019:  Just a quick note…Mr. Clack, I was sitting in my bedroom at sunset, sun had already set on Thursday 09/19 and to my surprise I saw a very large set of lights over the ocean. My bedroom has a view of the ocean as my house sits on top of the hill in Del Monte Forest Pacific Grove over Spanish Bay. The lights were in a “ V “ shape very large and bright which were oddly & randomly blinking (not in sequence). As far as nautical miles I could not tell you as I am not too keen with this, but the lights were traveling down the shipping route south. I was able to see this through my very low powered set of binoculars, the lights were very, very bright. In awe of what I just saw I had to chuckle to myself as I remembered your story from the day prior. I had no intentions of looking for an object in the nights sky and this was the furthest thing from my mind. Thought it was funny that I saw a large object with oddly placed lights like you and your wife did a few days prior. Thought I would share, funny story. Do keep me updated if you two hear anything. Of which my wife and I saw the same:  Coincidently, I again saw the same thing at about 20:10 and I'm racking my brain to think what logically could make that lighting sequence.  I tried to rationalize it might have been a flight approaching MRY on a due Westerly course as the winds were blowing offshore. I'll check again at around 8pm tonight. Of which our friend replied:   Last night?...wow that’s about the same time I saw this object. It sounds like you saw the same sequence as well? It just disappeared as I was observing, likely flew into the marine layer. I have lived in my rental home and see flights approaching MRY day in and day out, I have never seen this sequence before in my whole life living here on the peninsula. I called my son who lives in Salinas last night, I think he believes I may be looney tunes!...lol!  Amazing!    I am sure we are not the only ones that could have possibly seen this. This object was way too massive for others not to notice right after sunset, crazy!!  Hopefully we feel validated by reports from others, possibly a report here or there on the local news or maybe the Herald?  Tonight I will definitely be observing the hour just after sunset with binoculars in hand!    Enjoy!

Sturgeon fishing around 2AM downriver from Swan Falls Dam/Power Plant.  It had been raining and was still partly cloudy.  So visibility was not excellent.  We noticed what we first believed was meteor debris.  However the light from it did not fade, fall, or separate the way meteors I have seen normally do.  The object appeared to be at high altitude and was a long oval tube shape without clearly defined edges.  We realized it was quite unusual when we noticed what at first glance seemed to be stars shining through actually were at least 5 bright white lights along the side of the proposed craft.  They were equal in size, shape, separation, color, and placement along the visible side much like the windows of a train or bus.  The whole object had somewhat of an undulating white color which we both agreed reminded us of translucent deep sea creatures.  While it was in view it was travelling North at a very normal pace.  We were able to see it move from clear sky, then behind a small cloud and back into clear sky and then disappearing completely behind thick cloud cover.  As we stood discussing what we had just seen the clouds past and it was gone and there were no stars even remotely in alignment to what we believed to have been lights. There was no noise, colors besides white, shape changing, separation, or any other defining things about it.  Airliners consistently flew overhead during the night which we were able to easily identify and hear.  I cannot judge the altitude other than above the clouds.  It appeared to be many times larger than the airliners that passed during the night but the fact that we could not judge the altitude I cannot say much about the size for certain.  We could not think of any rational explanation and were left dumbfounded and a little unsettled.  And we didn't catch a sturgeon. ((NUFORC Note:  SpaceLink satellites??  PD))",2019-06-07T00:00:00,,

I went out for a smoke and to see if there was more activity with flashing lights at 11:30.  Looking at the same area, between the big dipper and North star.  At 11:33 I saw what I though was a trail left by a big meteor, except I hadn't seen any meteor.  It was just below the two end stars on the dipper, pointing approximately North east.  I thought maybe it was a jet trail, but then it started breaking up, and there was no jet.  As it was dispersing it was growing longer, and turned into separate lights, all same brightness.  It probably stretched from the corner of the dipper to the North Star and began moving Northeast.  The lights were in a perfect straight line.  I believe in 3 lines, but not evenly.  They were fairly condensed for the first 3/4, but the last 1/4 they were more dispersed, in no pattern, except in 3 rows, about the width of a c! ouple of jet trails.  Total of about 50, not changing formation or direction or speed, which seemed about the same as a jetliner.  No channges all the way to the tree tops, no sound.

May 24, 2019, Appox. 12:30pm  1 Mile west of downtown Denver, Colorado, (32nd Ave & King Street)   	Today, May 24, 2019, about a mile due west of Denver Colorado.  It is a day with almost no clouds and bright sunshine.  I was standing outside talking with my neighbors when I noticed 6 objects to the NNE.  The objects were at a 50-60 degree angle from my location.  These objects were simply just there.  From my location they had the appearance of an object between a baseball and a golf ball.  Planes were passing over headed to the local airport, Denver International Airport that fly at approx. 12,000’, less than a mile above the ground, as they have just passed over 12-14,000’ foot mountains and begin decent for landing.  A private plane passed over at no more than 2000’ feet above so my guess is they were 3-4000’ above the ground. 	My first thought is that these were balloons that had been released, as today is the last day of school.  The objects would have been too large to be balloons and they stayed in the same relative altitude.  Next, I thought they might be birds as they were constantly changing formations.  The idea being they were trying to gain altitude.  They moved from V to diamond to non-formation and back in a constant shifting of their position relative to each other. 	This was not birds or balloons.  First, their size would have been too big for a bird and while I thought I saw a wing, given the size of a bird and distance it was away a wing would not be possible to see.  Even White Trumpeter Swans would be smaller, they are exceedingly rare in this part of the US and don’t fly in the manner that I witnessed.  They also reflected light of a white translucent color with a hint of rainbow sheen leaning heavier towards the red spectrum.  Birds don’t reflect light, which is why my mind first turned to balloons, but again the size was too large.  They had to be rather large in size . They appeared to be flying in an erratic behavior at first glance, much like balloons, but it soon became apparent these were flying in a controlled manner and altering between multiple formations. I was with two neighbors who took no interest, and I’m not sure if they could see them.  I was wearing sunglasses and when I removed my glasses, I was unable to see the objects. They were not wearing any sunglasses (and chuckled at my reference to the objects being extraordinary).  My I-Phone was unable to pick up anything either.  The objects were clearly reflecting light which changed as they moved, giving the impression they were possibly spinning.  The reflecting was not bright enough to overcome the sun’s glare without sunglasses. This went on for about 10 minutes.  I turned my eyes away for a moment and when looked back they were simply gone.  I waited about 30-45 minutes to gather my thoughts and then began this reporting process.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

I saw what appeared to be one unit out ahead of the others, with a space between them and then what can only be described as a SEQUENCE of these identical lights light up one after the other.  They also appeared to be hovering.  these objects were angled at a slight angle which to me seemed like a nose up pitch in the section that had the 5 triangular shaped lights.  the tree tops got in the way and then, they were just gone.  My son saw something similar last night where Lester River rd t's into Roberg Rd in Lakewood. Just fields there.  Here is the coordinance of these UFOs; 46.913296 by 91.975568. If you'd like to speak with us during your show feel free to call us.  I called 911 as soon as i got into my driveway, explained what we saw, and dispatch told me someone would call me back shortly.  about 3 minutes passed and local Sheriff called me back.  I was telling him what we saw and two military jets flew directly over our house heading towards the area we reported, a minute later, a third jet.  I still don't know what to make of this.

My friend, who first witnessed the object at least a month ago, owns a home in this location, and has been taking videos of it at random intervals, when he feels that a good shot is possible, I suppose.  During a visit to his home over the weekend, he brought it to my attention, and I was quite surprised by the apparent closeness and energetic activity of the lights.  Really, I don’t know how I missed it before he pointed it out, because it was so strikingly obvious.  After some thought, I realized that I am indeed familiar with Sirius, and that there is also a star called Betelgeuse (?), or the “Witch Star” that flashes blue, red, and white, and which is incredibly visible in the winter from my home in Boone, NC.  I had actually first wondered if that was what my friend had seen, because it is quite unusual for a star, but when I went there in! person, I was surprised to see something entirely different. I can’t be certain, but I believe that I’ve seen this same thing over the past 10 years, in places from Canton, NC to Boulder CO, and this is the closest and most active that it’s ever been.  Per our conversation- I know what you mean with staring at lights and the phenomena of perceived movement...I’ve spent more than one long night with infrared cameras, and used binoculars at all hours,  truth be told, although I can’t honestly attribute that specifically to either curiosity or paranoia, perhaps a bit of both. I do enjoy looking at the sky, and have found the greatest volume of peculiar activity to have occurred in the area of Johnson Co. TN, in particular over Watauga Lake. I’ve seen many things similar to this lighted object, but didn’t think to capture most at the time, unfortunately.  Anyhow, I’m sure that you’re probably gnashing your teeth in consternation at having been rustled from your bed by a crazy girl, and one who promised a file in short order, so I’ll get to sending that posthaste. Thank you for your time and patience, with what could very likely be a perfectly explicable bunch of nothing...but hopefully not! Oh, and I must admit that I cheated and typed directly in the box- that doesn’t disqualify me, does it?",2019-12-01T00:00:00,36.3243,-81.931

Reported seeing “dancing blinking lights”  -	Driving in on highway 10 toward the Phoenix area, coming from California.  Within 10-15 minutes of passing the Arizona state line, I noticed some strange light (kind of star-like) activity going on in my peripheral vision, left side.  I would glance to the left and the dancing stars I noticed would stop moving.  They would begin again, kind of blinking on and off and jumping positions, and as soon as I turned toward them they stopped and disappeared.  This went on for a while and then I finally told my wife what was happening. -	The ‘stars’ then began moving in front of our vision, the road was still an open two-lane canvas, nestled against the very dark sky. -	Over the next hour or so, perhaps longer, we witnessed different star-looking objects maneuvering in all sorts of different ways.  Would blink and travel in the sky, then jump to another space in the vicinity, then back again, then ‘jump’ forward.  Appeared to defy the laws of physics for normal physical objects; they did not appear to be helicopters, planes, satellites or drones (throughout, we did see objects that appeared to be those things and judged them against these ‘dancing’ lights). -	These things would blink and move, sometimes very quickly through the sky, stop, and then disappear.  When we saw this, we both quietly gasped. -	Wife a streak of light, almost tube-like, on the passenger side. Once she thought she saw a more translucent light, but then we realized it was just the headlight reflection cast along the side of road as we drove through.  Wife described it almost like lighting in that the thick tube appeared to have “jagged” lines beaming outward from both sides of the tube.  Wife gasped at this point; before then she was somewhat incredulous at what was occurring. -	We would see objects, again, star-like objects, blinking and twinkling, traveling, sometimes in pairs, sometimes in clusters of three or more, moving through the sky, moving apart, then disappearing.  Most of the time they looked like stars. -	There was a charged energy of magic in the air. Palpable. -	We saw an object directly in front of us, a larger star-like/teardrop object, and appearing to be closer to the earth, descending slowing as we travelled through the dark highway.  It reached a certain point, then disappeared. -	There was a playful quality to these appearances. -	We asked ourselves, again and again, “is this really happening?”  We answered ourselves, multiple times, with, “yes.”",2019-10-04T00:00:00,,

Extremely high above us coming from a South Easterly direction were two orange/white lights traveling relatively slow, in tandem, headed in a Westward direction.  After watching them for about 20 to 30 seconds, they merged together then shot straight out over the ocean at an impossible speed.  The light  abruptly stopped then split back into two separate lights before shooting into opposite directions, one going north, and the other going south at the same impossible speed.  Thinking the event was over we both looked at each other and said, “What the hell did we just see?”   Seconds after reciting that sentence, I caught something out of my right side peripheral view, like a white see-through blur.  And the reason I marked three objects, is because now I was pointing out (to our right, north of us) a slow moving, silent triangle shape with three lights  (one on each tip) that now seemed to be about 700 to 1,000 feet from us.  Visually, it looked completely different from the first two lights, but due to the blur that caught my eye, I believe we were still in the mist of the original event only now it was much, much closer.   The only way to describe the movement of the triangle is that it looked to be slowly tumbling or rolling in the sky.  This lasted only seconds before it disappeared behind part of the resort building and was much lower in the sky. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to; Peter Davenport.

My adult-aged daughter and I were driving on I-295 North toward Yardley, PA, and shortly after passing the Scotch Road exit #65A, we started to see a really bright light in the sky ahead of us.  It caught our attention because the light was low, really bright and large, as if it were the moon; however, it was too low, too bright, too cloudy and late to be the moon.  Also, it was staying fixated in one spot—it didn’t seem to move or change in size as we got closer to it.  It was also NOT an airplane because it was approaching from the opposite direction of planes seen landing in this area at Trenton-Mercer Airport.  I was able to get two images as I was driving and you are able to see an incoming airplane to the left of this other object--the airplane lights are super small in comparison to the unidentified light—and the lights of the airplane were getting bigger and clearer as we drove closer, unlike the other bright light.

It was hovering about 10-20 feet over the tree line directly over the bank of the Delaware River in Yardley, PA.  It first reminded me of a drone about the size of a house but as we got closer, we saw that it was a solid silver colored pentagon shape.  There was a small red line on one side and a small orange light on the other and then there were 3 or 4 super bright white lights under the object.  It looked like a door was open on the side and white lights were lighting the inside.  I saw steps coming down, but my daughter did not.  She saw remembers something sticking up and out of the back end that looked like tail wing.   We got off at the next exit and turned around to see it, but it was gone.",2019-06-07T00:00:00,,

You could see cars go by barely.   Anyway, out of the corner of my eye while looking up, I saw what looked like campers had set up a string of lights.  We then realized we’ll thats the road and it was actually near the treeeline over Mt. Osceola.   As myself and two friends processed this we realize the string of lights were moving fast and in a straight line very close to each other.  They looked just like the stars, pure white but moving ina straight line.  Non pulsing and non color. I ran up the embankment to catch the tail end of the formation before it went out of view, behind the mountains to catch a better view.  There were at least 30-50 pure white lights, straight line.  At the end was one smaller pulsating color object that slightly bounced around like a nat.  Think Orion’s Belt stars filled in like a hiking trail .......... straight line,same color, same size.  Later saw a plane fly by and did not compare one bit to previous objects.  I grew up next to Logan, was a military soldier in Hawaii, I’ve been near airports all my life.

I was driving to the Independence High School at 10th and Oak st for an event.  As I approached the school via Oak Street, I noticed lights in the sky to the west.  At first I thought they were meteors.  My husband and 14 year old son also saw them.  My husband remarked that it looked like something was falling through the atmosphere, but as we watched, it appeared as though the lihts were chasing each other. There were four of them, but only three were lit at a time.  They lit from south to north in the sky and as one dimmed another took its place.  We watched them as we pulled into 10th street and then into the school parking lot.  By this time, the lights had moved a great distance across the sky and were then northwest of the city instead of due west. It occurred to me that I could take a picture of them, but by the time I got my phone out of my pocket, they were gone.  My husband said he thought they looked like military flares but that they disappeared too soon, as in they were gone in a matter of seconds.

It was massive. Had some sort of black unknown text writing and possibly had people below. My girlfriend and I observed from our patio overlooking (with binoculars) and have pictures to support. It had a red blinking light on the bottom and looked very strange.  We've lived here for over 3 years and have never seem anything like it. Our view is of the entire east bay and we can see the Oakland airport on a clear day. However, this stood out.  To start, we've never seen anything like such described. It was huge and from first glance all white. It was easy to dismiss as a normal blimp but in retrospect we've had a change of thought.  Like I stated, we've never seen anything like that before. It stood out. And the next day I remembered how strange it was to observe. So I googled every type of search that would pull it up. Found NOTHING. I mean NOTHING. I find it incredibly hard to believe that everyone in SF didn't comment on it and also take pics. If it was just another blimp why would it not be mentioned online somewhere.  Which leads me here. I can't find a single picture online of this.  I believe it was probably an emergency landing and not intended to be seen. It might have been some sort of military craft. Hard to say. Like I stated, it was easy to pass off as a normal blimp. And sadly, we didn't watch longer to see how it landed. I tried to film it but from our distance it only look like a large white spot. The picture are better. But what we saw in the binoculars is the most compelling. The writing was not legible. It looked like symbols. And it was far from what you would think was a promotional blimp.  If was a normal blimp, we would've seen it before. And the black out of it online makes me believe we weren't supposed to see it.  I think it could be a weather modification blimp that malfunctioned and needed to make an emergency landing. Hope you can provide more insight.  I'm not sure how to send the picture but will if your interested.   Thanks for being here. Hope your not the MIB haha",2019-12-01T00:00:00,37.76999211048627,-122.42539404565002

On July 29th, 2019, a friend and I were sitting on a blanket on the lawn of a B & B in the little town of Powell River, British Columbia.  The B & B is a block from Marine Avenue, which runs along the sea coast.  My friend since high school is a web designer and entrepreneur; I am a working musician.  We are both 51 years old.  The previous night had been clear and the stars bright, and I had witnessed a spectacular shooting star.  I was hoping for a repeat, but we were disappointed by the intermittent cloud cover and slight haziness in the air on this night.  The clouds were drifting very slowly to the East.  There was no moon and the night was still and silent. Some time between 1:10 am and 1:13 am--now the morning of the 30th--my friend nudged my shoulder, and directed my attention to the sky. Clearing the treetops, a strange light formation glided silently into view, traveling in a straight line from East to West, towards the ocean and directly over our heads.  I felt there was no time to fiddle with my phone--and I doubted it would capture the object anyway -- so I left it where it lay and leapt to my feet to better view the formation. The formation was shaped like a boomerang bent at about a 150 degree angle, with its elbow pointed in the direction of travel.  It consisted of between five and ten white lights (unfortunately, neither one of us counted the number).  The glow of the lights had a gentle, self-contained quality that reminded me of bio-luminescence.  They were not as bright as aircraft lights or stars, and were larger--more like orbs than pin-pricks.  The rigidity of the formation suggested a structure behind it, but I could not see any fuselage or wings. My friend does not need corrective lenses for distance, and so may have been able to perceive a bit more detail than I.  She said afterwards that she thought the lights were slightly oval.  She had been reminded of balloons trailing strings, and then she had thought of jelly fish.  I did not perceive these ""strings"", however, as I focused on an individual light, I clearly saw it slide, with a slight arc, a few degrees out ahead of the other, then slide back into it's original position.  I say ""slide"", because the motion did not seem aerodynamic or bird-like, nor wobbly and wind-blown, but rather fluid -- even fish-like.  My friend mentioned a ""pulsing"" of the lights, and I suspect this was her perception of the motion I was seeing. The following point may sound contradictory, but I want to be clear: while I saw this light move relative to the other, the entire formation as a whole was rigid.  If the lights were beads on a string, the string neither lengthened, nor shortened.  The angle of the ""boomerang"" did not change; the two halves of the ""boomerang"" did not flex or wobble.  It did not veer, sway, or stretch out and reform such as a formation of birds will do (I've seen countless Canadian geese formations flying over my home in BC, and this was not that). It was not a string of Mylar balloons drifting on a breeze:  it was traveling too fast and straight, in a direction opposite to that of the slowly moving clouds, and in a manner that was -- as my friend insisted I mention -- ""intentional"".  I completely agree with her on this point. The formation/object? crossed the the visible sky--an opening in the trees of perhaps 130 feet across--in about 15 seconds.  My impression was not one of extreme speed, but something like that of an aircraft.  It was well below the clouds, and given that I could discern the lights as orbs as opposed to pin-pricks, and also discern movement of the lights, I feel I was seeing it relatively close-up.  Our hands outstretched above our heads and held 18 to 24 inches apart, would have framed it.  I estimate it was perhaps 60 feet across, and not more than a few hundred feet above us.  It's possible it was a larger object farther away, but these are my impressions.  It was absolutely silent the whole time.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,50.0163,-124.3226

My bedroom has a view of the ocean as my house sits on top of the hill in Del Monte Forest Pacific Grove over Spanish Bay. The lights were in a “ V “ shape very large and bright which were oddly & randomly blinking (not in sequence). As far as nautical miles I could not tell you as I am not too keen with this, but the lights were traveling down the shipping route south. I was able to see this through my very low powered set of binoculars, the lights were very, very bright. In awe of what I just saw I had to chuckle to myself as I remembered your story from the day prior. I had no intentions of looking for an object in the nights sky and this was the furthest thing from my mind. Thought it was funny that I saw a large object with oddly placed lights like you and your wife did a few days prior. Thought I would share, funny story. Do keep me updated if you two hear anything. Of which my wife and I saw the same:  Coincidently, I again saw the same thing at about 20:10 and I'm racking my brain to think what logically could make that lighting sequence.  I tried to rationalize it might have been a flight approaching MRY on a due Westerly course as the winds were blowing offshore. I'll check again at around 8pm tonight. Of which our friend replied:   Last night?...wow that’s about the same time I saw this object. It sounds like you saw the same sequence as well? It just disappeared as I was observing, likely flew into the marine layer. I have lived in my rental home and see flights approaching MRY day in and day out, I have never seen this sequence before in my whole life living here on the peninsula. I called my son who lives in Salinas last night, I think he believes I may be looney tunes!...lol!  Amazing!  I am sure we are not the only ones that could have possibly seen this. This object was way too massive for others not to notice right after sunset, crazy!!  Hopefully we feel validated by reports from others, possibly a report here or there on the local news or maybe the Herald?  Tonight I will definitely be observing the hour just after sunset with binoculars in hand!  Enjoy!",2019-10-04T00:00:00,36.50200208333333,-121.84906041666666

First, we saw something that I initially thought was a satellite, but it seemed much closer/bigger than a satellite should be and was definitely much brighter. My husband said it was shaped like a crescent. It seemed to move pretty quickly from south to north, then curved east and faded a few minutes later. Unfortunately, my phone was acting up all night and I wasn’t able to capture it. It was very bright, like I said, but I couldn’t tell if it was just a reflection from the sun, or if it was lit up on its own. There were no flashing, or blinking lights on it and there was no sound. About 15-20 minutes later, I noticed something else. Three to six consecutive points of light moving from north to south, but unlike an airplane, they had bursts of strobing lights (as opposed to blinking steadily) and as they moved, seemed to bounce all over the place rather than following a linear progression. I did manage to record some of it. And, oddly enough, about 10-15 minutes after that, I caught a brief glimpse of a “fireball” in the east over our house. Probably a comet, or meteor, but I cannot be sure because it only lasted a split second. I watched the planes fly overhead the rest of the night just to be sure that wasn’t what I saw. None of them came anywhere close to what I’d seen earlier. The other strange thing about this was that those things moved very quickly from north to south. If they were planes, there was no way they could have moved that fast without it being obvious that they were planes. These were tiny points of light that jumped around forwards and back, up and down, seeming to appear and disappear at different points in the sky. I’ve been checking the internet all day, but I haven’t found any similar reports in our area yet. I honestly don’t know what this was. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It definitely wasn’t fireworks either because they didn’t make any sound and I’ve never seen fireworks move like that. I thought maybe they could be drones, or something, but last I checked, drones don’t just pop in and out of sight. There were no discernible shapes, or distinct ""objects"" that I could make out.  Just the lights and it almost seemed like they were responding to each other, but I could be totally wrong about that.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,42.39550474777448,-83.37302848664687

The sky was clear and I could see many stars.  I noticed multiple (3-8) balls of light streaking across the sky from the southeast direction.  The lights were sometimes coming forward, backward, left, right, randomly over the sky, even over our house.  At times they would stop in the air for a few seconds and then start moving again.  They were moving very quickly, faster than anything I have ever seen in the sky.  I’ve never seen anything like this before.  I went inside and woke my daughter and we watched the sky from a large window together.  Once inside, there were 3-4 times when in addition to the streaking balls of light, we saw the skyline, just above the tops of the trees, light up very brightly in multiple colors, mostly pink and white. After at least 10 minutes from coming inside, I woke my husband too.   He also saw the balls of light moving randomly across the sky.  Shortly after, from the skyline emerged a large oval object, like a glowing white light much larger than the streaking lights.  This object hovered in the skyline and didn’t move.  Then the object disappeared and re-appeared.  The balls of light stopped streaking and it all suddenly disappeared.  We waited for at least 10 more minutes and nothing reappeared.

We learned last night from a neighbor that there was an Elements Festival - a Music & Art Event in our area which included a light show all weekend. It must have been the lights from the show we saw with the flashes at time.  It was at 11:30 p.m. so it seemed very unusual to us.  As I said in the original post, I have never seen anything like this before in the night sky.  Please remove our original post Saturday, May 25, 2019 at 09:16:11.  We now know what it was and doesn't appear to be anything unusual.  Thank you. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Sky was clear, according to the witness, at the time of the sighting.

I saw two strange lights in the sky up ahead. They were higher than the tree line, but lower than where I usually see planes or helicopters in the sky. There were two lights situated next to each other, one was red and the other was green – I believe the red was on the right (my right) and the green on the left, but I cannot be exactly certain. The lights would blink in an alternating pattern, and when the lights would blink they were white. I notice that they weren’t moving. As I approached, they still were not moving – they just appeared to be hovering there. I continued to watch the lights as I got closer, and they did not move. I was able to pass under it – not immediately underneath as it was more to the left of me and would have been more over the left lane of traffic and not the right lane – but I was able to look out of my driver’s window and up to see underneath it. It was in the shape of a triangle, and there was another light at the back point of the triangle that was white and blinking. It was not moving at all as far as I could tell and appeared to just be hovering. As I passed it, I was near a curve, so I couldn’t continue to watch it and it was some distance before it became visible in my sideview mirror. When I was able to view it in my sideview and rearview mirror, it appeared as just one blinking white light. It was by far the strangest thing I have ever seen in the sky! In total, about 2 minutes elapsed from the time I first noticed the lights and the time when I passed it. I have a dash cam, but it did not capture the lights in the sky on my footage. I did dictate what I was seeing as soon as I realized the lights weren’t moving, so that can be heard on the footage.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,29.9845,-92.3224

We had intentions of getting to a lookout point in the higher elevations of the Carson to look at the full moon, hence the road and surrounding landscape was pretty well lit.  As I was the passenger it was my job to keep an eye out for Elk or Deer, so my eyes were focused towards the shoulder on the right.  At 10:09 PM MST she leans forward and looks up and to the left and says ""did you see that?"" after which I also lean forward and look up and left to see a low plane no higher than 200 feet flying over the road in a northern direction. She says she didn't even notice the plane, she looked up because something cast a shadow on the road ahead of us and she thought it must have been a giant bird or something.  While I'm still watching the plane fly North, she tells me there was a dark pointed shape she couldn't really describe beyond that flying North and by the time I looked up the plane came into view on the same flightpath. Based on where the moon was and how much time passed between her catching my attention and my looking up, I can only assume she actually saw something up there. We were nearly directly underneath the plane by the time our paths crossed, so for the 3 full seconds or so before the plane showed up, she was focused on whatever it was the plane was apparently chasing.  I will be sending a marked map to show a more precise location. The plane itself wasn't remarkable other than being pretty low for how close some higher elevation to the East was.

As I first came to the stop sign, I noticed an extremely bright metallic looking sphere in the sky that flew across at speeds much faster than the speed of any aircraft or missile that I have ever seen or heard of.  Its height was around 2,000 to 4,000 feet above ground and from checking 2k quality surveillance footage of our property camera that faced to the West.  I determined that the object did not come from behind me and perhaps from above me.  It flew to the East which was the direction I was facing at that high speed and then after nearing the 15 freeway a few miles out it began to dive at a forty-five degree angle at half of its previous speed until it was a thousand feet or less above ground and it nearly came to a full stop just outside of our view in which a large building was in the way of our line of sight.  As we drove past the building to get a better view, it flew away travelling at its top speed in the South-East direction.  The object was by far the brightest object in the sky shining a white/grey absolute metallic looking shine as if it was reflecting the sun.  At that time of day, the sun has just set behind the nearby mountains and was hardly visible at all.  The sky was mostly clear and there was still near full daylight outside.  As the IT tech for the large facility in which I work at here, I went back and searched all of the surveillance footage from dozens of high definition cameras, but sadly all except for one camera was aimed high enough to view at the sky which was the North-West facing camera which is the one I used to see if the object came from behind my location.  My roommate who was a Marine and I have never seen anything like that object online or from any other media source.  I can only wish that one of our cameras had caught that occurrence, the object was so vivid an! d pronounced that it would have spoken for itself on video as it was the brightest object I have ever seen in the sky other than the sun itself.  What is also interesting is that this occurred one day after the night a double meteor storm (Southern delta Aquariids/alpha Capricornids) was to be the most active.  This object did not act in any manner of a meteor, it was very low flying, greatly reduced speed, was visible for a large number of seconds and was undeniably metallic.",2019-08-23T00:00:00,34.520175916230365,-117.3407392670157

I had brushed it off in the beginning and then she said, “No really what is that?”  I lift my head to see one bright orange light over our junk pile about 100 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground that’s when I decide to stand up to get a better look.  After I get to my feet I see about 5 burning orange light in a diagonal formation. Right away, I knew what it was. This wasn’t the first time that I seen one around the area.  On the way home from a family event me and 5 others saw the same similar orange circular lights.  At first it was hard to see but then it sent a large beam of orange light onto the field lighting the whole five acres and revealing the the bulging hole and the rest of the aircraft.  The light lasted 5 seconds and we were so shaken up we pulled over in a nearby business and got out to look to see were it had went.  We were surprised to see a extremely long rectangular shape that was thin at the end and thicker in the middle with lights every 50 feet.  This thing was over 500 feet long. Following this large shape were 30 smaller lights formation flying and they would shift places every now and again.  That experience had lasted over two minutes before two planes with navigation lights went moving at a high rate speed towards the moving lights.  That was the first time we had heard any noise of a plane.  After that slowly all of the lights blinked out and were only left with the two pairs of navigation lights which seem like they were in pursuit. With that experience in mind I tell my sister that I believe we were looking at a UFO.  As soon as I say this either the craft turned on more lights or changed direction and there are twenty on these ominous orange lights at a forty five degree angle slowly moving up.  In shock my eyes could not move off the craft.  There was a slight height change before one by one the lights disappeared and there was no further evidence of anything being there.

It was approximately 10:30 PM Eastern time on 7/30/2019, when I pointed out to my wife that were some points of orange light appearing and then disappearing out over the ocean.  Note: at Folly Beach we are facing south as opposed to east on most of the east coast of the USA.  We assumed those were airliners although the color was very different than anything I have seen in the past, however that could be explained by cloud cover or any number of things.   My wife went inside and my son and I were talking, when I suddenly shouted out what the heck is that?  He turned around and saw the tail end of what I was seeing, but what I had seen was a series of orange dots in pairs descending towards the ocean from our vantage point at a 45° angle from the South by South East sky.  We talked about it for a minut! e and just decided that we didn’t know what it was.  My wife came back outside, we told her what we had seen, and kind of laughed it off.   After a few minutes, though, all three of us saw another series of pairs of orange lights progressing south to north in front of us.  Our son also saw another series of lights coming west to east, although considerably south of us.  My wife and I were aware of those other lights but we were focused on the ones directly in front of us, straight to the south. These were very straight line events, there were no orange shapes fluttering around in the air. They came as two dots, Then within a second two more dots,  And then again and again until there were four sets of dots on two parallel lines pointing roughly in our direction.  Then they were gone, quickly disappearing.  The lights off to the east also behaved in the same fashion and disappeared almost in the same second. OK, I am an engineer, my wife is an artist, and my son-in-law is an IT specialist.  We don’t actually see the world in the same way, but we saw this exactly the same.  And none of the three of us can explain what we saw.  My wife and I lived under a flight pattern for midway airport in Chicago, and sitting out at night we used to see airliners flying over all the time.

An hour later we are still sitting out here, unable to go to bed, because we cannot begin to understand what we saw.  I suppose we will sit out here most of the night waiting for something more to show, and nothing will come.

I looked out my window in Brooklyn, NY, and saw a very clear trail of exhaust in the sky.  Out of curiosity I stood by the window observing and marking the time down. I happen to live in an area where airplanes regularly fly on a few set routes and I have gotten to know their pace/speed and general flight paths (severe weather permitting). There are also frequently helicopters flying slightly lower in the sky than the planes. The craft leaving behind a clear and consistent trail was moving at a remarkable speed . I almost felt as if I'd miss the entire event altogether. The craft showed a clear and low starting point and moved upwards into the sky and then proceeded to stay level at a certain altitude but moved rapidly from West to East.  When it reached a certain area which I believe was over Queens, the trail abruptly stopped and the silver object leading it vanished. I continued to watch for its reappearance but it did not resurface. At this point I then saw another identical object do the exact same thing from the exact same starting point. This happened a total of 3 times with completely identical stories. The entire time was about 30 minutes but the individual flight for each was under a minute and the craft must have traveled miles during this time. The trails left behind were still strong and did not disappear or fade at all for at least an hour. As I mentioned earlier, I am also near airplane flight paths and the difference in speed between the two was too great to ignore. I also observed several, at least 3, black helicopters which seemed to be monitoring and following this event. One more craft started from the same point, this is a 4th, and was the same color and size and shape but instead of going West to East, it traveled upwards (North). The details are identical to the above statement but it happened about 30 minutes after I observed the first three which occurred pretty much one after the other every 10 minutes. I did not see any lights, I did not hear any noises or witness anything aside from what I have listed above.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

Specifically, from the moment the lights were noticed to when they faded from view, the range of vision was about 298-degrees NW to 11-degrees N as the breadth of observation.

They were faint to the eye but strongly visible seen through Military Grade Gen-3 Night Vision goggles. They were white lights. The number of them traveling in a line together was outstanding!  Some seemed brighter and bigger than others in the line.  It was not a perfectly straight line but fairly straight, as some were higher, while others were lower, but overall it was a line of them.  Some were bunched together in clusters with gaps between other small groupings either ahead.  Then many seemed to follow one after another individually.  The lights were all white.  They were solid white lights, not flashing, though some lights seemed to merge into other lights or simply fade out and pop in at a different spot as if appearing from nowhere, but all traveling in northern trajectory together heading from the perspective when they were first noticed. As they traveled farther away the brightness of their lights faded from view. From the moment when they were noticed to when they faded out from view was perhaps 3 to 5 minutes. While I tried to record them on my iPhone 10, they were too faint for the camera to see them. I then tried to place the phone lens to the Night Vision goggles but getting the lens in the right place and then guessing the direction of view from the lens without having my eyes to it made for unfocussed and shaky video footage that did not reveal anything that I could make out, compared to when my eyes were to the lens.

The first time was in October and I swear I almost got abducted. But the one I’m reporting now is from two days ago.  I am of sound mind and completely sober at the time of these events. I am 21 and have been living at this address for just over a year. I was sitting on my couch minding my own business on Youtube at 5am 2 days ago, when I noticed a strange, red flashing light above a neighboring building from the corner of my eye coming from my window to my right side. I disregarded it as a warning for helicopters and planes flying low. However, a couple minutes later I noticed another red flashing light right next to it.  That caused me to get up and look out my window. To my amazement, I saw 6 red lights stuck in the air like light bulbs all flashing in a syncopated manner. There might have been more but I only noticed 6. Five of them were in a line across the ! sky and 1 was above them.  These crafts were 100% not helicopters, planes, or any other flying craft that I am aware of. They stayed stationary in the sky for close to an hour before all dispersing one by one in different directions slowly.  I captured them on video. I snapchatted them to all my friends and no one could explain what they were. They alternated flashing from white to red. However the red light that they illuminated was unable to be captured on my phone. Only the white light that they made was.  And I can't explain how but I'm pretty sure they knew that I was watching them because every single time I left the window after being bored from watching them (because they were literally just boring flashing lights in the sky) and then returned to my window, there would be one flying away.  This all occurred before sunrise early Thursday morning and I saw the last two fly away right before the sunrise.  I have video evidence and I will email it to you.  In the video ! I am filming the crafts from my fire escape on the third floor! of my a partment building.   While we are on the topic of aliens I do want to talk about my encounter in October as well because that was WAY scarier.  This was just one craft and it came directly to my backyard and I was standing feet away from it. I noticed it the same way I noticed these red flying crafts; out of the corner of my eye while I was sitting on my couch. Except this time it was October 15th and 9pm. I heard a fleet of helicopters flying around my house for about an hour. I thought that this was very suspicious but I didn't think much of it. Then, out of my window from the corner of my eye, I noticed what appeared to be a helicopter fly down into my backyard. I ran right to my window because I was like, “What is a helicopter doing flying down into my backyard in brooklyn?”.  When I approached the window I did NOT see a helicopter. I saw a pyramid shaped craft directly in front of my fire escape. Im talking like feet in front of it.  I was absolutely petrified. It was a translucent craft ab! out the size of a small helicopter (think buzzard helicopter in GTA 5 for scale). It spun around in the craziest way possible.  It didn't spin on any particular axis it just spun in every direction imaginable. Maybe it was changing shape, I don’t know. It made a loud droning humming noise similar to a heater which could be heard in addition to the fleet of helicopters (yet I did not see any helicopters anywhere i just heard the fleet of them in addition to the droning of this crazy craft.)  This triangular craft also had the ability to be completely invisible phasing in and out of reality at will.  Most of the time it was translucent but it would switch from being translucent to invisible. Then at one point, it was completely present. When I saw it, the colors of it were almost unearthly. The triangle was this weird whitish/silverish color and this bright red light illuminated from the center of it. But it wasn't red. It was like a billion different reds and oranges at once! .  My primitive guess on the situation was that it was trying ! to signa l to me by showing me light frequencies that are visible to the human eye.  I had a thought to get closer to it and get on my fire escape, but after lifting the window, I was entirely too scared to go through with it. I didnt even lift the screen before slamming the window shut for protection and so I just continued staring at this thing I might never see again in my entire life.  After a good 5-10  minutes of staring at this thing, I decided to rush to get my phone on the couch to capture it on snapchat.  But once again, I felt like this thing knew what I was thinking and doing and in the 10 seconds I went to get my phone, it had gone back to translucent.  It was essentially invisible by the time i tried to take a video of it but you can STILL SORT OF see it in the video that I captured its just quite difficult because it is 90 percent gone. But you can still see the outline of this triangular craft.  I still have this video and look at it constantly.  After I first recorde! d it, the translucent craft floated away and I stared at my 30 second recording on repeat for about 30 minutes still in shock before I sent it out as a snapchat. Most people I sent this video to disregarded it as nonsense but two people responded that they totally saw what I was talking about. This translucent pyramid craft.  This was one of the scariest moments of my life. And unless there is a government in this world that has access to shape shifting, non jet or propeller propulsion crafts that can phase in and out of reality at will, I am certain I saw aliens right in front of my eyes that day.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,,

I Woke up at 3:53 am and went outside on the deck to look at the beautiful stars because it was a crisp and clear night.  A movement caught my eye and I turned to see a very large triangle aircraft, appearing over the roof of my home that was behind me and into my view.  From the direction of E to W.    It silently moving accross the sky just above my head.  The craft was not very high, and was moving at a steady rate until it went into the horizon and then I could not see it anymore.  It flew much lower than the small airplanes that sometimes fly over, and many times lower than the larger commercial airplanes.  However, it could be deceptive becuase of the size.  Each corner had one white light, that was not flashing or changing colors and stable.   The craft had to have been black/dark and blended in with the sky except for the lights.  It was not a box shaped triangle,(with square and flat sides)  but it seemed to have ends around the body that narrowed d! own, like something that would be aerodynamic. Not pointing down, but narrowed at the ends. I also found it interesting that the speed did not change, but because of distance and physics, it could have been flying faster than I would think.  I am thinking of when we watch small planes, they are going fast, but it seems slow and we can watch them fly across the sky for a while.  It did not move fast like a flash or anything as if a car was going fast at our level.  I hope that I am making sense.  I say this because that it only took 10-15 seconds to disappear into the horizon.  I was surprised at how quiet it was, like it was just floating on the air type quiet.  The 'miraged craft' reminded me of when I was working at a photojournalist in Israel, there was bombing over Bethlehem at night, so I woke up and went to a hill to see where the bombing was.  I heard an helicopter hovering above me and I looked up and could not see the craft, but I could hear it and the location could be seen because it was blocking the stars.

It moved in a straight path for a few seconds and was at its brightest when I first noticed it.  Soon it began to move erratically; it appeared to stop in place for a few seconds then move in a different direction with speeds alternating between fast and slow.  The strangest part is its altitude also spiked very fast and when it went higher the light seemed to disappear until it was in a new position in the sky.  I live very close to Mooney airport so I am familiar with aircraft, but the planes I see have more than one light, usually two in front and one in back, also they don’t have glow around them.

I asked my brother to check it out, but the time it took for him to walk two feet from under the porch into the yard, it disappeared from the night sky.  I walked to the back of my house and noticed very bright flashes of white and blue light coming from the trees on the right side of the woods in my neighbor’s backyard.  The diameter of the light looked to be about 7ft and maybe a foot or two off the ground.  There was no noise and the flashes seemed to overlap each other.  In just 15 seconds, there were probably 25 flashes.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,30.045273333333334,-99.16726999999999

Every light also appeared clear enough to be able to see, with the naked eye I might add, that they were in the shape or form of almost a perfect square.  As I looked & became to stare at this row of lights for about 30 seconds, I finally spoke loudly to my friend asking (excuse me for the profanity...) “Hey, what the **** is that?!”  Then I again excitedly asked “Hey (*his name*), what the **** is that?!”  He, who was sitting up on the porch, which btw faced east, had then stepped off & walked out to where i was.  This was just to the edge of his driveway to which he now also faced north & w/out any hesitation whatsoever, had seen exactly what I was seeing as well.  The lights ! were in a straight line & were moving northeast.  Now there was also a plane that was flying in the same general area/part of the sky.  At least, so it seemed anyway to which I’m sure the way the angle/direction was to where we were looking from.  The plane seemed to be much closer to where we were though considering the speed it seemed to travel & area of sky it seemed to cover compared to how these were moving themselves.  As the plane seemed to further itself away in the sky, we kept our eyes on these lights.  So as we kept viewing them, my friend raced inside to get a night vision camera that he has while I stood still & never took my eyes off of the lights. They remained in a tight row & seemed to now be as many as a possible 30 or more. I only was able to surely definitely count a now total of 24 as something began to take place. As my friend raced outside with his night vision camera, I myself was trying to use my iPhone camera but both were unable to get these lights to ! appear on either one of our camera screens. I really don’t kno! w how to explain why that was occurring. I asked how many lights he was seeing & he said he was counting somewhere around a possible 30 himself.  I know there were more than 24 at one time but can only say for sure that I had took the time at one point to count out 24 of them. Now as all this was happening, we were really asking one another of how sure each of us were in seeing what we were seeing & all of this was actually happening to which we both kept assuring ourselves that this was something that was actually taking place in the way that we were experiencing it to which is the same exact way that I’m describing it here. I apologize greatly for the rambling but I hope you can understand how excited & overwhelmed I am still up to this very point as I try to so greatly detail any/every little thing that both I & my friend can recall for you. Now, after a minute & a half or so had gone by, over the next I’d say 15-20 seconds (in what seemed to be a best estimate of) perhaps then ab! out 12-15 of the lights start to, I guess, dissipate then.  Now I don’t mean in anyway close to how, let’s say how a tail of a shooting star/meteorite tends to look like. When I say dissipate, I mean to just slowly fade out into a continuous dim.  As if you were to sit & watch someone slowly turn a rotary dial type light switch from fully on to dimly to just dark & without any flickering whatsoever. The first 6 lights in the giant row of squared shaped reddish orange lights remained just as bright as they did throughout the entire 2 mins of this entire event from 1:08 AM to 1:10 AM. They seemed to just totally remain 1 right alongside the other staying illuminated just as bright as they were when I first saw them at 1:08 AM. So now, it is (what I counted to be over n over again) just 6 lights left to which all remained lit & together, no one or the other within the tightly grouped side by side 6 of them dissipating/disappearing one before the next. Then at approximately 1:10 ! AM, all 6 just disappeared in an instant but in a strange sort! of ‘ins tant’. The 6 of them seemed to disappear in a ... i don’t know I guess almost as if to say the dark sky sort of ‘vacuumed’ them up and just... gone... like that, period. Then just... nothing. I don’t know how else to explain it but to say it was as if you’re looking at the front of a vacuum at eye level & you were to watch a piece of something such as dirt or dust for example & it literally just gets sucked up into the vacuum. Well, that is the very best & most accurate way to describe how differently & unique these last 6 lights seem to then vanish at the end of this most bizarre incident. Now there are some things I want to include & make very clear of as well. First off, neither 1 of us ever seen any sort of ‘ship, craft and/or structure’ of ANY kind. I say this & find it most important due to the comments I want to include in further describing the ‘square shape’ that I clearly saw in looking at these lights. A really good way to describe what we were looking at would be! , for example, take the fuselage of a passenger airplane. How all the windows are lined up next to each other & then say, have each one wide open with its blind pulled all the way up. Now as for the color/light & glow it seemed to create... I guess I’d say to imagine the inside cabin to be on fire, maybe? I suppose that’d be a way to describe the such glow and illuminated reddish orange shade that was being put off in each single segment of light. Now I was able to record the last few seconds of all this on my phone. Well, let me put it another way. I have the last 4 - 5 secs of us talking to one another in excitement as I’m holding my phone towards whatever this is in the sky yet as I mentioned before, nothing seems to come up on the screen. I just cant help but to feel frustrated bcos of not just myself but to have another person that I know so very well and can trust in knowing that he’s seeing the same exact thing I am. Yet, neither camera we’re holding and filming with! are able to pick it up. Even with the lights being as bright ! as they were while dissipating into all but the last 6. It just doesn’t make sense. I know this all comes off as sounding a bit crazy. I know how I’ve been my whole life in hearing such stories from different ones in describing such bizarre & crazy so-called UFO’s. I’ve got to admit though that I’m afraid that I’m about to feel the same in what most of these people have went thru as well in experiencing such a crazy incident(s) in their life. I’ll just say that “Hey, I know that both my friend and I are a couple of smart middle aged guys who are intelligent in each of our own field/trades. We both stood there for a couple of hours after the incident was over & tried & tried to explain what it was and/or could be but even after speaking to just a very select few of certain ones close to each of us, we really cannot come up with a logical answer. I know I can speak for the both of us though in saying that we would give anything to know what it was that we actually saw last night on Ma! y 25th at btwn 1:08AM and 1:10AM in the N to NE sky of Payneville, KY.

The moon as huge and bright to the left was a star and to the right a even brighter star further out..  After seeing the same sky for about 20 minutes i looked down to check my phone.  As i glance back up i noticed a formation of stars that were not there moments earlier.. I couldnt believe my eyes.  It was a in formation of a triangle but looked exactly like the rest of stars. as i began thinking what it could be one of the 3 lights started to disappear then the next and then the next .  I stood for 35 min in awww only to not see the formation show again.  One thing weird i noticed is in that window of me watching the stars i never witnessed a single place.  But few minutes after the sighting planes started rolling by as normal .  This area had a alien abduction case that was pushed under the rug about a man named Sees ...  My own good friend obe had videos on videos of ufos he captured on the island by the small airport.  One day he took his own life while watching these videos....Since i was 18 ive seen an amazing amount of movement in the skys.. Its weird even the military do patrol flights up here with apaches and other helicopters almost weekly. Something isnt right in this area of PA and i think i need to find answers,,, Ive seen lights come off the local mountain near the old Military armory here in Sunbury Pa..  Orange glowing orbs that start flying slow then zooom into space.  This area since 2000 has been high in sightings i know just from my own events ive witnessed one with 3 witnesses as well .

It appeared to be two spheres methodically rotating around a center axis or one sphere orbiting one in the center. The objects stayed the same distance from each other the entire time I witnessed them and if I had to guess I would say there was about the spacing of half of one sphere between the two.  They were fairly close together. I am certain there were 2 objects.  The rotation was fairly rapid, maybe 20 cycles a minutes and the speed seemed very consistent.  The objects were to my north, and seemed very high up in the sky.  I am unsure the size, as I had nothing to reference them against.  The sky was clear and cloudless. I stopped and watched these objects for approximately 15 minutes.  I pointed them out to several of the other guys on site who saw them but didn't take as much interest in them as me.  One said there had been a person flying a drone at the park the previous day, but that it had been black.  These objects were white. I looked away for approximately 3 or 4 minutes to do something and when I looked for it again it was gone.  I did not see the manner that it left in. I don't believe it was a drone. If it was it was not a design I have ever seen. After the fact I did some googling and see the local collage in St. Peter has a summer program where they launch high altitude balloons. https://gustavus.edu/camps/ballooning/  The balloon in the first picture on that website looks like the color of the spheres.  The dates listed are not when I observed this object. I cannot find any pictures online of two balloons being tied to one payload. I have reached out to 3 people at Gustavus for comment and have not yet got any replies. I also have seen news reports of testing of high altitude reconnaissance balloons being tested over the midwest, including Minnesota.  I have not seen any pictures of these and don't know how to account for the methodical spinning or how it departed in 3 minutes after not appearing to move for 15 minutes.

The date of the sighting was Saturday, September 21, 2019.  The time of the sighting was approximately 8:15 p.m. By this time, the sun had already set so it was quite dark.  We had been in the town of Marshall, MO visiting family and were a few miles past the exit for Interstate 70 so we weren't really in Marshall, it was just he closest town that I am aware of.  As we drove down the road at about 65 miles an hour, I noticed three red lights in the sky to my right. There are other similar lights in the area that belong to radio towers but these three didn't seem familiar and caught my attention for some reason.  As I drove closer to where the lights would be, I realized that the lights we moving towards us.  The lights, traveling very slowly, passed between 50 and 100 feet over our vehicle.  This was when I noticed that the lights were in a triangular formation.  As I said, it was quite dark so I! couldn't make out whether or not the lights were part of a single craft or were independent of each other but they were certainly in a tight triangular shape.  If it were a single craft, it must have been quite black.  I heard no sound and noticed no unusually behavior from the lights.  They just moved slowly but steadily overhead traveling from west to east across the highway.  As I looked in my rear view mirror, I could continue to observe the lights for a brief time before I lost sight of them. My wife was in the vehicle with me but she was distracted on her cell phone.  By the time I told her about the lights I was seeing, they were already above our vehicle and she could no longer see them properly so unfortunately I am the only witness to this. There were other vehicles on the road so I am convinced somebody else must have seen something but I have heard nothing. I waited a few days before reporting this because I wanted to see if anyone else saw the same thing. From what I can tell, no one else has so I wanted to go ahead and make my report. I want to make it clear that I am not reporting any kind of alien craft. I'm sure this has some logical explanation. This took place about 30 miles from Whiteman Air Force Base where the stealth bombers are housed. I have seen these craft on many occasions both at day and at night and what I saw wasn't this. I have also lived near an airport and have observed countless airplanes and helicopters take off, in flight, and land.! I cannot say this seemed like either of these things but it very well could be.

The rest of the camping trip we called it the ""space worm"" because it almost looked like some kind of glowing deep sea worm full of lights. 5 of us saw it and we even woke up the 6th person to make sure we weren't just seeing things.  The only thing we could think of that wouldn't be too crazy is possibly a huge line of satellites, but they were moving to naturally and were much larger and brighter than the other satellites we had seen during the night.

As we watched the light moving, it began to slow down, and began moving erratically.  After about 10 minutes, it seemed to turn east, and while its movement east was not consistent, it remained on that general course, the light fading in and out/blinking in and out the entire time.  It finally grew too distant to see.  This was definitely not an aircraft, since the fading/blinking was not consistent like an aircraft's warning lights, and was also only white, no green or red light detectable.  The intensity of the light when it was at its brightest reminded me of a satellite when the sun catches it just right, perhaps even brighter.

For a moment I though it was a lighthouse just by how bright it was, obviously that’s impossible, it just gives you an idea of how forcefully bright this light was.  It resembled a ball of bright fire in one stationary place.  When I finally realized how strange it was and ruled out any other type of craft or car headlights, I kept staring and saw a very bright fire-like object light up after about 10 seconds of staring, it occured in the same place over what would be the Boise foothills.  It looked exactly like a flame except that it became very bright then dimmed until it disappeared.  Between its appearance and its disappearance during the sighting that I directly saw, I’d say it appeared for probably 3-4 seconds before dimming and completely disappearing.  The strange thing is (as if that wasn’t strange! enough) a shooting star occured directly after it burned out.  Both flashes were in the exact same spot and the shooting star was significantly higher in the sky.

I began to worry that this was a plane or helicopter that was going to attempt a landing in our vicinity.  It cleared the tree line and dipped downward, traveling across the field and straight toward us.  It was moving slowly and stopped several times on its approach.  It kept getting brighter as it came close, a brilliant white light in the shape of a circle, the white of an LED bulb.  It hovered approximately 50 yards maximum from where we were sitting. It appeared as a flat, circular, one dimensional, brilliant white light that looked almost like it had been cut from a piece of paper.  It hovered for about 8 seconds before shooting off to the west at a phenomenal speed.   At this point my wife bailed and escaped into the RV.  I noticed that all of the animal sounds had quieted.  Dead silence ensued. Unsure of its intentions, I reached for my 45 caliber handgun on the picnic bench next to my chair.  I was unable to lift the gun as my arm seemed to no longer function. Panic hit me at this point.   The object quickly shot off to the west, dimmed and was gone.   The next morning, I surveyed the area, took some photos.  I estimate that its diameter was 20 feet or larger.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,38.8065,-82.2702

The sighting was right above the Luxor Pyramid at the large beam of light. The Lights we saw were 100x brighter than that of the Luxor’s, very noticeable difference.

When the flapping stopped, it then it disappeared into the Luxor Hotel Light on the strip of Las Vegas. It seemed like a helicopter was monitoring the lights.

Call was made to 911 Van Buren county dispatch to see if anyone else had noticed strange lights and occurrences within the atmosphere above the Van Buren county area towards the Lakeshore which occurred at about 5 to 8000 feet above sea level. Former military aviator with vast experience witness strange occurrencesand attempted to contact the FAA which was closed at 11 and the Kalamazoo international airport. The lights that were witnessed initially discovered by his spouse moving in an easterly direction coming from the West over the boundaries of Decatur township and Porter township in Lawton Michigan the lights that were seen where multiple in the sky as the sky was very clear and luminescent with multiple Stars however the lights that were seen we're altering and multi changing very fastwhat's led into the question the shape of the aircraft that were being witnessed it appeared that t! hey were cigar shaped at a distance long and cylindrical larger than an average aircraft without fixed wings there was one main light that was off in the distance that seemed to be stationary during the entire doing of this anomaly which added an ominous and unsettling feeling coming and going around it attempting to use cellular video cellular video the capture what was being witnessed in the sky this reporting individual made several attempts to adequately identify the unknown anomalies currently at the time of this writing the main lights in the distance that are alternating are still relevant and predominant the smaller lights in aircraft if that's what they can be called have been no longer visible as they were as they were. Upon retrieving a set of Minolta binoculars binoculars this writer adjusted this looking device to see clearly into the night sky upon doing so the first aircraft which was actually cylindrical in shape move quickly over the top of his location and! disappeared in the distance in a relatively short time withou! t any so und however a second aircraft came in the opposite direction a short time later and shook the home without really giving a sound the spouse of the writer was inside the home and clearly stated she heard something big come over the house. It is something that I have never seen in my lifetime very intrigued yet terrifying. Dogs in the distance can be heard barking continually yet when the call was placed to the 911 dispatch no other report has been given to them at that time as per the operator that took fielded the call. After hanging up immediately a call was made to the FAA but their office had been closed other than seeing the bright lights and as the aircraft or cylindrical object moved over the home which was obviously the size have a Navy destroyer or or frigate something that large was impossible to be explained as it went over...you could not hear the aircraft but you could feel the vibration of it almost as if it was a magnified presence which had some sort of cloaki! ng technology or you can see the framework the framework of The Craft and its lights clearly it looked as if it was interdimensional within itself and as it picked up speed it look to have deployed something really really wide coming out that could be only described as wing. The distance that you can see from this location is over 20 miles on a clear night the object disappeared within a matter of moments heading towards the Lakeshore beyond the coloma st.joe area... It is left this writer an experienced professional military man speechless and dumbfoundead having experienced many unique aircraft throughout a long military career nothing that I have seen could be described other than a flying massive grain silo. Which so difficult to describe the mechanics of looking inside of it as it went over the home it was utterly amazing. I'm refusing to go back outside to even look at it because I cannot believe it for myself and I witnessed it with my own eyes.,2019-12-01T00:00:00,42.1349,-85.8425

I have no idea whatsoever at all....Are the flashes somehow connected to a plasma storm hitting the earth from the sun and a ever decreasing magnetosphere...? Again, I cannot answer this, I have not the tools to measure nor determine this...But it is an interesting plausibility...Another thing to note here is this....EVERY single night for at least 2 years, at any given moment, there are several orbs in my sky...If it is clear, you can see them....White Orbs, and they do some crazy stuff...Sometimes they just shoot across the sky, sometimes they stop, change directions, sometimes they hover overhead and move around almost as if dancing in the sky...There are almost always multiple orbs...Something else to note, I have spotted them during the daytime when there are severe storms overhead...They appear BLACK during the day, and move in and out of the clouds and do the same general things they do when seen! at night...I also noticed, and this will sound weird, but if you use something to cover the sun, and look just above or just below the sun, and wait for your eyes to adjust, you can see MILLIONS and MILLIONS of orbs...Most are moving VERY HIGH overhead, but some change direction, and some are literally only feet above me...They very well could be ALL AROUND us, but I can only see them in the INTENSE and BRIGHT sun light, so who knows....I have so much more to say about all I have seen, but will sign off with just this....Heck...Most people will not even believe the things I have written here, much more the other anomalies I have seen with my own two eyes....",2019-06-07T00:00:00,44.7444,-104.6804

Over the Memorial Day weekend, my friend and I were camping a state park north of Grand Marais, and at about 12:19 am on Sunday, May 26, we both saw something in the sky that appeared unusual, and which was not obviously something man-made (plane, etc.) or a natural phenomenon like a bird, clouds, etc.  The sky was clear and full of stars, and the view from our campsite was mostly unobstructed except for some pine trees.  We had a good view of the west/northwest and west/southwest part of the sky. We were sitting around the campfire talking, and at a lull in our conversation, I was gazing at a bright stationary object near the Big Dipper.  I stared at it for a few moments, because it was so bright.  At first I thought it was a planet.  I began thinking that it wasn’t a planet I was familiar with because it was near the Big Dipper, and I didn’t think that was normal.   Then, suddenly it began to move on a straight track from the west/northwest to a point higher in the sky above us, generally in the west/southwest direction, but still fairly high in the sky.  When it began to move, I pointed the object out to my friend, who also began watching it.  We both watched it move towards the west/southwest in a straight trajectory for about 20 or seconds or so, at which point the object’s brightness began to fade until it disappeared about 10 seconds later. Overall we watched it move for about 1 minute, until it seemed to disappear.  The light just slowly faded, and we did not see it appear again along its trajectory, like we would have expected if it had gone behind a cloud or something.  As far as I could tell, there were no clouds in the sky; the forecast for the evening was clear skies. At this point, I noted to my friend that I had never seen an object that bright in the sky behave this way.  We wondered if it had gone behind a cloud or a mist, but again, it was strange because it was dry and clear out.  The object was high enough in the sky to seem to us to be a planet or star at first, but when it started moving and then disappeared, I was baffled. At first we both thought it could have been a satellite, but the way it tracked across the sky wasn’t like other man-made satellites we have seen before.  I didn’t think it was a meteoroid, as it did not flash across the sky quickly, but moved slowly. Talking with my friend about it the next day, neither of us had any immediate explanation for it.  I’m still curious as to what this object might have been. Thank you for maintaining this valuable resource for the public! ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a remnant from the SpaceX satellites??

The sun was not out yet, but it was already easy to see outside.  As I neared my vehicle, I observed a wingless, flying craft at an approximately 2000-foot (600m) altitude traveling in a northwest direction toward the Santa Monica mountain range.  The craft, had an an oblong disc shape, much like a horseshoe crab (without a tail). It was wingless, silent and traveling rapidly. It was glowing a bioluminescent-like blue-green color. The color definitely seemed to emote from within, not from exterior lights or a reflection. It was more reminiscent of a deep-sea creature than a flying vehicle.  As the sky was already a faint hue of blue, it was easy to see there were neither wings or propellers on the craft. There was a faint white shadow-trail following it, giving it more of a teardrop appearance than it actually had. This did not appear to be exhaust, but something more electrical or energy oriented.

As I was looking at the sky for a moment just taking in the nice weather (I live in Florida and a nice, cool day is rare even in December), I noticed four circular shaped objects with a disk-like ring attached to the center of the craft flying completely smoothly, until one started slightly moving up around the other, and after that they disappeared completely. They started right above the tree line, then gradually moved up until they disappeared. I stared at the sky for another couple of minutes and they didn't return. I know they weren't birds because they were clearly metallic and were moving much too quickly and too smoothly to be birds, and I know they weren't jets because they were completely silent, and at one point in the ! 30 seconds or so that I was watching them, they got very close to each other, too close for jets to fly. Plus, my dog paid no attention the them, and usually with airplanes or jets, she gets nervous when she hears the sound. Since my phone was in my hand I took a picture, and attempted to take a video, but my iPhone 7 has terrible photo quality, and even worse video quality. Its hard to make them out but you can see in the photo and also slightly in the video that they are not birds, planes, jets, or anything of the sort. I have never seen anything like this, and I've never had any sort of experiences with extraterrestrial life or spacecraft, so I sent the picture and video to one of my friends and she said that from the photos, they look more pyramid shaped, but in person they looked very circular. I live in a small town in central Florida, about an hour southeast of Tampa, and I've never heard any talk of UFO sightings or anything like that, but outside of the suburban ar! eas is mostly woods, fields, and open land.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,27.927325837320573,-82.23285933014354

On the morning of Saturday, November 23rd at 5:30 am I went out on my 2nd floor balcony wearing only my pant bottoms to smoke a cigar.  I’m telling you this to help show you the timeline of what I saw.  As I stood there and looked up at the night sky, I watched a light come from north to south.  It took about 1 minute for it to move north from about 2 o’clock south in the sky to about 12 o ’clock straight above.  Being out there only a minute with just my pants I was getting cold and ran in quick to get a shirt.  On my way in I noticed another light coming from the same direction and hurried and got a shirt on and went back out, taking less than a minute to get back out. Standing out in my shirt, I noticed 2 additional lights following the same path.  Still cold, I stepped inside to grab my coat.  This time coming out about 30 seconds later, I looked up and saw 3 lights in line with each other about 1 o’clock in the sky, coming much faster in the same direction from south to north. I continued to watch and more lights continued to move across the sky in increasing numbers, grouped together in lines, not clusters, moving from south to north. About 5:15 am, a small prop plane flew underneath the lights moving west to east.  I kept counting the lights as they continued to appear, and lost count after 75.  I estimate that I viewed a little over 200 lights total, however due to the horizon getting brighter, I believe there may have been more, just not visible any longer. One last thing I’d like to mention, is from the point of start of 5:30 am, to the point it ended at 6:00 am, looking southward, I noticed that the lights started at an 11 o’clock angle, still facing south everything ended at a 2 o’clock angle. I would like to receive an explanation of these lights if possible.  If I were to give it a basic explanation, I would say it looked like continuous strings of lights moving across the sky. Thank you for your time and attention to this.	",2019-12-01T00:00:00,39.5539,-104.9694

I was on my way home from my morning walk and had just made it to the entrance of the parking lot on McCulloch where you would drive right past the entrance to the Library. I looked up to look at the big dipper and saw to my amazement a continuous stream of lights moving from one end of the horizon to the other and passing thru the length of the big dipper. (moving from the ""cup"" end to the handle end) While the lights were not evenly spaced, they were all traveling at exactly the same speed with respect to each other. They were all of the same brightness which did not vary. None of them appeared any brighter than any of the stars actually a part of the big dipper. I have no idea how long this had been going on before I saw it. I do know I started watching it no more than a couple of min before six am Arizona time because my phone alarm went off at six am like it always does and I had just started watching the event. I was too amazed to count accur! ately but estimate I saw about 20 to 30 lights. They were in a perfectly straight line but were unevenly spaced. The distance between each light never varied as they moved, but the spacing seemed to vary from 3 degrees to 25 degrees. The ""train"" of lights extended from one side of the horizon to the other as much as I can tell. The lights seemed to fade out about 20 degrees past the handle end of the big dipper. I don't know if that was because of clouds or just the city lights of Havasu. My view of the other side of the horizon where they were coming from was obstructed by buildings and trees. When I got back to the condominium where I live I saw a friend who was in the hot tub and asked her if she had seen the same thing and she said she had and that she first noticed it as a group of 4 lights she saw going thru the big dipper and then she noticed the lights just kept coming.

Dear NUFORC,  First and foremost, I would like to say ""thank you"" for the work that you do. It was a lovely, clear Saturday and I was home after directing morning music rehearsals at a local church.  I was elated because the early evening was beatific in its summer breeze. Coming home to perfect summer weather was nice, as our church building has a cold-and-spooky vibe that leaves me drained. I was standing up on my porch, just enjoying the blue sky while my friend sat down to check her texts, when I suddenly saw something 25-50 ft overhead - something that I still cannot explain, as I have found little to no evidence. It was a highly reflective, metallic, glittery, shapeless poof of sparks that resembled blinking stars or fireworks.  The blob was about 5 ft in length, had many sparks, appeared out of thin air and disappeared the same way. Toward the end of its appearance, the sparks seemed to coordinate with one another to  make a formation that reminded me of a flock of birds flying very high overhead, at sunset.  I can definitely confirm that this was not that.  This was especially strange to me, and reminded me that I have a friend who has been researching UFO's for many years, and that she has found that they like to hide by imitating their environment. Back to the event, I was slack-jawed by what I was seeing, yet immediately alarmed my friend who was not able to look up from her screen to see the 2-5 second event.  I would like to add that we were soberly sharing food, and that I don't suffer from any type of hallucinations.

UFO Sighting: Black Triangle UFO with three white lights on bottom…  Brownstown Township, MI  Sunday, September 22nd between the time of 8:45 pm and 9:00pm  I was sitting in my hot tub on the back patio after a long day of work. It was a perfectly clear night and the stars were brilliant.  There was plenty of airplane traffic flying out of Detroit Metro Airport; a typical night, as I watched out to my west and south vantage point.  You could see planes and their lights a good 30 miles out or so; it was super clear.  I was in the hot tub with my wife and daughter. They went inside for a brief moment.  I leaned my head back and stared directly above to watch all of the stars when a black, triangle-shaped flying object with a small round white light in each of the three corners of the object flew directly over head from north to south/south-east heading at an indeterminable altitude.  It was visible to me for only 15-20 seconds total.   It watched it fly over-head, staring directly at it.  It left no contrail or vapor trails, and would have been difficult to see otherwise, if you weren’t looking directly at it.  Its mass blotted out the stars in the sky, which also helped me make out its exact shape.  I watched it fly slowly overhead, no noise, at a speed that was less than an aircraft that size would need to stay aloft.  It was flying at an altitude higher than the other planes that night climbing in altitude coming out of Metro Airport.  It had almost a shimmery maybe cloaking affect to ! itself, yet was flat black in appearance and clearly visible.  It was a distinct triangle in form, but each of the rear corners were not pointy like a typical triangle shape would be; each corner appeared to have 45 degree angle cuts on each of its corners.  It was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen.  It was not a toy-drone flying at that height, at that time of the day, or in the Metro Airport flight route airspace.  I watched it until it disappeared behind the roof line of my house.  My wife and daughter came out moments later after seeing it.  I told them and they thought I was crazy.  I saw what I saw…and it wasn’t your typical overhead flying planes like I see all of the time.  This was different.  Oh, and I wasn’t drinking that night either…lol  I thought I would write down the memory of the observation to keep the experience fresh in my head.",2019-10-04T00:00:00,,

I’ve observed this craft for almost two weeks and I’m not entirely sure what it is.  It might be a drone or a UFO, but it is certainly not an airplane, helicopter, or satellite because its movement patterns conflict with aerodynamic animations typical in planes and helicopters and it’s too fluid to be a satellite.  The craft exhibits sporadic unidirectional movements without the buffering process of reorientation.  For example, this vehicle can change directions without backing up or turning around.  Additionally, it’s capable of hovering in the air for hours, or speeding (however, I’ve never observed any brisk movements, it mostly hovers around the same region for hours) which is uncharacteristic of planes and helicopters, but not drones (depending on the type, if it is a drone it’s incredibly expensive).  The vehicle in question emerges exclusively during the evening, roughly between 12 AM and 3 AM, and lingers for three to five hours.  Maybe it stays longer, bu! t I’ve never managed to stay up long enough to witness it.  The craft possesses white lights, which amplify in certain contexts. For example, an almost indiscernible second craft approached the hovering, distinguishable vehicle and both brightened when in close proximity of each other.  The indistinguishable craft immediately disappeared after, following with a bright projectile shooting from the sky.  Firstly, I couldn’t tell if the amplified lights were strobe lights or solid lights, and what I’m describing might indicate drone collision lights.  I researched drone collision lights and they’re functional during the full extent of drone-operation.  Sensor-activated collision lights sound perfectly plausible, but I’m struggling to find any examples. Secondly, the bright projectile resembled a “shooting star” and it’s not the first time I’ve seen these “shooting stars” projected from/around this vehicle. However, correlation does not equal causation and they may be unrelated. Another detail to add, however, is that two distinct light proj! ectiles *appeared* to shoot from the isolated craft in a separate occurrence. But, I’ve only witnessed two occurrences of light projectiles coinciding with the craft, so I’m guessing it’s just a regular meteor. I am in no way assigning any definitive explanation because there’s a lot I don’t know. Do what you will and feel free to ask any questions.",2019-12-19T00:00:00,34.5075375,-118.67321250000002

In the blink of an eye, two more similar objects appeared next to them, as they gravitated towards each other and made some what if a zig zag pattern. A seventh light/flying object appeared next to them,  out of nowhere.  They all shifted to create a horizontal line.  At this time, I turned the corner in my neighborhood and lost sight for about 14 seconds as I drove down my street.  I pulled into my driveway, jumped out of my car, and ran straight to my back yard in time to see a single bright light (a little to the east of where I originally saw the cluster of lights) shoot straight upwards into the sky, almost like a reverse shooting star.

As I was driving across my employer’s parking lot at approximately 5 MPH (that is, quite slow, since there was a speed bump and it was dark) I noticed a very bright lime-like green light in my driver’s side visor area.  Because of the overhang of the car roof over my head, I estimate I first saw it at about 145 degrees to vertical.  There were three notably remarkable things about it:  1)  Although I was only 1 ½ blocks from our tiny regional airport, it was going about 2 – 3 times as fast as even an airplane that was NOT landing, 2) it was shaped like an oblong with one end cut off, e.g. like a beach “boogie board”, with a darker area in the middle which seemed to be a stripe or stripes extending from the tip to the back, and 3) it wasn’t going toward the airport at all, but at right angles to it.  If it had been an airplane, I’d have said it was flying quite a bit lower than normal  flight—but then, I didn’ t know it’s size.  Compared to the full moon up i! n the sky (not our recent harvest moon), it was about as big as ¾’s of a regular moon.  Then after it zipped overhead (coincidentally in the direction my car was going) I followed it with my eyes, still trying to discern the stripe, and suddenly (very suddenly!) it disappeared.   I didn’t hear any sound when it disappeared.  My estimate is that is disappeared when 20 degrees above the horizon.   I didn’t see any afterglow.   I called a friend immediately afterwards, and that call is recorded as being at 7:32 pm.  The visualization itself only lasted about 2 seconds.  I was unable to discern from 911, the radio or my friend whether there had been a reported meteorite or whether others had seen what I saw.

I was in the south parking lot of Gilman Village, a boutique shopping center.  The GPS coordinates are 47.538391, -122.040947.  My elevation was 108 feet. The time was 3:58 p.m. PST.  Cloud cover was about 70 percent.  Light snow was falling. A reas of blue sky were scattered around the south and north.  The sun was not visible.  The temperature was 31 degrees.  The wind was from the SW at 7 mph. Near the end of my call I started staring at an area of blue sky in front of me, directly to the south.  After maybe 30 seconds I saw the object.  I didn’t see it arrive, I just suddenly noticed it.  I finished my phone call and looked at my watch - 3:58 pm and 25 seconds.  The object was charcoal gray and cigar shaped. There was a very slight bulge in the center, on top and bottom of the object.  At arm’s length it was about 9.5 millimeters long.  It just hung in the blue sky, motionless.  A couple of small clouds drifted past the object, one just above it and one directly at it.  When the cloud reached it, the object was inside the cloud for about 3 seconds. A full layer of cloud cover was gradually approaching this area of blue sky.  The cloud base was at 2450 feet, so that may be an approximate altitude for the object.  According to the log law calculation, at 2450 feet the wind speed was 17 mph and the temperature was about 23 degrees.  The object’s direction was directly South of me.  I was looking up at it at a 45-degree angle from the horizontal. Paragliders, small planes, hobbyists with drones and bald eagles are frequent sights in Issaquah.  The object wasn’t a paraglider - no colorful rectangular parachute and no person hanging in a seat beneath it; it was 23 degrees up there with a 17-mph wind, too cold and windy to paraglide; and it was motionless. It was not a small plane – no wings; no engine sound; and it was motionless. It wasn’t a hobbyist drone –at the apparent size it should have been close enough for me to hear the buzzing whine; a drone would not likely be covered by a cloud at 2450 feet altitude; a drone would not likely be flying while it was snowing; and there would have been visible movement caused by the wind velocity, whether it was a 7 mph or a 17 mph wind.  But it was motionless.  It was not an eagle – even in warm air with updrafts there is always some movement of the eagle's wings or body; if it was trying to stay aloft with a 17-mph wind hitting it, obvious movement would be necessary, but it was motionless. After about 3 minutes and 20 seconds he object suddenly began to move, traveling to the Southeast.  It appeared to move at the low end of the speeds I see single engine propeller planes travel near Issaquah, around 110 mph.  It obtained that speed instantly from the moment it moved, no acceleration.  It traveled in a perfectly straight line, totally smooth, exactly at the horizontal, no change in altitude. The object headed southeast on a line that would take it barely south of Tiger Mountain, a 3000 foot mountain on the southeast border of Issaquah.  The trajectory would have taken it over the Cascades near Snoqualmie Pass, and then over the city of Cle Elum. After the object traveled for about 5 seconds a stand of fir trees blocked my view.  I ran to a clear area, but by then the object was gone from my view. I am a trial attorney. I have a bachelor's degree, a master’s degree and a law degree.

I had stepped back from my imaging rig while it ran and was viewing Orion with a smaller hand held refractor. 5 relatively dim lights in an almost straight line passed into the view of my scope. It was odd, so I tracked it by hand all the way to the horizon where I lost sight of it. I spend at least a couple nights a week imaging deep sky objects. I’m used to seeing planes, satellites, meteors, and other normal things. This one was different. The lights were too dim to be a  normal plane, way dimmer than stars.  They were dim, but seemed large, like they were closer than a satellite would be.  They would have been too dim to see with the naked eye though.  They were not in a perfectly straight line, but stayed the same distance from each other. So I’m assuming they were part of the same object.  All five lights were the same size, shape, and brightness.  I woul! d describe them as a really dim orange or brown color. They traveled across the sky about as fast as a plane would.

It being a plane flying high above probably flying around 500 mph going to it destination , i have flown many times ,know they fly aroun! d that speed, i would say these lights were about that same speed, i wanted to get a comparison to something to try to understand, make sense of what i witnessed.I counted 23 single almost star brightness single white lights move across the lower sky, coming down from above, that was my visual number count from when i actually began looking in that direction of the sky, i'am not sure if there was any before i began the sightings ,this is what i seen only.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,43.2001,-79.5663

Sometimes it would change direction while the light was off then it would appear off to the side.
