As I walked out of my house I was looking up at the night sky, very aware of the lack of air traffic since 9/11. Previous to then the sky was pretty busy since we live under flight paths for the Oakland airport. I live near town about .2 mi. from dowtown lights, so the sky is not extremely black. I noticed a line of different colored lights, one white, one red, and one amber. As I watched them float across my path at approx 60-70 degrees line of sight angle, from where I was standing, I realized that the lights were disappearing as it was approaching directly overhead and that a section of the sky and stars were being blocked out immediately behind the line of lights, It was as if the original lights I saw were on the top and front of some solid object and when it floated by my view of the lights was obstructed as well as the sky. The patch of darkness behind this line of lights was approx. 4"" x 4"" at arm's length. I could not really discern any specific shape but I want to say triangle. There was absolutely no sound even though it appeared to be quite close and it gave the impression it was floating. Since I don't know how far away it actually was I don't know how fast it was going but it travelled across approx. 110 degrees of arc above me until I lost the blackness in the night sky. I kept looking for flashing strobes or red and green wing lights but to no avail. I had wondered if stealth fighters were flying around patrolling the skies around us after such an event on 9/11, but unless they had all their traditional  flying lights off and they can fly without sound, I don't know what it was.

I was sitting on my couch one day, watching TV, and happened to look out my window. From my window I can see the East side of Manhatten, I am directly across from the United Nations building. In any case I saw what appeared to me at first to be birds flying. Like seagulls, when they just kind of float in the air. Their movement was like that two objects just kind of circling each other ove and over. It occured to me after a few seconds how high they were in the air. I got up to get a closer look, and sure enough they were not birds. My second though was military planes, like an F-14. This was in and around the time they were still patrolling over the City. But because of the movement, I would have to rule that one out too. They managed to saty there for about 10 minutes appearing and disappearing, reflecting light of some type of metallic surface. They were so far up it was hard to get a good read on its surface properties. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-03-19T00:00:00,40.74430706561509,-73.98772448166518

I was focusing on Mars when she said ""hey look at that star"", ""it moved"". I looked over to the West and saw a very bright star like object fall roughly 1/2 mile to the tree line and go exactly back up to the same spot. I said ""did you see that?"" my wife said ""good, you saw it too!"" I put my telescope on it to see the object better. It looked like a yellow orange sphere that pulsated with a bright white light almost like a heart beat. There was a extemely bright band of moving full spectrum rainbow light which encompassed the object and flopped around like a Lazurus sign wave, the ""O"" shape. After watching for a few minutes we noticed a jet moving towards it from the NorthEast, then we noticed another jet coming from the SouthWest. At this time the object moved straight up about a mile and the jets passed under it. Then another jet passed under coming from the North. Then the object flew further West and it was a much smaller dot in the sky. I then remembered I had a video camera in the camp trailer. I did video tape it but it didn,t show up very well with the digital zoom so I tried focusing thru the eyepiece of the telescope. Due to some more movement by the object and myself shivering from the cold night air I didn't get much good footage, but there is about 1-3 seconds where you can see the image fairly good. Your can definately tell that the object is pulsating in multiple colors. We watched do manuevers from the same distance off and on until 11:30pm (23:50)We had to go inside our trailer to warm up about 1/2 hour of each hour. The manuevers were geometric patterns like squares and triangles and some occasional full circles. About 11:15pm I saw it perform a loop type of manuever and then another bright object came from the South and did a loop and stopped very close to the other one. They then flew futher North West looking like one bright object. I did notice jets going by a few more times (atleast 3 times but only 1 or 2 at a time) during the rest of the sighting. I hesitated to report this until I read that other people in Colorado saw the same object that night. I mean we hardly believe it and we saw it.

My sister and I had just finished watching the Blues/Avalanche NHL playoff game on TV (which ended abruptly in overtime) and as I was frustrated that my team lost, I immediately proceeded to get ready to drive my sister home to St. Paul. She went outside ahead of me, while I grabbed a quick glass of water for the road. It was about 2134 CST on May 18, 2001. A few seconds later she yelled for me to hurry and take a look at something which was moving slowly almost directly overhead in the sky (which was clear). I stepped out of the doorway and looked up. What we saw for the next 6 minutes is as follows: A large object almost directly overhead, slightly east of our position, which was at a point just west of Interstate 35W and just south of US Highway 10 in Mounds View, Minnesota, USA. As I have been trained in this area, I estimated this object to be at an altitude of somewhere between 8000 to 10000 feet. The object first appeared as an oddly shaped rectangle though roundish on the bottom, with a deep-orange seemingly pulsating or shimmering underbelly, similar to a liquid metal appearance, with what appeared to be brighter orange highlites (which appeared as possibly tubular openings) in the front end which I viewed just prior to it passing overhead, which then hid those frontal features. It also appeared to have a halo, or jellyfish type of bubble on the top of the object well above the shimmering orange bottom. It was moving very slowly from the east to the west/northwest, and made no sound, and no other lights of any kind were visible, though its general shape seemed to ebb as its orange underside was unstable as it was pulsating slowly. As this was something that I have never witnessed before, it seemed significant enough for me to dash inside to grab my video camera, and I  was fortunate enough to tape nearly two minutes of this object. After taping this object for nearly a minute, I was surprised to see that another object seemed to be released from the main object and zip away from it fairly quickly, with this splitting visible in the frames prior to my nervous jerking of the camera to get a better angle as it was moving behind trees. Within seconds, the object released an additional two (possibly three) objects which are clearly visible on the tape. These objects seemed to fall in a downward motion though they could have been moving into the distance. One object is shown to fall off vertically behind trees while it suddenly reappears a second later moving horizontally and completely disappearing a few seconds later. This also is clearly visible. During this second release of smaller objects, there was no apparent change in the main object's structure, though it seemed with the naked eye to dim slightly after the release. About thirty seconds later, the main object then split into two major sections and the sped off in opposite trajectories from each other though in a seemingly downward motion in relation to the camera's angle, which was pointed upward at an approximate 45 degree angle in relation to the ground. The objects then disappeared from view behind trees. I have estimated that in relation to the camera's angular position, that this object split apart in the vicinity of Coon Rapids, Anoka, or Champlin, Minnesota, or in that general region, to the northwest of Mounds View. There were at least three witnesses from our location: myself, my twenty-year old sister, and my forty-nine year old then roommate, who only saw the object briefly. I yelled for another individual who had been entering his vehicle a half-block away to look, but the person either didn't understand or didn't fully hear me trying to get his attention. My personal credentials include military service in the United States Army as an MOS 16T10 (Patriot Missile). As this is an Air Defense position, I was specifically trained to spot and identify all known types of aircraft and other flying objects (balloons, missiles, drones, military flares, meteorological phenomona, etc.). Despite my background, I have no experience with the object I witnessed this particular evening. I can personally attest to the facts presented herein, and can faithfully presume that it was not an aircraft, nor a ""shooting star"" (meteorite), nor a military flare, and certainly not a weather balloon (the wind was blowing from the west to east at about 10-15 mph yet the object was moving east to west/northwest -into the wind). Additionally, the sun had already set, yet the object was luminescent or emitting its own light on the side not facing the sunset. At the same time that this object was sighted, I did notice a high-flying commercial jetliner that was flying from west to east at an approximate altitude of 36,000 feet, and was visible from its exhaust contrail. In terms of its possible size, I would judge this object as it first appeared overhead to be the size of between a 747-400 and a C-5A military transport aircraft. The object certainly was well below the altitude of the high-flying commercial jet which was moving in the opposite direction. To describe its size in a simple form, if you basically stretched both arms over your head and put two thumbs (and possibly another half of one thumb) next to each other, that's the size it appeared at its closest point. I wanted to share this story with your investigators and the general public because I felt that it was significant enough to warrant further investigation to determine what the object could possibly have been, and as to whether there were other witnesses ( which I have noticed that there was another sighting in the St. Paul, Minnesota suburb of Hastings about 2 hours previous to mine with a similar description) and if there have been other similar sightings with similar object behavioral characteristics. There has been some local investigation by the Minnesota MUFON network field investigator, and he is apparently still putting the finishing touches on his report. I am highly interested in knowing if your organization has connections to those who may have experience with video tapes, and who would be interested in examining the tape to determine the light source evident on it, and possibly enhancing the tape to show more detail. Thank you for your efforts regarding this. In closing, I would also like to share that within a few days of this sighting, I made attempts to get local media coverage of this sighting. Copies of the tape were made in the studios of KARE 11 (NBC affiliate), WCCO 4 (CBS affiliate), and KSTP 5 (ABC affiliate). None of the organizations returned any information regarding the sighting for a possible story, which I find highly unusual. I also contacted the local air traffic control center, which is a major regional center located in Farmington, Minnesota. They told me to contact the control tower at MSP (Minneapolis/St. Paul International). I spoke to a supervisor (whose name I'll give if needed) there regarding possible radar tapes from that evening to see if an object was sighted, but was told a few days later that nothing unusual was on those tapes. I am also interested in what local television weather radar, NWS radar, and NOAA weather radar scans show for that specific time period on 18 May 01. Thank you once again.",2002-01-11T00:00:00,,

Two children ages 6 and 9 witnessed in their back yard a huge flying object in the sky that flew toward them at a sharp angle and rested over them with a huge bright white light in the center beaming down on them.  They both ran for cover under the eve overhang of the backyard cottage.  They were screaming for their mother in the house,  ""mom, mom, help us, help us"".  The oldest felt that the ""space ship"" as she called it was trying to steal them.  This is why she grabbed her younger sister and hid from the light.  Both girls have drawn the pictures of what they saw.  The saucer shaped UFO had many, many lights circling around the edge of the UFO that seemed to change shape and the middle had a huge center of bright blinding light the size of the cottage itself.  After about 3 minutes, they both ran through the beam of light for about 5 feet and got to the back door where their mom was standing inside the door.  When they began toward the house across those five feet, the ""space ship"" took off at high speed diagonally in the sky and disappeared.  The UFO made a horendously loud sound as it hovered over them, both girls said.  When their mom tried to go out to see, the girls struggled to keep her in afraid that the ""space ship"" would steal her away from them.  She within a minute was out in the back yard and around the front yard looking for evidence of any airplane and it was dark and silent.  The surrounding area did not have many trees and the sky was mostly visible.  There was no trace.  The girls continued to be clingy for the rest of the night.  The mother remembers the lights of the house flickering and for some reason did not barely hear the sound nor react to the calls of the children as would be expected.  She does not understand this at all.  She is a very protective mother and watches her children closely.  What is intruiging to the mother about this incident is that her children had not been exposed to any UFO pictures, books, TV, videos, CDs or even ideas.  They did not watch television, n! or did t hey attend a public school.  They were completely nieve and yet they drew a picture that resembled other UFOs that the mom has seen drawn and described an experience that was truly terrifying and real for them.  She wonders why they felt like the ""space ship"" was trying to take them away. Their father has encountered a UFO in another house three years earlier where the sound was so loud he was holding his ears and the light was blinding.  The same mother, his wife  and the two girls much younger were in the house and barely heard the sound and did not see the blinding light.  They were all in the house but in separate rooms.  She wonders what all this means.  Why has her husband and children seen UFOs in her presence when she did not.",2002-01-11T00:00:00,47.03031595092024,-122.89693098159509

We were in the middle of watching a movie, and we had the speakers cranked up high, when I began to hear a loud whumping noise, like the noise of a helicoptor.  Startled, I jumped up and asked my brother to turn off the television.  Startled himself at my anxious expression, he did.  I heard clearly then, as well as the nineteen others piled in my living room, the noise outside.  We scrambled out as fast as we could to see a small triangular craft above my house (small in comparison to large ones I've read about).  The craft was about the size of my house and in the shape of a triangular pyramid, but at that moment I could only see the bottom of it.  I yelled at my brother to go get a camera (I had to yell because the noise soon became very loud) when the noise of the craft was accompanied by many more.  We saw out of the sky a whole fleet of these craft come down by my house.  There were probably twenty to twenty five ships in all.  They stayed for a moment, got into some formation, and began to retreat back to the stars.  I remember the noise that they made was deafening.  There were no lights on the crafts until they got in formation.  Then  thin beams, like lasers, connected all the ships.  They traveled off smoothly.

Curious Light 	I am writing this document 8 hours after I witnessed a curious light in the sky. It was at 6:50 AM on Monday, October 23, 2000. Walking down to the bus stop, I noticed a solid, bright light in the east sky. The day before, I read a report stating that most people mistake UFO's for Venus because they do not expect the planet to be so bright. I ruled out that the light was probably Venus. I saw a second light, lower than Venus and to the right. Dimmer, and smaller, but bright nonetheless, and solid. 	I looked at the sky with concentration. Blue, not a cloud in sight for miles, everything perfectly clear. I looked at the moon which appeared to be in the south. It was a crescent moon, and looked light a crooked smile. 	This is when I saw the light. A bright, flickering object in the sky off in the distance. It was on the left side, lower than Venus, to create an equilateral triangle. I stopped and stared at the ""UFO"";, it clearly wasn't a planet, or an airplane. In fact as I looked at the object, I figured that it was blinking about 4 times a second. The entire object wasn't blinking. It had other lights, and only a portion of lights, on the bottom half of it, were blinking. I wasn't walking anymore, and noticed that it was moving back and forth slowly and unsteadily. 	Then came an airplane. In a relative distance to the UFO. Dark, with those slow blinking lights that anyone can spot and identify. A bird flew by, plainly. A bird nor an airplane, nor a planet can be this strange object I saw in the sky today, that formed a triangle with 2 (what I believe were) planets. 	I am very skeptical about this strange light being anything other than a light, or an object in the sky. But that strange, rapidly blinking light is unexplainable. I have seen strange lights in the sky before, but this is the first time I believe it couldn't be anything else, not a flare, a plane, a planet, the moon, a balloon, or spotlight. It was some sort of craft. This is a real mystery.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,41.4675,-73.2406

(Kamiah is north central Idaho)  She was on highway 12 at milepost 70.  The lights were described as 9 lights in a row and appeared to be three to a section, with one bright white light on each end, with a smaller red light in each center.  The area is mountainous and the object appeared to be approximately 1/4 mile away, and 300 feet in length, and was traveling in a downward direction.  It is possible that the 'string of lights' landed in a clearing on the hillside.  No sound was heard.   At approximately 19:30 hours two boys 16 and 17 were at the Kamaih High School football field and noticed the same string of  lights travel slowly over the field at approximately 300 feet altitude traveling from east to west.  (This sighting was 4 3/4 miles east of the first sighting)   At 20:30 hours approximately 1/2 mile from the football field, a lady indoors heard a loud noise similiar to several jets flying over and went to investigate.  She saw 9 lights, but observed  3 distinct V shaped craft at an altitude of 3 to 400 feet.  All three craft were travelling from east to west.

I was sitting on my deck which faces north/northwest enjoying the early twilight and noticed a very bright light suspended in mid-air to the north.  At first I thought it was maybe a signal flare or something, but quickly ruled that out because there was no smoke or fluctuation of intensity and it wasn't falling at all.  I then thought maybe a new radio or communication tower had been built, but then realized the light was too high and too bright.  It also wasn't flashing like the strobes on many towers, although the light had the brightness and intensity a strobe.  The two things that made me realize this was something extraordinary were its intense brightness and its utter motionlessness.  The light appeared to pulsate slightly, but that could have been the result of atmospheric conditions.  The air was somewhat humid, though not really hazy. I watched the object for 3 to 4 minutes until it dimmed substantially and suddenly began to move off toward the east.  I don't know if the light went dim because it turned or if it in fact dimmed.  In any event, it became much more difficult to see as it began to move.  It didn't speed away but rather moved off at a fairly steady, smooth pace until it was no longer visible.   It was much smaller appearing after it began to move, probably because it became a dark object rather than a light one.  On the move, it appeared to be a sort of pea-shaped object, maybe slightly oblong, but mostly roundish. There was no noise associated with it at all. I,m 54 years old and don't drink or use drugs.

PD)) One evening in the summer of 1978 my boyfriend's mother was giving me a ride to a store about 9:30 at night, as the store closed at ten. We were traveling from Lake Elsinore to Perris on highway 74. From certain areas on Highway 74 you can see the jets at March Air Force Base take off and leave. When I had a home right on the highway(Meadowbrook) we would watch the jets take off and land all night.  The roar from the jets was thunderous.  On this night we were at that area where March Air Force Base was very clear to us, and suddenly my boyfriend's mom, Mary, says ""Do you see what I see""  and I really did.  There it was as real as the chair that I am sitting on, It was saucer(disc)shaped, with red, yellow, blue, and green lights in the windows, which circled the craft. The windows looked like they were lit from the inside, and they were flashing,interchanging lights.  The craft was hovering in front of one of the AIR FORCE JETS, staying in front of it, moving back and forth in front of the jets window, for as long as we could see it. It was the most amazing sight that I have ever seen. I know that the jet pilot saw it also.  And not to mention the people at the base.  It is just amazing to me that no one else reported it.  The third amazing thing is the fact that I saw an identical craft six years later.  I was watching the 1984 CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE LOS ANGELES OLYMPIC GAMES when to my surprize they landed an UFO in the Los Angeles COLESEUM.  And it was identical to the craft that I saw at March Air Force Base six years earlier.  You can imagine the questions that fill my head.  Who built the craft at the Olympics?  Where did they store it?  Did they ever test run it?  What is it capable of?   I personally think that they modeled the craft after sightings, rather than that being the same craft, because the one I saw could maintain its position in front of a jet as it was taking off, or landing. I'm not sure which it was doing, coming or going, but I could tell the UFO seemed to be taunting the jet. ! No trai l or sound could be heard, except for the jet sounds.  From where we were positioned we could not see any beings inside the craft. I wish the pilots,like the one in the jet that night in 1978, would begin to speak about what they have seen. Thank you very much.  ((initials deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We were not aware that a UFO had landed during the 1984 Olympics.

Minor spelling changes, made at request of witness.  PD)) HUGE circular object which hovered over the North Brunswick, NJ intersection of Route 1 and Route 130 in the late 1970's or early 1980 I was driving  home from Woodbridge New Jersey going south on Route 1.  From a distance away I could see something up ahead that I had never seen before.  I traveled that road every day. That particular day I stayed later for a meeting.  As I came upon the circle which connects Route 1 and Route 130 in North Bruswick, there was a HUGH circular craft hovering over the circle. It was HUGH, the size of a city block.  It made no sound, just hovered.  It had colorful lights on the bottom.  I pulled alongside the highway near what use to be the NJ Boys Scouts Headquarter and just sat and gawked at it.  Many people had parked along the highway to observe.  I left before it did.  I wanted to rush home to bring back a family member to see it but no one believed me when I told them about it.  I never went back.  Since that date I make it a point of watching the Discovery channel or History channel or whatever show has to do with UFO's in the hope that I'll see a story about that incident but I never have. It is now 2001 and I still think about that event.  It was a beautiful sight which did not frighten me.  I would like to read reports in this database from other people that saw what I saw. ((ADDENDUM #1)) Cleary, I was having an  off day.  In my report, please correct HUGH to HUGE and in the description of the craft, you might want to replace the CIRCLE description with the word DISK.  I thought more about it last night and the word DISK better describes  the craft.  Thank you  ((ADDENDUM #2)) ((QUERY BY NUFORC REGARDING DATE OF SIGHTING)) Dear Ms. ((name deleted)), Thank you for the wonderful report.  I suspect the incident may have gained some publicity in local papers, but that is only a guess. There is a celebrated case in which a strange craft allegedly fired a ""beam of light"" and shattered a window in a building in Bergen County (??), NJ, but I do not remember the date.  It allegedly occurred in a building that was located somewhere near where Meadow Lands Sports Stadium currently sits. Also, if you can ever ""reconstruct"" the date of your sighting, please let us know.  We know from experience that people often can come within a week or month, if they sit and think about what they were doing at the time, why they were driving, what car they had or what clothing they were wearing, etc..  In addition, fuel receipts, cancelled checks, credit card entries, etc., are all very helpful in this respect. Thank you for taking the time to share the sighting with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) For the sake of argument, use tHe 4/79 date.  I would like to see my report entered into the database just because it  may spark the interest of one of the other people that  was also parked along the highway.  That person may end up having a more accurate fix on the exact date.  Believe me I have tried to reconstruct that day in my mind for what seems like an eternity.  I know the date is a vital link.  Normally, I have a good memory but for some reason that exact date escapes me.  I presume you have already read the report I submitted.  Isn't that why you just contacted me?     I know this is really going to top off the cake but the closest picture I have ever come across which resembles what I saw is one fleeting moment of a spaceship in the movie ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""  Not the aircraft where they communicate back and forth with sounds but earlier in the picture. If I could get a picture of the craft used in that movie, I could pinpoint exactly what I saw looked like.  The one in the movie didn't stay on the screen for long but when I saw it, I almost jumped out of my skin.  Even to this day, it is the only picture I've ever seen that most closely remsembles what I saw.  ((name deleted))",2001-04-28T00:00:00,40.436,-74.485

I tried to follow them with my eyes but they were flying so fast I had to turn my head quickly west to see them. By the time I had turned my head they were 2 small dots on the horizon flying between the peaks of a mountain range probably close to 30 or 40 miles away. It's hard to judge distance in the desert. Maybe it means nothing but it seemed that time slowed down when this all occurred. There were other cars on the road at the time (two lane road) but I don't know if they saw them or not. There was one in front of me and one behind me. It seems that the traffic slowed when this happened but the whole thing happened so fast it was difficult to remember even at the time.

He did not know me and all the windows and doors to his home were locked, there were no signs of a forced entry.  He also had a German Sheperd in his yard that was completely fenced, that would have chewed me up had I tried to enter.  He held me at gun point while his wife called the Police.  When the Police arrived they simply drove me to the base and left me with my Base Commander.  The home owner had found me sleeping on his couch in his living room.  I had a pillow under my head and a blanket over me.  I nor the home owner knew each other and niether one of us had any idea how I got in his home.  The house that I woke up in would not have been the first home that I would have come to, far from it.  I noticed that I had a slight cut on my stomach that was very deep but there was no sign of blood and it healed within days.  My Base Commander was lost for words, and since I was his administrative asst. he knew me very well.  This was not something that I would do.  In later talking to some of my buddy's that had stayed at the site where we were partying they indicated that about an hour after I had left to walk back to the base they did notice some strange lights coming from the other side of the hill in the spot where I remembered just kneeling down to gather body heat.

As I approached town, I noticed that these lights were coming from the grocery store parking lot area. It was a stationary object so even though it was about 2 miles to town it was still there when I arrived. I saw a dark triangle shape against the sky with the 3 lights coming from each side of the point witch was pointed towards the ground. I was curious, still thinking that this could be a hot air balloon or something else. I was the only car which turned into the parking lot. I thought this in itself was amazing since the road had alot of traffic that night. Was I the only one who saw this?. I pulled my car directly under the craft, which was only slightly above the parking lot light. It was a dark color maybe black, metalic with slight bumps arranged in possible adhesion or rivet type patterns. The shape was clearly up-side down pyramidal and about 50-60 feet from top corner to top corner. It was centered over 4 parking lot lights and I wondered if it was gathering energy from them also. It made no sound.(I turned off my car, and listened carefully between the waves of cars on the road). Another car pulled up, a grey Toyota Celica with 2 young men inside. they roled down their window and were looking at the craft with the biggest eyes I've ever seen. Their mouths were hanging open and I could see their tongues. I waved at them and the craft began to rotate on axis. The men burned rubber out of there and squealed tires again acelerating onto the road. I decided that my car was a safer vantage point at this time and hoped it would start. It did and I backed up about 50ft. The craft then headed towards the grocery store. It looked like it would run into the sign and roof. When the point of the craft got within 15-20 ft of the store, the craft lifted about 5 foot and cleared the store top. I should metion that it didn't make any sound, the lights had rotate! d from p ointing west to pointing south and it was only traviling at a speed of about 5MPH. Against the night sky I could see the flat top clearly. A few months later a co-worker was talking about the UFO that crossed the road in front of her. She said that she and others stopped their vehicles on highway 34 towards Greeley and just watched this up-side down pyamid thing cross the road. She said that it was still moving at about 5MPH. Her sighting lasted about 15-20minutes as she saw the lights before it crossed the road. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not specify whether the time was am or pm, but we presume it was a nighttime sighting.  We have amended the time.  The date may be approximate, although we are not certain of that.  We would welcome reports from other witnesses.  PD))",2001-04-28T00:00:00,40.4724,-104.8939

I traveled along with me as I headed toward Antelope valley. I had seen this thing the previous night. I talked to my friend who said he saw it last night. So I drove to his house in Antelope Valley. It followed me all the way there . When I stopped at my friends house. It stopped too. I ran to my friends door. To show him. He went outside and observed the bright light. We were pretty freaked out. After that I began to drive aroud in Antelope Valley. Every direction I went the light followed. At first I believed it was a planet. And my eyes were playing tricks on me. I stopped at the Antelope Valley Kwik Shop. It followed. From there I went to the Antelope Valley Park. The light followed. It began to dim then get real bright. I ran to the top of a hill located in the park were I observed the light for 5 minutes. Were it remained motionless. As I headed back down to my car the light started to come closer. I started running towards my car. I was scared. I drove to the Antelope Valley Kwik Shop to use a payphone . As I pulled up My friend _____ pulled up I hopped in his car and pointed toward the light following me. I questioned my sanity here. Was I just seeing it. No. I showed my friend _____the light. I told him it was following me. He did not believe me tell we proceded into Gillette to a friends house. It followed at high speeds.  We stopped at Eagles Nest Apartments at a friends house. ____ and I ran inside to show our fiends the light. It was hovering motionless about 3 miles above Flying J a gas station. We left the apartment to go visit friends that live about two miles out of town on echeta road. The light followed. On the way out we saw a fire department blazer parked on the side of the road observing the light. We proceded on echeta to a friends house. It still followed. Now we were really freaking out. We pulled up to our friends house. It followed tell we stopped our car. It then stopped and remained about 20 miles away from us just hovering in the sky. We ran into our friends hot tub room. I told them what we saw. They didn't believe me. So we took them outside. My two friends both saw it. We observed the light with binoculars. It was the strangest thing It was  and had bright white lights aroud the border of the craft. All of us observed the lights. I decided we should all drive in my friends car to see if the thing would follow us again. My other friends were skeptical. We left and proceded farther down echeta road. It followed once again. We drove about 10 miles down the road. It kept right up with us. We stopped the car. It stopped. My friend that was driving got scared and turned around. It followed. As we headed toward the direction of our friends house with the hot tub room. We observed another light that looked exactly like the one we had jus seen. That was behind us still following us. In a sec the new light appeared to have dissappeared. About  a minute later all four of us observed a red light with blinking strobes lighting up aroud the red light in a circular motion. We stopped the car and went outside of the vehicle It flew right over our heads. The other light we had been chasing was still behind us following we went back tho the house with the hot tub. As we pulled up two other friends were leaving the house we were going to. We told them a u.f.o was following us. They didn't believ us. We told them too follow us to the house. Went went up the driveway to the house. We showed them the light with binoculars.  i observed the light once again with binoculars It appeared to be changing shapes and colors. It had a current of electricity running   between two lights. The current had a rainbow aura. Two other friend showed up. They saw it too. IT was getting kind of boring observing it for so long . It was just hovering there. We went to the shop and started talking I kept leaving to check if it was still there. It was. I checked every 10 to 15 minutes. It pretty much stayed the same until . I went for another check It was now a reddish hue and really close to the ground. I above the craft about 2 miles was two blinking strobe looking lights . They were alot smaller in comparison to the red light. I looked  at these lights with binoculars. It was a giant triangular shape. It was huge compared to the other light. I showed everyone there. After about ten minutes I went to call kaml radio station. I went to check if it was still out there it was gone this was at 10:30 at ninght. That is what happenend. I have many witnesses to testify and pictures. I am are devoleping them today. It was the strangest thing that I have ever seen.

On this date a @ 21:00 hrs me and my father in law were taking the garbage down the drive and I noticed a bright round light approx 200 feet above the tree line.  I asked my father in law if he sees that light and he said no only the tower with red lights I told him to look left of that  and he then saw it and said he didn't know what it was and went home.  I went into my home and got my video camera and binoculars.  It was a full moon and everything was bright,  so I put my camera on low light setting and could not see anything with the camera.  I then got my binoculars and could clearly see a roundish bright object that had been hovering in the same place for approximately 25 min.  On occassion it had changed color from bright white to green to redish orange.  This whole time the object never moved.  I noticed movement  @ 2130 in a downward vertical movement until it got into the tree line, then it moved southeast in the tree line and I lost sight of it.  I went in and called the hempstead county S.O. and the miller county SO  and asked if anyone had reported a light over or around the town of Fulton, Arkansas.  they both said no.  I went to the door approx 10 min later and saw the light out again but it was now what appeared to be over the small town of Fulton or in that area.  I watched it with my binocs and watched an airplane vear off its flight path and fly towards the light. After the plane came near and made an upward left banking turn the object again changed colors and went into the tree line and started moving south southeast.  The airplane continued to circle the area for approx, 15 min and then flew toward the town of Texarkana, Arkansas.  There is a minimum sized regional airport there, and my house is in the flight path of may planes.  I live on top of a hill in a rural community and have seen planes turning with their landing and wing lights on, and in fact the plane tonight had his/hers on for a while, when circling over the tree tops in the approx area the light dissapeared.  The second sighting lasted only 10 min and I came back and and called both SO's again and made a report.  The Miller County SO had sent deputied that way but did not see anything.  I explained that the main reason I called back was seein the airplane circle and look for the light and flew back toward their airport.  I thought maybe the pilot would report it or the radar control person. I am an 34 w/m and have a degree in psychology and another degree in nursing.  I am an emergency room nurse and am open to all things.  I do not drink alcohol, and only take prescribed medication.  I do not use glasses to read or see.  I have a daughter who is 3 yrs old and a wife who is 33 yrs old.  My wife saw the object only for a moment during the second sighting but did watch the plane circle with wing and landing lights on.  I was a army officer for eight years,but am no longer in the military.  My father in law is 55 yrish old  and does not drink alcohol or take medication.  He is retired from the army.   My mother in law was in the car when he saw the light but I am not sure she observed the object. The object appeared only to move in verticle and horizontal directions.  It could change directions quickly.  Once during the second sighting the object appeared to zig zag for a couple of second while changing colors before moving south east and out of sight into the tree line. I am amazed that my video camera would not pick up the bright light on such a clear full moon night. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness does not state explicitly what direction they were looking.  However, it they were looking to the southeast, the first possibility to be eliminated would be the star, Sirius.  PD))",2001-02-18T00:00:00,33.6383,-93.8298

I had visual contact for 1.5 seconds or so. It was a brilliant white ball with a blue and tuquoise type of halo around the core following back to the tail. The tail was impressive. It was a bluish and turquoise color but what was unique, it had two tails of smimilar thickness and length. It was at about 50 degrees above my visible horizon and pased very quickly from east to west then faded like a regular run of the mill falling star.  It seemed to be closer to the earth with more of an arc in it's flight trajectory. Size about a dime at arms lentgh. What really struck me was it's beauty as it passed. When we got to our destination I asked the driver in the lead truck if he had seen it, He got a bit enthusiastic about it and remarked on the brillinace and the many colors and stated it was kinda pretty wans't it.

The Dane who was driving was just as flabergasted as we were at this sight and checked the local radio and television news shows, as well as newspapers for any reports, but their were none.

((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Eric Byler, Oregon UFO Review, for sharing and submitting this very interesting report.  Contact information for OUFOR appears below.  We believe the incident occurred on Monday night/Tuesday morning.  Please see other reports for events over Puget Sound, Washington, for October 15, 2001.  PD)) For the sake of anonymity, the witnesses' names will be Jack and Jill. I met Jill in 1990. She was talked into contacting us by her mother over concerns that she may have been the object of abduction over the period of a lifetime...three times throughout her life, including 1990 when we first began keeping a file on her. I was with MUFON at the time. I have become good friends with Jill and her husband Jack over the years and have had no reports of UFO activity involving her since that first meeting 11 years ago...that is until Monday, October 15th. Around 7:30AM, Tuesday morning, I got a call from Jack. ""Something happened last night"" was what he said as I answered the phone. He handed the phone to Jill and she immediately began crying profusely and out of control as she attempted to tell of what happened. I had to stop her twice to calm her down as I could not understand what she was saying. The night before, Jill and Jack went to bed at 9:30PM. At midnight, Jill was awakened to the dogs in the house ""going nuts"" and to a noise directly above the bedroom outside that was loud enough to vibrate the walls slightly with each pulse. The noise was described by Jill as being the sound you hear when someone takes a large but thin piece of sheet metal and bows it in and out, making that sort of ""whirring"" or ""whipping"" noise that comes from the vibration...only this was higher in pitch, perfectly rythem'd, and many times louder, emanating from directly above the bedroom roof. She described her reaction as nothing less than total uncontrolled fear and panic. The dogs in the house were loud and frantic in their reaction to the noise. During the two minutes that this took place, she was unable to wake Jack as he simply laid asleep, not responding to the deafening noise from above, the panic of the cats and dogs and the screams of Jill to wake up, accompanied by hits to the arm and slaps to the face. Then, the noise disappeared, the cats and dogs were quiet, and within 5 seconds, Jack opened his eyes to see Jill staring at him, holding the cat, with eyes swelled shut and red from crying. ""What?"" Jack said. Jill reports that she was angry beyond words that Jack would not wake up during this but cannot understand why he didn't. Jack got out of bed, turned on the light and opened the bedroom window and listened but all was quiet. He then turned off the TV which had been left on earlier. He turned off the light and went back to bed. Shortly after returning to bed, the chimes on the clock rang on the hour but the tones rang with an intermittent rhythm and backwards from what is normal. Jack and Jill looked at one another, and again Jill began crying. Jill was unable to go to sleep for the rest of the evening. The next evening, I talked with them on the phone and had them go across the street to ask the neighbors if they had seen or heard anything but they were not home. Jack and Jill live in a very rural part of the country with very few neighbors and a lot of forest around their home. On Wednesday morning, I called to check on Jill before she went to work as Jack had already left. I asked if they had bothered to look closely outside for any signs of broken trees around the house. They had not. On the phone I had her go to the glass door that leads from the kitchen to the outside and look out and back toward the back of the house and above to see if she noticed anything. As she opened the door she looked out and yelled ""Oh my God, Eric!"" and began crying again. At the end of the house, just on the other side of the bedroom wall is a deck. Over the rail of the deck by the trees, in view of Jill as she looked down the side of the house, were all five chairs from the deck and the table with all 4 legs broken off, scattered next to the trees. She was unable to get hold of Jack due to where he works. The table and chairs where they lay as found after the incident. Jack called me when he got home that afternoon, before he had talked to Jill, and I guided him on the phone over to the door and had him look out. His reply was, ""oh shit!"" Jack reports seeing the furniture on the patio on early Monday evening as he went out to the deck to return a ladder which is kept under the deck. Jill has many interests, but talking about or following UFO information is not really one of them. She flatly states that she just knows this was a UFO over the house and has no doubt even though she was too terrified to look out the window during the event. Even during the time she was trying to wake up Jack, she was screaming at him that it was a UFO. On Saturday, October 20th, I went out to Jill and Jack's home where I took pictures of the back deck area and took samples of soil and vegetation in the areas where the chairs and table lay on the other side of the deck rail. Some of the pieces of the table legs were scattered around the area, one as far as 11 feet away from the table. Other items were noticeably untouched on the deck including the hot tub cover, a small tarp over that cover, several bottles of tub chemicals, two BBQs, a plant pot with only dirt in it, and a garbage can 1/4 full of garbage. It should also be noted that a yellow ash tray which had a permanent home on the deck was missing. Jack and I spent nearly an hour searching the radius of the area...a very thorough search...and the ash tray was no where to be found. Bothered by this disappearance, Jack continued the search after I left and as of this writing, Sunday afternoon the 21st, it still has not been found and Jack feels it's no longer on the property outside the home. The soil and vegetation samples will be sent to BLT Research for analysis to find out if the area where the chairs lay was exposed to any of the energies described in the research by Levengood, Burke and Talbot. Further findings of this investigation will be found here. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE: On Monday the 22nd, I got mail from our Chief of Investigations Mike Downey of Portland. Mike had gotten a call on his message machine from Tom Henderson of the Polk County Observer Newspaper. Tom was unaware of the Jill and Jack case and was calling to ask if Mike knew anything of a report that he (Tom) had got at the paper over a sighting report that took place on Wednesday the 10th, five days before Jill's encounter. This new report to the paper involved a guy and his wife who saw a reflection of light coming through the window of their mobile home. When they went to investigate, they saw a yellowish, red light shoot away, up into the clouds at a high rate of speed. The couple did not leave their names and was hoping that something might have been mentioned in the paper about it. I contacted Tom at the observer and confirmed the story and that he could not help in locating this couple for questioning. There may be some mention of it in the paper in hopes of bringing these witnesses to OUFOR for a statement. Tom also noted on the phone to me that the paper had in fact gotten ""quite a few"" phone calls over the last couple of years concerning UFO sightings in Polk County. Those sightings were passed on to MUFON. Tom has agreed to pass on further sightings to OUFOR as well. Eric Byler - Assistant State Director, Oregon UFO Research.

I just so happen to look up and notice three stars movng and thought that is odd, so I drove closer, and got out of my car and really took a good look at it. It was relatively low, very quiet, and seem to be very large. At this time, I became nervous, because I knew that what I was watching was not of the norm. Then I got back in my car and followed it for a minute, but then it seem to vanish from my view. It really could be very hard to realize it was there unless you were looking at there at the right time, but once I realized that this was definetly a moving object, it really kind of scared me, because of the size and the whole thing.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,43.7685,-88.0161

I went to my mothers bedroom to see if she dropped something on the floor.  She said no but had heard the noise.  While we were talking, there was another Boom, though with roughly twice the energy and only a single Boom!  That one really rattled the windows!! I turned on the Scanner to see if any thing was reported to the local authorities-nothing.  I got on the Web and checked several sites that have instant reports of quakes and the such-nothing.  While on the Web, there was another Sonic-Boom (characteristic again) at 13:35 hours, local time.  Again, the windows really rattled! What is really interesting, was at 13:45 hours, the National Emergency Radio System was activated--(Nation Wide).  The Notice stated this was a planned event and was in effect until 14:00 hours local time. During the duration of this incident, the sky was completely overcast with visibility of approx. 10 miles, No other aircraft were seen or heard.

Looking South from the Halekulani Hotel on Wikiki beach, 6th floor. I had arrived earlier that day with my wife, and had NOT been drinking.  The hotel balcony is only about 300 feet from the ocean.  I first noticed a disk shaped object hovering what appeared to be 30-40 feet above the beach.  At first I thought this was a seagull sized bird flying in place against the ocean breeze.  This seemed unlikely, since it was 11:15pm and the wind was barely blowing.  My next thought was that this faintly outlined disk shaped object could be a kite.  The object was bobbing and moving like a kite would from my vantage point.  5 seconds later this object moved to my right about 10 degrees behind a palm tree and shortly thereafter re-appeared to the right of the tree.  This convinced me that this was not a kite since the object moved too fast and started to ascend slightly.  The object continued moving in a slightly ascending trajectory to the West (my right)  This movement covered roughly an additional 20 degrees.  Somewhere near this phase of the sighting, the object emmitted a dim red/orange continuous glow, and that's what I tracked for the remainder of the sighting.  As the object moved across the sky to the right, it suddenly reversed directions and started moving East in a relatively straight line. Now I knew that this was like nothing I had ever seen in my life.  The object then moved in a counter clockwise circular motion, followed by another pass from left to right. Finally the dim light stopped for a few seconds and then went straight up and slightly to my right.  After this point, the light became dimmer and dimmer in the black moonless sky.  I called my wife out to see, but she could not pick up the very faint light at this point, roughly 45 degrees off the horizon.  This episode lasted 30-45 seconds.  The next morning I repositioned myself on the balcony in order to guesstimate how far away this object was.  Clearly, the object. depending on it's size, was between 1/8 and 1/4 mile away at the early stages of the sighting. (Well below the horizon) This would make the object size about 20-30 feet across.  I am college educated, and I know what airplanes, helecopters, sattelites, and shooting stars all look like in the night sky.  I did not hear anything; my encounter was only visual.  All these signs tell me that this object was definitely out of this world.  Needless so say, I could not fall asleep for several hours.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,21.32260015003751,-157.84012865716429

PD)) On 09/06/2001, at 0550 hours (EDST) myself and several witnesses viewed a ""missile-shaped"" object just south of Waterford, CT over Long Island Sound.  I am the Armed Response Force Team Leader at Millstone Nuclear in Waterford, CT and several of the witnesses are Armed Response Force Members and/or Licensed Nuclear Reactor Operators. From a distance of approximately one half mile, we witnessed what, at first, appeared to be a rapidly approaching plane heading toward our facility from the direction of Orient Point Long Island, NY.  This appeared as a very bright light approximately 300-400 feet above sea level, moving toward us at a high rate of speed.  The object was flying parallel to the ground at this height until it reached a distance approximately 1/4 mile from our shorline.  It then began a trajectory at approximately 60-70%, still headed in a North-Easterly direction (toward Providence, RI).  At this point, we were able to discern the outline of the object.  It was approximately 35-40' in length and shaped very much like a rocket or missile.  It had a four-fin tail end and swept back wings near the front end.  The wings extended back and outward from the body, but we could not discern the distance they extended outward. As the object began to gain altitude, there were red sparks and bluish/white smoke erupting from the rear.  Although the flight path maintained a North-East bearing, it was evident that the object was not flying in a straight-line manner once it began its' ascent.  The flight path became somewhat erratic as the object continued to gain altitude and proceded northward.  Because of the amount of contrail (which remained visible in the sky for nearly an hour) and the amount of flame being emitted, many of us were convinced the object was going to crash.  Many of the witnesses are former Naval Nuclear personnel and most thought the object was a ""Polaris-type"" missile or some other type of nautically-luanched device.  The weather conditions at the time of this incident were clear, mild, and very little wind,  The air temperature was approximately 60 degrees Farenheit.  There were no other objects visible in the sky and the sun was just rising above the horizon to our East.  we were able to view the object for approximately ane and one-half minutes prior to it becoming indistinct. Because we are a Federally Regulated Nuclear Facility, I made immediate notification to the FAA.  The FAA made inquiries to all the airports on the North East Corridor and none reported any planes down or in trouble at the time of the sighting, however, the FAA had recieved several other phone calls conerning this incident.  The FAA called me back about an hour later and suggested I file this report.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,41.3595,-72.1602

((FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION REPORT:  ERIC BYLER, Oregon UFO Review,  <Oregon UFO Review@home.com>.   Hi Peter,   I just got back from an investigation at the coast where I got the picture you see here along with the negatives.  I am still working on the report and have to make one more follow up call with him to clarify something, but the long and short of it is that the photographer is a ((deleted)) year old man of (partial) American Indian heritage by the name of ((deleted)).  He lives alone with a rather large ((dog)) in a very nice home on the coast of Oregon in a small town named Florence.   ((He)) spends a lot of time on his yard as it looks quite good. On the day of the picture, he was out with his camera...a ((high quality SLR camera))mm  1:3.5 - 4.5...using 35mm 400 film... a very nice camera that he chooses to keep on automatic for the simplicity of pointing and shooting.  He had already made a number of pictures when he approached the plants you see in this picture.   According to his testimony, as he was looking through the view finder and was about to shoot, this image appeared in his view finder.  He quickly hit the shutter button and dropped the camera to see what this was. He estimated the object as being a couple feet wide and glowing like fire with an outer lighter glow that emanated like a heat wave.  He pointed out however that as close as he was, only a few feet away, he could feel no heat.  He thought this as odd.   After a few seconds, the object began to slowly rise until it reached tree level which is quite high as you can see in the picture, the whole time just watching in awe thinking, ""'what in the hell is this?""  Then he realized, hey, take another picture.  He brought the camera up to began lining it up with the object when it did a 90 degree turn and shot away from the house traveling west towards the ocean.  He immediately took the film down to have them developed to see if he indeed had got the object on film.  I have checked out the negatives and the package with the number of pictures that were developed and is does appear that he stopped taking pictures in his yard by the time he got to the picture in question.  My thought is if this were just a reflection of some sort on the lens then it probably would have only shown up when the pictures were developed and he would have continued taking pictures.  The fact that he did indeed stop taking pictures at number ten (the roll goes backward from 24 to 1) and then developed the pictures tell me that he may have indeed seen something of a nature that points away from simple lens reflection and does add up with his story.   I spent some time in the house with ((witness)) and I found him very easy to talk with.  ((Witness) is a big man but soft spoken.  His house is very nice with lots of reference to his heritage seen in the art work on his walls.  He has three ((medals)) permanently displayed on a side table as he was in WW2.  A wall in another room had a number of framed certificates of achievements and education showing his many accomplishments over the years.     In his main den where we talked there was a large volume of books on shelves.  I saw no books pertaining to UFO material as many were related to American Indian heritage   ((Witness)) does not have a computer for internet access but does have basic television.   He has no idea what he saw.  He did contact the police who came over and took a report.  The following day he says he talked to the assistant fire chief while in town and he (the chief) mentioned hearing of a similar report on his scanner that day but remembers it as being on 24th street, rather than 23rd where ((witness)) lives.  I am following up on this.  I did contact the state police who reports that they have had similar reports like this over the past few months in other parts of the coast but did not elaborate.  This is being followed up on as well.   Just in case the photo doesn't come through, go here... http://www.oregonuforeview.com/florence.html ... to view it.

I thought, wow look at the north star tonight, but then I noticed that it was brighter than normal and looked more like a spotlight shining towards my direction than a star.There was absolutely no sound. But it was about the same size in diameter as the stars all around it  which made me think this object is extremely far away and not a star, and not an airplane either. I could see no motion, no blinking, and no flickering whatsever. Then all of the sudden the light went dim, it was about exactly the same brightness of the stars around it then. And to my astonishment, it started moving Northeast in the sky away from me and faded away after about 3 to 5 seconds. The sky was absolutely clear, stars all around it clearly visible, but this object completely disappeared in just seconds. It was obvious that this object was headed towards the ground, then made a sudden turn and went the other direction. It did not cast a beam of light in the new direction it was headed which also makes me believe it was way up there above the atmospheric dust and moisture. I have never reported anything like this before, nor have I ever seen anything that I couldn't explain either. But I am absolutely sure this was no plane, no meteor, or anything that I have ever seen before.  I feel extremely fortunate to have seen this and doubt I'll ever see another one, but I would love to hear from anyone who might have seen this thing as well. After thinking about this incident for about 45 minutes and explaining it to my wife I decided to log into the internet to see if there was a place to log such sitings and I came accross this site.  I am not a UFO enthusiest or anything but I thought I would share it with someone who might appreciate it. I wrote this about 1 hour after I saw it while the incident was still fresh on my mind. j.baynard",2001-10-12T00:00:00,,

While walking down the street something appeared in my peripheral vision.  Something was glowing to my right and this illumination was about 30 feet in the air.  As soon as my vision settled on the clump of mass, and my vision is ultra clear and good at distance viewing, the glowing orange yellow fire transformed into a ball object about basketball sized.  This ultra fast change appeared to be through a small explosion.  There was no shockwave or noise.  All of this happened in approximately 1.5 seconds.  100% quick rings then traveled across the front of the house.  This is what that ball changed in to.  It seemed the rings emerged simultaneously as the ball emerged and exploded from the growing clump of mass.  The rings were 3 or more feet in size and they kept their shape as they flashed and strobed.  They went from the street to the roof area of the house in what appeared to be a tiny sliver of time.  I was still able to track these parts through time.  These ring forms then combined into a single perfectly circular disk about 4 feet across.  This object was reveled to me in its unobstructed entirety.  I had a full frontal view of this disk.  It was stationary at the roof area of the house and perfectly circular.  It's coloration was off-white.  The object was not empty.  I saw shadows within.  They were about 2 feet long and narrow.  The sides of these shadowy objects were wavy.  There was not a flicker of movement as this disk levitated in front of me.  I gazed at it for approximately 2 seconds.  It then left my field of vision on a vanish.  It did not fade away or streak into the sky under some discernable propulsive power.  This single series of unique events occurred in the sequence I report.  The specific moments and incidents occurred at that time and place.  The events that happened will be remembered.  For the remainder of my life I will have a blast of total remote recall.  It will be remembered vividly.  On that morning something alien fully entered my consciousness.  Something unc! anny and mysterious inserted itself into my consciousness.

It was cigar shaped, silver.It engulfed the airplane as the airplane flew behind the object. It did not move. It seemed the sun was shinning on it but the shape was very defined. The plane kept moving and the object was still.I counted 11 as I was thinking this has to be real because the airport has just opened, no blimps, no small aircraft, no helicopters were allowed.Then as I blinked it was gone.

It was just dark; I could easily see all major stars, (ie Vega, Arcturus, etc.). We were facing south, with Denver to the northeast. I had my telescope setup (8” reflector) and I was observing Mars at the time, with my high power eyepiece. Then our organizer said, “What is that?” As we followed his hand, we saw to the left and down range a strobing sphere, about the size of a mini-van. I don’t dare estimate its altitude or distance from us. There were no reference points to compare to. Its heading was northwest and speed was faster then a small plane and slower then a jet. It didn’t change heading or speed for the entire time that we observed it. As it reached its closest point to us, I could observe the following:  It was a sphere, it strobed at 6 cycles per sec. (approximately), It made no sound, It was red-orange in color I was able to exchange eyepieces to my low power one and target three places before I saw it in my telescope. It looked no different than when it was closer. I was not able to see any more detail. Immediately after our sighting, Stan Romanek drove up in his van.

The rainy season is during monsoon around oct /nov.) My first sighting was certainly not during the rainy season. I was a bachelor then and as usual I entered my hostel room and opened all the windows and went on to remove my shoes and all most at once the windows slammed crazily with a sudden gust of wind and simultaneously it became dark , I came on to the balcony and scanned the sky and to my surprise the sky which was so clear hardly 5 min before had turned into inky blue, but only to a limited area . Above the dark clouds I saw a flash of red light and thought that it was an aircraft perhaps going to land. Then all of a sudden I noticed that the moving light was not flickering and that it had already come to a stand still . My mind was trying to figure out 'is that a chopper, no chance if it was one then the sound of the chopping blades should be audible. ( from the time of the sudden slamming of the window my mind was strangely working on the UFO lines) Then I saw that the RED light had changed to ORANGE and as well grew larger in diameter - I should say it was almost having a sharp oval shape. Now the colors began to change in waves of pink,yellow,orange,red....  it appeared that it was emerging from the bottom of the craft , perhaps from a single light point having the characteristics of changing its color like a chameleon. The light flowed from that point and simultaneously increased the sharp oval diameter and as well as the luminosity. I knew that I need a witness now and therefore dashed to the next room and found one of the inmates and forced him out to have a look at  the unbelievable phenomenon. He gaped at it for a while and then asked me what it was and went on to say whether it is a plane or a helicopter. I asked him to observe as keen as possible with out diverting the concentration. Then the craft began to HOVER  so very slowly and majestically with all its splendor and glory circling elliptically and moving in our direction and stopped again , then after a moment it started to move fast in a straight line parallel to the Earth's surface maintaining the height perhaps around the height of a 6 to10 story building (we were on the 2nd floor)    . Then the light  which  was so wide spread , shrunk back to its point of origin , the mid point of the bottom of the craft and then it zipped into nothingness perhaps changed into another dimension????? CHAPTER  : II The story of this sighting went around and finally surfaced a couple of days later when there was a gathering of the hostel mates around 10 pm and the location was an open balcony on the II floor of the building. The entire group which was all set to make fun of me on the subject of UFO , began to do so by countering every detail which I was providing them,emphasizing that what I saw, (which was as well witnessed by the next  room mate ) was an UFO and not an imagination. Even the witness kept tight lipped during the entire course. And as the commotion got heated up,  I said that someday I will show them what I had seen and that could happen even today , saying so I look up into the sky, My God , I saw the craft circling almost above us, the sky was so clear and almost above that UFO was the bright full moon , it was like a heavenly spotlight focusing on the UFO. What more do I need , it was My turn to bully them and asked them what on earth they were seeing , each one began saying that it was an airplane, a helicopter etc but then finally they realized that what so ever they were seeing was unexplainable .An UFO???? CHAPTER III There after for over a period of more than an year and a half , I used to see the UFO frequenting the Chennai sky (Madras sky). During most of my sightings,  I observed that the UFOs would be coming from the  direction of the airport towards the sea coast,  to be more specific that was the landing route of most of the aircraft . Most of the time these UFOs were moving very lazily stopping here and there and when once they reach the coast line they would fly parallel to the coast towards the nearby rocket launching station. On two occasion I saw the UFO chasing an aircraft almost zipping from far behind and on reaching the top of the aircraft  it used cut down the speed almost at once effortlessly and then travel along with the speed of the air craft . Am sure that these UFOs will be seen everyday in the Chennai skys, but when I realized that I was going nowhere by simply observing them, I gave up sky watching. Am willing to answer any specific questions on the above sightings which could help the science of UFOs.

All I remember is I was just staring at it, almost fixated.  While I was staring I remember my friends they said to get a camera to eachother, then I remember the flashes of the camera.  Then that was it.  I dont remember anything after that.  But what was wierd is that I finally remembered that night three years later.  I dont know how to explain it, its like I forgot that moment it happened, then remembered it three years later.  When I was telling the story to one of my friends, they asked if I ever asked my friend and her sister about it.  I said no.  So I called my friend and I got her sister.  I asked her if she remembers that night and she said yes.  So then I asked her what happened after we saw the UFO.  She said she deosnt remember.  So couple years later I finally ask my friend.  I asked her what we did after we saw the UFO?  She said, ""Didnt we go outside or something?""  So I dont know.  But it was weird. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness remains anonymous.

Long white streak in the sky above where the sun had just set - became bigger and began to move downwards from a 2 0'clock position in the North-western sky.  after about ten minutes it was moving faster and faster eventually revealling a very bright head at the bottom end of the streak - I then realized that the streak was actually the tail.  At the height of the event, it was moving  as fast as a jet across the sky and the head was very bright.  Suddenly the streak (tail) disapeared and about a second later apearred on the opposite side of the head (in a 10'clock position).  At that moment it stopped moving downwards and seemed to stay in a relatively stable position moving slightly upwards again in the distance.  After this it just got smaller and smaller as it faded towards the horizon.  All in all this occurred between 9:05 and 9:25 pm with the most dramatic part being about 30 seconds.  VERY dramatic and bright - I was walking across the Granville st. bridge from work and myself, a co-worker and at least 15 other people stopped and stood viewing what was happenning.  I phoned the news stations when I got home, but although they said they had recieved calls about it, without camera footage they did not care.  In retrospect it seemed to have been a comet or meteor entering and exiting the atmosphere with the moment when the tail suddenly changed direction probably being the time when it was closest to the Earth (and land/water).  Actually scared the #*!@ out of me during that moment because it was so bright and fast (and probably a HUGE object up there).

The whole sighting lasted approximately 7 seconds. About 2-3 minutes later I heard one single boom.

The first time I saw it I thought it was strange but blew it off simply as stars.  However, since I've seen it again, thought it might be worth sharing. Not really sure if it is a UFO per se, but it is definately not like anything I've seen before. Would love it if someone could explain what it is. Around about the same time it was before, 4:00-4:30 a.m., I went outside for a smoke because I was having problems sleeping.  Outside, over I 43 west of Beloit, going towards Milwaukee, there was one very big extremely bright and intense white light in the sky and a smaller light on it's lower right side, stationary in the sky.  I noticed it right away because as I stepped outside the garage it was located directly in front of me.  I looked around to see if there were any other ""stars"" in the sky, because the sun was about to come up and I was surprised to see such a huge bright light at that time of the day.  As I turned back around, to look at the bright light and the smaller one, I saw another smaller white light  coming from the east side of the big bright light moving west towards it.  (It was small like the other light on it's lower right side.)  When it got in a position to where it made all the three lights form a triangle, it stopped.  Maybe 2 minutes after that, (still smoking so it wasn't that long)I heard and saw an airplane fly towards the smaller light that had just recently moved towards the big light.  As the airplane got closer to the light, the bright light in the center, changed shapes, it got oblonged and grew 2 armlike looking things from it (like a stick person without the legs). While it was doing this, the light got really intense.  The airplane went around it.  Then, not more than 1 or 2  minutes later (still smoking the same cigarette), another airplane to the right of me this time came from behind me, and flew towards the triangle and again, when it got close, the big light in the middle got oblonged and the arms came out, and the brightness increased. The airplane flew past it.  I came inside the house but went back out just before the sun came out (about 45 minutes later) to see if it could be seen in the day light.  When the sun came out, I could still see it. (It was that bright!) But it didn't stay long.  It got smaller and smaller and just disappeared, in a matter of seco! nds.  If anyone lives along, or near the I 45 freeway between Beloit and Milwaukee Wisconsin, check it out, it's a neat sight.  Like I said this is the second time that I have seen it, and both times were early in the morning around 4:00-4:30 a.m. before sunset.",2001-08-05T00:00:00,42.5584,-89.1599

Three cars were pulled off to the side of road to observe the orb.  The witness flashed her hi-beam lights at the orb.  The orb came very close to the witness's car.  The witness drove and followed the orb for several minutes and eventually lost sight of it behind the trees.  The witness's husband was following behind and also saw the orb. The sighting was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center on the same evening that it occurred.  Subsequently MUFON investigators Dr. Joseph Ryan and William Puckett investigated the sighting.  The results of the investigation are described below. INVESTIGATIVE NOTES We made two trips to the Enumclaw area to investigate the alleged sighting.  The first trip was made in December of 2001.  In this trip we did not interview the witness, but we surveyed the area, took pictures, and made some environmental readings to ascertain anything unusual in the area.  We also talked to the police dispatcher to find out the police received any ufo reports recently.  The dispatcher told us that the last report that he received was about six years ago.  The dispatcher did not recall the details the six-year old sighting.  When taking measurements of  the environment  we did find extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic readings to be above normal for an area removed from electrical interference.  Readings of around 5 milliGauss were obtained close to Nolte State Park where the orb was observed.  (Although no clear guidelines exist for exposure to ELF it is recommended that exposure not exceed 2 milliGauss.) We observed nothing else unusual about the area. On February 9, 2002 we made an appointment to visit with the witness and her daughter.  We conducted an extensive interview including a tour of the area where the red orb was sighted.  The results of our interview are briefly described below: The witness drove us through the area where the orb was sighted.  The area was along Cumberland road to the northeast of Enumclaw.  (See road highlighted in red on the map.)  The orb was first sighted when the witness saw two towers each of which had a red light.  The red light appeared to be close to the towers.  The light then moved closer and grew larger.  The witness then saw three cars parked along the road and the passengers were outside observing the orb.  (The witness did not know any of the other witnesses.) The witness continued driving towards the orb and flashed her lights.  At that time the orb moved very close to the witness's car to the point where her entire view was obscured by the red orb.  At this point the witness was driving under 10 mph, but doesn't know how she could steer.  She felt as if the orb was guiding her.  (This was interesting because at the point where the orb obscured her view a steep curve was immediately ahead.)  The witness had the impression that the orb was intelligent or under intelligent control because of the way it responded when she twice flashed her lights.  The witness said that orb emitted no heat, sound, or odor.  The witness also said that she had no fear of the orb at the time and neither she nor her daughter suffered ill effects during or after the sighting.  The witness did say that her van began malfunctioning the day after the sighting.  It is possible that the van problems were due to effects other than the sighting. The witness did not strike the orb with her car, but either went through it or believes that it evaded her somehow when she otherwise should have struck it when it was directly in front of her, and so close that it blinded the entire road from her vision.  She traveled quite some distance with the orb in this ""blinding position,"" but did not recall how far.  She estimated that she drove for approximately 8 seconds while so ""blinded.""  She negotiated turns perfectly during this time, however. Subsequent to the ""close encounter,""  the witness lost sight of the orb when it moved behind some tall trees.  The orb was moving eastward towards the Cascade Mountains.  The witness noted that some aircraft were pursuing the orb before it moved out of her view.  The witness then returned home, but went out on her rear deck to see if she could sight the orb.  The orb was not sighted, but the witness noticed several strange aircraft in the area which had been pursuing the orb throughout much of time that it was in view.  These aircraft are triangular shaped and sometimes move quite slowly and hover.  The witness said that on this particular night one particular one was hovering close to her home. She estimated that the size of the triangular aircraft were about ""fighter aircraft"" size. A few minutes after the witness returned home her husband arrived.  He was following behind the witness and also saw the orb.  The witness also said that her husband saw the aircraft ""hovering"" from their home.  The husband has not been interviewed.  The only other witness was the six year-old daughter of the witness.  The daughter was interviewed in the presence of the witness and also saw the red orb.  The daughter drew us a picture of a spherical orb which suggested that it was quite close to the ground.  The daughter told us that the orb was about the size of a car tire. One of the witness's neighbors heard a strange sound on the night of the sighting of the red orb.  The neighbor did not see anything unusual. The other mystery associated with this sighting is the strange aircraft that witness said were pursuing the orb.  The witness says that she has seen these aircraft on a regular basis during the past three years.   She says that the aircraft are triangular shaped, can rapidly change speed or direction, fly low, and sometimes hover.  The lights on the triangular aircraft were almost consistent with modern USAF aircraft - two bright white lights center and front and both a ""blue"" and red light at points along the sweep of the triangle on either side.  If the ""blue"" lights that she observed/observes were/are actually green, the lights would match current conventions for placement of night lights.  She was absolutely sure of the color ""blue,"" however. The witness said on one occasion that she could see two pilots and could make out of the pilot's features (blond hair).  The pilot was clearly human.  The witness has a job in which she works in the early hours of the morning.  She sights these aircraft in the early morning hours.  Sightings are more frequent on clear nights (95% of the time).  She says that the aircraft come from the Auburn area and sees them coming and going in the general direction of Auburn.  The witness said that the aircraft fly quite low (75 to 1000 feet) and generally fly from west to east (when coming from Auburn).  Sometimes the lower flying aircraft appear to simply ""disappear"" behind trees that are relatively close or even house tops right across the street. In addition to witness testimony, we decided to obtain radar data for the time period when the witness had the sighting.  The radar data did not reveal any aircraft in the vicinity of Cumberland Road where the witness sighted the orb.  However, radar data did show several slow moving aircraft to the north and west of Enumclaw.  This is the general direction where the witness frequently sights these aircraft.  (See map.  On the map The aircraft are coded with red arrows which show the direction of movement.  Estimated speeds are also shown.)  The radar data shows several aircraft moving quite slowly (under 70 mph).  Two aircraft were observed flying at speeds of conventional aircraft (200 and 360 mph respectively).  The radar data showed the normal heavy traffic in and out of SeaTac Airport.  As expected these aircraft were moving at more conventional speeds expected for commercial aircraft.  A check of weather data on this night shows light southerly to calm winds at weather stations throughout the Puget Sound area.  Skies were partly cloudy with weather radar showing some widely scattered rain showers.  The witness said that it was clear in the area where the orb and other aircraft were observed. We also contacted both Whidbey Island Naval Air Station and McChord Air Force Base to establish if any military aircraft were in the area at the time of the sighting of the orb.  The Air Force said that no aircraft were in the area on the evening of the sighting.  The Navy said that two F18's were flying from Miramar into Payne Field at Everett, but were above 15,000 feet.  These aircraft flew over the Enumclaw area about 6 pm which is about 45 minutes before the witness sighted the orb. Another note of interest is that the same witness has sighted other orbs in the area.  She sighted a green orb two years back which she describes as about the size of a full moon.  She also sighted another red orb over Enumclaw which was more ""fish"" or ""cigar"" shaped. We did not record when this sighting had occurred.  We have a record that red orbs have been sighted over the Enumclaw area before.  In February, 1996 a red orb was sighted.  A picture was snapped of this orb.  We showed the picture to the witness, after the interview, and she said that the picture looked exactly like what she and her family saw. CONCLUSION/SUMMARY This case has been extensively investigated.  Detailed interviews have been conducted, meteorological and radar data have been collected, inquiries to FAA, Whidbey Naval Air Station, and McChord Air Force Base have been made.  We have collected electromagnetic readings in the vicinity of the sighting, taken pictures, and have performed a general survey of the area. The red orb in this case is unexplained.  The case is weakened somewhat by the lack of  ""unrelated witnesses.""  The case is strengthened by virtue of the fact that other red orbs have been sighted in the area.  It is pure conjecture to guess at what the orb was.  Some scientists believe that orb-like sightings are more common in seismically active areas and that the earth releases gases which show up as nocturnal lights.  The Enumclaw area is close to Mt. Rainier which is an active volcano (currently not erupting).  Nocturnal lights have been sighted extensively on the Yakima Indian Reservation and in Hessdalen, Norway.  However, the Sweden and Yakima lights are generally not red in color.  More yellowish or white colors are common. (See references 1 and 2.) A check of astronomical data for the date and time of sighting shows that Jupiter was low on the northern horizon at the time of sighting.  However, it is unlikely that Jupiter would account for the brightness, movements, and apparent intelligence of the orb. The above normal low frequency electromagnetic readings in the area are interesting.  These readings were obtained well removed from power lines and other known electrical equipment.  A few scientists attribute higher readings in the areas of volcanoes.  Perhaps Mt. Rainier could be responsible for the above normal readings.  However, this is not widely accepted amongst the scientific community. The mysterious aircraft that the witness saw pursuing the orb on the night of the sighting are also unexplained.  However, the witness believes (and we agree) that the aircraft are piloted by humans and could be secret military aircraft.  The witness regularly sees these aircraft at night.  The radar data suggests that some slow moving aircraft were in the area on the night of the sighting.  However, no aircraft were seen on radar where the witness saw the orb and the aircraft.  This does not mean that the aircraft were not there.  (They could have been too low to be picked by radar or stealth aircraft.)  Radar data is difficult to interpret and sometimes will pick up cars, birds etc.  We did overlay data with streets and did not see echoes moving along well traveled roads.  This suggests that the echoes were aircraft. We conclude that the witness has been truthful and very likely encountered the orb.  We also believe that the aircraft are unidentified, but of human origin.  The orb is unexplained.  The orb could be an unknown natural phenomenon or a vehicle of a higher intelligence. We plan to conduct further studies of the aircraft in the area.  We are planning to collect more radar data and have received several detailed follow-up reports from the witness.  We are going to make some early morning trips to Enumclaw and see if we can sight any aircraft.  We are hopeful to collect useful data in the form of videos and pictures.

I stepped out behind our house after dinner to get something out of our storage shed.  pon leaving the shed, I glanced up at the sky as I locked the shed door. The sky was clear.  It was early twilight.  Almost directly overhead was a triangular shaped craft.  completely quiet.  The triangle would be roughly a 70 - 70 - 40 degree triangle with the apex of the 40 degree angle apparently the front of the craft.  The apex of the nose was blunt as if the front few feet were removed.  It left a distinct triangle with a square front end.  Along each edge (left and right) was a defined area that was slightly lighter extening front to back and possibly 8 to 10 feet wide.  In essence, it looked like two stripes, one along each edge of the triangle (but not the back edge).  Set in each of the stripes and spaced equidistant from each other and within the area of the stripe were circles that looked like dull dome lamps.  The circles were perhaps 6 to 8 feet in diameter.  I believe there were 5 along each edge.  I don't recall if there were these circles along the rear edge or not. In the area between the two edge stripes and starting perhaps half-way back from the leading edge of the craft was an area that appeared to be somewhat darker than the rest of the craft.  It was uniform in color but only a part of a shade darker.  The curious thing here is that while I've described a craft with stripes and lights, it was very pale against the twilight sky.  I don't believe that I would have seen it if I hadn't just by luck looed straight at where it was.  The color was almost the color of th sky with just a little difference.  The overall shape, the stripe area, the large circular lights were definite shapes but the color was so weak as to be almost blended with the ambient image of the sky.  There was no sound.  I waited and listened closely for several seconds to see if I could perceive sound.  There was none. I live next to a little league ball field.  The field lighting was on.  I almost believe that reflected light ! from the field was what enabled me to see this thing.  From a size standpoint, there is no way to know.  If the visual cues from other aircraft I know are valid, and if the altitude was from 1500 to maybe 2000 feet, then the craft was about 120 feet long and 50 or 60 feet wide at the back.  If that was valid, then I would estimate the speed at around 100 to 150 knots.  If the size cues were wrong, then the actual size could be anything.  We live onthe edge of an extended traffic pattern for Scottsdale Airport.  It was curious that the craft had no  beacon or anticollision lights.  That makes me believe that it should have been much higher than I think because of the danger of collision in an airport traffic pattern. I don't recall the altitude requirements to cross over the airport control space but I think it's around 7500 feet.  If the craft was at that altitude it would have been enormous andwould have been moving at perhaps 300 or 400 knots.  I'm a former military pilot.  I know aircraft.  My distance vision is excellent.  I've never seen anything like this before.  I can say what it wasn't.  It was no known aircraft in the inventory of any country I'm aware of.  It was not a hang glider, an ultra-light, baloon, F11, B2, Beechcraft Starship, Dick Rutan creaation, or anything else I can think of.  It was not shaped like a blimp and besides, you can hear them easily.  I watched the craft for approximately 10 seconds until it disappeared behind a tree that blocked my vision.  It held a steady course, altitude, and speed - traveling from southeast to northwest.  I have filed a report with MUFON some time ago.  I just found out about your group today on the radio.

I looked down Commercial st towards Albert Park to see an object floating in the air level with the top of the nearest biulding to us in the st.    It was very close to us, approx 20 metres up and 20 metres away and looked very big!! We saw a disc shaped craft (classic looking UFO) with a lot of glass looking windows on the top of the craft with lots of white light inside.   The bottom of the object was tilted towards us and I could see the flat disc shaped bottom of the object.    There were several half spheres prodruding from the base with lights shining from the edges of the spheres. It was at that point I thought 'Its a UFO!!'    It reminded me very much of many pictures I have seen on TV and magazines. The object was quickly lost from our sight when a biulding obscured it as the taxi driver had not seen the object and had continued driving.   I made the driver go round the block and then drive around the area for 20 minutes.   We never saw anything further. The next day I scoured the papers, news on the tv and internet for other reportings, I never saw any other mention of this object.   This did seem strange to both me and my girlfriend as the object was very big and in the middle of Melbourne??? We went back the following night and nothing looked similar to what we saw.

I'm a 48 yr old male with a BS in marine biology from the Univ. of Miami. I've studied botany, zoology, geology, meteorology, astronomy, chemistry and physics, i. e. I have a solid background in the natural sciences. I currently work as a fisheries observer collecting scientific data for the state of Alaska and the federal (US) government. I have never before seen or reported a UFO. On the night of 9/14/01, while doing a tour of Canada by car, I decided to camp just N of km 85 on the Trans Labrador Hwy (provincial road 389)in the province of Quebec. The nearest town was Baie-Comeau at the beginning of the highway and my campsite was miles from any human habitation in the Laurentian Mountains. I was utterly alone in the Canadian bush and I don't recall one vehicle passing on the road after about 20:00 hours. My campsite was off a small dirt driveway leading to some high tension power lines about 300 meters to the east (the  driveway was blocked about 10 meters west of my campsite) and about 50 meters off the main paved highway. I was invisible from the road. Directly across the main road was another dirt driveway, very overgrown and rarely used. I walked about one km down this road the next morning looking for signs of human use but saw only one set of very old tire tracks. Clearly no one lived nearby. About 100 meters to the south of my campsite was an intersection with a paved road leading to a hydroelectric project. The road was a T junction and traveled west away from my location. I drove for a mile the next morning on this road and saw no one or any sign of human habitation. The weather was cold with a hard frost occurring on the morning of the 15th. There was not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind. There was complete silence without even the rustle of leaves. After setting up my tent around 20:00, I sat in my car reading under the dome light until right around 22:00 hours. I looked at my watch and decided it was time to turn in. I often admire the skies at night and stood outside doing just that for a few minutes before retiring. A brighter than average yellow ""star"" just above the horizon (there was a low ridge to the east of me)caught my eye but my first thought was that it was probably Venus. As I watched it, I thought I could see the vague shimmer of green and red lights, obviously a plane in the distance or so I thought. That didn't explain the yellow light but I didn! 't think of that until later. The odd thing about it was that it wasn't moving. Planes always move somewhere. This really aroused my curiousity and I grabbed my Minolta 7 x 50 binoculars to get a better look. The object was bright yellow with a pulsating green light on one side and red on the other but completely stationary. As reference points were three pine trees which I thought were near the top of the ridge to the west; since these were in my field of vision with the object I could gauge any movement. The next day I discovered that one of the trees was actually on the roadside about 75 meters from me; the other two were near the top of the ridge. As I studied this thing it began to move very slowly and I then observed a white beam of light (it had almost a bluish tint to it) aimed toward the ground appearing much like a searchlight from a helicopter. I could not see any evidence that it reached the ground. As it moved it moved behind the nearest tree and I expected it to disappear but then it passed in front of this tree which I'd estimated to be about 300 meters away, much closer than I'd imagined. The next morning I discovered that this tree was only about 75 meters from me. I continued to watch it through my binoculars and observed a pair of beams of light shine out from the main orb. Again, they did not appear to reach the ground that I could see and emanated about one diameter from the object before dispersing. The object itself appeared to be between 30 and 45cm (12 to 18 inches) in diameter. When the beams disappeared, a blue light remained in the center of the red and green lights with about an equal intensity. Next the lights quickly faded to a red point of light not more than a couple of inches (5cm) in diameter much like the light of a laser pointer and it began to move like in a laser light show in an erratic fashion like an insect around a night light. The odd thing was that it never moved outside of the silhoette of the tall and narrow pine. After one or two minutes of this unusual behavior, the red l ight changed back to the larger yellow (no other colors reappeared) which slowly moved down and to the north. It slowly disappeared, obscured by the undergrowth, to the roadbed. I only realized the next morning that it was on the road although even when I thought it was 300 meters away, the hair on the back of my neck was standing and I thought of abandoning my tent and coming back in the morning. I doubt if I'd have had the courage to get a closer look. The next morning I thoroughly checked out the entire area looking for any evidence of anything unusual. If one were to do this for Hollywood, how would it be done? The hovering lights could be done by a remote controlled device, possibly an electric motor, but not a sound was heard all night. Nothing and it was dead calm. As for the laser light, there was only one point because of the undergrowth and the height of the sighting where it would have been possible (it was not possible from the road) and that was about 10 meters from my tent surrounded by undergrowth making it impossible to move in complete silence. Also there was no signs of disturbed ground debris or soil, no footprints, no evidence whatsoever. No vehicles passed until early the next morning and I heard no sounds whatsoever so I have to conclude that due to the remoteness of the site and the results of my investigation that the chance of this being an elaborate prank is extremely slim although not impossible. Why would someone go through the trouble? I really don't think so but if it wasn't a prank, what the hell was this thing that I studied for 20 minutes with binoculars? I know of nothing in the natural world that would fit the discription of this thing and have no answers.",2002-01-11T00:00:00,49.2167,-68.15

She was the witness of the event. At approx 1 am in the morning. I'm not sure of the exact date, I was sleeping over at my girlfriends house. We had been watching some boxing matches that night and after they had finished we started getting ready for bed. I went on the computer to do some stuff and my girlfriend went outside for a cigarette. We are on the second story of a 4 unit apartment and she went outside on the balcony. The balcony faces in a north-west direction. Her apartment is within one block of the detroit river that seperates windsor and detroit. Let me just say that I have been studying UFO's for a very long time and in the back of my mind I feel I may have been abducted at about 7 or 8 years  old. But everytime I talk aout UFO's or the X-files or anyother conspiracy theories she gets upset and tells me to keep it to myself because she didn't believe any of it and nothing I said could change her mind. Well we've been together for 3 years now and I havn't convinced her of my views one bit and up until the moment she saw the ufo she was in total disbelief. Well my girlfriend was sitting out on the balcony for about 2 minutes when I heard her call my name. I didn't think anything of it and brushed it off. She than called my name again and I thought maybe it would be something going on so just as I was getting up my girlfriend came in the door and told me to come outside. She seemed pretty excited to I rushed right out. When I got out, she was looking up at the sky. As I walked up to her and started looking up she told me that she had seen a black object moving in the sky. Like I said I have followed ufo's for a long time now so I believed her and started looking for the object. I didnt' see anything in the sky so I went around back and looked around but still didn't see anything. I looked in every direction but it was gone. When we got back in the apartment she told me that what she saw was a totally black object with no lights at all. She could not describe the shape of it but because of the shape of it she could tell that it was not a plane. It was a very clear night and she said the object wasn't very high off the ground. So it would easily be below 10,000 ft. When we settled down a bit and got back into the house I called the local pigs, whoops, I mean Police. and tried to make a report. I had no Idea who else to call. When I told her that I wanted to report a ufo she started laughing and ridiculing me asking me if I had seen anyone aboard it or anything. I got very offended  and told her that it was a brainwashed responce to ridicule people that witness ufos and laughter and ridicule are the reasons people do not come out with their encounters to the public and than I hung up. I dont' know what else to tell you. From the time my girlfriend called my name to the time I got outside was only about 30 seconds to a minute so this wasn't much of an encounter, but my girlfriend said the object wasn't moving very fast. Thank you for your time and if you have any questions please feel free to email me or even call me at 519-((number deleted)). I will get my girlfriend and myself to answer any questions you may have. P.S. In writing this report I hope that you are not connected to the governement in anyway and will just use my stroy in helping with the cover up.

I hardly had time to focus on it before it flew out of sight over the south horizon.  It was black and had a slight rectangular shape without wings or lights.  I estimated it to be about the size of a car, but it could have been much larger. I probably focused on it no more than 5 seconds. It made no sound and travelled much faster than any conventional craft that I have ever seen in my 63 years. It flew as straight as an arrow. I would never have known it was there if I had not already been looking at the nearby plane.

Driving southbound on Harrison Street at 9th Avenue--- STRANGLY ENOUGH where about a year ago I had a dream of seeing a UFO- I spotted a shiny object in my front field of vision. I slowed down, stuck my head out the window, and it just vanished. I thought it might just be a common sun reflection off of a plane. However, it now occurs to me that the sun reflection would have to be on the OTHER side of the plane, as I was north of the object.<P> I kept looking up in the sky casually, though slightly alerted. I then got in the turn lane of Colorado Blvd, waiting for traffic to clear to make a left turn eastbound. I then spotted either another object or the same object high in the eastern part of the sky. It was a VERY bright dot- just hanging in one spot, and rock solid, not moving at all.<P> I made my turn, and immediately parked the car on 6th Ave.<P> I got out of the car, and looked up to see a bright object, again totally immovable in the sky, about 60 degrees up from the horizon. Imagine how bright this object must have been to catch my attention from inside my car, waiting to make a turn, in broad daylight. I had one small Fuji Finepix 2.1 (4 MP extension) megapixel digital camera in the car which I used to take about 10 pictures, the best of which are below. This camera has only a 3X zoom lens-- IT FIGURES! This day I did not have my high power digital zoom video camera with me (never again!!)<P> Never the less, you can clearly see the object between the light and the curve of the lower tree branch.<P> Upon enlarging, the object appears to be a metallic sphere, with light reflecting off of the upper right hand side- facing the position of the sun. <P> I watched the completely stationary object for about 15 minutes, up and down the street, even driving around the block , and confirmed its presence by talking with about six other people waiting for the bus (they had not seen it until I pointed it out, then confirmed it was there). <P> I then decided to quickly drive home and get my telescope and more powerful cameras with stronger lenses. From my home a mile away, the object was not visible. When I returned to the exact same spot about 10-15 minutes later the object could no longer be seen. <P> I returned home and checked my computer sky chart program to see if there were any planets or bright stars in that part of the sky- and there was nothing at all. The brightest star above the horizon was Vega, and at 3 PM, it was completely invisible, as well as not being in the same part of the sky where I had seen this object. <P> I considered that it could be a mylar birthday or maybe another balloon reflecting sunlight, but given the amount of time that I watched it, its' apparent size at a distance and brightness (I could judge it was very high up from my perspective as I moved down the street, and that it did not budge any perceptible amount whatsoever during this time, this seemed pretty much impossible. A balloon in the atmosphere would move up or to the side- and this object was absolutely rigid in one location, as a star would be (and I ruled out any possibility of celestial object with my investigation). <P> I thought that maybe it could be a stationary satellite reflecting the sun, and so I would return on the next day and see if it was again visible. I returned again to the exact same spot at the exact same time the following day with the same weather and carefully scanned the same part of the sky, but absolutely nothing could be seen, ruling out a stationary satellite.

My first inclination was that it had to be a meteor.  It was the brightness & green color of fireworks but the size, speed, closeness, & lateral movement across the sky made it apparent that it was not that.   We both jumped up & went onto the porch to see if we could determine what it was.  It was very quiet outside & I was surprised at how clear the sky was- especially for Seattle this time of year.  We turned on the news to see if anyone else had witnessed this- that's when we decided to check this websight & report what we saw.   The interesting thing is that 3 days ago (on 10/18) someone had reported seeing the same thing in this area.  The object was travelling in the NW direction & they noticed aircraft going in that same direction.

Thought it was odd because it was not blinking (maybe not a plane) and very low on the horizon (maybe not a satellite).  Then we see it go behind a dark spot in the sky (cloud, about 20 miles away and about 2500 feet above our ground level of 6000 feet.)  The light turns, goes into the dark spot (Cloud?) and what comes out on the other end are three MEGA Size lights (one at a time like blinking on 1 then on 2 then  on 3).  How big?  The lights were no less than twice the size of my trailer and sharp brilliant, like the light you would see if you were looking at Jupiter.

After drawing my attention to the sky with the sounds of loud music, a UFO hovered over my house traveling at a slow speed. The size of the craft was around 40 feet in diameter hovering about 200 feet above the house. It was emitting a loud, distorted noise that could have been music. It was spinning slightly and moving at about 25-35 mph. It was saucer shaped and had various lights around the vehicle. The time was around 3 to 5 o'clock in the day. After staring in awe for around 10 seconds, I ran to  the front porch thinking where I could find a camera inside. I decided that I would miss the opportunity to see the craft again and therefore turned to watch the craft float off into the distance. My Mother, Brother, and I all stared at each other in bewilderment. My conclusion after all these years is that the research on the 1965 'Abrocar' experiment in Nevada was not cancelled. From my research, the hovering vehicle was manufactured in somewhere in Nevada and flown and tested in an air force base in Canada. It is possible that we witnesses the experimental vehicle en route to the testing facility. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My experience began as I left a friend's house early one morning.  I drove to the end of his driveway, stopping to look each way.  The road, Pekin, is dark and deserted, with scattered homes and small farms on each side.  As I looked to my left, a line of brightly colored lights rose above the treetops 100 yards away and stopped in mid air. There were six lights, flashing on and off similar to a moving sign, or what you might see on a tiny portion of the Goodyear blimp.  They flashed red, green and white as they moved, from left to right.  I rolled down my window, expecting sound, but there was none.  Extending my arm out the window, and using my left index finger as a gauge, I noted that the line of lights were as long as my finger, from tip to palm, and that they were about half the thickness of the finger in diameter.  Puzzled, and not really sure what I was seeing, I just turned left as I always did, going east on Pekin.  As I started down the road, the lights moved to their left and crossed over the road from my right just as I passed under them.  I remember looking up through my windshield to see them, then they dissapeared behind trees as I drove on. A half mile down the road, there is a stop sign for Sperry road, where I would turn right.  I wondered what the blimp was doing out here so late, it's too rural for the blimp, so what was it?  I was now approaching the stop sign, and that's when I saw the lights come back from my left and stoped, hovering over the road at the same altitude directly in front of me and out about 200 feet.  I had the impression ""it"" expected me to continue through the stop sign and towards it.  My hair stood on end when I realized what these lights were, and I quickly turned right and sped off as fast as I could.  Looking left, I saw the lights were pacing my car at the same speed, at which point I became very frightened, shouting ""Not tonight, not tonight!"" Within a mile of that intersection, I lost sight of the lights, continuing on to Mayfield road, where I stopped and go out to look back.  In the distance, at least a mile back, I could see the lights hovering, still flashing their colors, at about 600 feet, I would guess.  Since then, I have interviewed four differnt persons of different ages, from 13 to 65, who have seen this craft in the same area.  In addition, Tim Good's book, Above Top Secret, contains a piece concerning a man who lived 30 miles east of Cleveland, Ohio, who observed a UFO on the ground for 20 minutes.  This location is exactly 30 miles east of cleveland, and the gentleman named in the book lives on the same road.  There is a lot of activity in this area, and it should be investigated.",2001-04-28T00:00:00,,

Myself & a date were driving home and were approximately 2 blocks from my house, when the car stopped in front of what was at that time a corn field.  All I remember is looking to my right out the window and seeing a large disk-shaped object hovering approximately 50 feet in the air over the field.  I could only see the underside of the object,  but it was radiating a pink light which lit up the whole car.  I remember a very powerful vibrating humming sound which sent a numbing & tingling sensation thru my body almost like what I imagine an electric shock would feel like.  I turned my head away from the object to look at my date saying, ""Oh my God..."" as I turned my head, and it felt like I was moving and speaking in slow-motion.  I remember nothing else except that I arrived home at approximately 1:30am,  and do not recall how I got home or what happened.  I never spoke of that night to anyone until about 5 years ago,  and I only told my mother and 2 of my closest friends.  Since that time I have ran into the person I was with,  but have never had the courage to ask him about that night,  because it sounds so crazy.  Since that time, I have experienced what a neurologist told me is probably a sleep disorder called sleep paralysis.  I will be on the verge of sleep,  but still aware of what is going on around me and I get a buzzing sound in my head,  which progressively gets louder and louder,  then what feels like an electric wave runs thru my body causing that same tingling & numbness feeling that I experienced that night.  When this happens,  I am completely paralyzed,  then I don't remember anything else.  I either pass out or fall asleep or something.  This happened approximately every 3 months until the last year, during which time it seems to have stopped. I am very skeptical,  and have anylized this,  wondering if it really happened or if it was a dream, yet it is still so vivid & such a strong sensation.

The following was witnessed by me, and at least 4 of my friends. The event occured in April or perhaps May of 1991. I was dark but it hadn't been dark very long. I'd guess it was 9:00. A group of us were in my friends apartment (Lincoln Parkway apartments) when one of my friends called us out to the second story balcony of the apartment. ""hey guys check this out.. are these UFO's or something?"" We went out of the desk and there were several lights about 40-45 degrees above the horizon (from our perspective).. These lights were moving fairly slowly in our general direction.. as them moved closes they seemed to be following each other, one after the other.. I would call it a ""string"" of lights..there were 7 or maybe 8 of them. I'm almost certain that these lights were moving independantly of each other and were not part of a single, huge object. The lights were a deep, amber red. I'm fairly certain the red lights were on continually and were bright. In addition, each ""craft"" also had what I remember to be several strobes blinking in a repeating, irregular, odd pattern not like the once every 3 second strobes of an airplane. the repeating strobe pattern (of maybe seven individual blinks) that each craft had repeated I would guess every second or so. I got the impression that these lights were fairly close to us.. and the size of each was maybe the size of a small plane. (20 feet diameter each?) I didn't notice any sounds from these lights. I actually got the cordless phone and called my roomate (who was in my apartment in the next building) and told him to go out on the balcony and look at what we were seeing.. I asked him what he thought they were and he said ""I don't know, a train??"" which was obviously not the case because trains don't fly, and these things were definitely in the air. But the lights were ""train like"" with one following the other  blinking their weird lights.  The distance between these lights in this string was not far. They seems to be much closer together than what I would think to be a safe distance. A couple years later I noticed a formation of helicopters flying, one after the other, and I took note that the distance between the helicopters was much farther apart than the lights that we say. Actually, I do remember that the noise of a train going by on nearby track was audible at the time. this may have also been what caused my friend to give ""train"" as an explaination. If there were any sound of the craft, the train noise may have gotten in the way of us hearing anything). But had it been 6 Cesnas that close, I'm certain I would have heard the engines. Still watching the lights, I called the police on the phone I was holding. the woman who answered said ""Oh, you know what those are? they're ultralight aircraft"". This I doubted. I had seen ultralight aircraft in the area before. But never to my knowledge at night, and never flying in formation. The crazy blinking pattern of these lights was unlike anything I had seen on any airplane before.  Seeing one of these things would have been curious, but It's possible that I may have just dismissed it as a plane that had odd lights but I doubt it. These lights were weird, and there were 6 or seven of them! Interestingly, the police-woman I was talking to told me that in a neary by town (Fairbault) there had been a newspaper story of some UFO sightings a week or so previous to the night I was talking to her. (more about this later). The lights continued closer and closer to us and seemed to get lower. Slowly, the lights drifted past us to our left and from our perspective they disappeared along the tree line. After the initial string of lights disappeard to our left, 3-5 minutes past and then we looked up and saw another single craft appear in the some location in the sky that the initial group appeared. It moves slowly along, following the path that the other lights took. I seem to remember this one being slightly different. I believe it was smaller, but perhaps it wasn't. It had similar red lights and blinking strobes. The entire sighting lasted about 8 minutes. I later regretted not getting out of the building and going out in the field past the trees to see if I could continue to see the lights, but to be honest, I was scared.  The next day I called the Fairbault newspaper and asked about the article that had been printed. The reporter verified that he had in fact written an article that discussed a couple of sightings in that area. I believe he mentioned that someone had seen a strange light shining a beam down or something like that. He also mentioned that a local farmer farmer had apparantly also had a sighting around the same time as us. This farmer had had sightings in years past and even had experienced cattle mutilations. The reported took my name and we talked about him possibly writing a new story talking about our sightings, but I didn't pursue it and neither did he so nothing ever happened. I also called the FAA and not surprisingly they weren't helpful. The 1997 ""Phoenix Lights"" reminded me somewhat of what we saw, how the lights appeared in a row. But the lights in that video seemed white, not red, and didn't appear to be moving.  The lights we saw were much closer to each other (and to us) than the lights in the Phoenix videos that were widely shown. I know this report lacks certain important information (exact time, date) but I've done the best I can. What I do know is that these were definitely, without question, intelligently controlled craft, not balls of light way off in the distance.  These lights were close and sharp and had it been daylight, I'm certain I could describe the shape of these craft, but it was just dark enough that we could only see the lights of the craft, not the shape of the crafts they were attached to. If these craft were man made, they were unlike anything any of the five of us ever recall seeing before or since. This string of lights was moving roughly in an east to west path.

At this time i was between 17/18 years old and living with my parents. My best friend was staying over for the night. Him and i went out at around 3am to go swimming at the club house swimming pool. (Yes it was closed, but we would jump the fence and swim anyway...i paid dues for the right to swim so i was going to do it when i wished.) As we came about two hundred yeards for the pool fence, we saw a large streak of light go across the sky, similar to a comet type firework. The color was green, like green flames, so we though someone shot a firework of some sort that did not make any kind of report. (Report as in sound) (I am not saying this is related to the craft to come, however a link is possible, even though i cannot say that there is in fact a link between them.) I do not know how long my best friend and i had been swimming before leaving, i would estimate an hour. We were talking in detail about many things like friends do, and we decided to stay outside until we had finished talking. My parents room was right above mine, and talking in a normal voice is easily heard from their room. So, we sat on my car in the drive way and continued our convercation. Now, i began to notice what i thought was a street light being obstructed by something else out of my peripheral vision. Like trees blowing and disrupting the light. However, i took note that there was no wind blowing, and so not enough to move any tree branches. So then i started looking to see what it was that was blocking the light at times. When i began to focus on the light, i then realize it was not a street light to begin with....and the source of this light was moving. (Coming at us.) I will not post my exact words, i said something to the effect of, ""What is the world is that?"" My best friend and i walked to the middle of the drive way to get under this objects flight path, or as close as we could guesstimate. It was at this point we got an idea of how fast this object was moving. I have no frame of reference, so i cannot tell you how fast it was moving. I have never been to an air show and have not seen a fighter jet make a low level, high speed pass. This craft was flying about 100 feet off the ground. As it came closer, i noticed the light source was a large tube coming from the bottom of the craft, and it was a clear tube. The light itself was amber in color, and it illuminated the bottom of the craft. The tube was about one third the size of the bottom of the craft, and the tube was located in the center. The illumination was not a brilliant light, it was dull, just like what you would expect from a street light at a distance in the color amber. You could clearly see the tube as being clear, and the light contained with it. I have no idea what material the craft was made of, other than to say it looked dark from the illumination of the amber light. I saw nothing but the tube and what it illuminated because the tube was my main focus. I could not take my eyes off of it. It was moving at a very fast rate, and from the time we took real notice and moved up the drive way all took about one minute. This craft made no audible sound....not even a whisper. And the craft was about the size of...i am having trouble relating its size.....if you were to cross two streched limousines . (make a cross of them) As it went over us and past my house, my best friend and i ran to the back of my house and up the balcony in the back to watch it for as long as we could before it went out of sight. When i first realized it was a craft, a craft i believed to be alien, my first impulse was to run back to my car and jump under it. Hey i am not ashamed to admit it scared me. During the whole encounter, neither friend nor myself spoke a word after we saw what the craft was. Both of us were in shock, and we did not speak for around 5 minutes after the craft had been gone. When we went into my house, we both took note that it was 5:50am. The pool was only about a 10 minute walk away. I do not claim anything happend other than what i just reported. I do not believe anything other than that happend. I cannot account for that large time loss, although as i said, i do not know how long we were swimming, nor do i know how long we talked on my car. The green streak was moving from the North West heading South East. The craft was moving east to west. I do not know if they were connected as said before, but i do not deny the possibility.

It was a cold november night with bright skies and a lot of stars. We were on a military exercise out in the mountains in Sweden. I stood looking up at the stars while fetching some water out of a lake. Suddenly i saw what i first thought was a falling star. Then came another one. My friends saw it too but they said it must be a satelite (they can be seen this time of year when they pass the skies). But, the next moment i saw two moore, and they started to ""chase"" each other... They looked like stars (same size, same bright light) but they were moving so fast! It was very strange to see the ""stars"" first flying at this speed, and then stop(!!?) and change direction and start again with same speed instantly. The ""stars"" were also flying in circles, continuing chasing each other. They must have been flying at a very high altitude since they were so small. No human vessle och aircraft can fly so fast, so high and change directions like that! That is for sure!!! The experience lasted for at least 4 minutes before they suddenly dissapeared. I can not find any theoretical explanation on this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2001-04-28T00:00:00,,

West-to-East Observer #1: Myself. I am an engineering drafter of 24 years. Observer #2: My close friend who was a waitress, and the driver of the vehicle we were in during this event. While traveling East on the Ventura fwy (hwy 101), our car approached the halfway point between Winnetka Blvd & Tampa Blvd (this would be at Corbin Ave) when the event began. As the passenger in the front seat, I had been facing to my left (North) while speaking with my friend. At this point near Cornin Ave, I took brief notice of an intense, red light in the far corner of my left eye. I assumed for a split second that a helicopters nav light was responsible for the bright glow. What initially drew my attention was the low altitude of the objects flight path(approx 90-120ft): By looking level thru the drivers side windows, the object was clearly visible. I looked away momentarily as I was in conversation, but returning my stare almost immediately. ""It"" was travelling East, slightly faster than traffic (65mph) and was moving parallel to the fwy trafic. With my attention now sharply focused on the object in question, we could see that 5 (five) objects were clearly in a flight formation: a straight, level line extending perpendicular to the fwy structure, and only about 200-300ft from the fwy. The objects were identical in every describable aspect,... and all were sparkling (not flaming) beautiful red spheres. The spheres were approx 30ft in diameter, and approx 120ft center-to-center. Not only were background urban features visible between spheres, but very subtle, yet distinct vertical variations of the altitude of individual spherical entities confirmed that they were indeed not (physically observable) conjoined entities. During this entire event, at no point did the entities appear to deviate from the estimated altitude/speed/direction/distance: Making for an exceptional viewpoint for us, for the duration. Beyond the point being perpendicular to my vehicle (& while the entities briefly appeared as a singularity) and where ""individuals"" were clearly visible again, something radical in their orientation to one another developed rapidly. Each of the outermost two spheres began, simultaneously, to close the gap between its nearest neighbor in flight: encroaching on the sphere next to it!: I feared some sort of accident and/or crash. However, there were no visible cautionary measures taken by the two spheres apparently being jeopardized. In fact, the moving two entities simply continued on their collision course, to eventually meld with the neighboring spheres: All of which now totalled three! Very soon afterwards (only seconds), the outermost pair of entities embarked on the same course of action as their previously described counterparts,... and melded with the central spherical figure, and with the same methodical ease! Only one entity existed now. Note: At no point did any sphere, individual or combined or ""transitional"", exhibit any deviation from the original observed color/shape/speed/altitude/direction. Within a few moments, our ""companion"" sphere (now approx 1/4mi ahead of us) quite casually split into two distinct entities,... and similarly, each of the new pair divided themselves, now formimg a group of four individuals. This talley was not observed to change. It appeared as though the unusual ""transformations"" within this event transpired over approx one minute. Since ""they"" had been travelling slightly faster than traffic, the theatrics of combining & dividing had ceased when the group of spheres was approx 1/2-3/4mi ahead of my vehicle. By their brightness, this new group of four spheres was clearly visible up to approx 2mi away. The pitch of the fwy eventually severed our line-of-sight view. We were left astonished. It seems evident that my friend & I were in perfect position to view the intelligent flight management display of either directly or remotely operated craft,... or simply that of ""Light Beings"" or pure consiousness. I am to this day, grateful for that night. This was my 8th sighting, and the 2nd for my friend, who also saw her first one with me approx 6mo earlier. I will write of this one in future.

That is, were you alone at the time, or were there other people standing with you, with whom you were discussing the event at the time?  Do you know what the surface winds, and winds aloft at 3 and 6 were at the time, by any chance? Did you look at the objects with binoculars, by any chance, or with the naked eye only? Finally, how did you establish what the combustible fuel was?  Is that an assumption, or were you able to identify that it was fuel oil? Thanks again for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport -- Peter B. Davenport, Director National UFO Reporting Center PO Box 45623 University Station Seattle, WA 98145 director@ufocenter.com http://www.UFOcenter.com Hotline: 206-722-3000 (From 8AM to Midnight Pacific preferred) RESPONSE Gracious, Peter.  I hardly expected to receive a ""personal"" reply, particularly so quickly. Well, anyway.  To address your questions. ALTITUDE The altitude was guestimated based on a hypthetical or presumed size of the targets.  In other words a 4' or 3' lighted object at approximately 1500' might appear not as a pinpoint but a larger light point, yet not as large enough to be definable as a vehicle or airship.  I realize size and distance are difficult to estimate, particularly at night when there is nothing to calibrate with.  But if you visualized a very tiny aircraft at a very high pattern altitude that would be consistent with the sighting. OTHER OBSERVERS I was with a group of 20 to 30 people.  Apparently the sighting had been going on for several minutes.  I was called outside to join the group for the last 5 to 8 minutes of the sighting.  At that time all of the points of light became extinguished.  There was much discussion and there has been much subsequent discussion.  The 3 local TV stations are collecting many observations and theories.  The sighting included perhaps 1000 or more people in the area.  There are reports of sightings from outside the local area but it is difficult for me to believe that we are all talking about the same sighting.  Numerous amateur videos exist of this particular sighting so comparison can no doubt be performed.  You may receive other reports; your web site was mentioned by one of the TV stations which is why I decided to file this report. WINDS Surface winds were calm.  I'm not sure how to obtain past observations for winds aloft.  You may be able to do that for the date/time that I specified for RFD.  I would expect winds aloft at 3,000 to somewhat correlate with what we appeared to observe, e.g. a movement from SW to NE over a period of several minutes.  Interestingly the RFD airport is located approximately 6 miles SW of the position where this observation occurred.  Direction of movement would have placed the path prior to our sighting somewhere in the vicinity of the airport.  If my theory is correct a possible point of origin would be from rural areas south of the city. BINOCULARS No binoculars or other viewing aids were available.  Sightings were unsupplemented naked eyes. FUEL SOURCE Fuel source is a hypothesis based on color and apparent behavior, e.g. yellow color, reasonably constant intensity with occasional minor flickering.  An observation that may have some significance is that the light or flame of each target appeared to diminish before it died out, one by one much as if whatever might be burning was ultimately consumed.  During the time that I observed, all targets eventually disappeared at an average of 1 minute intervals. I hope this is helpful.  It will be interesting to triangulate various reports.

The wind shifted and I looked up to make sure no sparks were going to hit my roof, when I noticed a twin prop commercial plane heading south, appearing behind it, closing at a high rate of speed was a small silver object. Estimated speed of object 2000 miles per hour plus. I walked from the garden to my 800 foot front lawn, still watching both objects. The silver object seemed to come to a stop behind the small plane but stayed with the plane for about 20 seconds. All at once the object moved back towards me, made a loop, came to a dead stop and accelerated out of sight at a 45 degree angle. At that time I considered calling my wife outside, but hesitated. As I went back to the garden to check the fire, a commercial jet heading south about the same altitude, flew over. I proceeded to observe this one also. From the northeast sky another silver ball closed in on the jet, staying behind the jet about one half mile. This one was weaving from side to side. It stayed behind the jet for about one minute. It then sped off in the same direction as the other object. This one seemed to travel a little faster then the first object. At this time I called my wife outside. As my wife came down onto the front lawn, two more objects appeared, not accompanied by any commercial aircraft. They both raced off to the east. My wife did not see these objects at this time as they moved too quickly for her to catch sight of them. I went into the house to get my binoculars. I do not own a video camera, which I really regret. At this time my wife and I started noticing a dark area, we are not sure if it was a cloud, fog or mist forming directly overhead, it appeared to be 25000-35000 feet high, estimated. It looked like it stretched in symetrical shape, about two miles. As this ""cloud"" seemed to get darker activity increased, at this time only with small objects appeared. Now my wife started to see them also. Let me state at this time the sky! to the north, south, east and west of this ""cloud"" was extremely clear and blue, except for the ""cloud"" directly overhead. My wife stated at this time""they do not seem to be coming from the outskirts of the horizon, but from the ""perimeter"" of the ""cloud"" area"". For about a fifteen second burst, way off to the south, two smaller objects trailing behind one larger object, the larger object being three times larger then the small objects ,they seemed to be swaying back and forth behind the larger one, similar to a kite tail. They came and went so quickly my wife didn't see them. Remember, I had been looking through binoculars. These objects seemed to just disappear from my sight. For the next 4-5 minutes the cloud, mist, fog got a darker grey in color. My wife sighted two large silver objects traveling side by side from the northeast heading southwest, from the perimeter to the center of the cloud formation, when they got to the center of the cloud area they disappeared from her sight, she did not see them come out of the cloud area. At the same time I myself observed other objects, two large ball shapes exiting the southeast corner of the cloud, they were moving half the speed of the smaller objects observed earlier. This lasted for about forty seconds.Immediately after these seperate sightings, the cloud increased to its darkest color and we sighted a silver boomarang, vee shaped object heading east-southeast.,it was moving much slower than the rest,it seemed to have sqared off wings at the ends,the size was about 1/and 1/2 times bigger than a 747 airplane,again all objects had no sounds,for the next couple off minutes nothing appeared ,where it came from i am not sure, but heading in the same direction as the v object ,an older  military plane which had those pontoon type ends on the wings ,the wings were straight.,seemed to be following the v, let me also state it was an extremly wide v, dusk was now stating to set in,and it seemed now the so called cloud was almost gone, these were not off this earth. as my ! wife sta ted to me this was some type off portal, or cloking devise , on this planet no one has this tech. yet.

We were heading east in our vehicle.  We had the sun at our backs.  The weather was clear, the sky was clear with a few wispy clouds.  The part of sky in which we saw the object was clear.  My wife saw the reflection of it at first.  She asked me if I saw it and I slowed down. I saw it and looked for wings thinking it was the shiny reflection of a plane heading to or away from us (as I only saw the round shiny orb).  I could see the round orb shape clearly, but could not see the horizontal line that would be wings.  Then it made it's turn and if it had wings, I should have been able to see them.  I did not.  Neither did my wife. From our vantage point of moving east, the craft was at our 10 o'clock position when first noticed. Our movement was straight during the time we saw it.  The craft moved south to our 12 o'clock position then made a slow arc downward toward the ground (probably 10 degrees downward) then when approx. 10 degrees above it original altitude, moved away from us at our 2 o'clock position. Very fast when it moved away.  All motions were very smooth and controlled.  Regarding the direction of movement, the craft moved very smoothly, no erratic action.  It moved slowly at first.  Took approx. 60-70 seconds to move from its initial position to the point at which it started its curve downward.  It then accelerated through the curve and shot away from us at a very high speed.  Fast enough that we lost sight of it after a few seconds when it finished its arc - maybe five to ten seconds at most to get out of sight.  No apparent radio or electrical interference.  It was a silver sphere.  No wings or other markings.  As described, we were probably 3-4 miles away, according to the mountains it was over in the Blairsville GA region.  It was polished and looked like a ball bearing.  It was large enough that I would guess it to be as large in diameter as the length of a small plane would be at the same altitude and distance from us.  It was very polished and smooth in appearance. It's movements were very smooth.  Not like the erratic movements of balloons adrift.

What follows is exactly as witnessed on the night of September 8, 2001.  My wife and I were out on our balcony at our apartment complex.  We have somewhat of a limited view of the eastern sky from this vantage point due to trees, however, I was watching a distant storm cloud moving northeast. It had my attention because flashes of cloud lightning were brillantly illuminating the cloud itself.  These ended and while talking with my wife I noticed a dull white light moving at a very high rate of speed, seemingly in the cloud itself.  It's speed is what first drew my attention.  Being in Fort Worth, approximately 15 miles from DFW airport, there's quite a lot of air traffic in the area.  But this was moving faster than even low flying aircraft move in the night skies.  At first I thought the light was within the cloud itself, moving out of it.  Although now upon reflection that couldn't of been the case:  this storm cloud was much too far off to see such a light.  And indeed it wasn't behind or in the cloud.  Upon reaching the cloud's edge and emerging from it, I realized the light had the same dull white appearance as it did while seemingly in the cloud.  The light had to have been much closer to us than the storm cloud.  At that point I stood up from the rocking chair I was seated at, and moved quickly to the railing to get a better look.  At that time, the object - or light- which originally was singular became a group of three or four lights of similar hue and size.  No blinking or FAA lights could be seen.  These were not airplanes.  They continued moving in what seemed to be either a diamond or a square formation.  Then at that time, and, of course, this is what really peaked my interest, the object(s) split into a ""V"" formation.  Or, if not trully a ""V,"" then a formation shaped similar to a banana with a slight to moderate curve in it.  Following this, the object(s) distanced themselves from one another, still in the same formation, but spaced apart more.  (And I should mention at this point that e! very cha nge in formation occurred almost instantaneously.  I could see the movement, but it was faster that anything I have ever before seen in the sky.)  Still moving at what was a southeasternly direction, a single light of the same brightness, shape and size moved into the formation from ahead.  It moved into the formation seemingly at the same rate of speed as the other object(s) that were moving toward it.  This independent light joined the formation at dead center or perhaps slightly below this point.  Then the object(s) regrouped into the box or diamond formation and slowed significantly, if not stopping.  Together they rose in altitude slightly before again forming the tight ""V-banana"" formation.  At this time the object(s) were about to enter the blind spot of my balcony so I ran outside, downstairs, and around my apartment building in an attempt to gain view unobstructed by foilage.  However, because of the strong light from the rising moon and the faint, dull light of the object(s) themselves I was unable to again locate it.  And realizing the speed at which the object(s) seemed to be moving at, I knew the sighting was over.  Upon joining me downstairs, by wife did say before she lost sight of the object(s) the tight ""V-banana"" formation loosened up. Again, this occurred at approximately 00:30-00:35 hours on September 8, 2001.  The weather conditions were windy and partly cloudy with the wind and clouds moving in a northeasternly direction.  And while the sky was cloudy, an equal amount of clear, visible sky was to be seen.  The object(s) moved in a southeasternly direction which, from where I live, would put in on a crow's flight toward Arlington, Texas. I am 26 years of age, college-educated, with a degree in English.  Struggling as a writer, I spend my days earning a living as a salesman for a contracting company.

I opened my sliding glass door to my back porch on the night/morning (11/18/2001) of the Leonid meteor shower at approximately 4:30-4:45 AM. The porch faces south. I was standing in the doorway looking up, catching 3-4 good meteor trails, when I noticed a faint, brownish-amber object (closely resembling the illustration on your site of the May 13, 2001 sighting of a dimly lit craft over Bangalore India) moving NE-SW at a slow rate of speed. It looked like an arrowhead-shaped clump of approx. two dozen or so peanut-brittle colored balls, not 100% solidly in formation, loose, but definitely organized. No sound. Whatever it was, it wasn't self-illuminated, rather it seemed to be dimly reflecting light from the town below. My best guess is that I was looking at a flock of migratory birds flying at night -- is this common this time of year in the Northwest? However, two things prompted me to make this report to you: (1) the object *did* strongly remind me of the object seen over India; and (2) I just read on the NUFORC site that someone reported seeing a (what I interpreted as a strikingly) similar object in Seattle (about 90 miles due south of me) the same night, albeit earlier.",2002-02-22T00:00:00,48.74688634868421,-122.44462006578947

It was a ball of light, not like fire, but more like  the color of a soft light bulb with a tail like a comet.  although it was flying too low for it, we thought it might be the space shuttle reentering and on it's way to Edwards but it was not to be launched until the following weekend.  It was partly cloudy and it entered the low clouds illuminating some of them or momentarely entering a thiker one that made it disappear for fractions or a couple of seconds.

I ask, because that was the night that a major space debris re-entry occurred over Texas and the Midwestern states in the U.

It was a clear and starry night: My fiance and I were travelling across a lake in cottage country in a small boat when we saw a strange low flying light that acted strangely. The light appeared over the trees about a half of a kilometer away from us on the far side of the lake (I checked a map later for the distance), it was a very brilliant white light and it was travelling silently (at first we shut the boat off to listen and started it up again) but slowly to the east. We had a perfect view of the light as it moved and we noticed that it would speed up a little then slow right down. We sped up in the boat to get closer and the light continued to move away a little faster but with the same speed up and slow down movement. We noticed that it travelled in a straight more or less and watched it for a good few minutes as it travelled to the other side of the lake (about 5kms) where it moved over the trees and out of sight. This area of northern Ontario is very sparsely populated and is for the most part thick forest for hundreds of miles, there are no airports nearby aside from the odd private airfield. Two nights later it was approximately 3 am on another clear night with some clouds rolling in and again we saw the light over the lake. We were sitting on the deck of the cabin with all lights off looking at the stars in recliners when we noticed the light again but this time very high up over the lake. At first it seemed to just sit there for a few moments and then it began to move slowly. It would change directions instantly at sharp angles with no curving. And a couple of times it blinked off and then blinked on in another location in the sky. My best estimate is that it was at an altitude of about 1 km.  We watched it for about 3 min in all and lost sight of it when it moved into approaching clouds. We waited another hour for another look but by that time there was cloud cover and we saw nothing. I am an audio engineer and my fiance is a legal assisstant, we do not take drugs and are not heavy drinkers, we do not wear glasses or cantac! ts and w e have never been able to properly explain what we saw those two nights.

I was on the way to visit my grandparents in Cranston,RI,USA, when I spotted a egg-shaped object moving at an incredibly high speed(a good deal faster than a commercial jet).  I am very skeptical of any Ufo sighting, and I can usally tell what something is right after I see it, but this had me stumped.  It wasn't any aircraft I know of, and I know of a good amount of aircraft.  It was too small to carry humans( about 5 ft. in diameter and 7ft long), and I don't see how it could fly as straight as it did, or how it could fly at all. There was a haze around it, but this might have been shock waves( like those visible when the F/A-18 hornet is approaching and reaching the sound barrier.  There was no aircraft following it(I beive the closest Fighter base to the sighting is Ottis ANG base, which deploys F-16 fighting falcons) and it was too small to appear on radar, so obviously there was no way for fighters to be scrambled to trail it.  It was silver-gray, and egg-shaped as I said.  It had no markings visible to me, although I only saw the underside of the craft and there may have been markings elsewhere.  I don't think it was an alien space craft, but it could have been an experimental military drone, possibly based at Quonset ANG, which would be the perfect place to keep the vehicle,seeing as Quonset has not had at test or fighter sqaudron based there since the 40's and 50's, so noone would look there. this is not the only explanation and I'm open to suggestions and I would enjoy them very much. All of this is true.  I won' send any pictures for I am not a good artist, but I think the above descriprtions are sufficient. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness is anonymous.

When I arrived at her door I rang and I looked up to the second floor window. That is the window of her apartment, she mostly opens the window to throw the keys. When looking up I noticed 9 bright lights. There course was WNW. They made no sound. They seemed to be flying very fast and very high, though the lights were very bright. I couldn't distinct if anything was between the 9 lights. There were no blinking lights. It was as if you see 9 sattelites flying over in perfect inverse V formation. During the V formation the speeds of the lights was constant. Then suddenly I knew it weren't just planes or helicopters in formation, cuase the shape just changed to a double inverse V formation!!! The changing of the formation was only a split second, and the movement of the different lights were smooth without one of them crossing onother one. The movement of the different lights wasn't symmetric, the left side of the V moved differently then the left side of the V. . . . .   . .     . .       .

Normally in aviation they have a fixed manner of changing to another formation. Also it happened in only a second time. The way they slowed down and catched speed up again was surprisingly smooth. It wasn't in a way that If they were fixed (in some way connected) so that turning over or changing angle caused it for me to see it as another formation.

These objects had lights at all 3 corners (two red, one blue) and a larger white light in the center.  What was so amazing about these objects was their ability to hover, as well as their incredible speed.  We stopped and got out of our car to get a better look, but within about 5-10min they were gone.  A little later in the evening, closer to 10pm, we went out again to see if we could spot these objects.  As we drove on the interstate closer to Raleigh, they appeared again.  It seemed to me that we saw between 3-5 of these at various locations. Again, we got out of the car (with camera in hand) and one of the objects flew fairly close to us to allow a better look.  This object appeared to be similar to the center object we had seen earlier.  Also triangular, it appeared to have two very bright white lights at the top-most point, with red lights on the bottom two.  In the center was again a larger white light, and right above these were two strange markings of white light (resembeling <<).  This object came close to us, but made absolutely no sound whatsoever.

After watching four straight episodes of a Quartermass series (ironically), it was getting really late and we decided to break up the party. Around 3:30 am we gathered in the street to leave, when one witness needed to go back inside to get something. When he returned, the second witness began telling me a story of an encounter he had had recently (more irony). As he was telling the story, the third witness looked up and said, ""Look, a UFO"". The four of us looked straight up and saw three dimly lit glowing orange orbs moving from East to West overhead. The details are as follows: The orbs (or disks) appeared to be self illuminated, but not very bright, like a candle flame through a transparent orange balloon; which was a different colored orange than the city-light reflections on the clouds. They were traveling directly above us, just below the spotty checkerboard of cumulus clouds, which were estimated to be about 1500-2000 feet high, and the moon was directly south of us at about 65 degree angle from the southern horizon (my estimate). The two outer orbs (north and south)were flying in a straight vector, while the middle orb was ""playfully"" zigzagging between the other two, yet more closely to the northern-most orb. There was no sound as they passed over. Myself and another witness watched the objects the longest as they passed behind a nearby building, which obscured our view at about a 45 degree angle from our viewpoint. After witnessing these objects we had ruled out these objects as being seagulls, common to this area, as there were no signs of wing-flapping, the objects were not oval-shaped as a seagull's body would be and the maneuvering of the middle object was to fast and erratic for a bird. Seagulls and other birds tend to make sounds when flying as well. After talking about this between a couple of us later, we did not seem to surprised by what we saw, nor disturbed. It just seemed to cap off a perfect evening. Though one witness referred to these objects as ""piloted craft"", my gut was telling me ""critter"", as if they were some yet unclassified self-illuminating lifeform.",2002-03-19T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

Cloud cover was at 3-4000 feet and no blue sky (it's Scotland in March???).   It was dark grey with blue and red colours (not lights) on either side and had something trailing underneath it like a re-fuelling rod (DC-10 with 4 F-18's and a RAF Tornado flew low over the city the day before with DC-10 trailing fuel rod and planes lined up behind it - last time this happened about 8 years ago there was complaint made as to how low aircraft were over city).  Since I have always been a plane spotter since childhood and local airport is about 8 miles and RAF base is 30 miles away she knows what a plane looks like, commercial or Forces, and still thought this was a balloon, however strange it looked, with it's curvy hourglass look and trailing rod.  She went to get the telescope to have a closer look and ran to the bedroom on the other side of the house as she knew with it's speed it would be over the house before she got to the telescope even though telescope is in her room next to cupboard by the window.  When she got there she was surprised to see two of the same description flying in the same direction as the other one and about 3 times as high as the one that caught her eye.  She focussed the scope on the lowest one before it disappeared behind the rooftops of the neighbouring houses and still it looked as she described earlier.  She focussed on the other 2 objects and they were going as fast as the other one was which she described as your typical RAF jet speed for the area, about 300 mph with no noise at all.  Our location has a good horizon to horizon view from east to west (about 3 miles west and 1.5 east and RAF fly it every ! day) and we get very strong winds here but rarely exceeding 70-80 mph and that day was only a 15mph breeze.  The more she thought about it the more it seemed strange but if she had to define her sighting she would say it was a weather balloon, the fastest weather balloon she has seen.  NEVER, never have we or I in all my time looking up at planes (even when there are none there) ever seen a weather balloon in our area and if they did fly over this way??? why so low and more importantly, how so fast?  I have to stress that at first sighting she jokingly thought we were being invaded she told me(seeing as object was unknown to her) but as she watched approach a bit more it became clear this was not a normal sight you would see flying in the skies over our city.",2002-03-19T00:00:00,,

There were approximately 2 objects, one was stationary and the other manuevered around in a manner which was uncharacteristic of any conventional craft that I know of. It performed tight circles and moved very fast as compared to the commercial traffic in the area, which I used as a comparison. The most dramatic manuever it performed was a tight loop which only took a fraction of a second, then it shot out a thin beam of light to the other object and it seemed to ride that beam up to that object. The light that eminated from the objects was blueish white in color and seemed to flash at different intervals depending on the objects manuevers.

On the morning of 2-9-02, at 5:55AM, I glanced out of my upstairs window and noticed a very bright light just above the treeline. It looked like a star/planet except it was about 3 times the brightness of jupiter and it was facing north. I immediatley knew this was not a star. >From my upstairs window i have a great view of the sky over Charlotte facing north towards downtown. I can see about half of the sky including the buildings downtown. The light hovered just above the trees for about a minute. It appeared to be about 2 miles away from me. After about a minute the light started to drift a little to the right and then a little to the left. I lined my eyes up with the crosshairs in the window to make sure i wasn't seeing things. I wasn't. After drifting further to the left the light abruptly turned and sped off towards downtown. It passed behind the Bank of America (BOA) building a flew off out of sight. As it was moving away from me I noticed a small red light behind the light. I was astonished at how fast this light moved across the city. I spend a lot of time watching planes and helicopters fly around the city and I have never seen anything cover that much distance in so short of time. I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to convince myself that I saw a helicopter that was hovering with a spotlight on and then speed away very quickly. The only problem is the math. It took the light approx. 5-10 seconds to go from the spot where it was hovering to behind the BOA building. Taking the angle that i saw the light from my window and drawing a line out across the city, the closest point from that line to the BOA builind is 1.75 miles (this is best case scenario. i think the distance was more like 3.5 but i am taking the closest possible distance). 1.75 miles in 10 seconds is 630 miles per hour. That is again using the best case scenario (at 3.5 miles the speed is 1260). I am not aware of any helicopter that can go 630 miles per hour from a dead stop. Also the helicopters i have seen flying around have 2 blueish/white lights on the back not a small red light. I also did not hear a sound from the light. I can usually hear planes and helicopters all the way to downtown. I have no idea what i saw but it's not anything i can explain using rational logic.

I wore my glasses out to the pool specifically to skywatch. While watching the plane, I caught sight of a large lighted object fairly near the horizon and in my right peripheral field of view. As I focused on the object, it followed a curved trajectory right and down and disappeared behind a ridge. The object was very bright, white or maybe slightly yellow/gold, and roundish, though not a perfect orb. It was only in my sight for a couple of seconds, yet the impression was that it was wider than tall. At least there was some shading that kept it from being a perfect orb. It was definitely not a meteor or a star, as it was too large, its length about 2/3 of the distance between the stars on Orion's belt. Had it been a meteorite of that size hitting the earth, I think we would have heard or felt it, and the trajectory would have been different.

I am a 41 year old registered nurse who saw what I considered to be a UFO on 11/20/01 at 0405.   I discussed it in detail will my father who urged me to report it.  He gave me this web site to do so.  Why did I wait to report it? I had a friend's husband who is a retired airforce pilot say that many sightings are reported in this particular area where an airforce base is and fly secret aircrafts that may look unusual to a civilian and I took his word for it.  But after looking this web site up, I saw another individual report a sighting on the same night in the same area and knew I had to submit my story....... I live in Jacksonville Beach and was on a trip to Pensacola to a company to give flu vaccines.  I left the beach at approximatley  2am.  I was traveling west on Interstate 10 in my car.  At 0405 I noticed a low flying aircraft flying toward me, traveling east. It was visible through the left of my windshield and left side window. I thought it might be a radar plane at first but soon realized it was shaped like a stealth/chevron. I wouldn't say it was larger than an average aircraft.   It had 10 large white circular lights on the bottom of the craft slowly going on simutaneously and then going off to where I could not see it.The lights were triangulary placed.  One at the point, then two, then three, then four.   When the lights came on it was very clear. It was shaped like a boomerang with a jagged edge, like the stealth.   There were NO other colored lights (Green/red)as would be expected in normal aircrafts.  To compare it to a full moon size, I would say it was at least one and a half times the size of the moon.  It made no noise, which scared me because I just went to a sea and air show with the Blue Angels here at the Beach a few weeks ago and witnessed many different looking jets and aircraft that were pretty deafening.  It seemed to travel very quickly for a craft flying that low. (Difficult to say how low, a guess...2-3 miles)  I slowed down to watch it go by, but it was gone in about 30! seconds , the lights went out and never saw them turn back on. I knew it wasn't anything I had ever seen and thought it may be a UFO.  I quickly noted the time, the exit I was closest to, a tractor trailer a quarter mile in front of me was the only other vehicle around, and I noticed him driving erraticaly as if he was trying to see it go by as well.  Im sure he saw it too.  I even wrote down his licence tag number to see if I could contact him later if I needed to, but I misplaced my notepad.  Im still looking for it.  If you're out there reading this, please write in!!...As requested I will make a sketch of it and mail it in for you to see.....Thanks for listening.

We live in an isolatd forest area 12 miles from town. These lights continued intermittenly for aprox  6 hours.  Myself, my husband and two house guests also observed the lights.  Three of us are of American Indian decent.  My husband and I also observed a similar light object, orange and yellow and red, in Aug 1996, in the west sky at aprox 8 pm EST.  I am having a hard time describing what  we saw,  because the words don't fit the vision. If you could imagine a flash light being shown through a prism,  so that as the light moved it also changed color, only on a much larger scale.   There was no definate shape, just and eliptical light source.  Since the sun had already set, I ruled out the possibility of sun rays through the clouds producing a sort of rainbow, but rainbows don't flitter across the sky from south to north.  My husband's impression was that the movement was not random, but controled.",2002-01-11T00:00:00,41.4842,-79.3825

It hovered for a few seconds in the sky and then proceeded rapidly downward and disappeared behind some trees.  It looked like it landed within a mile or two beyond Junipero Serra, but we did not investigate it further.  Also, it seemed like it left a faint trail as it descended downward, but this disappeared.  We were astonished; this bright blue ""thing"" did not resemble a plane, meteor, or any other object that we have ever seen in the sky before.  I have seen random lights and other things that I couldn't readily identify before, but nothing that I have ever felt the urge to report on a UFO site.

My husband and I were driving on a county farm road in the Southeast Texas countryside between East Bernard and Wallis, Texas around 8:30 pm on a very cloudy night.  An approaching cold front was drawing clouds from the south and the cloud cover was fairly dense and moving rapidly. I looked to the east which was in he direction of Rosenberg, Texas and could see the lights of that small town displayed against the flat horizon.  Above the lit horizon was a very brigt cloud nestled among many others of a normal grey appearance.  When the cloud drifted to the north there was a huge display of lights about 35 degrees above the horizon just behind or maybe inside the low clouds.  The lights appeared to be like those seen from a distance at a football field, but they were lined up right beside each other and there were at least five rows of them.  Each sat next to the other and above and below the rest.  There seemed to be very little space between them in any direction I counted five rows, but the clouds around the light display seemed to be obsurng more rows because the brightness kept showing through even when I could see five rows distinctly.  I don't believe the set of lights moved, but that the cloud movement kept covering the display and at one point I could count nine lights in the longest (and center) row.  At arm's length the object was almost three inches in width and about a inch in height.  The lights appeared to descend in number from the middle to the top and in the same manner from the middle to the bottom.  Occasionally, a cloud would totally encase the lights, but the cloud would then be luminescent. We watched the formation for about ten minutes before turning on to another road.  Trees close to us loomed over the part of sky we were watching.  By the time we could see that horizon again we had driven fairly far from Rosenberg and there was nothing but normal cloudcover. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Mr. Davenport,  Actually, you're correct in that the sighting took place on December 1st.  I checked my original report posted to a message board that very night.  My memory can be faulty so I wrote it down as soon as I got home.  As far as the timing goes it was definitly 8:30 pm CST so if you are taking about Midwestern time for the reentry the two don't really match up.  However, if you are talking Pacific time that would be just right.  (Well, I just read a lot of the reports at NUFORC and realize the timing isn't right for when we saw what we saw.)  There were no tails or auras and the lights didn't seem to move at all, but with the clouds moving so rapidly I might have become confused.  The lights were side by side and extremely bright with perhaps six lights in a row just above the row of nine and perhaps another five or six below that row.  There were even fewer visible in the top and bottom rows and I'm referring to the best view I had with clouds passing.  The lights never varied in size, they were all of equal size, so whatever the object might have been I doubt it was moving.  I neglected to make the report to you at the time because what I saw didn't look like any know UFO shape other than a disc literally made entirely of white lights.  Really strange and as I said, they seemed to remain stationery for ten minutes or so.  I've also been waiting to read reports of something similar before reporting  I also forgot to mention that we made the same trip on the night of December 23rd and saw Rosenberg's lights on the horizon on a clear night, but there were no lights in the sky other than stars.  It might be a good idea if I called Rosenberg's police department to see if there were any other reports or if there is some explanation I haven't thought of.  It's a small town with no reason for a large tower extending into the clouds, but I think it's worth a phone call or two even if I have to listen to a chuckle or two.  If there were similar reports I'll let you know.  Thanks for letting me know others have made more than one report to you.  If and when you might find the time I'd appreciate knowing what sort of sound you heard a UFO make.  I was sitting in a quiet house alone several weeks ago and heard a very strange, loud sound outside, a buzzing of something electrical, but it seemed to be ""skipping out.""  It sounded to me as though it were passing overhead, but I can't be sure of that.  The sound progressed and then seemed to pass away.  I'm sure there are any number of reasons for such a sound, but I've never heard that before.",2002-01-11T00:00:00,,

At approximately 9:20 pm (N.M. time) we observed a formation of 5 very bright spheres with long, arcing, glowing tails traveling slowly from south to north.  The first 3 were in a triangular formation and much brighter than the last 2, which were offset from each other.  The latter 2 abruptly disappeared, and the remaining ones continued to travel all accross the sky, disappearing behind the northern mountain range.  They were too slow to be meteorites, and we could see them very clearly.  My son is a physicist & amateur astronomer and I am a teacher & book illustrator.

We discussed all the possible explanations for our ""sighting"" and came to the conclusion that they moved too deliberately to be ""space junk"" or huge bright comets.

We were rushing around trying to fix breakfast and don't know why...   We don't eat breakfast right when we get up. Where did all the time go ? Where were we ? What was that tone and lights about ?  Did we go somewhere and don't remember ? Our three year old son said later that day that "" The mean men were coming back when its dark outside again."" I asked him if the men drove here and he said no they come from up there and pointed to the sky.,...........WHen he was 2 years old he would wake up almost every night at the same time and talk to someone in his room It ws like he having a conversation. We would laugh and then once screamed bloody murder like something was hurting him. We went in his room and he clung to us for the rest of the night and said he was sacared of them. WHo ? He said those guys. When he was 1 week old we went in his room to feed him and he was in a totally different position than when we left him. THis happened about 5 or 6 times. He also developed a red triangular shaped mark on the back of his leg and it stayed there for 1 to 2 months before going away. We never did figure out what it was. It was about 1 Inch in size and he was about 8 months old. My twenty year old daughter who lives in LA and is going to college would insist that she had another mommy and daddy that lived way over there and would point to the sky when she was 2 - 5 years of age. She even had names for them and could not have made them up because they were very odd and very hard to pronounce. We lived in Yakima , Wa at the time out side of town on 5 acres. I have had quite of few weird things happen in the last three years, like firecrackers going off in my bedroom and lights turning them selves off and on. I pick up strange conversations on the phone quite often too. One day I was sitting on the floor in my bedroom and heard a elecrtical zapping noise coming from behind me. I turned around to see my plant zapping electricity from one upper branch to a lower one. It burned it off the main stalk and left soot. It looked at though it had been burned off. The branch fell to the ground and was smoldering. I hope to hear from you soon and maybe you can make some sence of this.

We sat down shaking very hard from being so scared and watched it for about 1/2 hour. It circled the valley of Eburg 3 times very slowy and them disappeared as it turned to go back up higher in the sky. It looked just like the sky so you could not see it if you were just looking up. THe lights on it would change with the stars as it passed them so it didn't attract attention to a star being covered up. The reason you couldn't see it if you were just looking at the sky was because of this. It was so big , like 2000 747's hooked together .

I watch this view for quite a few hours a day, and see all variety of birds and am usually fairly accurate in judging distance from shore. at least a quarter mile or more offshore.

The five-foot pear-shaped piece of silver metal was first spotted hurtling towards the ground by trainee teacher Jenny Cook in Hendon on Tuesday morning. Police launched an inquiry following the report by the 18-year-old Sunderland University student but, despite a ground search of the area, failed to find any trace of the object. The Echo has now learnt that officials at Newcastle Airport were alerted after a similar sighting three hours later above Penshaw. Ron Atwill spotted a mysterious five-foot long grey object narrowly miss a passenger jet as it made its descent towards Newcastle Airport, while walking his dog near the old Herrington Colliery site. Mr Atwill, a retired prison service worker, saw the object at 11.45am. He said: ""I was looking up as a passenger jet was flying quite low in the distance on a flight path between the colliery and Penshaw Monument and I saw this thing almost hit it. I rang the airport because this thing appeared that close and I thought they might have spotted it as well. It was about 20ft away from the plane. ""It looked exactly the way it was described in the Echo. It was a silvery grey in colour and from where I was standing it looked very flat, pear shaped and about four to five feet long. ""I watched it for a little while and then turned away and took my eye off it and it had disappeared. It almost looked like it was standing still, moving very slowly earthbound towards Sunderland. If you can imagine a piece of corrugated iron, but not corrugated and oblong."" Speculation has included suggestions that the metal could be debris from a plane or a metal chunk from a decaying Pegasus satellite, which Nasa officials have warned is in the process of breaking up and falling to earth. Other theories include that the object could have been a model aircraft, advertising balloon, or even plastic sheeting. Mr Atwill, 64, of Elm Place, Newbottle, added: ""I hadn't a clue what it was and I didn't want to say anything, because of what people might think. ""But I definitely saw something. It wasn't a speck in the sky. It was big enough to make out even though it was a bit in the distance, but now I am beginning to think what was it? I thought it must have been something dropping out of the sky. I wasn't imagining it. I should know, I was there. It wasn't a weather balloon or a model."" A spokeswoman for Newcastle Airport said the pilot on board the jet had reported no sightings to air traffic controllers. Detective Inspector John Watts, of Sunderland City Centre Police, said: ""We had a report of a strange object in the skies about the size of a small car. We couldn't find anything but it has been reported to the relevant authorities."" Roger Mallett, an independent paranormal investigator, said: ""It is more than likely they saw something which they can't rationally explain and they don't know who to turn to. The fact that two independent people did, adds more credibility and if more come forward, even in two or three weeks' time, will certainly add even more weight.""

I remember I always used to look at three bright starts in a triangular shape in the sky because I always felt something about them. I was looking out of the window for a few minutes. Then I suddenly noticed one of the stars (I always used to look at) was shining so bright, but nothing happened for a few seconds until I finally saw a bright object appear exactly from that spot with the same size of the star that I was looking, and was inclining in my direction (and growing bigger). I was shocked when I saw the scene. The UFO reached me in just about two seconds with so much speed that the scene was like slow motion and that was the scariest part of the incident. After it came right in front of my face, I was just looking at it (like if I was trying to explore something) without even getting scared. But after three or four seconds it vanished. Then I got scared again and I started crying. I couldn't believe it because I was a kid (11 years old) But still, I wonder why I woke up when nothing even happened and knew that I had to go by the window and see those 3 stars until a UFO comes out of one of the starts, exactly in my direction and right in front of my face and then it vanishes. At first the object was like a star. But then it turned into a UFO and it grew bigger when it came closer to me. The object was very bright and it had green, red and orange lights. Unfortunately the object was so bright that I couldn't even see how the body looked like. But after I saw the UFO pictures, I presumed it was like the large pleiadian ship (~20 meter diameter, 18 ports around rim, red/orange bottom) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There were no other cars on the highway and it was a very clear night, when suddenly the interior of the truck light up with flickering fire light, we thought the trucks cube with all our supplies was on fire. The light source was on the passenger side (my side) just out of the corner of my eye, but when I looked the light was gone. We both saw the light, but didn't know where it came from. We were a little taken aback. Five minutes later the light came back on the same side as before, but it was much dimmer and again when we looked back in the mirrors the light disappeared, but it was the same flickering light and there was no other traffic on the road with us. We arrived at our destination and told others our story. It turned out that the same light flashed two others in a different car, the same night, but in their story it was much brighter and scared them so bad that they pulled over and camped the rest of the night. Three weeks later after the contract was finished the crew was going back to Prince George along the same road, this time I was sitting behind the driver, it was about the same time as before, but in a different truck and again there was no other traffic on the road and it was a very clear night. Suddenly I got a savear head acke, it was instant and painful, like someone was going into my head and trying to comunicate. I tried to hear, but failed. I was going to give up trying when I heard in the back of my head ""he still can't hear us"", with that I tried again to comunicate, but again could not make the connection. After about 15 minutes of trying I gave up and looked out the window to my right, past two of my crew. They were looking and talking towards the inside of the truck, so they didn't see what I saw. It was as large as a big marbell and bright white with a tail shooting out the back. Between the body and the tail was a gap about an inch wide. The spray was emmitting from the body and looked to be bubbling (large bubbles close to the boby and smaller ones at the end of the spray).From the spray shoot the tail which looked to be about five feet long. All the spray and the tail were orangy yellow in colour. The truck was going about ninty kms and when I looked at it, it slowed right down and flew behind the truck. The window it was flying beside was open a crack and when it slowed down and went behind the truck the noise from the wind coming through the window dropped by half, and my headacke went away instantly. I didn't say anything to my crew, I think I was in mild shock. Love to have it happen again. Next time I will stop the truck.",2001-04-28T00:00:00,53.84763564814815,-122.85669027777777

At 9:25 PM, 2-16-95, my wife and I heard a jet plane type roaring.  This was not suprising, as a small airport is a few miles north.  I soon realized that the roaring was intensifing, rather than diminishing.  Looking out the west window of my family room, I saw three bright, blue-white strobe lights at about 40 degrees in the overcast sky.  The lights were arranged in a flattened triangle, with the two base lights about 10 degrees apart, the one apex light three digrees to the left and two degrees high.  If you connected the lights, it would have made a simple ship profile, with the bow to the left, the water line below. The lower to lights strobed simultanesouly, and when dark, the upper light strobed.  The rythem of the strobing would correspond to a normal resting heart beat of about 72 beats per minute.  These lights were stationary.  I opened the window and distinctly heard the great roaring sound emminating from their direction.  Using 7X35 binoculars, I could not make out any shape or outline, as the area between the lights blended in with the night sky.  The lights looked like typical aircraft strobes, but about twice as bright.  My wife also saw and heard this phenomenom. I observed the lights move, in unision, extremely slowly to the west  I watched for about 12 minutes before they dissapeared behind distant roof tops.  Just before this happened, the lights seemed to rotate slowly towards the north. I called the local radar tower and the tower at Cleveland Hopkins airport.  Neither had any craft on their radar in my vacinity, nor had there been.  I called the FAA the next morning to inquire about the same, and the woman there stated she had received a similar report from Huron, Ohio.  There, a man claimed the roaring had broken some windows.  Huron is due west of here.  Another friend living in Chagrin Falls Ohio, slightly south east of here, claimed to have seen and heard something similar the same night, glimpsing it through the tree tops surrounding his home.

The memory itself is strong and undeniable yet when I try to concentrate on the event, I can recall it only as through a veil of mist.  On the day in question, however, the weather was perfectly clear.  A beasutiful blue desert sky.  I cannot begin to remember what first caught my attention, but I do recall the gist of the conversation I had with my wife.  ""Is that what I think it is?""  ""I can't beleive it could be anything else"" ""It's so huge"" for about twenty minutes we observed a huge silvery grey craft.  I first remembered it as being Large and round but throughout the day I remember the round craft as being one type along with two others that joined the much larger craft which I now seem to remember as being somewhat angular.  As for its' shape, I cannot find the words to describe how immense it was.  It moved fairly slowly for the time we observed it.  I do not recall how it came to leave our sight. As for the other objects I beleive I saw, there were some large round ones, and two types of smaller ones.  Had I seen the smaller ones by themselves, I do not beleive I would have described them as small but in relations ship to the large craft, they seemed somewhat diminutive.  I am overwhelmed by my memory of the large craft.  My wife remembers the large craft as being oval. This does not fit my recollection.  Nor does she recall any other smaller craft.  What puzzles me most, I think, is that we did not talk about this event for any length of time after it happened.  It seemed so, ""Matter of fact"" It seems to me that an event such as this would have been ""life changing"" but strangely enough this has not been the case.  I spent some time this evening searching the web to see if anyone else witnessed what we saw on or around the same period of time with no luck.  Perhaps it was some foggy dream of my own creation I say to myself, yet when I asked my wife if she recalled anything, she quickly was able to verify a similar sequence of events.  Our details do not seem to coincide, but the overwhelming memory of the event, for me, precludes any immediate need for corraboration(sp?)  I am not now, nor have recently been under the influence of any medication alcohol or illness.  I do not now nor do I have any family history of any mental illness.  I am not given to flights of fantasy yet do not generally take the role of unreasonable sceptic.",2001-04-28T00:00:00,33.56413757440476,-111.9050830357143

My neighbor and I were doing just that when all of a sudden I look up and see what I thought was a comet.  I said to my friend, ""Hey look!  Check out that comet!""  We both look at it for a few seconds.  Then he notices another similar ""comet"" to the north of the one I saw.  My first reaction was, ""Maybe this is a meteor shower,"" but I soon realised if this was a meteor shower why weren't the meteors visually moving.  I looked back at the UFO I spotted and saw that it had moved further up (it was on an angle like this \ from our viewpoint) and the tail had grown.  Then one of us saw a third UFO in the distance which was about 1/2 inch long at arm's length ( the first was about 1 1/2 inch and the second 1 inch ) I can't recall exactly what happened because we were both so excited, but #2 had grown and moved, too.  Eventually the third one moved and a fourth appeared.  Let me remind you that I didn't see any of these moving, growing, or appearing.  This kept on happening, one would move and grow while another would appear.  After about a half an hour there were nine UFOs and by this time #1 had grown to about 4 or 5 inches and had moved so it almost vertical ( they were moving in a circular pattern with one appearing when it was horizontal and increasing in angle from there ) as the others had grown proportionatly.  By this time we were both freaked out.  So we ran the half block home thinking aliens were going to abduct us knowing only what the media had told us about UFOs and aliens.  After that I became very interested in the UFO phnomenon and read countless books on the subject.  My neighbor however, I think has pretty much brushed it off as somthing explainable, but I checked and there was no comet or meteor shower that night.",2001-04-28T00:00:00,41.8732,-88.0002

I am sending this without the consent from my father.  My father whom has been famously a non-believer his whole adult life, has recounted to me a truly disturbing story.  Although it was a couple years ago, I finally decided to report his story. My father works for a local steel company, he would leave for the day shift at approximately 0545H every day.  He took the same route every day. Since we live out side of the city he would travel a back country road off the highway.  When he turned onto this road he noticed up ahead that it appeared to be the sun rising beyond the bush area.  He travelled closer, approximately a mile up the road, over a railroad bypass.  When reaching the max height of the bypass he saw what a large saucer type object to his left.  It was about half a kilometre from him.  He pulled over to the side of the road and observed it.  It hovered above the trees.  Predominately red lights with blue and white also.  They did not flicker but were continueous.  He told me that it was about 200 feet long in length and approximately 50-80 feet in height.  He remarked to me about how he couldn't believe how big it was.  It was noiseless and there was no other actions other than the ones stated above.  He observed for about  half an hour.  The reason he knows this, he told me, was because he pulled into work at 5 minutes to 0700H.  He left before it did, so it is unknown how long it stayed. He didn't tell me at first, he relayed the story to my mother, whom told me.  I questioned him right away.  He has refused to speak to anyone about it for fear of ridicule.  He is afraid of being called ""crazy"".  He did not speak of it for a couple years, self-doubt was obviously taking its toll on him.  A week ago I asked him about it again and he gave me more detail, with vigor.  Unbeknownst to him I am relaying to you his story. I am my fathers judge of character.

When I first looked up in the sky and saw the lights the first impression I had was I was seeing the Big Dipper Constellation. Then it struck me that the lights were rather bright and the dipper is not orange, besides this being the wrong time of the year for it. I watched the lights for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes trying to get some kind of clue to what the were. The lights were moving from west to east at a rather slow rate of speed so I didn't take them for aircraft. The sky was mostly cloudy and the lights occasionally moved through one of these cloud banks. I didn't hear any aircraft noises and the lights seemed to be moving rather aimlessly along their path anyway. I would have taken them for a group of hot air balloons except I don't think anyone would be crazy enough to take balloons that high at night in the middle of a January night. The lights were circling each other and changing formations rather aimlessly as they headed east. There were no aircraft in pursuit of these lights nor did any chase while I watched them. If these were extra-terrestrials they obviously had a few beverages during their pit stop on Earth. I finally got in my car to head home to see if I could get my wife to see these but they disappeared from my sight about five minutes after I started driving.

But what we witnessed (just happened to have just reached the top of Bear Peak and were looking out across the plains toward Denver) was definitely traveling east and came from the west along a trajectory more like Salt Lake/Denver than Nebraska/Colorado. The glow from the illuminated gases around the object were bright enough to light up my face and allow one of my friends to realize and turn around and catch the end of the spectacle.

I had heard the droaning of an airplane engine and went back out on the front steps to see if parachutists might be jumping, which is a common occurance on Sundays at a small airstrip located about a mile northwest of our condo just off route 111. I put my head out from under the overhang to look for the plane, and pulled back quickly as the bright sun was right overhead. Just then, from above the overhang came a small round silvery object. My first thought was that it was a white bird, but quickly discounted that as the object moved straight and steady towards the east southeast at a pretty good clip. I watched it for three seconds and it disappeared. I don't believe it was reflecting the sun as the sun was almost straight above it. It was round, possibly shaped like a ball or a disk, silvery white in color, and about the size of a round 1/8"" grape seed held between the tips of the first finger and the thumb at arms length, and it covered the distance of a 12 inch ruler held at arms length in three seconds. About two seconds later the airplane came into view moving in an east northeasterly direction. In comparison, the airplane was the size of a grape held at arms length and it moved the distance of the 12 inch ruler in about seven seconds. I've seen high flying jets from the same location in the past, but there's always a lot of noise involved, usually following the jet at a distance. There was no noise from the silvery object. I don't know whether the object was small and close or large and very high in the sky, but it's possible someone on the airplane spotted it as it passed in front of them. I hope someone got a better look at it than I did and reports it.

The time was just before dark when I had been starring out the window and noticed that toward the coast there was someting in the air which wasn't very normal.  It seemed to be in the shape of some sort of missile and was on a very subtle donward trajectory.  It was very obviously not a plane and my husband who is an engineer also agreed that it wasn't a plane and also thought it kind of looked like a missile.  I have to admit that it freaked me out and I really didn't want to drive further. Anyway, we kept driving and when we were heading into grapevine California which is just over tejon pass and into the valley we started to encountered black smoke like something was burning  but apparently there was no fire so the source is unknown but we no longer saw what appeared to us to be a missile either.  .Anyway, this had both of us quite alarmed and freked out so we stopped in a parking lot to calm down a bit and as we sat in the car we saw a small ball f light flash and dissappear with incredible speed that surprised both of us and this light seemed to come from no where as well.  That is about al I have to say about what i saw except that it was very freaky and I probably will not be forgetting it anytime soon. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

Washington State: 9/10/01 Two bright white burning, falling objects, one may have hit the ground While enjoying an evening walk near sunset (Appx 8:00 - 8:15 p.m.), we heard a small child walking on a perpendicular street exlaim ""wow, fireworks"".  He and is two parents and a small child stopped and looked toward the sky in the SE, yet north of Mt. Rainier.  The two of us looked in the direction they were looking and saw what might be described as a falling object, very white in color, falling quickly toward the ground.  It looked almost like a Roman candle fire ball or some form of signal flare, but it was falling quickly.  No planes appeared directly in the vicinity, although 3 commercial flights were lined up for a Sea-Tac landing in the distance.  It's trajectory was not perfectly straight, nor it's speed steady.  It struck me of how a piece of plywood would fall from the sky, falling fast, then slowing and even changing it's horizontal allignment slightly as it ""caught air"".  This first object appeared to stop burning before it hit the ground (if it hit the ground)at about 25 degrees above the horizon. My partner then stated that she could see another object, dark in color, falling very fast in the sky above the first.  I could not see it with my naked eyes but she continued to watch it and tried to point it out to me.  Within 10 to 20 seconds, this object appeared to burst into flame and burn in the same manner as the first object.  It's rate of fall and trajectory was similar to the first.  This object continued to burn and possibly did hit the ground.  Our view of it was obscured by a tree in the neighborhood, but we saw it flame down to within 5 degrees or less above the horizon when it went out of view, still very bright.  We did not hear anything nor did we see any smoke or any sort of a flash when it hit the ground.  The object flamed long enough to come down west (toward us) of the Cascade foothills in the vicinity of the White River valley SE of the City of Enumclaw. We continued to watch the sky but did not see any further activity.  We could not say for sure that the planes changed their courses, but the closest did seem to stay higher than the following two.  Upon reaching our home I did try to contact the closest FAA office in Auburn and was dismissed by the operator as a nut.  She stated in broken english that they had no reports of any such activity, laughed and then hung up the phone.  We assume it must have been some sort of space junk but are curious about why it would fall for some time, then appear to ""catch fire"" and then burn until it hit the ground.",2001-10-12T00:00:00,47.106,-121.6029

The same type of fireball object travelling across the sky, this time from east to west. Tonights siting, the object was moving extremely fast. I estimate about 500 NMPH. Altitude is too hard to determine at night. Also this siting tonight was not dropping sparks as the other sitings have done. This is driving us crazy trying to figure out what it is. But, since it is un-identified by us, we consider it a UFO. ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS)) Peter, Thanks for responding. My Fiancé and I saw this again tonight and we think we have determined it to be a type of flare. Tonight when we saw it, it seemed to fizzle out and we could see an object floating down thanks to the moon light we have tonight. I guess our only real mystery is who is sending a flare up on a regular basis.

For a split second, (having flashbacks to 9/11) I thought it might be a plane heading down.  Then, I see other objects falling too, in more of an arc fashion.  Also, I notice about 5-6 silvery round objects at about a 40,000 foot height in the sky.  My friend and I watch all of this, and notice one of the fiery objects, turn and go north after it had been falling south. We initially thought what we were seeing was ""space junk"" but that was quickly ruled out with the other vehicles flying around and also the fact that the fiery object went north. There were two different objects.  The silvery round ones high in the sky and the fiery Rocket like objects falling and climbing. The next evening (1/28) I observed the same thing again (that is when I got a better look at the fiery objects).

I looked up and I saw like a little silver shiny sphere. It did not seem to have light by its own. We think it was just reflecting the sun's light because it was a really sunny and windy day with blue sky and few clouds (not so common in Mexico City). At the beginning we thought it was a metallic ballon (those for children) but it was a windy day and we were very surprised because this little sphere was static just like a light bulb in a room. We estimated it was very high because we saw an airplane passing by and the sphere seemed to be even higher. The same happened with the clouds. In fact after approximately 10 minutes we could not see it any more because some clouds passed by just under it. My husband concluded that maybe it was a geostationary satellite. That is why we could not appreciate its movement. But days after I searched in the  internet and it did not look like one. Besides these kind of satellites are very far from the Earth. I also looked for weather ballons but apparently these kind of balloons have some movement and they are not so big. If this was a a weather balloon it should have been a very big one because it was very far and we were able to see it. Finally we concluded that maybe it was a NASA new device for experimentation.

I was invited to a cinco de mayo party at a friends home. Approximately 8 p.m. that evening my wife and another person were sitting at a table on a deck overlooking the Delaware River. The other side of the river is approximately 800 feet away and a rise of trees graduates to a ridge. The direction was West. The party was in its early stages when I heard a reaction by someone to ""come quickly...look!"" I quickly ran out on the porch and looked West above the  ridge at the sky on the other side of the river. This is what I saw: A pale yellow oval object moving at a relatively slow speed heading East towards my friends home. At first I thought it was an unusual aircraft( strange shape and size...larger than a helicopter, smaller than airplane).  There were some clouds in the sky and there was moonlight. Then SUDDENLY the object changed direction almost 90 degrees south)- and also moved high rate of speed... instantly , zooming out of sight!. My thoughts were that it could not possibly be any aircraft I have ever seen in my 53 years . I saw something that stayed with me for a long time in my mind...could not get over the idea that seeing is believing.

The object was not traveling at a great speed, and it was only probably two hundred yards in the air.  My first reaction was to pull off to the side of the road, but I immediately realized the object would be out of sight by that time.  The object was round, and doomed and very dirty looking. What stuck in my mind for several days was the object reminded me of a picture I had seen several times, years back, on TV.  My reaction to the picture on TV was ""This round, doomed, dirty looking, fakey looking object is suppose to be a UFO.  No way.""   I wonder now.  Because it was 12:50 Pm and the outerbelt was crowded, their had to be hundreds of cars that saw the same thing I did.  But they probably were heading to or from work, or had other business, and brushed off the object like I did.  The object did look like what I always pictured a UFO not to look like.

Ok, as a skeptic (most UFOS I would think are merely military dirigibles and unmanned drones) I wasn't really certain what i and my girlfriend had seen.  We pulled out of the Holland Tunnel in downtown NYC not far from Canal street, on our way to Brooklyn.  It was a beautiful day as the sun was shining and visibility was straight up (10,000ft ceiling maybe), and no cloud cover.  We were sitting in traffic for oh, maybe 2 minutes when something just above a building across from us caught my eye.  The distance, ground, was maybe 100 yards to the building, and vertically maybe 12 stories high.  The sun wasn't shining in our eyes nor was there any glare to obscure our clear path of vision.  This thing behaved like a living creature, it sat in the air just above this building and slowly rose and began to move horizontally over canal street.  Immediately i asked my girlfriend to look and comment on what she thought it was (still sitting in traffic we had ample time to peep it).  Her initial comment was that it was a string of black balloons floating carelessly in the air and rising upward, made sense to me judging its appearance, BUT balloons wouldn't behave like this thing did!  This idea of it being balloons was dashed against the rocks due to it's size and nature....was maybe 45 feet in length and altered its shape.   Allow me to explain in bulleted points:  1.  The object was hovering in place and changed direction a few times smoothly, against the breeze which was blowing.  Did not react to wind direction or speed, as the wind would gust. 2.  Object was close enough to the street (like 100 feet) that it would be affected by same wind we were. 3.  Was jet black and appeared to be almost like a giant oarfish moving in the air in a twisting fashion.  This thing had what seemed specific motions which were repeated over and over such as a sidewinder snake moves...deliberate and repetitive. 4.  Would stop, hover, twist, move, stop, hover, twist, move, etc. all the while changing shape from long and snakelike to rectangular and spherical. 5.  After floating and shape shifting above and around building (it wasnt tethered as the wind would whip it a certain way)it moved ""fast"" (maybe within 2 secinds time) the length of 3 blocks NE, then stopped to begin its dance again.  Then moved an opposite direction just as quickly and stopped. As it moved on it began to head due NE towards the east side and east river then ultimately dissappeared behind a large building maybe 6 blocks from my car, at this time it reached an altitude of maybe 350 feet then just vanished.  By now i had cars honking behind me followed by a barrage of profanity, so i had to move. Strangest thing i've ever seen...it truely looked like a snake or oarfish/eel floating in air anyone else see this thing?! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Since I live very close to the area, I will be personally doing a field investigation for a small UfoAmerica.iwarp.com. Several thousand others were witness to this event, as vehicles on surrounding roadways were reportedly pulling off to the shoulder faster than you could imagine. There were about 15, maybe as many as 20 glowing orange orbs, high in the sky above Caretet New Jersey. The event was reported on all the local NJ/NYC news channels including Fox-5, NBC-4, WB-11, NJ-12, and is totally unexplained. The orbs moved about, changing various formations. People said they saw everything from a circle, to the big dipper. The UFOs were just floating there in the sky, moving about each other and taking various formations. Carteret NJ police were notified by several callers. So far there has been no radar confirmation, and it appears that the military was not involved. The only alternative explanation at this point, are unlawful sky divers with illumination flares. However, the length of the event seems to rule that out. There are at least two known videos. The UFOs themselves were of the ""string of pearls"" variety. The same type have been caught on tape before. Once in the US in the 50s I beleive, and the other in Mexico more recently. This seems to be a very good sighting with many people as witnesses. I will be going door to door today asking witnesses to tell their story in the area. I'm hoping that by posting it on the Internet everywhere, more people will come forward. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time of the event here.  PD))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,40.5817,-74.2315

I was driving at approximately 9:00 pm on Rt. 30 North towards Hanover, PA, with my 3 children.  Unfortunately, they did not see it.  I was on a stretch of the road where there are no street lights, so it was pretty dark in the sky, as there were not many stars shining either.  Anyway, as I was driving, I noticed a blue colored ball shaped light, or object, flash across the sky out of the passenger side of the windshield.  It was going north, just like me.  It was so fast.  There was no trail behind it, so I know it was not a shooting star, or anything like that.  Especially since there were not many stars out that night.  Also, there were no cars in front of me, or behind me; and no cars coming towards me from the opposite direction.  I had never seen anything like that before.

I assumed it was an aircraft in the flight pattern from Wenatchee to Moses Lake, however we do not have any scheduled flights after 20:30. Because the light looked out of place, I parked and began to watch it through a pair of 10X50 binoculars. When I did this, I noticed that the light seemed to be pulsating, going from a dimmer orangish then intensifying to a larger whitish. I wondered if the light was a yard light from a farm house somewhere on top of Monument Hill located just south of Quincy, WA. however I could clearly see the silouette of the tops of the hills, and this light was obviously higher than the hills. At first the light appeared to be stationary, but then it began to move slowly along the ridge of the hill towards the town of Ephrata, WA. It appeared to move along top of the ridge for about 1 minute and then stopped, began to desend towards the hill top. I noticed that the pulsating seemed to get brighter as it began to desend, as it neared the hill top, it was just like someone turned off a light switch. It just disappeared!! I sat there for about 20 more minutes searching the skyline thinking that maybe I just lost it behind a cloud,(it was overcast that night). After about twenty minutes, I spotted the light (or one just like it) about 20 miles to the west of where I saw it desend towards the ground, the light had the same characteristics as before as it seemed to be pulsating the orange/white light.

It had a glow around the circle, I am not much of an astronomer but I believe it was a lunar eclipse, the moon was very bright and seemed to be right in the middle of the circle which had a glowing haze around it.

My parents and another couple were outside and us 3 sisters and there two boys were all in the bedroom bunked down for the night or so our parents thought. It was around late night maybe 9pm or later, Its sketchy still but i remember a bunch of activitie and excitement going on in the back of the cabin (our bedroom window faced the back of the property not the lake). My dad came running in to the cabin and told us kids to go to sleep and not look out the window ( we tried and couldnt see anything anyway) when parent speak we listened anyway.  Dad got a camera and his gun and ran out side. I dont remember much after that. This is the story we were told by our parent and there friends  They would not lie to us for we have witnessed many and i mean many saucer and wierd stuff in the sky for years over the olypmic mt and our lake.  the story is that there was a flying disk with lights around the bottom of the disk flashing the many colors and they could see the port holes (as mom called them) i dont recall if they saw any aliens in windows or not. Dads gun had a scope on it and they looked thru it. The male friend was a very large man and had to huge a big pine tree he was so frightened, my mother ran up the driveway away from the cabin to get away from it,she said and my dad yelled and said we got kids in the house.  she was so frightened. The disk hovered for about 15 to 20 min. if i recall right.  They got many pictures . We were unaware and dont remember much except that us kids were frightened. The next morning the lake was down a foot and there were dead fish floating in the water. We left for home earlier than usual. My parent had family develop the pictures and they called the authorities and newspapers. The newspaper story said da! d shot a t it which he did not and they said it was spotted over whidbey island which it was not. and the pictures were confiscated by the athourities along with the negatives. I did a share and tell at school with the newspaper articule and never did it again. Us kids were ridiculed and told we were weird. We weren't  This kind of observation was natuarl to us girls. We've seen cigar shaped clouds over the lake, we've see orbs, we've seen mothership(main) with 4 or more little lights on either side go into it. Alot of the times we would hear a how would you discribe this sound   woowoo  woowooo humming. We brought friends from school after we moved to cabin permantly 1 1/2 later to see the sky at night at lake and they abserved it also.  We've seen the public access with three prong hole burned into the ground with the grass pressed down. My grandparent even in the 70's and 80's were still observing these sights. Needless to say my parents are dead. We used to wish as kids that they would land and heal our mother of hodgekins disease. Yes they are up their and we girls are messed up because of it. This is true and unreal to anyone else but we lived it for years. Did we get abducted who knows If so they rejected us, The three of us girls are bi-polar and many physical aliaments, but who doesn't have these problems.

I was 16 not 17 at the time, and was with the metioned gentleman. Recently our paths crossed for the first time in twenty-eight years. What I saw was oval not boomerang shaped. It had an upper section of super white fluorescent lighting separated by partitions. It was approximately 200' away and 100' above the ground when we first spotted the craft on Monroe Blvd., between Outer Drive and Carlysle, what is known as West Dearborn. It appeared to be about 100' ft. wide. Below the craft was a red glowing dome that pulsated with bright to dimmer intensity. There were no sounds emitting from the craft. My above mentioned friend was the first to notice the craft as I was the driver. The craft was hovering over a residental area near a elementary school. I pulled into the first driveway after spotting the craft and all three of us were in a mild state of shock. This craft seemed to be aware of our presence too. The craft immeadiately headed in a northwest direction with us following in amazement. It's direction took us down Oxford Blvd., which dead-ended at Crowley Park in Dearborn, MI also. Just before the road ended, all the lights on the craft dissapeared. I then pulled into te last driveway on Oxford St. to turn around and head back to Telegraph Rd., (U.S. 24) when suddenly the craft was right over the car. At this point, I could have thrown a stone and hit it. This is where we got a good look at the red pulsating dome on the bottom.  There was now static interference on the 1963 Ford Falcon AM radio we had on at the time. Now... the craft began chasing us. My above mentioned friend was sitting in the middle and put his left leg on my accelerator pedal. My other friend sitting shotgun was throwing punches into my right arm and shoulder. I had no choice but to break all the residental speed laws by about 40 miles per hour. Now we were in survival mode. With the craft over us all the way, we made it to Telegraph Rd. south where the craft stayed at our right over the line of houses and business, rather than the middle of a major highway. We then pulled in to the only restaurant open that night which was near the intersection of Van Born Rd. We managed to get the male cook and female waitress to come out and witness the event. At this point, the craft headed west. Th restaurant employees did see the craft as it was leaving the area but it was too far off for them to describe it as we did.

These objects had now lights and appeared to be shaped to cut through an atmosphere at very high speed, although the speed they travelled at this time appeared to be maybe 50 miles an hour.  These craft came into view only at a near direct overhead angle and seemed to vanish into the darkness at the same angle at which they appeared.  We were awestruck.  The person we were waiting on arrived and had seen them also.  An old man who lived on this corner was going to work at this time.  We saw him staring up at the sky and asked him if he saw them. He said, ""see what?"" We said ""the flying saucers"".  He said that he thought he was going crazy when he saw them and wasn't going to tell anyone. We reported this sighting to the police and to the Air Force as these saucers probably flew directly over or near Bergstrom Air Force Base.  Two months later the Air Force sent a uniformed colonel to our house to inform us that we had seen ""space trash that landed later in Kansas.""  He even brought an ""official report"" with him.  We laughed him off the premises.  We anticipated that the Air Force would be interested in hearing what we saw, not telling us.  As far as I know, only the old man has since died, and the rest of us remember what we saw.

It was a little after 9p.m.  I was around 17 yrs. old, coming home from my p/t job.  I pulled up in my drive way, got out of my car and noticed a saucer shaped object with a row of lights just hovering above my house.  I looked at it for what seemed about 3 minutes - I got scared but no one was home to call to come outside and see what I saw. Quick as a flash it took off and was out of sight.  The next day I went to work & told my co-workers what I had seen, supposedly alot of other people had seen it.  The explanation we heard was that it was a weather balloon. (I don't think so).  Has any one else seen that? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-01-29T00:00:00,40.7228,-73.517

The craft flew over some trees on the side of the highway, seemed to stop directly over where I was, hovered a few seconds and then zoomed away at lightening speed, faster than a jet. I know that it was faster than a jet because I thought, I'll be able to see it when I get closer to my house. I never saw it anymore. It was gone. Funny thing, I asked around to see if anyone else saw anything strange in the town of Burnsville that Friday at 12 noon. Evidently I was the only one who saw it.

They appeared to be stationary with large spot or floodlight shining from center of cluster to the left or west.The lights gave the appearance of different size tails but were definitely not tails, they were light beams, as landing lights on an aircraft. The scene was definitely not a returning piece of space junk.It didn't appeal to me to be anything but some sort of a military manuever.Looked like an area of refueling helicopters. We didn't stop moving,and it appeared that the lights were still in the sky and we were passing them.

My wife saw them about 30  sec longer than I did.At arms length,they appeared to be about 12"" to 14""in length,and about 7"" to 9"" high.They appeared close because of the clarity of the strobes and we seemed to be passing them and the pattern appeared to change noticeably in perspective.

This scene,if reproduced as a hologram and projected skyward, would have duplicated exactly what we saw in Dec.  It would explain how the ""object"" could have moved at a fantastic rate,as was told by another witness, just by turning the 'projector'from side to side, and then shutting off the power, to make it disappear altogether. This explanation , for me,  at least gives me a sense of possibility.

PD)) Two Fiery UFO's Seen from Hellicopter at near the same height. This is second person, so bare with me.  I didn't witness the crafts myself, I'm just repeating my uncles story. My uncle flies med-vac choppers from Columbia, MO to Springfield, MO and Kansas City, MO.  Two - three weeks (exact date unknown to me- between 11/25-30/01) ago he witnessed two Unidentified Flying Objects en route between Springfield and Columbia.  He said it was pretty close to Fort Smith(?) off of I44 between Rolla and Springfield.  My uncle described these UFO's as practically undescribable or unviewable rather, other than that there was a fiery aura around the actual ships, or flames (redish orange with a blue mixture as well) unlike any fire that is common on earth and that he'd seen for that matter, blanketing the crafts outward appearance.  The ship itself wasn't even distinguishable.  He said he was travelling at about 2500ft and they appeared infront of him, like a cars headlights, at a height of nearly or exactly 3000ft, and at around 700 - 800 mph passed directly in front of him, flying exactly parallel to the earths surface, one slightly behind and caddy corner to the other.  He witnessed them go out of sight, as they had come into his view.  He even said they flew directly inbetween his chopper and a cesna flying not to far off beside of him (distance unknown to me), and when he made the call on his transmitter he was told that they were not seen on their radar, yet the cesna and him were obviously there.  He also said that they were not small either.  Very large.  He didn't go into exact detail on the size of the crafts.  I don't know where he was speaking to exactly, but he said that he spoke directly to an Air Force (representative) also and was told by him that it was 'Space Debris'.  There is no way that this was space debris given it's path of travel.  If space debris it would have been heading towards the earth!  He said that the Air Force representative was adamant, and he realized that immediatly and complied.  The local Ozark media also ran the story telling of many eye witness accounts of the UFOs, but followed with the Air Forces guise agreeing that it was 'Space Debris'. Unfortunatly this is all I gathered from him.  There was a nurse with him who shared the experience as well. (personal note to previewer - omit from description) ((NUFORC Note:  So omitted.

It was south of the freeway, about 30 degrees above the horizon, and about 30 degrees to my right ( 0 degrees being directly ahead of me).   I'd noticed it out of my upper right peripheral vision.  At first, I thought it might be a long strip of moonlight shining from behind clouds.  But as I looked, I could see a line of separate white lights (more distinct towards the front).  Underneath it, towards the front, and perfectly parralel to it, was another line of lights about 1/3 the length of the top line.  And this is what first jarred me out of the thought that it might have been moonlight :  these lines of lights were ruler-straight.  Although I could hardly process it, I realized I was looking at some kind of HUGE mechanical object. It appeared to be VERY long and rather flattish.  I say this because the sky seemed darker above and below the lines of lights  (i.e. it appeared a lot longer than it was high).  I cannot tell you how far away or how high it was, since I do not possess this skill.  However, it was obviously at plane-flying height, so to speak, and not way out 'in the atmosphere'.  At any rate, as I watched it, I realized it was moving, apparently north and perpendicular to the the freeway.  It traveled very slowly, parralel to the horizon, and straight across the sky.  As I watched, it came into view directly in front of me, above the freeway.  This thing was truely huge.  I could barely process what I was seeing, and I can only tell you that this thing looked like some kind of giant moving complex.  Although I still hesitate to utter it, the words 'space station' did come to mind.  It continued to move north.  At about 30 degrees to my left, north of the freeway,  I noticed it was angling downward.  At this point,  I strained to keep it in view.  It appeared to me that the lights went out, from the back to the front, until all I could see was one peachy-pink colored light, which then dissappeared at about 15 degrees above the horizon. I called 911 and got a Goodland operator.  I told her what I had seen and from where.   She related that 4 other calls had come in.  The next day, I described the event to a couple of people in Kansas City who each told me they'd seen a report on CNN.  One person told me it was being explained as a Russian 'spacestation' which had re-entered the atmosphere, broken apart, nothing to worry about, folks.  I myself watched the local Kansas City news at 10 pm that night and heard it explained as a Russian 'rocket' re-entering earth's atmosphere, complete with an image of what appeared to me to be a couple of meteors - 'shooting stars'.  This image was NOTHING like what I witnessed.  As I had told the 911 operator when she'd asked me if  perhaps what I'd seen might have been a comet or 'space junk', I'd replied, 'definately NOT'  -  not unless objects falling to earth are suddenly defying the laws of gravity, and traveling in slow horizontal trajectories across the sky.  Additionally, since when does a Russian anything fall to earth without further comment or inquiry?  I will add that on my return trip to Colorado through Kansas 4 days later, I called the 911 operator back, as I'd said I would.  She told me that a total of 7 calls had come in to her; one from a sheriff, 2 from deputies,  3 from local rural citizens, and mine.  I also stopped in Goodland to see if any locals were talking about it.  At a convenience store, I asked the cashier (40-ish) if he'd heard anyone talking about the 'lights' in the sky the previous Saturday night.  Apparently that night, a man had rushed into his store, sworn he was neither drunk nor taking drugs, and had told the cashier that as he'd been driving to Colorado, west on I-70, he and another driver had both stopped their cars on the freeway owing to what they were seeing in the sky.  The only description this casheir relayed to me was that the man had said there was a large light underneath this thing.  When the cashier had suggested that maybe it could have been a blimp, the man had said 'no way', as this thing was much bigger than that.  Then I told him what I saw.  During my conversation with him, I turned to another man standing behind me in the store who'd been listening in.  Judging from the somewhat frozen look on his face (40's, clean cut, athletic looking), I ventured to ask him if he'd seen 'it'.  He nodded wordlessly, 'yes'.  I asked him if he thought it was a meteor or some 'space junk', and he said, absolutely not.  He had been in Goodland at the time and I asked him to describe what he saw.  He said, 'It was just like you said.  It was big, moving slowly and horizontally across the sky'.  He left shortly after.  I have subsequently spoken at some length to the sheriff mentioned by the 911 operator.  He had seen 'it' from 20 or so miles south of where I had been at around the same time.  He described seeing brightly colored lights traveling parralel to the horizon across the sky, adding it was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.  He tried to take a poloroid, but only nearby lights on the ground were visible in the picture.  I asked him if he thought it was a meteor or 'space junk', and he'd said no, citing the same reason  -  its slow, horizontal movementl.  He asked me, 'how big do you think it was?  A mile long.....?'  I told him I am unable to judge, but that like him, what I had seen was very large.  He said 'it' had been moving from north to south.  We discussed this discrepancy in our 'sitings', yet agreed it was unlikely that these were 2 entirely unrelated events, since we'd both seen it around the same time.   Anyway, that's my story.  I am a professional woman in my mid 40's with no interest in UFO's.  Until now, anyway..… ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for 01DE01.

Ufo's play tag with each other. At 10:30 pm on the 26th of november 1997 My feionce alerted me to a very bright diamond shaped object sitting just above the horizion. On a overcast but still night. After watching the object for a minute or two i went to get my video camera. We went outside and started to film the object, almost imeadietly as i started to film the object slowly started to more to my right until it dissapeared behind a hill in the distance. We both look ed at each other and thought it was a bit weird but proceeded back inside. At that point an object in almost the same position as the first one. A large object was sitting on the horizion with a smaller object aproaching from it's right side (my left side) passed right by the bigger object and stopped and then flared up to the same size as the the other object. Big! at that point they started to fly towards each other passing by each other, one of the objects stopped where the first one was sitting and the other object moved behind the hill and out of sight. The other object remained in position for minutes before leaving in the same direction as the previous two objects. As was stated in the video by my feionce and I we where surprised at what we had just witnessed. At that point out of the corner of my eye i saw an object coming towards us i called to ((name deleted)) and said look up and we saw what looked like two balls of light with a strobing red light flying right by us with no noise and no definable features apart from being two balls of light. No wings no tail no blinking and more importantly no noise. the object was low in the sky, infact so low that it passed behind a tree a about 25-30ft tall about 20 metres in front of me. As it passed by us and went in front of us it was a mirror image of itself. In other words no visable change just two balls of light with a strobing red light going from left to right. We lost sight of the object about two or so kilometers away going behind trees. at that point i think we both knew we were watching something we had never seen before. Around five os so minutes later a large oval shaped orange glowing light appeared on the horizion right where we had lost the object behind the trees, low in the sky but clearly visable the object stayed still for minutes when all of a sudden a small object seemed to fly write up into the bright oval object.The bright object then changed shape into two white lights seperated by a small gap but with no red light this time and was approached by another similar looking object which flew past and a minute or two later both objects seemed to fade out and were no longer visable. The time now was around 11.30pm 1 hour later. Quite a long exhibition what ever it was! The next day i telephoned Air services Australia the official people who monitor aircraft movement into and out of Sydney. Their Response was that there was only one plane in the area at the time a 747 which flew past the area at 10.30pm and into Sydney (Mascot) and asked if i wanted to persue the matter further at the time i was a little nervous and so no but i would like to no what it could have been. Their response was after a minute or so on hold was that ""it could have been police helicopters or rescue helicopters"". Well if this is true then i am convinced we would have heard them as we had one pass almost directly overhead at no more than 100 feet. the UFO Society of Austrailia has also looked at my tape as well as an astronomer at Sydney Observerty, Channel seven news here in Sydney not to mention my family and friends are all of the same opinion we have seen and video taped ufo's. They cannot at this time be identified. I would be only to happy to show you this and other footage i have and let you make your on mind up. However as i live in Australia we only have vhs.

My actaual location was approximately 3-4 miles south west of Beloit Kansas.  A yellow-orange ball with a bluish trailing edge appeared to fall to the ground at a high rate of speed.  It did not appear to be perfectly round.  It was as if the effects of falling through the atmosphere were effecting it's shape, not actually causing a distinguisable tail but rather making it somewhat egg shaped.  The object appeared to be dense and not transparent at all, but also it appeared to me to be a ball of fire rather than a solid object.  It fell at not quite right angles to the ground.  I would say more like 80 degrees in relation to the horizon moving from right to left as it fell.  I would say that from the time it entered into view in my windsheild and disapeared behind the horizon was a little more than one second. I was in a low spot and when I topped out on the next hill I saw no further evidence of the object.  I neither heard, nor felt, nor saw any impact, but as far as I could tell it had to have hit the ground because it disappeared behind the horizon.  As far as size I would say that if it were possible to extend my arm infront of me and try to cover the object with my thumb it would have just barely covered it.  Because I have no way to know it's exact size it is impossible to accurately judge the distance it was away from me.  However, I had the sense that it may have fallen somewhere around the Solomon Rapids or Glen Elder lake area and between the Tipton road and Hiway 24 which run fairly perallel to each other about 5 miles appart.  I contacted the 911 dispatcher and within about 10 minutes a deputy Sheriff contacted me by phone.  I related the event to him and he told me he had been on the tipton road also but had not seen it.  He said that if something had fallen it must have been behind him or he would have seen it also.  His location at th! e time w as west of glen elder eastbound heading toward me. He did not tell me how far west he was but I was about 7-8 miles east of glenelder at the time.)  If the object was behind the officer it would have to have been atleast 8-10 miles away from me.  If that is the case, in my estimation the oblect had to be fairly large for it to have appeared as large to me as it did.",2001-02-18T00:00:00,39.4073,-98.0881

Nothing more was said but the last two days (Oct. 8 and 9th) in Las Vegas, NV while viewing Telemundo, a major Spanish speaking channel, there has been much airing of the footage, actually extended over what what shown during the day of the event.  This time it was being commented on in Spanish and shown on the screen was the object, a disk shaped, silverish object, quite large, seemingly the size of a couple of busses seen to be hovering between the towers, after the first airplane hit, but before the first tower collapsed and before the second airplane crashed.  The footage was being shot from a close by helicopter and narrated in English by a female newscaster. She pointed out the object to the cameraman with a startled ""look over there, what is that"".  The cameraman's comment was much more graphic, such as ""what the **** is that?!""  He filmed it for a few seconds and then the disk shot out from between the buildings and directly towards them.  The woman sounds like she is exclaiming, screaming slightly and the camera guy says something and actually leans back and films from a reclining angle as the object careens rapidly up and past them.  This footage has been aired several times and each time seeing it it's quite startling.  My original comment to the kids before seeing it was that it must be some kind of secret surveillance craft that we have and don't want anyone to know about but upon viewing it, one just can't believe that we have such a capacity.  I've seen the comments from around the world of people who viewed something like this and would like to have this investigated.  Is there some sort of news blackout that has prevented this particular shot from being re-aired in the U.S.  Interestingly today it was announced that Sony is buying this network.

Washington). The colors were a distinct green, red and white.  They moved just slightly, relative to each other, indicating some small movement, but over the period of viewing, the object stayed basically stationary in what was seemingly a hover pattern from our distance (up close, maybe a tight circle?).  We were interested in particular due to the total grounding of all civilian aircraft that night.  The size of the lights and intensity was about right for a planet, but the lack of move over time ended that thought for us (as well as the sharply varying colors).

I live in Colon, MI. (85.19deg west, 41.57deg north). The time was about 22:10 when he reported to me that he saw a plane in the sky. I went to his room to see, thinking this odd as all of the airports had been shut down. I have seen airplane lights before, they strobe a a regular, even rate and have a red light on one wing, a blue light on the other and a white light amid-ship somewhere. What I saw was a slow moving craft with randomly flashing blue, red, and white lights all along the edge of the craft. We then ran outside to get a better view. It was moving due west from a point south east of my position. As it came parallel to our position I did a angle check by hand (a trick I learned in astronomy class) I found that it was about 30 degrees above the horizon over due south. I could not judge its distance as I realized that I was not dealing with just any standard aircraft, and these things could really be any size. I could not detect any sound coming from the craft. But, as I said, I have no idea how far the craft was from my position. As it neared the western horizon I noticed that the only steady lights on the craft were two white rear lights. One on each rear point. I don't know if there have been any other reports of the sighting, but I offer mine as more proof that this type of craft exists.

He said ""What color is that thing you've seen before? I think it's outside."" The object was almost directly over the house, located in the SE at about 500-1000ft in altitude, floating slowly NW. Within a few minutes, it stopped in a hover and was close enough to discern a vague gray colored triangle shaped outline behind the main point of round orange light. At this point, the object began alternately glow brighter orange and fade, then it began to kind of change in appearance. Several times the object was clearly visible as a line of small bright orange dots which would then resolve into one large orange glowing object again. It did this 'dance' at least 3 times. During the times it would again resolve into one object, smaller white sparks appeared to fall off the bottom. After approximately 12 minutes, the object began to fade in brightness and float off towards the west. Shortly thereafter, it faded altogether and since the night was clear with an almost full moon rising, the gray outline was visible clearly at this point. It picked up speed and then disappeared altogether from visibility behind some trees in the neighborhood. We then witnessed a local police patrol turn down the nearest street in the direction that the object went, and I have little doubt that the officer probably saw it too. My 15 y/o daughter who also witnessed the event was on the phone to one of her friends; her parents have a police scanner and she told my daughter that the radio traffic from the local police stated it was ""balloons someone set on fire"". That doesn't make sense. Helium filled balloons would not be able to stand up to the heat of any attached fire source, and this object emitted no smoke trail. Nor did it make any sound. We tried to get videotape of the incident, however, the batteries for the video camera weren't charged up.

S.-Mexico border the California desert, approximately 70 miles east of San Diego.  At approximately 0530 hrs. (Pacific Standard Time), on Thursday morning, 31JA02, the officer was seated in his patrol vehicle, facing south toward the Mexican border.  His dog became visibly agitated, at which time the officer began to discern a warbling sound, which fluctuated in pitch.  For a moment or two, the officer thought that the sound was being generated by his vehicle.   The officer reports that he was quite surprised to see a disc shaped object, with a noticable bulge on its top, and fluctuating illumination around its flange, fly from west to east, directly above his vehicle.  A moment later, the officer looked back to the area of the sky from which this first object had just flown, and was equally surprised to see a cluster of discs, similar in appearance to the first disc, fly across the sky in the same direction in which the first object had flown.  In the center of the cluster of objects, the officer witnessed a ""boomerang-shaped"" object, which he at first took to be a ""military bomber.""   ((NUFORC Note:  Presumably a B-2 bomber, which looks like a flying wing.  PD)) The officer quickly jumped out of his vehicle to get a better look at the objects as they moved fairly rapidly to the east.  At approximately that moment, the boomerang-shaped object, the officer reports, suddenly accelerated in velocity, began to rise at a sharp angle into the cloudless, dark morning sky, and disappeared from sight.  A short time later, the discs also accelerated, and flew off in the same direction that the boomerang-shaped object had flown.  NUFORC hopes to be able to obtain more information about this incident.

My husband and I have seen this on several occassions (together & idiviually) since Sept. 1999. The first time we saw it was at about 9pm on a clear night in September. It was an extremely bright light racing toward the south. It did not have a trail nor did it make any noise. I don't if you would classify it as a fireball or a light. It was as bright as a fireball or perhaps like a meteor. It streaked across the sky in a matter of seconds. We never saw anything fly that fast. It actually seem to dissapear into thin air. We are both professionals and realized after mentioning it to couple of friends in passing coversation, that it was best to stop talking about it because they thought it a strange topic and in laymans terms didn't want them to think we were nuts. A few months later a friend had told us that while she & her husband were walking the dog, she too, had seen the same light. Her husband did not because he was not looking in the same direction. Since then we have viewed this same strange light on several occassions. Twice at dusk. On a clear evening and on a overcast evening and also late at night. It has been a few months since we saw had seen the last occurance and we forgot all about it until recently. Another friend of ours (a little skeptical) told us about a green light she viewed during the daylight hours. Unlike what we had seen, this light (fireball) appeared to change directions and then disappear. We were very interested in what she had said because now we personally know of two other people in the same town who saw this and think that others must have seen this too. It is ironic that to see such a event like this you would have to be looking at in the right place at the right time because it happens so fast!

I was in transit from Dallas, TX to College Station, TX driving about 70 miles an hour. As I approached Reagan, TX on State Highway 6, headed in a south easterly direction, I saw a light that seemed bluish in color traveling in a path perpendicular to mine. At first, I thought it was a lower flying plane. But upon further inspection, it was clearly not a plane due to shape, speed, altitude, and lack of any further lighting. The strange thing to me was that I've witnessed meteor showers and they have always seemed to be coming straight down, are very fast, and are very short lived. The object I saw was traveling in a very horizontal direction angling slightly downward. As I was driving, I noticed it in about the 11 o'clock position from the direction I was driving and proceded to follow it visually for 3-8 seconds as it continued to head perpendicular to my SE traveling direction. It seems the light strength faded somewhat as it continued until I lost visual sight of it at about the 3 o'clock position to the direction I was traveling. I didnt have time enough to slow down and stop and track the thing. My initial thoughts after I knew it was not a plane, was that it was that fallen satellite I had vaguely heard about. But then, I recalled that it had supposedly landed much earlier in the day in the Egypt area. While I am a young college graduate with an engineering degree, I can not say what it is I saw. From my experiences, it was no type of meteor due to it's relatively slower speed than all the meteors I've seen and it's brightness and direction of travel. It could have been a plane in the process of crash landing, but I have heard nothing of that in the news today. Also, an argument to it being a plane is that it was just a brighter bluish light. It appeared round and not very distant from my location. As I have grown up close to the DFW airport. I have seen thousands of planes come and go, and for the object to have been the same size I saw without seeing wings or the rest of a plane, it would have ! had to b e at extremely high elevation which it was not and was traveling much too fast for a planes at most heights.

I was to excited the first time, and I now belive I know what kind of ship it was. -update- I saw two bright lights moving in an unconventional fashion.  When I first noticed the light it was behind a group of trees that was blocking my view.  I moved my head around to get a better look through the branches. After 20-30 seconds I gave up and continued with my smoke.  A half minute later I looked back at it to see if it had moved enough for me to see it better.  It had moved, to the left of the group of trees.  I was curious what it was because it was brighter than a plane.  As I studied it I noticed that it was actualy two lights close together. They looked to be about the distance apart of 1 centimeter held at arms length.  The two white lights had hints of many more smaller lights or possibly a reflection between the two.  It moved slowly to the left and then stopped dead before moving back to the right(it didn't seem to excelerate, or decelerate. It was just moving or it wasn't, with no in between speed) and continued in that direction until it was out of site about 15-20 seconds later.  The two lights stayed the same distance apart and at the same horizontal orientation to each other which rules out a plane banking. As its direction changed the one in the lead that was the brightest grew darker, and the one that NOW was in the lead, grew brighter.  Its position in the sky was very close vertically to the tree line on the other side of a clear cut that is about 500 meters across from my backyard. The object was in my opinion about 1/2 mile away, but could have been much further as its size was hard to judge.  There was no sound at all(it was a very quiet night) or blinking running lights like you see on all aircraft.  If it was a rescue helicopter from CFB Comox (the largest helicopters in the area) it would have been fairly loud from that distance and it also moved unlike any fixed wing aircraft commercial/private/or military I can think of.  Im located just on the outskirts of Courtenay B.C. to the west of town and I was looking north. Since I reported this I found a video on the net of a sighting from Belgium of a triangle shape ship.

No doubt about it: this was not any form of 'known' craft. Between 8:30 to 8:45 pm CDT, I witnessed the sighting of an otherwise, 'UFO,' which remains a total and complete mystery to me. To wit: Driving northward towards the small Texas town of Joshua (population about 7,200) from my hometown of Cleburne, Texas: the night sky was very clear-without a cloud to be seen. The temperature was a cool 61 degrees F. There was a possible light wind out of the due south, but I did not check this out with the National Weather Department. The stars were yet faintly seen at this point in time and in location. My sight was drawn to the obvious huge light in the low sky (about 35 degrees from the horizon), which was just short of being the size of the full moon-or-if one were to place a U.S. nickel coin in their out-stretched hand (arm's length) for size comparison: the full moon is this size. When I state that my sight was 'drawn' to this object, 'compelled' to look, also comes to mind. It was a soft, white light-not glaring, nor hard to look at-seen in the due north-northwest (330 degrees [NNW] on a compass bearing). My driving speed was within limits at about 55 mph. As I drove on northward on highway 174 towards my friend's house in Joshua, I noticed that this huge light was not getting larger-or smaller-as at first-I thought it to have been a low flying private airplane of some sort (Note: commercial jet airliners would not be found in this part of the sky-as they are always heading north of Cleburne to the west of town-then they bank to the east towards the Dallas/Fort Worth airport, and if they are departing D/FW airport and heading south towards Austin or Houston: they fly to the far east of Cleburne-but in either case: they never fly directly over Cleburne). Just as I realized that this huge light could not have been an airplane-as it was devoid of 'belly lights' and 'wing-tip' lights; the softly glowing light blinked out. As I drove on-now out of the city limits-driving up the bridge (over-pass) that crosses over the railroad tracks (Cleburne is a 'hub' for the railroads) at about 50 feet above the ground-but high enough to see clearly-suddenly, there appeared 'colored' lights all about the object-so many-that it took my breath away. Having been a Veteran of the war in Vietnam-and having also worked my first job back from the war at Delta Airlines: I certainly know the placement of 'ID' lights on airplanes, helicopters and all 'known' earthly aircraft. These lights were nothing at all like standard aircraft lighting. There were just too many of them of too many different colors. I drove on as the mileage grew in approaching this object, which was heading in my direction (its path would have been to the due south) just to my left, or to the west of me. It was huge. I compared it immediately to the Super Dome in New Orleans, or about 400 to 500 feet across (or roughly,166 yards) and about 200 to 300 feet in height, based upon the placement of these mentioned outwardly seen lights. As for these 'lights': there were three (3) small blinking lights on top at 'dead center,' which were, from top to bottom, red, soft yellow and white. All were blinking in an odd pattern of off and on, very swiftly. They were evenly stacked atop of each other. Below these 'center' lights: the area underneath was completely dark to my vision, yet obviously, solid in nature, since the lights were certainly 'fixed.' Outwardly from the 'center' to either 'end': the distance was amazing at several hundred feet. I judged the distance between this object and me to have been about two (2) miles. The lights at either 'end' were solid, softly lit and multi-colored-yet larger in size than the 'center top' lights. Some were blinking-some were not. They were placed in a very odd fashion with no reasoning-as they were staggered in placement. There were about 4 to 5 lights at either 'end' of the object. To the 'bottom side': these lights were the oddest, as otherwise, 'belly lights' of normally 'known' aircraft have a single red blinking light-with white and either red or blue 'wing' lights found latterly. These 'bottom' lights were strung out all along the bottom, making, again; no known pattern or reasoning to their placement. They, too, were multi-colored and were all of the same 'brightness,' which was not so bright as to have been difficult to look at. As I approached it--and it was approaching me; I decided to pull over to the shoulder of the road and to stop, which I did. By now, the huge object was almost even with my car to my left, or, I was looking to the western sky. It was now completely obvious that this object was no more than 1, 000 feet off of the ground-and VERY huge! I turned off the car engine and stuck my head out of the driver's side window-to listen for any noise, which may have been emitting from the object. There were NO SOUNDS whatsoever. The huge object was traveling so slowly, that if it had of been a 'known' aircraft: it would have fallen from the sky. I watched in pure and total amazement, as the object just glided by me-within one (1) mile from my position. I was speechless-within the quiet of my car and on this part of the country highway that I know so well. This was just outside of the city limits where there are only a few farm houses spread out in the area-with patches of remote woods to my left and right sides as well as to the front, or north of where I was. (See 'Drawing' of the object attached). The huge object glided on by not making a sound-not making an effort to turn, climb, ascend nor descend, as I watched it and etched the size and its likely shape within my awe-struck mind. Regrettably, I had no camcorder, nor still picture camera to record this. It continued on its course to the due south-and drifted further away. It was still within my sight as I started the engine of the car-and drove away. I was very calm, having seen, witnessed and videotaped UFOs several times in my past life-proving ALL to have been 'unknown' aircraft--beyond a shadow of a doubt. For more information on me and these former sightings, please see: http://jasonleigh.org for the Reports and documents of proof.

Anyway I would like to re-cap the facts presented by different people so far in regards to these observations: The sighting was collective. About 75 cars stopped on the highway to view the lights and 15 people in different locations who have noticed it independently of each other and called the Cartret police department. According to reports police officers themselves saw the lights as well. Whatever this was, it must have been very close to the ground, as only people at Pert Amboy, Raritan Bay, and Carteret NJ, but not in any other neighboring towns, saw it. The descriptions all point to orange redish radial self contained lights in a V and then Diamond shaped formation. This does not convincingly corespond to any possibility of projected light from the ground or Aurora Borialis as some suggested. It would be very interesting to know whether the coast guard or the Newark airport radars have picked up anything unusual at that time. It is also interesting to find out if any of the people heard anything at all while making this observation (such as a chopper or plane sound) especially considering the concluded low altitude of these lights. could we have a more articulated description of the sighting from anybody who saw it? What was the angle of the opening in the V shape? How far do people asses the lights along the sides where in relation to the end points of the V from each other? What shade of color would you compare it to? Did the intensity or shade of the lights change throughout the observation?

PD)) Flickering Golden Lights in NJ The original story from the Star Lerger.  Police received about 15 calls, 75 cars stopped on NJ Turnpike to watch, even the police themselves saw it.  Newark airport, National Weather Service, and McGuire AFB all report no explanation.  No planes, no unusual weather, no air force. Late-night Carteret light show a mystery 07/16/01 BY DORE CARROLL STAR-LEDGER STAFF A drowsy mother in Carteret saw the flickering golden lights in the sky and ran for her camera. A hard-boiled Navy veteran traveling the New Jersey Turnpike spotted the slow-moving, bright-yellow V-formation and pulled his car to the shoulder to get a better look. Police officers on patrol at 12:40 a.m. yesterday couldn't believe their eyes. Within the hour, Carteret police dispatchers said they heard from at least 15 callers reporting strange orange flares blazing high above the Arthur Kill. The eerie glow had people at backyard barbecues mesmerized, with heads upturned and mouths agape. Almost 75 vehicles pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike to watch the spectacle. But no one seems to know what caused the luminous vision. Police could not identify the source of the lights, and Newark International Airport authorities reported no unusual flight patterns. A meteorologist with the National Weather Service said nothing in the atmosphere would have caused the bright disturbance, and an airman at McGuire Air Force Base said none of their military planes were in the air at that hour. Whatever it was that lit up the sky above Carteret was by all accounts weird. ""It wasn't fireworks, and it couldn't have been a hot-air balloon, not at night near the airfield,"" said Steven Vannoy, who pulled over on the turnpike with his girlfriend on their way home to Perth Amboy. ""What we saw last night qualifies as a UFO. It was an unidentifiable flying object."" A Carteret police sergeant on duty called the State Police and neighboring departments in Linden and Woodbridge to find out what was causing the strange glow, but he said none had received reports of the lights. Bob Wanton, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mount Holly, had no explanation for the lights. ""Weatherwise, there was nothing that would have caused it,"" he said. The aurora borealis, a spectacular show of light high in the northern hemisphere, is seldom visible in New Jersey, said Wanton. The lights normally appear in the winter, he said. ""It's very unusual for the northern lights to come down this far, especially at this time of year,"" he said. On Staten Island, a spokeswoman for the 123rd precinct in the Tottenville section suggested the display might have come from a nightclub on Arthur Kill Road that frequently uses search lights for promotions. The club had been ordered closed by a judge on July 11 and its phone was disconnected yesterday. Airman First Class Andre Steverson said no planes from McGuire Air Force Base were flying at that time. An operations manager at Newark International Airport said there were no reports of unusual activity and said the lights ""could have been almost anything,"" from a group of military helicopters on flight exercises to a blimp. Maybe, said David Stich, who saw the bursts of light from his back yard in Carteret. But those flares didn't look to him like spotlights or anything else he could recognize. ""I never in my life saw anything like it,"" said Stich, a lifelong Carteret resident accustomed to the roar and flight path of aircraft from Newark. He compared the lights to volleyballs, dwarfing the surrounding stars, and said they clearly moved in formation. Around the corner, Pam Russell's husband woke her to see the show. She saw a diamond-shaped pattern in the sky and noticed smaller lights leading the pack and bringing up the rear. ""I ran for my camera,"" said Russell. ""But they disappeared."" Afterward, she said, the skies were dark and silent. ((END ARTICLE))",2001-08-05T00:00:00,40.5817,-74.2315

I contacted another witness who was trying to reach me.  I interviewed the  ((name deleted)) (higher than Monsignor) by phone that saw the object.  He sent me the following e-mail.  I'm driving up to interview him tomorrow and trying to get a copy of tape made by Carteret Lt. of police. From:   ((names and addresses deleted))  Hello: I have to report this since it occurred at approximately 12:45 AM July   15th  2001, over the town of Carteret, New Jersey.  I am an Orthodox Ukrainian priest -- and my son (who is a funeral director was going out on a death call) gets in touch with me via his cell phone at about 12:40 and tells me I need to get dressed quickly and come outside.  He was just getting ready to get on to the New Jersey turnpike when he saw a huge collection of lights numbering about 30 over the town of Carteret, and, specifically over the ""Carteret Shoprite Shopping Center.""  I immediately put on a pair of shorts and slippers and went outside.  By this time, my son was standing in front of the rectory (which is aside of the church) and was pointing to the series of lights moving in an easterly direction towards Staten Island.  The Lights were arrayed in a series of triangular forms, but I only counted 13 or 14 lights.  I say 13 or 14 because I was so taken by them that I didn't want to take my eyes off of  them to count them twice.  The entire group of lights was moving from right to left (east) and totally in unison.  As they were moving, a light would ""drop"" a ""new"" light from it (less intense than itself) and the ""new"" light would fade away.  Immediately after that, the light that just ""dropped"" the new light would also fade out.  This happened about five times as the collection of lights continued to move.  As the entire sequence of lights continued to move behind the buildings to my immediate left, I had to move to our parking lot to see them and as I did, I began to lose sight of the group of lights until there was only one light and then none at all!   This was the strangest phenomenon I have ever seen.  I estimate that the lights were no more than 3-4000 feet above the town.  I am a private pilot, so I have a little idea of height and some sense of distance in the sky.  These lights made absolutely no noise and moved with such precision that they  resembled a huge craft, yet I get the sense that they were individual lights and not one large craft.  They definitely were not a meteor shower as a neighbor of mine neither yelled to me nor were they stars moving.  They were a ""calculated"" series of high intensity lights moving in a specific direction.  At this point, I can only call them UFO's and that they definitely were.  I only wish I knew what they were doing here?  If anyone else saw them or can explain their purpose, I certainly would be interested in hearing about it.  Thank you.  Rt. Rev. ((name and address deleted)) an added note - the sky was totally clears - no wind - stars were visible in the sky as well as approaching aircraft to Newark.  There were no aircraft in the vicinity of the ""lights"" and my son commented that the airplanes which were on approach to Newark airport were lower than usual.  --- Editor's Note: Witnesses claim they do not believe these were parachute flares, blimps or other similar phenonena.

Two lights, one blue and one red either joined or the red followed closely behind the blue and streaked across the sky together EXTREMELY fast.  We stopped and rolled down our windows and there was no sound from the sky at all.  Another light appeared and I thought it might be an airplane investigating the phenomenon but suddenly a meteor-like lazer blue flash came from this object and streaked downwards for a second or two.  Two lights, one turning to return westward, came hurtling towards each other and we thought they were going to collide but when they met, one crossed behind the other and then both of them turned back and jolted across the sky.  All the lights traveled into one direction. . .northeastwardly. This experience was something I had never seen before and words cannot really do justice in describing it with mere words. Previously on two separate undated occasions (about four months apart), in the same area, I was traveling with relatives (the first time this happened) and the car was hit by three separate lazer-blue beams that were probably four to five feet in diameter. When I questioned the V.L.A. supervisor, (because this had happened close to their vacinity), I was told that it had been Game and Fish people spotting deer poachers.  They were definitely not regular spotlights.

I am Currently working as a security guard at a major fruit warehouse.  I am ex-military, I have traveled around the world several times and I have always watched the skies, so I have no problem identifying aircraft, lightning, satellites, stars, and most anything else in our night skies. Last night at approximately 0130 while making my rounds I noticed a light blue flash of light from behind a ridge line 12 miles to the south of me.  I drove up on to the small hill on the west side of the warehouse were I could see better and watched in that direction for a while (This is not the first time I have seen this happen in Wenatchee.  I saw this once before in November 1995, 30 minutes before a diamond shaped UFO flew north up the Columbia River.  This was witnessed by at least two on duty police officers.).  As I watched the surrounding area I turned on the hand held scanner that I have to see if anyone had reported seeing it but nothing was said about it.  After 30 minutes I started making my rounds again and made a note of the temperature reading at the scales, it was 34 degrees (and dropped to 32 by 0400).  At approximately 0245 I was driving on the hill on the west side of the warehouse (and watching the ridge line) when the flash occurred again in the same area but much brighter.  Again I sat and watched and again nothing happened. At 0300 a co-worker arrived and I told here about these flashes (She looked at me like I was crazy) and we both agreed that even though it was cloudy, it was probably to cold for lightning.  She left to check the refrigeration equipment and returned at 0345 to tell me about a door that was opened.  At this point we were sitting in our trucks with the engines off and the windows down and talking.  There was no equipment running and no one else on this side of the building, so it was very quiet out.  As we were talking I was facing east towards the Columbia river, her truck was pulled up to my truck about 2 feet away, when the whole inside of here truck just suddenly flashed into a blue glow.  I turned my head towards the front of her truck and up and saw a Dark blue object, below the cloud base and over the river, that seemed to pulsate as it got brighter and then suddenly flashed and went out.  It lit up the whole area around us for about 4 seconds, and was bright enough to leave spots in my eyes for around 2 hours, but there was no sound.  Nothing else was seen the rest of the night.

My brother and I as well as two friends (back when we were teenagers) ""borrowed"" a neighbors row boat for a near midnite cruise around the lake (Maynard's Lake in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia). It was a beautiful clear summers nite, the water was as smooth as glass and everywhere you looked it was pitch black. You could see silouhetted houses along the shoreline with the streetlights illuminating them from behind. The only lights to be seen were at the far east end of the lake where the plaza was (approxx. 1½ miles). In any event, we decided to head in as we were out for nearly an hour. While heading in maybe 100 feet from the shore, I heard someone say (in what appeared to be a weak and crackly voice) ""what the hell are they"". We turned to the east in the direction of the plaza and maybe 500-600 feet away were two huge Orange glowing spheres, perfectly round, one overlapping the other by probably 15-20%. The very bottom of each sphere just barely touched the water's surface (they were in the middle of the lake)giving the illusion that there were four. In fact, they were two only. (I'm actually getting chills writing this as I remember) Anyway, we were terrified, one guy crying, so we paddled our butts off for shore. Here's the bizzare part, the balls were glowing brite orange but they didn't cast off any light, they seemed to glow from within and the spectrum of light never left the globes. After about a minute of paddling, I looked over and they were still there, not moving and completely silent. Then as quickly as it began, it was over, they were gone, not a trace in the sky, no sound, odor, breeze....nothing. The lake returned to the black mirror state it began in. Not much more to it than that but I'd like to finish with this: The afore mentioned story is the gospel truth. I swear on the life of my children it's true. I've since heard of similar sightings in Mexi! co and S outh America (Orange Glowing Balls) And only wish I had continued to look as they dissappeared. None of us saw them leave as we were too busy getting the hell out of there.

We had just had a different odd experience minutes before we reached my home. as we turned off hiway 30 onto the blacktop road that led to my place the road suddenly was alive literally thousands of glittering jhewl like things, actually covering the road. It was not long before we realized what we were onto. thousands upon thousands of small toads on the road. I was all we could do to keep from crashing as we mashed though them. We had to ride slowly with our legs extended to stay upright. Not to mention the sound and the splattering all over our bikes and ourselves. Nausiating to say the very least. I all my years living there, and all the other odd things I have seen and experienced in that area, I had never ever seen that many toads, & green frogs, at one time on the road like that. There could not have been a square foot of open space anywhere on that whole two mile run! Back to the main story: It was after we hosed off the bikes and ourselves that we went into the house for a nightcap. I had borrowed a clean pair of pants to my friend who was prolonging his trek home , in the hopes the mass of creatures would be dissipated by the time he left. We were seated in my dining area by the east window, which was open as were the rest of the windows in the house on that warm midsummer night. It had started to cool slightly but not to a chill as of yet. I had poured a Crown Royal on the rocks for each of us and had no more than taken the first sip,(This I want to make perfectly clear, we had not even had one drink when this happened!),when all went suddenly completly quiet. Till then all the usual night noises were going on as usual. Cows baying in the distance, frogs and crickets, chirping down in the slew. Night hawks, owls ,neibors dogs barking ect... . It was so sudden and so completely quiet that we locked eyes and and froze for a second or two. When we looked to the window there was a dull red light on the widow sill, and a dull red glow everywhere outside. I leaned over to the window and tryed to look up to see what was causing this but could not see anything. We got up and went to the bay windows to the south, facing the meadow betwen us and the the tree line along the river bank, about a half mile away. There in the sky, almost directly above us was a ring. It looked like a smoke ring actually. A fat smoke ring , bright white with a red fringe on the edges. We grabbed a matched pair of my 22 caliber rifles and headed out the  door  down the steps , across the yard , through the slew and about 75 to 100 yards out into the meadow. The hat had not yet been cut and we were knee to hip deep in grass. The ring was slowly getting larger and thinner directly above our heads. We were trying to figure out what this might possibly be, anthing from a exploded rocket,bomb, metorite,we just did not have a clue. We watched the ring slowly expand for several minutes. The brightness never dimmed as it got bigger and thinner. As it did this we became aware that although we could see the stars on the outside of the rings all round we could not see any in the black center area of the ring. It was a t this point that we were beginning to get a real creepy feeling about the whole thing. The moon was in plain sight to our southwest, at about a 45 deg. angle to the horizon. Half the horizon away from the ring above our heads. This whole time not a sound could be heard and it seemed that our words were falling on dead air as well, as if we could not have heard each other had we been only a few more yards apart. Hard to explain! About the time that the ring covered 1/4 or slightly less of the sky area red spears of light started arcing down from the rings outer edge. When these were mabey 1/4 of the way to the ground then white ones did the same spaced evenly between the red. At first we thought that the beams were very high and following the arc of the horizon but when the first ones came down far enough to the ground we could see that the beams were between us and the home place,(My fathers farm about 3/4 mile north of us.), and on the south side seemed to be within the 1/3 mile of tree line along the north river bank. We were in side what I have can only call a cereal bowl effect. Like beeing in a bird cage. We could see stars between the beams. then a sweet sickening smell was in the air. it was hard to breeth withthis putred sweet smell. First a pricking static like electricity in the air, then nothing. We both began regaining our senses some time later several tens of yards apart. wet laying in the wet grass,( sitting up actually.) disorientated, at least 2hrs had passed since we first walked outside. All was gone but a hint of the sickening sweet smell. We made our way back into the house and sat back down on at the table. The ice in our glasses had long melted. The clock read 2:20-somthing. After about an hour my friend left for home. The next morning on the way to work was the first I heard the radio talk of all the sightings for 500 miles around us in each direction. There were so many different versions, and experts versions all I could do was shake my head. My friend and I worked together, and discussed this only with a shrt list of friends after that. NOTE: I want absolutly no publicity over this!!! I am relaying this to you hoping mabey that you may have some other info relating to this for me, or some other similar event somwhere else. This is the only reason for any contact I will accept. The only contact with me is though my e-mail, thank you. p.s. I and my father had a sighting when I was about 10 yrs old at the farm. Since I have had three others, each different, one was simply spotting a oval shped object passing from a cloud though open blue sky and into or behind another cloud, only this this was reflecting the color of the sky behind it. It did not change from the white color to match the blue sky right away and that is how I caught sight of it. this was about two years ago heading east on hiway 33 west of Crete ne. The other was summer 2000,. I had taken my 12 year old daughter out with me to star gaze on the hill behind the lake community where we live. I have beendoing this periodically for years, yet had never seen anything. This was the first time I had let her stay up this late to go with me. We had been there for about 15-20 minutes, and she was already whining about going back when we saw two objects comming our direction from the northwest. There is a gravel road about 1/3 mile west of us. You can here the gravel crunching under a cars tires from where we were. The objects each had a bank of 5 lights in front of them. One was following the other just behind and to the west. They crossed the road west of us and the lights lit up the road like search lights. I thought they were helicopters untill they got that close and made no sound at all. All we could see was the lights because they were so bright. They passed us less than 1/4 mile away to the north and dipped down out of sight in the valley northof us. A few minutes later they popped up several miles north headed west this tim and then dipped down out of sight again. Even looking with binoculars at them as they were headed away we could not make out any shape of a craft. Just after they dipped out of sight the first time a car passed on the gravel road with the radio blairing and we could hear that well. This happened about 5 miles north of Crete ne. at about 10:30 pm on a wednsday night. That is all I have to report. Pardon any tyo's I am doing this fast as I am @ work.",2002-01-29T00:00:00,41.51069365079365,-97.34733968253967

It is in front of us in the sky. It is as close to us that u can actually see the textures and graphical features on this object. I would have to say that comparing the size of this object to the sun, it was smaller because of its actual distance though. My mother then stops the car, but at that very moment the object goes flying in the opposite direction and we lose contact. About a minute later, driving down the same road we tend to spot the same object again. This time the object appears from the right. It makes a semi-circle in counter-clockwise motion. It starts to hover over some trees. When at that moment, it enters the forests and flies between the trees. This is when we lose contact. I'm not sure what this was.

My friend and I had stopped for a moment and I walked behind a tree to relieve myself.  As I started to walk back I noticed 3 bright lights which I thought were flares.  These lights were about 15-20 degrees off of the horizon in the SouthWest portion of the sky over the area of Wetmore Colorado (25-30 miles Southwest).   When the lights disappeared I walked back to my bicycle and asked observer #2 is she had seen the lights?  She saw them too because they reappeared about then.  We looked to see if they might be landing lights of a plane disappearing and reapperaing behind the clouds,  but there were no clouds.  We saw the blinking light of a plane in the same general area but saw no association between it and these lights.  The sky was  star filled. We got a reference to the mountain range that sits below and they were definitely above the mountains.  We wondered if they might be distress flares from someone in the mountains, but the lights never moved downward like flares do.  They just stayed in the same spot, disappearing and reappearing.  Each appearance lasted  20-40  seconds for about 4 times.    There were always 3 lights.  They were always in the same position but  their positioning was not symetrical.  They each had about the same intensity of light and were of the same size (about 1/4"" in diameter on the scale we were viewing).  One was  slightly higher than the others and slightly to the West.  The other two were closer together with the lower one slightly East of the center one.  They disappeared after about 4 or 5 minutes.  We do not know what these lights were.

This is not a UFO sighting, but something I feel is related and very interesting.  After watching a program about a man with something in his body, they extracted it and did not know what it was, I immediately recognized the object and even now, I am getting tingly just writing about it. I was about 10 years old and sitting on the toilet.  I guess I was rubbing my calfs with my hands as I felt something.  I looked closer to find there was something imbedded in my right side of my leg below the knee.  I tried to get a hold of it with my fingers, but it was too smooth and pointy to get a grip.  My mother had a pair of tweezers close by.  I finished what I was doing and propped my leg up on the bath tub.  I pinched it with the tweezers and began to pull.  I was shocked to see this thing in my leg being so long and pointy, yet I felt no pain.  After I pulled it out, there was no blood, but only a hole.  I looked at it closely and I can remember it being very similar to a thin yet long and pointy piece of rice.  It had a gold/brown colour to it, and was very hard.  I didn't think much of it at the time as I was only 10.  the best is yet to come. Frequently,over a couple of years, I marvelled at the hole.  I looked at it, felt it, and didn't go away.  Another couple of years, I forgot about it, then once again, I was sitting on the toilet and remembered it again.  I looked at it and saw another object in the very same hole.  I got up and looked for some tweasers.  After finally finding some, I pulled it out again.  It was identical to the one I pulled out the first time. Again, I was stupid and did not think to save the piece. It has been about 20 years since I pulled the last one out, and still think of it.  I still look at it, but it hasn't returned.  The only thing I have left, is a grown in hole, that you still can see.  I joke about it to the people I tell and even show them the hole.  I tell them the people planting this ""bug"" on me, finally got sick and tired of me removing it and sending them to the sewage plant. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The lights moved in a west to east direction and maintained a steady speed.  Elevation was difficult to assess, however, I estimate it at approximately 1500-2000 ft.   The pattern of seven (7) lights formed a ""V"" similar to a flock of geese.  The lights were very dim (similar to a 25 watt bulb at about 100 ft.).  There was no visible body to the object as it moved eastward at an increasing rate of speed.  There was no audible jet, propeller or rocket sound.  The night sky was totally clear and the path of the object did not intersect or come close to the flight path of either nearby major airports (within a 60 mile diameter).  The size of the craft would be at least that of a B-52 if not slightly larger, however, the rate of acceleration and our geographic location made me question that assumption immediately.

My girlfriend and I, after visiting friends on South Camano Island, were getting in our car to leave when we noticed a very bright starlike multi-colored light ""twinkling"" and flashing about 30 degrees above the southern horizon (the hill of Whidbey Island).  I assumed it was a normal aerial craft (plane, helicopter) - but it seemed too bright and the lights weren't flashing in a regular rhythm.  I grabbed my 8mm video camera (analog) and recorded 90 seconds before it disapeared completely. Optical zooming revealed that indeed this was not Venus, another planet nor a star. The pattern and colors of the flashing lights were also not like any aircraft.  Several times before - and also once while filming - it faded out completely (not from a cloud), only to instantly reappear.  I digitally zoomed (24x) and then one could really see the strange pattern of lights ebbing and flowing throughout the disc of light now resolved by the lens.  I yelled for my friend to go tell the people in the house to come out to see this, but it disappeared again, and after a long wait, never returned. I think this is definitely a UFO.  I know many people have captured video footage of strange lights.  However, what makes this footage unusual (as far as I know), is that - when we played it back -  THERE IS A SOUND THAT SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIGHT!  We did not hear anything when filming or observing it, and it seemed to be too far away (several miles?) to hear any sound, unless it was creating a loud sound like a normal aircraft. The sound is loud enough to easily hear after the light reappears; but after you have heard it and know what to listen for, you can hear it during the first part of the tape also.  It is not camera noise from the zoom or focus motors, and there was nothing in our environment that I can imagine could have caused it.  It repeats in a regular rhythm 6 or 8 times.  It is very similar to the sound you hear submarines make with sonar in the movies. I am going to digitize the tape and have the video - and especially the audio - digitally enhanced.  I'm sure the audio signature can be compared with - for instance - a sonar sound to see if it matches it, or any other known source.",2000-12-02T00:00:00,,

My family and I attended an outdoor concert on this night (The Moody Blues), and while laying on our backs looking at the sky waiting for the show to start, we spotted a tiny pinpoint of light almost directly overhead.  Our location was about 10 miles SE of downtown Nashville, TN, at the Starwood Amphitheatre.  The time was 19:45.  Because of the angle of the sun and the height of the ""speck"", my first guess was that we were seeing a low-orbit satellite.  It was tracking WNW at an altitude of at least 100,000 feet. We had two sets of binoculars with us, so I watched it with 10x50's while my wife watched it with 8x35's.  It resembled a lollipop, of all things, with the round sphere brightly reflecting the sunlight and the ""stick"" end clearly rotating around its axis once every 4-5 seconds.  This was all pretty cool -- I had never been able to see one so clearly before. And then a strange thing happened: it appeared to ""explode"".  Right before our eyes, we watched this object, still tracking to the West, split up into several pieces.  The largest chunk emitted something like a cluster of BB's, in other words, where there was one object before, now there were two or more smaller objects and an array of tiny pieces, each reflecting the sunlight perfectly, fanning out toward the South.  The fan of BB's and the main object(s) continued tracking together, but gradually increased the distance between themselves.   A third piece moved rapidly away from the main group, at a faster velocity than the BB's, toward the SE. My first thoughts were that we had just witnessed some space junk disintegrating on re-entry, but the speed didn't seem excessive, and the movement of the third piece didn't seem to jive with the general motion of the main body.  The total elapsed time of viewing this thing before it was obscured by clouds was about 5 minutes.  In that time, it traversed maybe 10 degrees of overhead sky.",2001-04-28T00:00:00,,

The light did not move and I could not imagion what it could be. After watching it for two to three minutes it suddenly decreased in intensity to about one tenth of its origional brilliance and remained at that level as I watched it for another several minutes. At this point I was getting very cold and went back in to bed (to sleepin bag). The next year, late in the Spring, I walked to the ridge which has a large clearing in front of it from logging.

PD)) Black cylinders over French Quarter I was browsing through your site to see if anyone from New Orleans has reported seeing black cylinder objects crossing the sky over the city.  I read a report of a someone who saw something similar to what I have witnessed three different times in the French Quarter and the Central Business District of New Orleans.  The report I read said in 2/01, the witness only saw one black object slowly moving across the sky.  Every time I have seen these objects there were two in formation, casually crossing the sky, all three times I witnessed them at dusk.  They move very slowly in a direct path from NW to SE across the city.  The most dramatic sighting occured the first time...I was on my balcony, in the late afternoon, on St. Philip St. with my friend, when I noticed the objects moving across the sky.  At first I thought they might be birds flying from Lake Salvador to Pontchartrain, as there is always an increased amount of birds in the sky at nightfall.  I soon realized they weren't birds and I told my friend to check them out.  He got a little freaked out by them but we watched them slowly move across the sky.  About the time they  had reached the Eastern part of the city, and I estimate they were over or near Lake Ponchartrain, an incoming airliner apparantly swerved at the last minute to miss them, the sound of the jet's engines increasing as the plane veered to it's right and up to avoid the objects which just kept on their course.  We were pretty amazed at the whole thing. I have seen the objects twice since then, both times at sunset and both times they were flying on the same course over the city.  We have a lot of Military  bases near us in Mississippi and Florida, and we often get F-15s and even those warthog planes flying over.  I suspect it may be aircraft from a base because of the routine in flight pattern and time of day.  But whatever they are, they aren't using jet propulsion and they aren't prop-driven.  They are just black cyliners moving slowly  across the sky and are un-affected by the motion of the wind.",2001-04-28T00:00:00,29.96590338078292,-90.0784456405694

Missing time event followed. Family awoke at home the next day unsure how they arrived only recalling seeing UFO. Returning home on Christmas night from an out-of-town trip to Oklahoma, a family of four decided to make a restroom stop at a I-44 rest area just outside of Mt. Vernon, MO at about 11:00 pm CST.  While returning to their car they began to notice a buzzing noise.  The son told his father to look up at an object just above the trees.  The father, mother and sister also looked up.  They observed a dark chevron craft hovering nearby. The next thing they recall is waking up in their home the next morning. They didn't know how they got home, parked the car in the garage, unpacked luggage and presents, put presents under their Christmas tree, or got dressed for bed.  The father said his eyes were very sensitive to light when he awakened, but no other unusual bodily effects were noted by any family member.  They were perplexed how they arrived back home which was only less than a half hour drive from the rest area. An investigator from OARG checked out the rest area the following day and did not detect any evidence of trees damaged, parking lot debris, or ground vegetative effects.  HE also checked the family car for any signs of unusual marks or debris.  None was found. The mother is concerned as well as the father and daughter about the incident, but the son said its ""cool"".  The mother is considering regressive hypnosis but a recent dream on Jan. 7, 2000 may have changed this opinion.  The mother had a dream which she was out on the back deck of their house with all of her family.  They were looking up the same craft they saw at the rest area like they were in a daze.  She screamed to wake herself up from sleeping. The Ozarks Area UFO Research Group (OARG) in Springfield, MO is continuing its investigation.

About 10pm we saw a white light in the distant sky to the northeast and the object was moving from the north to the south or southwest.  It was very distant, you could tell it was very high and it was moving much faster than a plane.  Everyone was talking about it and I suggested that it might be a satellite as I heard they move faster than planes.  About that time we saw another one - this one seemed to be coming from east to west and then another from south to north and so on. They seem to be appearing one at a time from the black night sky - almost as if they were stars that had been stationary and then just started moving.  We would watch them until they travelled out of our sight.  We thought that was an awful lot of satellites. One in particular, as it travelled from north to south and then westward out of our line of vision, seemed to flare very brightly for a second and then go back to normal. Also there was one that changed direction and at one point seemed almost to fishtail, or swirl.

It was Friday morning, and I was on the Jefferson Park train platform waiting for my 7:14 train to downtown Chicago. What first drew my attention to the sky was this orange smoke in the northeast...and then moving on into a trail as what a jet speeding across the sky would leave. To the east I saw a little gray oval-shaped disk moving in the sky. It seemed to be coming from the south toward the north. As I followed it - it turned back around and started going south again. I thought of the possibility of it being a UFO but was skeptical of such a thing. I looked farther into the south and saw 2 or 3 more coming...again, gray oval-shaped disks. I looked back at the first one I had seen and followed it with my eyes. A orangish light on the side of the UFO blinked 2 times and then stopped. In the northeast, a plane was going in the southwest direction. The UFO looked as though it would collide with the plane once they got close enough to do so. When it looked as if they were about to collide, the UFO ended up just passing underneath the plane. In the south, the other 2-3 UFOs were getting nearer. One thing to point out is they were not close together at all. They were all spread out individually in the sky. The train then arrived, and I boarded. The reason I chose to report this is because I read in the newspaper about light sightings over Rockford Thursday night. My sighting occured Friday morning and may have some connection to the Rockford sightings. NUFORC Note:  We suspect the alleged incident occurred in 2001, not in 2000, as indicated.

((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the witness describes here the star, Betelgeuse.  It is very bright in the southeastern sky, and it ""twinkles"" vividly.  PD)) On the night of Jan.,15,2001 I was driving to a friends house when I first noticed the object in the sky. Since I was almost to his home I didn't give it much thought although I did think that it looked out of place or strange since it seemed brighter than any of the stars around it or even other aircraft lights that I could identify. I spent about 45min. at his home and then left. on the way out his driveway I saw that the object was still in the sky but seemed to have move to the south of it's original position where I had seen it earlier. this peaked my interest enough to stop my vehicle and watch it from a stationary position. I thought to myself that a aircraft would have been long gone by now unless it was a rotorcraft that was hovering. After watching this object for mayby two to three minutes I was convinced that it was not behaving in a  familiar way. It would move periodicaly in a direction (up,down,left,right) and than stop. The movement was rapid and the distance traveled was not great, but it was difficult to tell just how far it was moving. After it would move I could see a small cloud of something appear where it had been then this cloud would disappear in just a moment,it looked like a small patch of fog. With the naked eye the object looked like a ball of light very bright in intensity and periodicaly I would notice red and green colors also. I returned to my friends house hoping that he might have a pair of binoculars that I could use to help identify this object. My friend had both a pair of binoculars (10X) and a spotting scope (20X to 60X). Both myself and my friend along with his wife and daughter went back outside to observe this object with the above mentioned items. Once in a position where we cold see the object it was clear to my friend and his wife that this object was nothing that they have ever seen before. We all agreed that we could not positively identify it with the naked eye. The binoculars were too unstable to get a good solid look at the object. My friend drove his truck up to where we were to use as a rest for the spotting scope. When the scope was on target it was even stranger looking at 60X magnification. To me the object looked like a single cell organism as seen with high power microscope. The color was easier to see with the spotting scope, it appeared to be changing slightly in intensity between white,green,red,and yellow but none of the colors ever completely went away. even with the help of optical magnification none of us could identify this object. My friend and I continued to watch this object and at about 8:50pm it faded than disappeared behind some hills.    During the time that the object was observed it traveled in what I would say was a southwest direction. I have been a professional firefighter for 15 years.

I called a friend that lives a few miles away, and he witnessed the same thing. A second person that was in the house with me witnessed the same thing. These objects were located in the sky at about a 45-degree angle from view (elevation) and South Southwest to the left and slightly below Orion's Belt (I think). There was a triangular constellation of similar objects to the left and slightly below the initial object that were moving around also, but they were dimmer. The objects resembled stars, but seemed to change from bright white to red and blue. They were also flickering between colors. It seemed as though the object left a small trail at times, and sometimes it looked like two stars connected by a thin beam of light before they merged into a single light source.

It would move in one steady direction, then, as if it were tired of doing that, it would take a quick 90 degree turn in another direction. Then one of my friends noticed another object, then another. There were now a total of 3 moving ""stars"". They roamed around a bit going one direction then another. They would also be moving east, then immediately go 180 degrees towards the west.

I was looking an UFO Report on tv today and I remembered me of a dream that was somewhat realistic that I sould tell you. Sorry for my bad english language, but the dream might be interesting to some of you. Some years ago, I had a somewhat realistic dream. I do not tell you my name or other things, because i just want to report. I looked out of my window in the night. The night was clear, I could see the stars. It was silence. I could see a group of space-ships flying to the earth, they were slow, not fast. And there was no light or something, they all where brown/grey. It was a gigantic formation with houndrets of ships  coming directly out of the sky to the earth. It was looking as they would directly fly to my window, it was gigantic. I could hear nothing, it was completely silent everywhere. No engines, nothing. And they were moving very slow. The formation was as long as i could see, approx one or two ships in a group, then the next formation. Like a small street, but very long, as long as you could see. I remember that the front side of the ships where with red lights and yellow within the light. But only the front site, i could not see a ship from behind. I could not move myself or do anything, i was looking and i can´t move myself. It was unbelievable. Then, i am not sure, because it was long time ago when I had this dream, I think that they startet to shoot, but then i waked up. I am not sure if they really where shooting, i can not remember this. But i can remember the formation in the dream as if i dreamed this dream yesterday, but it must be 10 years ago. A dream is a dream, but this was unbeleavable realistic. I felt the same feeling as wheere a comet some years ago flew in the near of the earth where you could see something if the comet in the sky. exatcly on the same position of my house i had the dream of the direction of the space ships. Again sorry for my bad english.. however.. in the dream the location of the space shipts was the same as i could see the comet flying in the near of the earth some time ago, i forgot the name of the comet but we all could see it. It was the same location! So i think that the ships will come from this direction, too if the dream will come true. This dream *is* true. There was no strange light except the red light, and it was somewhat silent... and gigantic, as if your days are counted. I am living in germany near cologne. Thats all. Someone unknown",,,

She claimed I must have gotten hit with a nail or something.  I was 8, 9, or 10 years old because it was the summer my grandmothers brother died. It was on 8th street across from the golf course.  I went back to see if I would remember the house in the late sixties early seventies and the house had not been changed.  I did not ask to go in back or to see if the garden area to see if the ground was still dead. A short time after my expierence my uncle told me about Mr. Arnold and his UFO sighting.  My uncle was a pilot and owner of a single engine piper cub.  He took me flying once and I was thrilled. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",,37.66861323741007,-120.99442244604317
More on dreams in Seattle,Trail,BC,,,recurring,"Occurred : 6/15/1960   (Entered as : 06/15/60) Reported: 3/26/2001 22:00 Posted: 4/1/2001 Location: Trail (Canada), BC Shape:  Duration:recurring",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16984.html,"More on dreams in Seattle I realize that you prefer to post verifiable events, and I won't mind a bit if you don't post this in your database. But the report of the dream from that fellow in Seattle 03/15/01 made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. When I was a child growing up in Trail, BC, I used to have the same recurring dream as that described by your Seattle correspondent. As I got older, the dream would recur less often. Oddly, I had the dream again, after an interval of many years, only a few months ago. In my dream, the early morning clear daytime sky is filled with these objects flying over at relatively low altitude, leaving trails that are not contrails, as I stand in our backyard watching (we lived at this location in Trail from the time I was about two years old, 1958, to 1964). Some of the objects are dark green, but many are shining, golden coloured. I don't recall seeing markings on the objects, however. I don't remember when these dreams started, but I do recall that at first I had them almost every night, sometimes more than once in a night (I usually woke up immediately after the dream, and the recollection of the dream is vivid in my mind for days afterward), then less frequently. By the time I started university in 1974, I was having them once or twice a month. By the 1980s, I seldom had the dream. As I got older, I attributed the dream to a child's interpretation of events related to the Cuban missile crisis, although I don't recall if they started at the time of this event or not. I never thought that anyone else would dream of exactly these same objects. I don't really expect (or want) to see this in the database, but I wonder if the person who contacted you from Seattle might want to know that others have had the same dream, from the perspective of where they were living.

It was flashing not twinlking, one single white light then we could see three vertical lights, two white and the one in the center was red, the lights were in a row vertically.  It appeared to drop very quickly from what I assume to be a very high altitude and moved from side to side, almost insect like in it's movements. This is what raised the hairs on our necks, it was not swamp gas, a harrier jet or military planes, it's movements were like nothing I've ever seen. Ever. It continued to come down all the while flashing it's red light every so often. Finally it got to be too low in the tree line to see. Then after watching it for so long I noticed movement in the sky to the northwest, my husband and I identified this second object same as the first, it was moving in sequence with another light and another.  We made out three triangular formations in the sky comming from the north and going west. Each point of the triangle was a seperate moving and flashing entity.  Then it started to change into a circular pattern and the second light began the same descent pattern as the first.  This one appeared to be larger than the first, there was a quick white flash from it that went towards the other lights, we could tell they were headed away from us (west).  Eventually they became to small to watch and were gone.  There was no sound. Just as an after thought, at one point while watching the first light it became three lights and moved as if it went upside and back, more than once.

After dropping a friend off at home, I was traveling down Lake Louisa Rd towards Lake Shore Dr in Cermont,FL. I had not been drinking that night nor had I been under the influence of any drugs. I am not one who has ever given thought to mysterious objects or paranormal occurences (in fact, I usually dismiss such claims as insanity or stories told by people looking for attention). As I was traveling down the road, I noticed a bright light on the left side of my car down by the lake, which is kind of downhill from the road. The light was so bright that it was almost like a truck's high beams or a spotlight shining directly in my line of sight. I didn't give much thought to the object as it was just above water level and was just sitting down in the valley. When I started to pass from its view, the light started to approach up the hill and made a slow move across the road above my car. It was now directly over my car, just in front of my hood, I would say at this point it was about 15/20 feet in the air. The light was so bright that I could see nothing but the light. I coudn't see anything in front of me. At this point my '99 Ford Mustang completely died on me! The battery and all. I couldn't get the engine to turn or anything. Dead. I was sitting right below this thing and it was dead silent. I had the window about a 1/4 of the way down and I could hear nothing. It was probably the eariest silence I can ever remember. The light sat there for about 30 seconds or so and finally started moving to my right until it was directly in view of the right side of my car. It took some time for my eyes to adjust and stop seeing spots. But all I remember is having that same bright light to my right and seeing it rise out of view and dart off. It was almost as though it shot off like a slingshot had propelled it at a 45 degree angle. Just like that it was gone. I continued to try and start my car, and, after sitting there for about another minute, it started. It took all I had to catch my breath and try to tell myself ! that I w as okay and to bloc it out as though nothing had happened. I immediately called my parents, and then my girlfriend, and told them each of what had just occurred. They could all tell how anxious and scared I really was. I am 26 years old and I am a collee graduate. I believe in rational explanations to events like these. I cannot think of any, which has me scared. My car is working perfectly and have never had any problems with it. The battery is fully charged. It couldn't have been a helicopter because the light was at a low level and there was dead silence. With the window down I would have for sure heard the helicopter. I am a religious person, yet skeptical of such modern day claims of supernatural events. I really am at a loss for what to make of this.",2002-02-22T00:00:00,28.51724827586207,-81.78506551724136

We picked up some smokes and headed back to my aunts who lived in the core area. When we looked into the air the light was still there. It appeared to come closer and more clear. We coould see a honeycomb under the disc, and it hummed and hissed as it floated in the air. It floated there for a few minutes and gradually all the neighbors were out on the streets looking up at it. Oooo. Ahhh. What is that? A UFO, it's a UFO. Anyway it hovered for a few minutes and suddenly it flashed a very bright pinkish light from there honeycombs underneath., It shot rings of light from unterneath, one after another, you know like the way the transporter looks in Star Gate. Very quickly and in the blink of an eye it flashed and zoomed up into the evening sky. I always wondered what the heck could build such a craft and I would imagine how it would be to fly one. A memory I will never ever forget, thats for sure... I never had the opportunity to share this with anyone on such a large scale as the net, but that was not the first time I saw one. There was a time even earlier when I was a young lad back at home in a village in central manitoba. A brisk winter night. My brother, his girl friend and myself looking up at the sky saw an amazing light show. This experience too, is etched into my mind. About seven lights flew in formation across the sky from the north east. Suddenly they all shot off in different directions. I believe that it was in  seven different directions and then they all came back together at amazing speed and bounced off each other, as it appeared, and went in all directions again. They did this about four times before flying off for good. Well anyway, thats what I saw and I know that I am not crazy.. If I had a paper I could even draw it for you, I believe!!! There have been numkerous sightings in our region throughout the years and some of these UFOs even come only meters above the houses. I wonder what they want?

I was ten years old at the time of this event.  My father was a Cub Scout den leader and my father, a friend, and me were travelling in the same car in route to a Cub Scout function.  There was another car following us with another Cub Scout and his step father.  We were travelling through the country towards Melvin, Il about eight miles away.  It was dark at this time and a winter snow storm had just hit.  As we were driving we noticed two bright lights at our two o'clock position (NE).  I remember my father commenting, ""It must be two helicopters looking for stranded cars.""  At the time my friend and I became excited about two helicopters flying low over the empty fields.  As we watched them we noticed they were on a direct path for us.  Being the young child I was at the time, I rolled down the window to hear the whoomp, whoomp, whoomp, of the approaching helicopters.  Only there was one problem, there was nothing, except the cold winter wind blowing across the empty fields.  As the lights came closer we noticed that the two lights came from the same craft.  Each light was positioned at the end of the craft.  The craft was the normal saucer shape, composed of three layers.  The middle being the longest, the bottom being the second longest, and the top being the shortest.  Keep in mind though that the top was metallic and extremley long (not a glass bubble).  The craft at this time was about 800-600 ft high and about 40 yards in front of us moving at about 20-30 mph.  My father stopped the car as well as the car behind us.  We rolled down the rest of the windows and watched as it floated over our heads.  It was so low that I am still able to remember the sight of portholes or tiny lights on the side of the craft.  Thinking back I am reminded of portholes, but not entirely certain.  The craft slowed as it floated over our car and came to rest in a field about 200 yards from us.  It maintained its altitude (600 ft or so) and just hovered silently.  I do remember looking up as it floated over the top of! us and seeing the bottom layer was donut like, hollow in the center.  The bottom part had a glowing effect to it, anti-gravity???  Anyways by this time my father was standing outside the car looking at this object along with my friends step-father.  By this time both me and my friend were in tears (same car) begging my Dad to leave.  Finally my father got into the car and took off.  The next thing I remember is being about a mile away and looking back at this object.  It had now tilted up at a perfect 45 degree angle and before I could get my father's attention it dissapeared.  Both my friend and I (occupied the same car) realize what we saw that night, and do not deny it.  My other friend has moved away now and I haven't talked to him in several years.  But with hard work I could find him to verify my story.  His step-father has passed away now.  My father still to this day thinks of that moment as one of the greatest in his life.  I believe if it wasn't for us children, he would have walked out to it.  I know it may seem hard for someone to remember these incidents, what with so much time that has passed.  I still to this day remember those events like yesterday.  It was truely one of the most magnificent things I have ever seen.  I am now a college senior preparing to graduate from a Christian University in Chicago. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date may be approximate.

I think I witnessed the same sighting as reported on this website by someone else.  I will never forget what happened, but as I was the only witness in my vehicle, I tried to dismiss it, but I can't, I marked down the date and time, so that if anything ever came out in the future, I would know I wasn't nuts. After watching a UFO show on TV, I decided it was time to do research and see if anyone else reported what I had seen. I know what time it was because I looked at my watch, so I would always know what time it happened. I had 3 sightings or encounters in that month, and nothing ever again. This was the first. I was driving  SE on highway 270 between the former Morse RD and 670 exits, on my way home from my mother's house, there were several other cars out at the time, as I was driving, something caught my eye up to my right at about 1 o clock.  It was a round cluster of lights, red blue green and white, from what  could see, I couldn't make out an object clearly just a cluster of lights in a circular pattern, what caught my eye was the movement pattern.  It was hovering in a spot and it would dart to one driection then another, like center, then  down right, then down left then back up to the hover point.  I have never seen any man made machine capable of such quick and precisely executed movements.  It looked like a pinball, being shot back and forth, though it hoved a bit at each ending point. I pulled over immediately to make sure I was seeing what i thought.  I sat there in awe, watching it dart back and forth so fast and in a way that defied normal flight, no helicopter etc could have moved that way, and it covered large distances in a so called flash. I looked at my watch to verify the time. I was terrified.  i saw 2 other vehicles pull over during that time, i assume they had seen what i saw, but i was scared so i pulled back on the freeway and drove on home.  I finally got the nerve to look online and see if anyone else saw this. A the next night , i was spending the night at my mothers in this same area, when something equally odd happened. I was in my little sisters room and we couldn't sleep, so we were talking.  suddenly the room started to shake as if vibrated by some huge motor and the room started to glow red-orange, brighter and brighter, like the light was coming through the window.  We heard a loud whirring metallic sound, like screeching metal that sounded like it had a pattern, almost like music. we were terriified, and it lasted for several minutes, the light kept changing, like it was in a search pattern, but the noise level remianed the same. my sister and i sat staring at one another, afraid to say anything, finally when the light went down a little i jumped up and looked out the window, i had to know what it was, i knew if i didn't look, someone could try to discount me. But after what i saw the night before, i had to know.  The glow was coming form directly over our house and also from the woods behind it, there was more than one source, i think the metallic ""music"" must have come from the one overhead, explaining why the volume never changed, but the light did. I am convined it wasn't a police helicopter or anytthing, i have seen them before. I have never seen one with orange light.  I never saw any craft of any sort, just the glow from above and the woods, obviously i couldn't see what was over the roof, i thought about popping the screen and sticking my head out her window but I was too scared.  It wasn't anyhting like the night before's sighting.  But my mom lives in the same area where i had seen the lights the night before.  i honestly believe the ""glow"" the following night came from government craft, possibly tracking or searching for the object from the night before in the woods behind her house. Strange radio frequency's can be picked up sometimes late at night out there, that have the same sound as i had heard that night, though never on the same channel twice in a row. And no it isn't static.  My sis and i heard somehting one night that sounded like German and spanish mixed together, being spoken too rapidly for anyone to understand, no music. I really don't know what else to say. I have no pics or anything, don't even know if this is usefull. I don't live there anymore, nor have i ever related this story before, but it feels good to get it out of my system. My sister saw and heard the same thing I did. I have never seen or heard anyhting else. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD))",2001-12-05T00:00:00,45.65808015267176,-122.58490839694656

I have been thinking about it more, and wanted to add that the lights seemed to change positions, like they were morphing or somthing, not going off and another going on, just like it was reconfiguring. and at any given time it seemed circular because of the way the lights would spin, but there were three, giving the impression that it was a triangle, the lights were in a triangle shape, but seemd to be on a circular object because of their movement. This is hard to explain. BUt there were three points of light rotating in a circular pattern as the object moved, with white light in the center. Also, i forgot to check the box that said approximate date.  I know it was somewhere in the last 2 weeks of february, but not certain of the exact date, though i know the exact time.

It was a clear night. A handful of lights moving across the sky caught the corner of my vision. Over toward the house behind a street light (in view) I seen 5 lights that were the size of stars along with the same brightness. I nudged my friend and just pointed. We started walking back towards the house when the lights were becoming a lot more identifiable. The 5 lights were in a half circle and sitting on the belly side of a huge triangle shaped ufo.  Both of us experienced a tone or ringing in our ears, other than that there was absolutely no sound.  When the vessel came into full view it couldn't have been no more than 300 to 400 feet off the ground and this thing was creeping. It couldn't have been going faster than 5 or 10 miles per hour. I knew it was strange because this thing was as long as my neighbor's yard and our's put together.  Anything human would have fell out the sky or been loud.  As it was passing we both noticed that the ship had blue wave like sparks coming out the back.  The sparks drifted for about 10 feet or so from the craft and just disappeared. When our view was starting to be compromised by trees we climbed the roof of the house and watched as it went over the 4 lane highway and skimmed across the trees until it was gone.  After this incident, although not my first I've experienced the same ringing in my ears, my sinus's which hardly ever bothered me are bothering me all the time, and even hives.  I've noticed throughout my life that I have seen more ufo's up close than I can shake a stick at. Some more experiences that I've had....  an orange glowing ball that blinks in and out of existence which I've seen on 3 occasions, and an egg shaped one that appeared once when I was a child that was hovering directly above me 1000's of feet and actually split the clouds as it left.

I was out in my back yard looking for satellites and shooting stars with a night vision device.  I had seen several satellites before I noticed the most remarkable shape emerging from behind my roofline.  Looking toward the east, I saw a perfect V-shape at approximately 50 degrees up from ground level and moving in what I would guess to be a south-southwest to north-northeast direction.  The V was laying on its right side.  It looked like a flying ""less than"" symbol.  Only two edges were visible.  From what I could tell, there was no third line to connect the two arms.  There were no lights on it.  It moved very smoothly in only one direction.  It had to be very large.  There was no noise whatsoever.  I tried to see if the area between the two arms would block out light as it passed between my position and a star.  It looked as though the starlight was blocked out until both arms passed the star.  Only the two edges were distinctly visible, but they were very straight, very symmetrical and came to a very sharp point.  I'm not sure that I would have seen it without the night vision device.  I couldn't say how far away it was, but my feeling was that it was many miles away and quite high.  The sight of it was actually stunning.  I truly could not place this object anywhere within my frame of reference.  I've never seen anything remotely like it.

We were camping in the open country, clear sky,hot, no clouds. We were sitting looking up at the sky watching for anything that might move accross the sky. My back was to the plough/big dipper and in an area of darkness, (to the naked eye) we both saw a bright flash of light, followed some 10 seconds later by another flash in what seemed to be the same place. The light was like a pinprick in size, but the light was white and intensly bright. The area where the light was was in the s.e approx mid way between the horizon and directly overhead. Shortly after this from the west we watched an object move e.n.e. moving spasmodically. It was lit to intensity of dull star two objects one from the north and one for the south moved towards it and seemed to dissapeer, as did the orriginal object. They were very high, and we were not able to discern any lights on or shape of the orriginal object, which I had been watching through field glasses. Later, possibly 10 minutes after this a large round object moved e to w.s.w steadily accross the sky. I watched it with field glasses untill I could no longer see it. It was a dull yellow, seemed to glow, not shine. I could see no other lights and it was very high, yet it was clearly bigger than any satalite I have seen. THE FOLLOWING NIGHT 17th July 2001. 20.40 hrs. Mazarron, Spain.  warm night, clear sky. 3 objects move accross the sky with about 8 to 10 minute intervals. They followed the same flight path, travelling roughly s to n. Viewed through the field glasses they seemed illuminated, by the sun perhaps, but with the naked eye they appeared only slightly lighter than the sky. At 23.02 I spotted another of these objects on the same pathway. I was using the field glasses. It was almost overhead when it just dissapeered. I could not see it at all after this. Some 3 to 4 mins. later a bright light the size of a pinhead flashed for a few seconds in the area where the object had dissapeered. Then: some 15 to 20 secs later a similar flash seen an inch or so from the last flash on the forward line of projection. Some 15 secs later a further flash seen 12 inches e. of the last then two more in the area between the previous flashes. Some 30 secs later a final flash in the line of flight of the three previous objects The plough/big dipper was at my back at all times. NIGHT OF 18th July. 22.00hrs. warm some cloud. Sky not really dark, only Venus and a few of the brightest stars visable. I looked up and saw a bright star. I realised that there was no bright star at that point, looked again and saw it move s. to n. on a line approx to that of the  previous night. It reached a point over my head and dissapeered. I scanned the sky for some time but saw nothing. At 22.30ish. I saw a bright flicker to the s.e. Then an object moving n.w. to s. steadily. No lights visable through field glasses. I am sorry that I am not good at giving better direction/sky positions, but I have little knowledge in this direction. However I do know that these bright flashes of light were not natural, and they were so very very bright, even though they were no bigger than a pin head to the naked eye.

Lately, in the evenings I am aware of a very loud plane noise that lasts an inordinately long time. The sound is so deep and rumbling that it does not sound like conventional aircraft. The first time I went outside to try and see where it was coming from,I stared up at the sky for almost 15 minutes - but saw nothing. This evening I was leaving my friend's house in Placentia around 9:45 pm. I heard that same noise. As I reached the parking lot, I stared up at the sky and observed two white lights. The lights struck me as being MUCH too far aprt to be the lights on a conventional airliner. It was impossible for me to tell how high this thing was. I didn't see anything in between the two lights. The craft was cruising in a westward direction. When it got about 2 -3 miles away it abruptly switched directions and went south, then it switched again and came back east in my direction. I may have lost sight of it behind some trees, but when I saw it again, it was now two flashing red lights which seemed to continuously change their position in relation to one another. And the lights were not like the type you'd see on a plane, they had kind of a jittery, laser like quality. The two lights became 4 or 5, and were forming various triangular shapes with one another. The way they moved was erratic, not at all in a linear fashion. They seemed to join back together to create one light and headed off in a northeasterly direction. My friend remarked that he had never seen any plane move that fast. I feel that I was lucky to have seen a craft at all, because as I mentioned usually when you hear that loud rumbling noise, you do not see anything that could be creating it. As a matter of fact, my friend's husband was leaving for work one morning recently and heard that same noise, and despite standing there for 10 minutes and staring at the sky,he saw nothing.

The lights were in a definite formation, and at first it appeared they were part of an aircraft.  However, we could see there was no substance between the lights, although they were all travelling in a very slow, but perfect formation.  They were a normal orangy colour.  What really caught my attention was the light that was adjacent to the formation, either blue or green, that was moving about totally randomly.  The lights were not a reflection, they had substance.  I alerted my family who also watched them as we passed them and they then appeared to change course behind our vehicle and cross the motorway.  We lost sight then as we travelled on.  There was no audible sound.  Although the car windows were closed, if this had been a helicopter or larger, there would have been considerable noise as we were so close.  Again, I reiterate there was no substance or form between the lights.  Because it was dark at the time, we could not observe the reactions of other road users.  It was very strange, and we were in a sort of denial of what we had seen.  We racked our brains for a logical explanation but could not come up with anything.  I do not know if there were any reports of this sighting made by other people on the road that night.  Exmoor National Park lies in the direction that the UFO would have probably travelled from.

Me and my brother were sitting on the dock at our bay house fishing. My brothers attention was drawn away bywhat he believed to be a shooting star.He pointed at it but i was unable to locate it due to partial cloud cover, and its dimmness. He lost sight of it in the clouds, but regained sightof it comming out from the other side of the cloud. At that point he noted that the object made a course change of about 20 degrees and continuedout of sight over the horizon. The object followed an almost perfect north to south course untill the change which was slightly more to the east.I was unable to see this object as it was moving so fast it was gone in less than 10 seconds. There was no 'tail' on the object, nor was theremore than one single point of light. its dimmness was equivilent to that of a satellite reflecting the sun in the evening and reflecting the suns light.After he settled down, and finished explaining his idea about it being a UFO, we went back to fishing, both of us now watching the sky.  Less than5 minutes later, the object reappeared, again from the north. this time I was the one who spotted it first and pointed it out to my brother. He confirmedthat it was the same object he viewed previously. With both of us watching, the object started a series of right angle turns that seemed to defy the laws of physics.It made about 6 or 7 course changes overhead and continued towards the south like origionally, and disappeared behind our bay house. It AGAIN reappeared out fromthe side of the bay house low on the horizon to the south over the gulf of mexico. at this point it was moving horizonally and was moving extremely fast the entire way.By extremely fast I mean like a shooting star moves fast. We both watched it move horizontally about 30-40 degrees across the horizon, then it turned again, in a very sharpzero curve turn to a northerly direction. It proceeded across the sky making one final course change of about 10-20 degrees comming to an almost perfect north direction andproceeded out of sight into the clouds along the north horizon.I need to note here that it is uncanny how familiar it is to the looks of a satellite in orbit. We both had the perception that the object was VERY far away. With the exceptionof a few low clouds, it was VERY dark and MANY stars were visible. I think city lights (like from Houston 60 miles away) would easily have drowned out the light.its my personal view that the object was not in our atmosphere.Also, i emphasize that every single turn it made had no 'curves' in them. If you drew a right angle, thats the path it was following.I would have been more skepticle of what we saw, but increadibly, there was a report the following monday (we saw it on the first saturday morning following memorial day)in the Houston Chronicle (June 2nd i believe) reporting that there were 16 reported sightings of a UFO from Galveston Island.

I liked going down there to gaze at the stars on clear warm nights in the Summer.  I was looking up at the Summer constellations toward the Eastern horizon over Lake Michigan.  The sky was absolutley clear, and hardly any humidity and no clouds that night.  I was staring at a section of sky just about 20 degrees downward from Polaris toward the Eastern horizon.....maybe where Casseopia's located.....when all of the sudden......DIRECTLY whithin my line of vision......this object appeared into my view...and quietly sailed across a section of the dark sky about 30 degrees in distance from my vantage point....how many miles in distance...I don't really know.....how high up in the air.....good question, since I really couldn't make out the size of the object.  This this appeared, then dis-appeared as fast as it was into view!  It made no sound....TOTALLY silent.  It was no meteorite, or shooting star.  I know what those look like in all of their many visits and forms.  This thing was definitely something from an ""intelligent"" source.  It was like it appeared in our three-dimensional realm then exited it just as fast. It was not in my peripheral vision, but I was lucky enough to view it directly, as fast as it happened.  I do not do drugs, nor have I ever. i don not consume alcohol, nor was I under the influence of any prescription medication.  I was as stone cold sober as a judge that evening. There were NO stores or restaurants having any ""Grand Openings"" in the surrounding area beaming huge floodlights into the sky, or anything like that.  Nor were there any clouds for light to relfect off of.....no aircraft of any sort in the area either.  It ABSOLUTELY defied any logic that I know of.  No ""aurora borealis"" phenomena scheduled that far south that time.  It was bizarre.  It was amber to orange colored....solid, yet defined and fuzzy edges ou! tlining the form/s. It was three oblong shaped forms, like three hot dogs right next to each other....or ONE object separated by two black lines, I don't know....they all travelled together, in unison with each other in the short time it appeared, then disappeared.  After I saw it....I was dumbfounded for a few moments....Like, ""What in the HELL was that??""  Then I got into my car, and drove home and told my mother she, was like. ""Huh?"".........then I just wrote the whole thing off after awhile....but it will always stay with my, because it NEVER seemed like one of those situations when you  ""see"" something out of the corner of your eye, but you're not really sure a few moments afterward if you really even SEEN something, but perhaps just some figment of the imagination, or some typical fleeting natural neurological phenomena....like seeing quick flashes out of the corner of your eye, when you move your head too quickly.  It NEVER seemed like anything like that.  It was TOO direct and straight within my line of vision, and it lasted AT LEAST two seconds long.  I don't know....you tell me.  There were no other people or cars anywhere near me either.  Now it's just a weird memory in the back of my mind.  I also have no history of neurological disorders, either.  Just thought I'd clear any doubts up.  Anyway.........that's my story. I'm 37 yrs. old now (Jan. 2002)........it was the first and last time I ever seen anything like that in my whole entire life.  I've told some freinds of mine a few years afterward, but they all looked at me like I was a crackpot.  So I tell no one anymore.  We all see what we want, or would like to see in life, but lewt me tell you......I was NEVER looking for something like that, EVER.

Noticed a darkening in the daylight like a cloud was crossing the bright sun. Looked up at the sky and to the east, over the buildings and open space came a very huge dark shape, moving about 25 to 30 miles per hour.  It was wider than a football field. There was not a sound, in fact I could still here a bird out in the open space in front of me just as it started to come into my line of sight.  The triangle was a little higher than tree-top level.  As it passed over my position, it appeared that the larger mass of it was actually over the open space in front of me. I looked steadily at it as it went over my position and thought that it was made of some type of metal of platic with the appearance of very dark gray to black and had the distinct texture of not being painted.  It was not shiny, i.e. the sun did not reflect or light up to top of it which I noted. I got the strong impression thatit was not painted and there were no markings on the bottom of the craft or along the training edge.  There were no apparant appetures  for engines along the back end of it. As it proceeded to the west, I noticed that it seemed to be very thin at the trailing edge of the craft.  I had the impression that it was a little thicker in the middle, like towards the pointy edge. As it continued to the west, and as it was passing direcly over me, I felt like there was some type of disturbance in the air.  I could feel it on the skin of my arms, almost like an electrical/magnetic charge was in the air.  It continued moving slowly and silently over the crest of the hill and disappeared. I waited a long time before I finally told my husband and said that since this had occurred on the day of the Dayton Air Force Show that I had probably seen a stealth fighter from Wright Pat.  Some months later I saw a picture of the Stealth and that WAS NOT WHAT I HAD SEEN. ! Besides , since then I understand that the Stealth does make noise and also can't fly at such a slow speed.  I know what I saw and felt.  There is no doubt in my mind. I cannot ever forget the impression of the skin of that craft - the color and whether it was metal or plastic, but metal seems closer to what I saw. It appeared to be crossing directly over the area where a building was to be built and passed along and over the hill directly in back of a hospital. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We came home and I called some TV stations and they wouldn't even think about listening to what we had to say about what we had encountered! I was in this stereo store while my son was outside talking to some of the people that worked there. (My son was about 19 or 20 yrs of age at this time.) He had called me out to look at what was in the sky to the East, sure enough they were flying saucers!  All of us were amazed!!. Other people from the shops there saw us outside looking up in the sky so they came out also and looked above and saw the samething. Wish I had a camera! These flying saucers where flying in and out of the clouds, staying for like a few seconds and fly out like they were taking turns. They must have been doing this for maybe a good 5 or 10 mins. They were silver and not quite cigar shape, but pretty close to it, but with a dome ontop. That day was a clear day, blue, but white clouds scattered. We don't get many clear days like that here, so it must have been either after it rained, (cause that's the way our days will look after it's rained) or a day after we've had our Santa Ana winds kick up.

It doesn't say what time of day of that sighting that we all saw, but it does give a date which was Jan. 15, 1997. The city I thought we were in was not Paramount, it was Pico Rivera which is next-door  to that city. I was having my stereo installed in my car that day, my son bought the stereo for me for Christmas. Also, it was before 5 PM cause I remember calling the TV stations after I got home and it was almost dark.   From Pico Rivera it takes me about 30 - 45 mins to come home depending on  traffic and there were no other stops I remember I made coming home and this was not in the morning and this happened before dark, but after 12 PM.   I did submit to your site on this experience prior to receiving your email and not looking for this receipt, however one correction: It was not in Paramount as I wrote on this form. I will write your tel# down if I ever happen to view a sighting again. Thank You for that!  Thanks for emailing me.

Around 7pm, in Calistoga, California, our attention was drawn to a blinking light in the vicinity of the North Star. My brother-in-law was familiar with similar sightings and drew our attention to it. It was blinking at a steady rate (not like a natural star), and not moving. After a moment, it began to move slowly through the sky. Unlike a satellite, or aircraft, this light was moving erratically through the sky: left, right, up and down - very abrupt movements. The movements were at times slow, others fast with no apparent pattern. It would come to a complete stop for as long as 5 minutes. It would begin as a single blinking light (white), and then would appear as two lights, regardless of the direction it was moving, and then back to a single light. When it would move quickly, the lights appeared orange-red in color, when stationary, white. At times, the lights would be synchronized, others alternating. Viewing through binoculars, I was unable to determine the shape (I would try to focus on brighter stars behind it to determine if they were two separate craft, or one when the two lights appeared. It did appear to be a deeper black in between the two lights, but it was too difficult to hold the binoculars still enough to determine for sure). However, when the lights were brightest and blinking, it appeared that it might possibly be triangular in shape from the way the light would reflect out. The size of the lights would change giving the appearance that the craft was moving farther into space and then descending again. There was absolutely no sound in the quiet countryside to lead us to believe that this was a commercial jet, or aircraft of some kind. It was a very clear, very cold evening and the stars were very visible in contrast to this light. We also saw two distinct satellites cross the path above the lights. My 10 year old wondered if perhaps the satellites may have taken a picture from above??",2002-01-11T00:00:00,38.6253,-122.6159

At 00:20 I looked outside and was surprised to see a clear & star filled sky, as generally the planes keep spraying something which creates perpetually cloudy sky over Chicago. I got out my Russian panoramic viewer, the best night vision available in my opinion, and started scanning the sky. No air planes could be seen or heard, which is unusual because I live under the landing path to ORD. I looked to the West at about 45 degrees above the horizon and almost missed a solid black chevron slowly moving silently across the midnight sky. Absolutely no light was emitted from the craft which was itself darker than the sky behind it. As this wide, chevron shaped wing passed in front of the star studded sky - the stars did not fade behind the wing but appeared to keep shining through an invisible structure. I assume the ship was able to bend the light around it adding to its stealth. The event lasted about 3 minutes and this object moved slowly due south - aprox. over Wheaton, possibly even farther west. No idea how far away or how high it actually was but it did not reflect the laser light that I directed at it. This ship was HUGE (my guess is one mile across) and I feel it is part of a larger geometric structure whereby 6 craft would create an immense, six sided ring with another - solid craft in the center. The wing was the same width from one end the other and each end was straight - like a straight cut on a piece of lumber with two 90 deg. Corners. (I could fax a drawing) This craft had a pointed leading edge and the chevron had about a 120 angle with the wings sweeping toward the rear. No curves could be seen, only sharply defined edges. There were no vapor trails. I could not determine the thickness of this craft, but by its darkness and how I almost missed it with my high power nightvision - nobody would ""EVER"" see it using binoculars.

I was driving at or about the speed limit of 60 m.p.h. and observed the object for a total of possibly 15 seconds.  The color wasn't a shiny metallic, but seemed to be shades of white and grey.  The shape of the object was that of a 'Y'.  There was a fuselage and a wing coming off each (back?) side in the slanted position.  I saw no propellors, rotors, or 'engine' type parts.

It came out into the clear and it looked like a saucer, just like I see in the movies sort of and it was glowing orange, but it was clear enough to make out and see little ovals that might've been windows. It was a saucer bottom and a little hump in the middle (the way people say they usually look). There was only one and I was the only one that saw this I'm pretty sure. Suddenly as t continued going it did a spiral manuver (flying in a spiral) and disappeared from my sight behind the building (I don't mean it landed).

The incident took place in mid-day under clear skies. While in my backyard, I saw a commercial aircraft going overhead apparently only moments after take off from the local airport. I glanced up at the plane and noticed, in the blue sky at a much higher altitude, a star like object. Had the plane not passed over, I probably would never have noticed the object. It looked like a star of average brightness, but this was 1 in the afternoon, and the only object of its kind visible. The object moved very slowly from east to west, perhaps slightly southwest. At one point, the object abruptly changed its course and moved south for about one minute. Then it once again resumed its westerly course. As I said, the object moved at what appeared to be a very low speed and was at high altitude. While watching, I observed two high flying commercial jets flying over Memphis, apparently bypassing the city enroute to other destinations. These planes were leaving contrails, but appeared to be at a lower altitude than the object. They were also moving at a considerably higher speed than the object. At one point the object came to a dead stop in the sky. It appeared to hover over what appeared to be the center of the city for at least ten minutes. It was absolutely stationary. It then resumed its westerly course. There were no erratic manuevers or sudden changes in speed other other than the 10 minute period of hovering and the brief change of direction to the south I mentioned. The object moved in straight lines. I ruled out a balloon figuring winds at such an altitude would have driven the object across the sky at a much faster rate, and balloons tend not to hover and remain stationary for ten minutes at a time. The entire sighting lasted aproximately 30 minutes and the object could not have covered more than 45-50 degrees of arc in the sky during this time. It did not appear to emit light of its own. It reflected sunlight and the intensity of the reflection varied as it moved across the sky. I am not a trained observer, but if this object was indeed as high as I thought, flying higher than airliners bypassing Memphis, it must have been  a rather large craft based on the intensity of the reflection. I followed its course with the naked eye until I lost sight of it as it moved into the path of the sun.",2001-11-20T00:00:00,35.12547266265719,-89.92692482230727

They moved completely silent and without seeming effort. We were on the beach watching as they moved southbound about 1/2 mile inland from the ocean. They were less than 1/2 mile high and it was in broad daylight.  They were darkish brown in color, disk shaped with a dome on top and 3 small domes on the bottomand lighted portholes.They were definitely directed, piloted, made no sound whatever, omitted no lights whatever, just flew silently with very fast velocity, perhaps 400 mph, or perhaps slower. They flew towards San Diego Airport.  I called the Airport and Mirimar Naval Station, and informed them both, also the police as well.  They were definitely not birds, nor balloons, nor airplanes  nor temperature inversions, nor light beams. They were real and we had them in sight for about 6 seconds. After this incident my wife and I found a book in the library called ""Flying Saucers and Outer Space"" written in 1955. On one page was a drawing of a Flying saucer.  As soon as my wife and I saw the drawing we said immediately to one another ""that is just what we saw"".  The sightings were made near my residence at  ((address deleted)), La Jolla.

It was a Saturday night; I and my best friend/classmate had begged off attending a slide show in the cafeteria, and were in our respective dorm rooms, studying.  Around 9:00, my friend was banging on my door and babbling in hysterics.  I let her in, and heard what I thought was an April fools joke about seeing a flying saucer.  I finally agreed to go to her room (which faced the back lawns and woods between the school and Chicopee) and look out the window.  There was nothing there but the woods and dark.  I was in the middle of saying ""there's no such thing as flying saucers"", when a very large red glowing (like glowing plasma) ""cloud"" appeared over the trees at the edge of the woods.  Now I was hysterically laughing and babbling and pointing at this thing, while it descended slowly into the woods.  Once it had ""settled"", we couldn't see it anymore.  But that was only the beginning - a few moments later, we saw white saucer-like objects flying at very high speeds and at unbelievable angles.  They seemed to be able to go from about 1/2 mile to 3 miles away in an instant!  At one time during this incident, we counted as many as 11 objects in the air at once.  Their movement seemed to be centered very close to, or right over Chicopee, although it was hard to tell because of the tremendous distances they covered so quickly.  We never saw any of the objects again, although there were rumors in our dormitory that several girls had seen strange things in the sky.  It was very hush-hush; nobody wanted to be labelled a ""kook"".  Understandably, my friend asked me never to discuss the incident.  It does take a bit of courage to report something this bizarre.

I am a graduate civil engineer and I was employed as an upper level engineer by an international engineering-construction company who had transferred me from the Trans Alaska Pipeline to this nuclear power project in New Jersey. I was on the interstate bridge that crossed the Mississippi River driving east near sunset on Saturday, February 14, 1976, in Memphis, Tennessee.  This was the first time I had seen the Mississippi River.  As I was taking in the sights, I noticed a large ""structure"" in the distance that was slowly revolving and had slowly pulsing lights, much like a communication tower but it was too broad, it was rotating and it had multi-colored pulsing lights.  That caught my eye.  I was looking east at the ""structure"" away from the sunset so it was hard to see the mass of the ""structure"". The portion of the ""structure"" I could see was about a thousand feet above the ground.  The ""structure""  (defined by a dim outline and the pulsing lights) made a precise vertical rise of an estimated 200-300 hundred feet and then a precise vertical descent of about the same distance.  At this point I was straining to see what supported this ""structure"" that was making this precise movement.  I could not see any mass or structural support under the portion defined by the dim outline of the ""objec's"" mass and the pulsing lights.  I realized then this was not a ""structure"" but it was an ""object"" and there was nothing supporting it.  It then began an exact horizontal movement to the west for a few hundred feet and then an exact horizontal movement to the east. I decided to get off the interstate and get directly underneath the ""object"" to get a better look at it and to confirm to myself there was no structural support from the ground.  As I was exiting the interstate, the ""object"" began an exact horizontal move to the west.  The""objec"" moved slowly at first, then accelerated at an astonishing rate of speed toward the west until it disappeared from sight. The sun was still visible in the west.  The speed of its departure was so quick that I was still on the exit ramp while watching it disappear in the distance.  I heard no sound from its departure nor did I see any evidence of propulsion devices. I later performed a calculation to estimate the average speed at which the ""object"" departed.  I estimate that the time it took to travel from a standstill until it disappeared from sight in the west was at least 2 seconds but not more than 4 seconds.  The visibility was at least 100 miles and probably more.  That means the AVERAGE speed the ""object"" traveled in this distance was at least 90,000 mph and possibly 180,000 mph.  If the visibility was 200 miles, these speeds would be doubled to 180,000 mph minimum and possibly 360,000 mph. Description of ""object""  The mass of the ""object""; was difficult to see when I was viewing it in the east and it departed so quickly that I only viewed the mass for a few seconds.  However, this is what I saw.  The ""object""; was disc shaped.  I estimate its girth at 300-400 feet.  The thickness at the middle of the disc was around 100 feet.  I believe the ""object""; to be circular at its girth as it was slowly rotating without any change in its outline.  It had multi-colored slowly pulsing lights (yellow, green, and red) on its girth and elsewhere on the mass. I continued traveling on the interstate for a few more hours and spent the night a couple of hundred miles east of Memphis, Tennessee.  I could not obtain a copy of any of the Memphis newspapers to find out if the sighting was reported and published. I have not been back to Memphis since then, but I always hoped to be able to return there some day and research the archive newspapers to read about the sighting. With the advent of the Internet, I performed a search for UFO sightings on the 2/14/76 date to see if someone else had witnessed and recorded the sighting.  The only information I found was about a UFO Crash near Cubatao River, Brazil 2/14/76 recorded by ((a well-known UFO investigator)).  At the rate of speed I observed the ""object"" to be capable of traveling, it could very easily have traveled from Memphis to Brazil in a few minutes.  I tried to find out more information about the crash in Brazil but to date I have been unsuccessful. I certainly would appreciate a response from anyone who (or knows of anyone who) experienced the Memphis, Tennessee UFO, or who knows about the Brazil UFO crash. I hope to hear from someone.",2001-04-01T00:00:00,35.12547266265719,-89.92692482230727

It appeared to be floating very slowly down.  This coil was a golden colored and oulsed coils from a 'cats eye color' to a brighjt bright gold.

The weird thing was that it wasn't moving and it definately had a strange light pattern. My husband brought out his telescope and managed to get it in the sights. There was a bright white light and seemingly colored lights (red, blue, green) appeared to swirl around the white light. The craft was completely stationary from what we could tell.  It did eventually move further west very very gradually. An airplane of some sort (seemed like a commercial airliner) did fly from east to west directly over the craft.  The reason my interest was piqued at all was that a friend told me she saw a ufo the night before in the Duvall sky so I was keeping an eye out for anything unusual.  My husband, who's very skeptical, even seemed to think that the craft was something highly unusual. Not your normal airplane definately.

I would bet money that what I saw was actually a meteorites but it seemed very low and it streaked across the sky at a horizontal attitude. My first thought is that if was a UFO, it was over the hood canal or Jefferson County, not more than 10 miles away. It looked just like a star. If it really was 10 miles away, then I would estimate its speed at several thousand miles per hour. It was below the tree line, and visible for not more than one second due to the trees. There was an optical/visual streak effect, because it was going so fast. It was different looking than the average shooting star effect -It was not leaving a dust trail in its wake. I know that sometimes meteorites are much much farther away than they look, which could explain why this one was visible to me going across the sky on a horizontal path. It was going South to North. I'm only reporting this because I'm hoping somebody on Whidbey Island or Vancouver BC saw the same thing come their way and maybe saw more than one seconds' worth of it.

It was a totally clear night, maybe one or two extremely small bits of cirrostratus cloud, hardly bigger than your finger on an extented arm. There was a small amount of scattered light from the urban areas to the south, but not too much. There was no moon, and the air was pleasant, about 70 degrees. I, and the others, happened to be looking over the mountains to the SE (Mt. Gleason) and there we saw what appeared to be a comet, low on the horizon. I was watching it for about 5-10 seconds, and I said to Anthony, ""Is that the comet you're gonna look at when you set your scope up?"" He was looking, too, and he said, ""There's no comet supposed to be there this early in the year,"" Well, as we look at it, it gets MUCH brighter, and suddenly seems to surge toward us, passing either into or behind a small cirrostratus wisp of cloud, which lit-up interactively. It continued in a NW direction, very quick, accelerating much faster and glowing much brighter than any plane or chopper. It now appeared to be much lower and closer, maybe 20,000-40,000 feet altitude, somewhere over the San Gabriel Valley. It was approxamately 40 degrees above the horizon.

Another sudden stop. Another abrupt course shift, back toward us, heading NW. No regular aircraft could withstand the G-force required of such instantaneous manuevers. It then shot hard to the west for another 2 seconds, stopped instantly, glowed incredibly bright, and shot straight up, fading to nothing in about 1.5 seconds. I remember saying, ""It's clearly exhibiting some non-ballistic movements."" It was quite evident this was a strange craft. It glowed like a bright star, with a hint of changing color around the edges. It really didn't have a shape, per se, but for a star, it did appear... thick, or fat.

The movement was much greater than the shimmering effect on stars caused by atmospheric conditions. as we watched it we could discern colors. We got binoculars and through them we could definitely see rotating or pulsating red and blue lights on the object. After a few mintes the air traffic in our sector became really heavy.

I was at my home on a hilltop about 18 miles SE of Spokane, WA. At about 8:20 PM PDT I observed a bright light to the NW over Spokane.  This is not too unusual as this is the general direction of the local airport and military air base.  I am accustomed to seeing landing lights, and have observed them appear to hang in the air when the plane is taking off and traveling towards my location.  Usually however, I can detect the motion of the plane after several minutes.  What drew my attention to this light, was the fact that about 10 minutes after initially seeing it, it was still in the same location.  I then thought it must be a helicopter, and grabbed my 7X35 binoculars. What I saw through my binoculars was three white lights in a line, with red and blue lights on top.  The brightness would increase to quite bright, and then fade to dim, and back to bright etc. about every 2 to 3 minutes.  The light then began moving slowly toward the NE.  I then saw another light approaching from the SW.  I thought it must be an airplane coming to check out the original light.  But when the second light got to within what I estimate to be about 3 miles from the first light, it too then stopped and began to get brighter and dimmer, just like the first.  I called 911 and reported what I was seeing, and was told no one else had reported anything. Now what is still giving me goose bumps is that while I was on the phone with 911, I was still observing the lights in my binoculars.  All of a sudden the second light began ""dancing"" - it left the impression of what one sees on the 4th of July when you move a sparkler around rapidly at night.  What is most unusual is that the original light stayed stationary, so I know it just wasn't me getting jittery with the binoculars. This dancing lasted only about 20 seconds. The second ""dancing"" light then dimmed out and I didn't see it again. The original light then continued moving slowly to the NE, but as it got NNE of my location, the white lights went out, and the ""object"" began moving rapidly to the SSW, and it appeared to be climbing.  I would estimate its speed as that of a fast military jet.  I observed what appeared to be the normal red and green navigation lights on the outside edges, but there were two larger, brighter red lights which glowed steadily on top.  I was outside at this point, but I heard no noise, which is probably not so unusual, because the object was probably 20-30 miles from me at this time.  Its hard to estimate.  At about this time, I again saw what appeared to be an object much like the original, over Spokane, again in the general direction of the civilian and military airports.  This object again flucuated in intensity, but after about 5 minutes it dimmed out.  Again, what bothers me about this is the wildly dancing of the one light, while the other stayed stationary.",2002-02-22T00:00:00,47.68357629392971,-117.38633105431309

We got out of the car and while waiting to see if the light would move all of a sudden a second but smaller light appeared above and to the right of the first light.  As we waited to see what would happen next the first light suddenly disappeared.  Then all of a sudden the light reappeared and then the second light disappeared.  I called my mother out and she brought with her a pair of binoculars.  When looking through the binoculars you could observe the lights pulsating.  The light would take turns suddenly appearing and disappearing. The lights would also change shapes. The continuded for about 40-45 minutes.  When all of a sudden one by one seven lights appeared.  Each light was even distanced except for the space between the 4 and 5 light.  After all seven lights appeared in a perfectly straight horizontal line, to the above and left 4 more lights appeared.

They moved steadily, not zigzagging or stopping and starting.  They were travelling northwest, coming from the southeast.  They each took 4-6 minutes to cross the sky from horizon to horizon.  There were first a pair, moving at the same rate, far enough apart to be distinctly two separate objects.  Before they disappeared over the horizon, a solitary object moved in the same direction.  This solitary one was seen to flash.  About 5 minutes after that one disappeared over the horizon, 4 more came from the same starting point, moving in a line at first.  About 1/4 of the way across the sky, the front one diverged a bit, but they still travelled together.  At about this point, the rear one began to flash white for 30 seconds or so, then went back to amber.  Along the way across, perhaps one or two others did a similar flash behavior.  No sound was heard to come from them.  The objects were very bright and large; moreso than planets, stars or any airplanes.  I am a 26 year old college student in LAS.

I stopped the car to watch.  They were all about the same size, and seemed to be very small objects, very high up in the sky - all orange colored like the embers of a fire.  One of them quickly flashed white very brightly, and then quite shortly after 'fizzled out' (there was no sound), and could then not be seen.

After that I didn't quite know what I had seen, so I continued on my way home.  I stopped to get some gas and had just left the gas station at 11:43 when I saw another set of the same objects exactly as I had seen a few minutes before.  I pulled over again to watch, and this time saw another 5 or 6 of these objects, and one flashed violently and then fizzled out again like the other, and as I watched one very carefully I could actually see little pieces flake off and flash brightly and then disappear.  I watch this group of objects as I did the previous group, until they passed north and I could no longer see them. I do believe the UFOs I observed were pieces of some object which entered the atmostphere and began to disintegrate, breaking into pieces.  I do not know, however, what that object was.

I write it as a story of the events that happen. I have no answers to why me? You all can call me I cannot run from this any more. Visitors on A Cold Night Sometime last year I received a visit from two strangers. As the year passed, I have not heard from these strange visitors. One day out of nowhere they came in the earlier morning to see me. This day was very cold. They came from a far away place that was not known to us. One day during the week it was very cold. The wind was blowing very hard so my home was cold. The heaters did not do their job very well. As the night fell our trailer was getting colder. My family and I had blankets over them to stay warm. We all sat next to the heater as the wind and cold came through the trailer, so the evening was very cold. Bedtime came and I put my boys, B((deleted)) and J((deleted)) to bed. Even, though their room was cold their heater did the job, as it was suppose to. B and J fell asleep. My husband ((deleted)) and I went back to the living room to sit down and have some cocoa to warm our cold bodies. Then we went back to watching TV for the rest of the night. As time went by we became aware it was 10:00 p.m., the news came on. Even though it was very cold in our trailer, we still enjoyed each other's company. After the news I decided to get up and go to bed. It took a few minutes to get settled down for a good night sleep. I do remember laying my head down on my pillow for a few minutes. I do not remember anything until 1:30 a.m. in the early morning. I do recall waking up for a glass of water and going to use the restroom. Then I returned to bed and fell back to sleep. Suddenly, I heard this sound that woke me up out of a sound sleep. This sound was so far away as it traveled in a downward, vertical descent from the sky. This sound was nothing like a plane engine. The noise had been getting louder and louder as I had been lying in bed shaking from the fear of what was going to happen to me. I could not even move out of my bed to get my family up so they could hear what I was hearing. This shaking and terror that my body was feeling is something no matter what I say will never allow a person to understand what it felt like to be so afraid that your body can not even move to get help. The time was 2:00 a.m. in the morning when I first heard this noise. I tried everything to move; no matter how hard I tried I began to shake worse from the terror that I was hearing coming down toward me. My fear had been so strong that I could not protect my family and I tried to hide like a scared cat running away from what I could not see. Suddenly, I turned and looked at my clock, which said 2:30 a.m. The visitors were in my room holding on to my shoulders one on each side. I do not even remember how I became very warm and standing straight up; I was moving, but my legs were not. It felt like I was leaving a house front door and going into a doorway with a bright white light. Both of these little people had long arms and big black eyes. They were shorter then me. Their heads were bigger then their body and came to my shoulder. I felt as though I was not in my trailer at all. I do not have a door where my bedroom windows are.  Even though I felt at peace with whatever happened to me, I still do not understand it all. I do not remember anything after I went to the light. When I was returned to my room on my bed, I was shaking from fear again from the sound as this noise was now leaving straight up into the sky. I turned my head to the clock and it said 4:30 a.m. After the noise left, I calmed down; it took me a little while to stop shaking. I finally got up to go through the doorway to get my husband. Suddenly, there were smells in my room that I could not tell where they came from. They were very strong in odor. Then in just a few minutes the smell was gone. I still to this day do not know what happened. I was awake. I am one who will always find a way to protect my family, but this time I could not protect anyone, not even myself.

There was  one small white light on each corner, that would flash simultaneously every 3/4 of a second. I was only able to see the lights; no outline of the craft.

He was strongly impressed by the sighting and talked about “nothing else” that night with witness 2, his wife. However, he was not traumatized. He has not spoken about the sighting except for a few people close to him until the interview with the investigator.  No previous or subsequent UFO sightings. Witness was in good health with good eyesight. The witness did not have any particular interest in UFOs and had not read any books on the subject before his sighting. Witness 2.  Female, age early-middle 30s, wife of Witness 1. Works in local area. Witness is apparently in good physical condition. Eyesight, hearing are good. Witness was excited about the sighting (even 6 months later) but did not describe any symptoms of trauma. No previous or subsequent UFO sightings. The witness did not have any particular interest in UFOs and had not read any books on the subject before her sighting. She has done some reading after the sighting.  Sighting Account. The witnesses were driving east on Rt. 96 near the intersection with highway 5 in a rural area 1-2 miles north of  Stillwater, MN ( ~22 miles east of St. Paul.)  The landscape is gently rolling comprised of  crop fields and wooded areas. It was nearly dark, but some light remained in the sky, which was clear.  Witness 1,  Object description.. Sitting on the passenger side of the car the witnesses were traveling in, witness 1 noticed a lighted, triangular object to his right. The object appeared to be about 250 ft on a side. The witness reported the triangle was equalateral, though his (inexact) drawing shows it as isosceles. It was not possible to discern a texture to the surface of the object. A bright white light was at each apex of the triangle underneath the craft. The lights were not bright enough to illuminate the ground beneath the craft. There was also a red light in the center of the bottom of the triangle, less bright than the white lights, which blinked about once per second. There were no other lights on the object and no windows, orifices or other surface features were visible. The color of the object was black, but not the same color as the stealth aircraft. The object produced no sound, although the witness did not get out of the car. No other witnesses are known to have observed the object.  Position, movement and duration. The nearest surface of the object was approximately at a 60 degree angle from the ground when the craft was at its lowest altitude. When first seen the object was about 400 ft above ground but moved down “quite rapidly” to about 150 ft and hovered for several seconds, then rose up to about 400 ft. There was no apparent lateral motion of the object. The car was moving about 45 mph but slowed to 10-15 mph immediately upon sighting of the object. The object was last seen to the rear of the car and disappeared when the car got too far away for the witness to see it. The duration of the sighting was about 1 minute. Witness 2, the driver, did not see the object because she was concentrating on driving. Drawing of object. When he came home the witness made drawing of the object (Fig. 1) which looked substantially the same as the drawing he made during the investigation. The original drawing was lost. After the sighting, he read some UFO literature, including accounts of the triangular objects seen in Belgium in the early 90s. as shown in Figure 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                2 of 2 Figure 1. Object viewed from below at its lowest altitude.                              Sighting evaluation: CE1. The object described is similar to the description of many triangular objects seen worldwide for the past 20 years. There is no conventional explanation apart from the possibility that the craft was an advanced military aircraft. However, current known technology is not consistent with a craft capable of hovering and moving rapidly vertically upward and downward without engine noise.  Witness 2  Object description. Witness 2 observed two white lights, separated by the width of her thumb at arms length directly in front of her (toward the east). The lights were estimated to be 15 miles away (though she emphasized the uncertainty of this estimate), and were seen at the same time as witness 1 observed the triangular object to his right. Witness 1 also observed the two lights, but not closely, since he was occupied with observing the triangular object to his right. Witness 2 estimated the size of the lights to be about 1/8th the diameter of the moon and the brightness as brighter than a streetlight. Based on the inverse square law, this would mean the lights were more than 225 times the intrinsic brightness of a streetlight. As far as she could tell the object was not illuminating the ground. No other witnesses are known to have observed the lights.  Position, movement, and duration.  Witness 2 estimated that the object was about 20 degrees above the ground. This would make the altitude of the lights about 6 miles (~31,000 ft). The lights appeared motionless for about 1 minute, then moved downward rapidly until they disappeared below the tree-lined horizon about 3 seconds after they began their descent. The calculated speed of movement was 7200 mph. The lights disappeared at about the same time as witness 1 lost sight of the triangular object. The witnesses observed airplanes in the vicinity but witness 2 was adamant that the lights she saw were not conventional aircraft. The nearest airport is 9 miles to the southwest, 135 degrees to the right of (behind) the direction where the objects were sighted. There are no airports within at least 40 miles to the east of the sighting location.  Additional lights. During the time the 2 lights were hovering, they emitted 2 smaller lights which circled downward and back up and joined with the primary light a few seconds after they appeared. The witness had no estimate of the speed of these lights and said they were not quite as bright as the primary lights.  Sighting Evaluation: Probably conventional aircraft. If the object size was 1/8th the apparent diameter of the moon and 15 miles away, it would have been a very large object, indeed. At 225 times the brightness of a streetlight, it would also have been exceedingly bright. The downward speed of 7200 mph is also extraordinary. The lack of other witnesses or press coverage of such a remarkable object as well as the inexperience of the witness and the well known difficulty in judging distances of lights in the sky causes the investigator to believe that the lights were probably much closer than estimated and thus much smaller and less bright. Despite the lack of an airport in the direction of the sighting, the presence of a major airport, MSP, 30 miles west of the sighting causes the investigator to believe that the lights could very possibly have been attached to aircraft. However, there is not enough information to make an unambiguous judgment.",2001-12-05T00:00:00,45.0648,-92.8473

I glanced up slightly and saw a huge bright light flying only a kilometer or so over the tree line. At first I thought it was a plane with its landing lights on but there is no airport near by. At closer investigation I saw that the brightest of the lights was in front of the craft and there were two more at the rear making a triangle shape. There was a blinking light directly at the bottom. While it was still a good distance from us I noticed a small light of some sort fall from underneath this thing.  As it came closer I thought about pointing it out to my wife. Just as I thought of telling her I heard her ask ""What is that?"" We slowed down and looked at it for several seconds as it lowered and finally became less illuminated. I could see clearly the side of the craft. It had what looked like windows wrapped around what I call the hull. Just when most of it was visible it lit up again very quickly and disappeared with a bright flash of light. No sooner than we saw this my wife started to almost scream when we saw two more directly in front of us. They all looked identical to the first one. Again I saw a light (almost looked like a meteorite) fall from the bottom of one of the other crafts. One all of a sudden appeared and went straight down in the east. We were speechless. We finally talked about it when we got to the apartment building only a mile from where we witnessed all of this. To say the least this was the weirdest thing either of us have ever experienced.

Surprised was I to see what looked like a satelite, high in the sky, but with an unusual twist....it had a clear beam of light, with a narrow focus emitting in front of it all the way across the whole sky from west to the eastern horison! The beam of light was very focused and did not widen or dissipate for the entire length of its arc across the sky....a very long distance from that altitude. As the'satelite' moved across the sky, about 20-25 seconds to cross from nw horizon to ne horizon, the beam clearly was coming from the front of it and it shortened as a headlight would do as the vehicle moved across the sky.... Satelite body was yellowish, no detals, beam was slightly bluer. There was also a clear but faint sound as it passed overhead, sounded like decelleration of a body from a great speed...a droning, low pitched vibration which lowered slightly in frequency in the time I observed it slightly.

Location:  Bellevue, WA Time: 11:15 PM 02/24/02 to 3:10 AM 02/25/02 11:15 PM I stood outside on my front porch and saw in the western sky what appeared to be 2-3 stars grouped together.  I was alone.  It caught my attention as unusual.  As I watched, it changed back into what appeared to be one star.  It wasn't as if the lights merged; it was as if some lights were shut off.  Next it appeared to be a regular, but bright star with a thin ""X"" light shine pattern coming out of it.  Went back to the ""ball"" shape.  An arm of light appeared to project off of it, making it look kind of like a long, thin arrow.  The light didn't appear to be projected, but again as if it were turned on.  A few times there appeared to be a gap between the arrow tail (the ball) and the shaft of the arrow.  It was moving in a northerly direction, but very, very slowly.  The ""arrow"" seemed to point easterly.  There was no noise, and the light appeared to be quite high up, but I don't know, as the light was all I could see (no outline of any shape).  The ""ball"" part of the light looked about the size and intensity of Venus in the night sky.  There was a very, very faint aura of light around the object.  I phoned my son to ask him to go view it, but he had company, he said it was probably a satellite, and he refused to go look. 11:15 PM As at the first sighting, the look of this object wasn't constant; it changed.  A few times it appeared to project a very thin green ""X"" light pattern off of the ball of light.  The shaft of the arrow would appear and disappear.  At times there appeared to be a red light at the tip of the arrow.  At times it appeared to project thin green lights that gave it a diamond shape, with one tip of the diamond being at the ""ball"" and the other tip being at the end of the ""shaft"". 11:54 PM It appeared much the same as 11:15 PM.  It had moved higher in the sky (more easterly).  I could see it moving, but the movement was very slow. 2:20 AM Still fluctuating between showing the different light patterns as described above, mostly appearing as a star-colored ball with a shaft of light from it.  It wasn't like a searchlight being projected, but like lights being turned on.  Still quite close to the same location as 11:54. 3:10 AM The object had moved way off to the north and was quite a bit lower in the sky than at 11:35.  At this point the lights appeared to be pulsating.  The ball was red, and the shaft was green, then they would trade colors.  There didn't appear to be a set rhythm to the color changes.  After this, I went to bed. At each observance, I watched the object for approximately ten minutes, but it was close to 30 degrees on my front porch (facing west), so I couldn't stay outside long. At noon today there appear to be some ""clouds"" -- fanned con trails? -- that have strange patterns to them... then don't sweep straight across the sky like a con trail, but curve.

The sky was clear and there was very little wind and there was no sound of jets, helicopters, and prop planes. I had enough time after watching them float to run inside and yell to my wife to come down and see them. She was really excited and we both watched them increase in speed and move out of sight. We also both made an observation that kind startled us both. As the lights moved away from us they seem to make up the outline of a much larger ship. When they were above me I only saw the lights with clear sky in back of them, not the outline of a ship. But again as it moved away it looked, as those lights were again the outline of a larger ship.

The sky was dark, no moon. I went out for a cigarette.  I always look at the stars when I am outside.  As I was looking, I saw a very dark objectmoving from East to west.  If I did not have better than 20/20 vision, I would have missed it, as it almost blended in with the black sky.  I estimate it to be moving at around 200mph and at an altitude of about 2000 feet.  It made no sound, and being a star and airplane buff, it was not an airplane.  It had no marker lights, strobes or any lights at all.  It was very quiet, dark.  The shape was like a boomerang as it passed overhead.  As it continued away from me, I could just make out a shape from behind.  The first thing I thought of when I saw the shape, was squashed pearls. If you picture a string of 4 black pearls on a table in a straight line, then you bend the string in the middle so that 2 pearls are on one side of the wing, and 2 pearls down the other side. Then you squish the pearls down until they are oval shaped. Basically, it looked similar to the stealth bomber, but didn't have jagged wings.  It looked like a black boomerang with 4 bumps on it. Immediately after seeing this, I ran upstairs told my wife, and called the media and asked if there were any other reportings.  They told me there weren't any reportings, but took my name and number down and said they will contact me if anyone else reports anything. Why so long do I finally report this?  I always wanted to tell someone who is interested, but didn't think to look on the net until tonight after going out again and seeing the same kind of night reminding me of that night.

At about 1:30 am, 2 friends and i were riding atvs on a remote fire road in a wooded area about 3 miles from town when i noticed a bright blue light behind me. At first i didnt think anything of it but i realized there was no one behind me.  As we rode at about 15 miles an hour the light hovered above us. Im not sure how long it stayed above us but if i guessed id have to say  15 - 30 seconds.  Then the light accelerated extremely fast ahead of us. When it got ahead of us it rocketed to the left then back to the center of the skyline dissapearing in front of us. Its hard to describe the intensity of the light but it was extremely bright.  Also, im not sure how high the light was above us.  (if i was going to make an accurate guess id saw about 250 yards when it was hovering and i couldn't estimate how high it was when it accelerated away).  The light accelerated faster than any airplane could as it crossed the skyline in a matter of seconds it was like the speed of a shooting star or a meteorite.  It also cornered very quickly  when it changed directions( first to the left then back to the center) I dont think any aircraft is capable of that type of cornering.  After the light disappeared my friend ahead of me (about 20 yards) stopped to let me catch up.  Before i could ask if he saw it he said ""what the hell was that"". I was glad he saw it too.  My friend that was on the back of the atv with me witnessed it also.  All 3 of us had the same description of the sighting. I have no idea what the light was but i am positive it was not an aircraft of any type or a meteorite or shooting star.  The way the light accelerated and turned was not possible by man or nature.  I would also like to add that there was no other visible light of any kind except my headlight and the one on the vehicle in front, a big difference from the intense blue light.  This was a remote and wooded area not easily accessible. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2002-01-29T00:00:00,40.8413,-76.1089

As I left my office about 10pm I looked up into a clear sky in the east, and noticed a bright manilla colored light about 45 degrees above the horizon. This is also a view of the approach to LAX so you see the various aircraft at their various levels during approach.  This light was much larger and much brighter than the lights of the approaching aircraft. The light, at that distance was about 3/8 inches in diameter, and did not appear to be moving, as the other aircraft on approach were.  I took a minute or so to look at it, tried to figure out what it might be and when I couldn't left.  On my way home, I stopped to get something to eat which took about a half hour. When I got home and out of the car, I couldn't help but notice it was still there...still unmoving...total elapsed time from my first sighting of it was no about 1 hr. It was east of the belt stars of Orion. Being an amature astronomer I first tried to equate as an astonomical body but couldn't. It was much larger than Jupiter and Saturn which had already set by this time. It was too large and too yellow for Venus. It's color was like that of Saturn through a telescope. I ruled out astonomical and commercial aircraft. I gave up for the night and went in and went to bed. When I turned on the Coast to Coast program to listen to until falling asleep a guy called in from Santa Barbara and told the host (AB) about it. He said he and some friends were leaving an eatery in Santa Barbara when they spotted it. He described it exactly as I saw it to AB who began to ridicule him. He finally got angry and told the host to go out and look into the eastern sky about 30 degrees above the horizon. Finally the host said he'd do it at the next break. Given Santa Barbaras proximity to Los Angeles, it would have appeared lower on the horizon than it did from my vantage point. Unfortunately, I don't believe the show host could've seen it from his desert location. My best guess is that the farthest east it could've been would have been Palm Springs, CA. I hate trying to guesstimate distances and heights but I'd say it was probaby at about 7000 ft over the area of Riverside or maybe even further west. To rule out an astronomical body, I went outside the following night at the same time and there was nothing there. Had it been astonomical in nature it would have been there for a number of nights at least. I rued out a law enforcement helicopter which are prevalant in the area because they away's circle or move in some way...this object simply wasn't moving. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness may have been observing.  However, we note that Jupiter currently is very prominent in the eastern sky during the early evening, and that it ""rises"" in the sky toward the zenith throughout the evening.  Unless there were two, prominent bright lights in the eastern sky, our first guess is that the observer might have been looking at Jupiter.
