It happened and as the new TV series says, ""I KNOW WHAT I SAW,"" and I don’t care if you believe or not! Story:   Upon arriving home from work one day in June of 2003 at 6:15 pm or so, our biggest cat (Midnight) was wanting out and was standing by the back door.  I opened the door . . . my next recollection was of looking up and seeing a rectangle dark space with three pipes attached beside it that were approximately three feet long and reattaching to an object, and I thought; what the heck! My field of vision expanded and I saw a ship hovering above my back patio just missing the top of our mimosa tree in the back yard.  The object was approximately 30 feet by 30 feet but was not a silver disk, the front (that was the side that was forward when object moved to the west, then zoomed off, I assume it was the front) was over the covered patio to the west of the open patio 5 feet and covered the length of the open patio plus 5 feet or so (just measured area with tape measure 30ft x 30ft).  This object had attachments, plates and bolt, and there were antennas sticking forward in the front. As I stood there I heard a low hum, almost too low to hear, resonated from the object and it started to move slowly to the west, I walked east into the back yard to get a better look.  Object had three equal rectangle areas on back that glowed red, but I felt no heat and should of, as I was only 20 feet below the object.   The object maneuvered around the neighbors’ tree (neighbor west of house) then zoom disappeared into a dot then gone.

It was coming directly from the west and I was hoping it would be a satellite reflecting the light from the sun that had set an hour earlier.  I did not see flashing lights, or colored lights; just a steady glow.  As the object drew closer, it appeared it was about as high as some of the jet airliners that often pass overhead to other cities.   I was just outside of my house, so I ran back in to get binoculars (7x35) to see the object better.  It appeared to be traveling as fast as military jets at high altitude, but it did not look like a plane.  Using the binoculars, I was then able to tell that the quality of light was much brighter than reflected sunlight and that the object appeared to be creating the light.  It was a round shape; glowing a very bright white with a slight hint of blue at the edges.  Again, I could not see any standard aircraft lighting.  Based on the altitude of normal aircraft, the diameter of the object appeared to be as big as the length of an airliner.   It was now about overhead, and I was thinking it could still be a satellite, when it then began changing its eastern course and then began heading in a northeastern direction.  I could not see jet thrusters or wings on the craft. I continued to watch it as it disappeared.    If it was satellite, it should have lost intensity as it went further from the horizon, and it would not have changed directions.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,39.79513762886598,-89.66251786941581

Sky perfectly clear and moonless with Jupiter bright in the southern sky.  I was carrying groceries from my car to my apartment and was not watching the sky when suddenly, a flash of white light from above caused me to look skyward. I saw a white hot, incandescent object with blue and red tinges of color at its center and a short tail of sparks directly overhead. The object and the glow surrounding it were about the size of a saucer held at arm’s length against the sky. Its speed was a bit faster than meteors I’ve observed in the past. The object passed to the west behind the roof of my apartment building where I could no longer see it. When I rounded the corner of the building, it had disappeared altogether. I assumed it burned out while beyond my field of vision. The sighting lasted about 2 seconds.  I immediately concluded I had seen a meteor, but the altitude of the object was surprising. It appeared to be much closer to the earth's surface than meteors I’ve observed in the past, including the spectacular meteor shower I saw in August, 1993, that resulted from some vaporization of the Swift-Tuttle comet core. This object seemed so close that I initially thought it might be some type of firework launched from the nearby neighborhood. I was concerned the object was going to touch down somewhere nearby. (I realize that altitude is difficult to judge when there is no other backdrop than the stars at great distances in a black sky.) There was absolutely no sound that preceded my sighting the object and no sound when it flashed and then passed overhead. When directly above me, the object was so bright that it illuminated the wall of my apartment building.  I’m assigning my sighting to a meteor, but the object had a couple of characteristics that were not meteor-like.

As soon as it had passed our yard it slowly began to disappear. The light traveled from the NE to the EW and was of a triangular shape. Approximate 20 minutes after the first light, a second big orange light appeared traveling from the NE to the W. This one had a orange circle around the main light.

I would place the object somewhere over the Blue Hills reservation. The object first caught my attention when I saw a flash of light in the sky. I then pointed it out to my sister who confirmed that something was there, she was driving so she didn't stay focused on it. I am more than familiar with commercial, military, and recreational vehicles. It was not a blimp, it was not anything that I have ever seen before. I looked at the object in the sky for approximately 6-8 seconds before it flashed again only brighter and longer it seemed. The glare coming from it didn't shine directly off the metallic surface of the craft, rather it appeared around the craft in an aura. The aura lasted 2-3 seconds, the craft then sat there hovering motionless for another 6-8 seconds, before it looked like another very short burst of light before the craft began to just fade from sight. It was like nothing I've ever seen the way the object just disappeared, as if it had a cloaking device that was turned on to make it slowly fade from sight in pieces. It was like someone was spraypainting the sky behind it onto what you were seeing. It disappeared in sections, bit by bit. And it was gone forever! I stared at the spot where it was until we got to the 93 merger and went all the way past Blue Hills but I saw no trace of it.

Kind of looked like a giant window pain flying across the sky. Very ""Star Wars"" animation like with glowing engines instead of flames. The panels were vertical to the road, or 90 degrees to the earth, and looked as if I was looking at the propulsion system of something. Do we have plasma drive??? Can't say how high it was or how big it was because I was driving. I did get some very shaky video of it through my windshield while I was driving.

I was at a football game preparing for our halftime performance I observed with several others a group of lights in the sky.  Nobody I know of saw the lights come into view and I didn’t see them until we came down from the stands.  There were about 8 lights all revolving in different directions but they stayed at the same altitude and stayed clustered together in the same area of the sky.  The lights crossed each other’s path which kept me from being to accurately count them.  They did not blink or pulse and looked about 5 or 6 miles away. They appeared to be above a light cluster of clouds. I can’t accurately guess how high the lights or clouds were. The area I think is near DFW airport because there were always passenger aircraft flying over. The planes were flying lower then the clouds. We had to move on to the football field for our performance and so I did not see the lights leave. When we finished the show they were no longer there. I know there is probabl! y a simple explanation to what the lights were. I suspected that they were just spot lights reflecting on clouds but there were no upward beams of light visible.  All the witnesses I know of are in the Weatherford Marching Band. I pointed out the lights to most of the people who saw them but they took no interest in the sighting although they had no explanations for what they were. I have always had a interest in paranormal activity ever since I heard of the Stephenville and Lubbock sightings. I live close to both cities. The spotlights of the State Fair was my first guess but since the Stephenville sightings and a wave of strange earthquakes in the area, which I read are suspected to be linked with UFO sightings, I began to wonder.

And then I could see the omitting light, began to intensify.  till it got to a point where it was close to being as bright as the sun.  Which was over to my right, high up in the sky.  Far away from this object.  One the object got to this point it sustained that level of brightness, and appeared to come towards the Hill we where on.

Right after that, I kinda sweep the whole bay, from where I was, and now saw 3 identical small objects show up in sequence, and at parallel height.

My family and I were in our vehicle, I was driving my wife was in the passenger seat and my two teenage children were in the back. About five minutes earlier we had seen a shooting star that was large and green in color, it stood out because of the brightness and size. I noticed off to my left on the east side of the interstate a similar green light, I watched it for 30 seconds thinking it was a tower light from a cell tower or power line. I did not take my eyes off of it except to check the road and traffic in front of us then return to looking at it. I then noticed it was moving west bound and starting to cross the interstate. My thought at the time was ‘could this be another shooting star?’ it was approximately 20 feet off the ground it appeared to be moving across the interstate at 25 miles per hour. The only thing I saw was a small green light going across the road, no outline of anything else. At this point I pointed it out to my family who all watched it as well. I was very clearly studying this light and everything around it and saw no outline of anything. As it went over the interstate it went off to the right hand side my family turned to watch it clearly, it appeared to speed up and then all these lights appeared on it . It looked like an almost V shaped two lengths of straight white/ silver lights with  two or three square shaped lights below it. It looked almost triangular in shape. It continued to glow and then looked like it was flying lower slightly tilted which allowed us to see the square outline of lights below the two long strip of lights, then we only saw the glow of it which then disappeared completely. The amazing thing was there was no sound at all, if it had been a jet or aircraft we would have heard the engines as it was so close to us. It lasted only ten to fifteen seconds from start to finish.

I have seen lots of sat's give up there location to the setting sun glowing brightly and then going out. I watched this to see where it was going and how long it would last. It then got bigger and I figured I was looking at a plane headlight, but then it got longer so I asked my mate, what do you think of this light. She quickly looked up and we both watched as it got brighter and larger, looked like an hour glass to me how far off, no idea but it seemed a great distance, then after about 15 seconds it went out, just sort of a grey outline in the sky, so I thought wow that was some light show, it must be huge to look that bright down here and still seen as an outline (looked to me like a bus flying through space, from where I stood). Then I noticed that there was a red light on the object. I thought, what in orbit would have a red light on it that I could see from here? Then I noticed the red light was moving. It traveled a circular pattern as it it was mounted on the outside and was going around something. The object could not be seen, it was as if it was invisible, but the red light gave it away, It took about 5 seconds for the light to do one revolution, I watched 3, 4 revolutions as the object was directly over head moving towards the North. No sound, nothing, just then I noticed, it was glowing on the top, I could not see the top but the air above it was lite up like the color of a sunset, pink, orange, red, I mentioned, look it's glowing at the back on top, just then a small orb came off of the larger object, this orb looked like an ember from a hot fire, about the size of a star, and just as bright. It made several loops behind the object (like an ember in the wind) , seemed to follow, but I watched the larger object due to the fact that if you took your eye away you could probably not locate it again, the object continued to the north with the light rotating. The Red light was the red of a tail light in a car or a jet, how fast would it have to have been going to go from sunlight to over my head in 25 seconds, then to the north and back out of sight in another 35 seconds? The circular path the light took was very large, I would say that if you held out a 5 inch disk at arms length it's about the size of the light path when the object was overhead. The whole event lasted about 50 seconds or so. I have never seen anything like this and I am in my 45th year here on Earth. I will try to get my mate to submit what she saw.

Multiple sightings of unidentified objects have occurred in the past few weeks over Fort Wayne, Indiana. Sightings have been made by myself and 5 other people.  I have experience in astronomy, astrology, and physics, as do two other witnesses.  REPORT:  On clear nights the unknown objects have been seen flying across the sky as (apparently) tiny points of light--NOT BLINKING, with a constant glow--, about the size/brightness of an average star (from our perspective). At first we assumed they were planes or possibly satellites, but for how small they were--seeing as they were at extremely high altitudes--they were moving far too fast.  The objects moved at a seemingly constant velocity, but their independent trajectories are  not constant.  We have seen them travel in straight paths, in exaggerated arcs, and even move back in forth in a kind of weaving motion. What is peculiar is that the objects do not appear off the horizon, they simply appear at random points in the sky, sometimes along with barely noticeable flashes of light.  Some are stationary and then begin to move very suddenly with no detectable acceleration.  Furthermore, the objects do not necessarily fly toward the horizon as they move away from us.  Instead they either fade away or simply blip out of sight.  We assume that this means they are not following the curve of the earth, but moving on some kind of tangent.  One object was the most interesting.  It was much lower in the atmosphere then the others, appearing very large and bright, but with no obvious shape.  It was just a point of light.  It moved very quickly across the sky, and disappeared in a very sudden and almost undetectable flash of light.  It was nowhere near the horizon at the time of its disappearance.  The color of light coming from the larger object seemed to be a yellow shade, the wavelength being around 580nm. The most recent sighting was witnessed by myself alone at approximately 4:15 am, Wednesday, July 15 2009.  There was a small flash and then a poi! nt of li ght like others before.  This time, though,as the object moved directly over my position, the amplitude of the light it emitted greatly increased until it was very very bright.  It dimmed again, then brightened for a shorter amount of time, before quickly speeding up and simply disappearing at about 75 degrees off the horizon. ** I realize this report is not very well organized, but it is in all aspects completely serious.  I would very sincerely appreciate if someone were to look into this case. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As we drove up on the object, which was about 50 yards off to the side of the highway in a field with high power lines, we both stared in awe as we noticed a giant triangular shaped craft hovering above these power lines.  I was driving and my friend was in the passenger's seat, so he had a better view than I did.  I kept looking over at it every second or so and what I saw was a triangular shaped craft about 60-80 feet long on the longest parts and three bright yellowish/orange lights shining from each corner.  We took a right turn at the next light about 100 yards up the road and pulled right into a parkin! g lot next to this field.

I scanned the sky for just a second or two, and by the time I returned my focus to where the object had just been, it was gone. This incident has stuck with me ever since, and even though I saw the object for just a second or two, I can still picture it perfectly in my mind.

After it had disappeared, I could see no smoke trails indicating where it had gone, nor did I hear any sounds indicative of a fast moving aircraft. I recently saw a television program where I saw a filmed sighting of a remarkably similar object, which was filmed in California. After seeing this, I decided that I should document my sighting.

I had just got off of work. The sky was bright due to the parking lot and didn't have many stars. All you could see was the crescent moon to my right and a bright star below it. I looked up momentarily and something caught my attention. It was a unique red star, it didn't look like the red of a plane. It looked more like mars but even brighter. It went right under the moon and moved towards the north. I thought it's gotta be a plane at first but as I kept watching it, I saw no flashing lights. Planes always fly over from the north and so as I was watching it a plane flew by and the object started following it. It was moving very slowly and would move subtly up and down as it went in a northern direction. Then it went more towards the west, and sort of stopped in one spot (turning into odd shapes of lights) and started coming back towards me. This is when it got weird, Instead of being one bright red light I saw 2. Then it was coming even closer, and I saw 2 red lights and an almost orange light. It was not flashing. It then turned it's shape or did something and had 3 red lights (sort of orange hue) in the shape of a triangle. It then flew slowly right over my head. I could actually see the outline of the object. It appeared to almost change shape before my eyes, but I made out a triangle. It flew over me and then went back towards the east, almost did an oval shape. At this point I was convinced this was not a plane or a helicopter. It started moving back towards the north. I was standing outside of my car with my lights on so I flashed my lights at it. It then actually came back towards me after doing this. I yelled at a co-worker to come look at it. It was changing from white to red erratically. Not flashing, just changing. Like possibly rotating or changing its shape. When I flashed my lights at it, it was pretty far away and once I yelled at the co-worker to come look it started coming back towards me, this time lower and even more over my head. After it went over our heads, it had 2 bright light wh! ites on the back. We could see the shape of it. It was triangle but had other things on it. He thought it looked like a satellite but agreed it was way too low. It then went back towards the north and I stopped watching it. We see planes fly over everyday since there is an airport close by, but this was beyond bizarre. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))",2009-03-19T00:00:00,29.87306124031008,-98.01287441860465

If this was a plane it would have been rattling my house. Not to mention, it would have been moving. It was completely stationary. It just hovered there in the woods and began to change the color of a harvest moon (orange). The brightness of the light was not as intense as this time passed. By this time I decided to get my video camera to show my husband what I saw. While I was scrambling to find it, the light was fading. The camera disc was full. So, I just stood and watched it shrink smaller and fade into a red/orange light the size of my hand. It was strange how it shrunk and faded. It just faded down to the center of the original light source. no sounds, just complete silence. The whole thing lasted about 10-15 min. Then the light was gone. We are in the winter season here and the trees are bare from hurricane Gustav and the cold. So the visiblity through the woods was pretty clear.

It is a dark, dead, straight stretch of road. More than fifty miles ahead, we could see an active city of flashing white glow.  As we neared the city of lights hovering over the left side, my wife pulled off the road and she said,  “Look at this!” I saw a spectacle of the brightest white flashing light ever experienced.  The object was hovering approximately 40 yards away and 50 feet above the ground.  It was so bright in the night sky that I could not make out the shape of the object, or objects.  It was hovering, but not completely stationary, as it slowly wavered 10 degrees down it’s path.  There was no sound.  I peered into the luminescence as I looked up to this swiveling white light at the top sending beams high into the dark sky.  Below, there was a row of blue lights possibly stretching 30 yards across.   I franticly repeated, “What is this?” My wife, my eighteen-year-old daughter and ten-year-old grandson were speechless as we, all, looked on in awe.  This experience lasted a mere minute before I resolved quickly, “I’m gonna grab my camera”, reaching in the back window for my camcorder.  Suddenly, as I said this, the lights/object strobe-shifted miles down the road.  The movement was unworldly as there was no humanly audible sound nor any notice of motion to reach it’s distance.  I, still, thought to capture the distant lights to record ‘something‘ of the phenomena.  Again, suddenly, as if there was connection of my intentions, the object shifted considerable distance down the road to be a mere glow.  Within two seconds, the object was here and then had nearly disappeared.  I felt cheated.  My wife began turning the car around until our daughter cried out with all her fear and common sense, “No, don’t turn around!  Do not turn around!  Do not go after that thing!”  I had never seen my daughter so scared Looking through the rear window of the car, perplexed with the sudden distant remaining glow, I considered our fortune to live through this experience.

I looked up to the northeast, and what we saw appeared to be about 2 miles away, black, and cigar shaped.  I said to him that I thought it was an airplane.  He asked me just what kind of plane did I know that looked like that.  Just as soon as he said that, the object flew instantly towards us and now was not even a quarter mile away in the sky.  It changed shape, still black, but looked like liquid metal.  It became egg-shaped and was very shiny, however, the sun was blocked by solid cloud cover, so I didn't make sense that the object was reflecting light.  It hovered in the same spot for about 15 seconds, then, with amazing speed, shot straight to the east and stopped instantly, hovering over the middle school.  I was now heading east in my car to get closer to it.  I traveled two city blocks, looking straight at the object.

As I drew closer to it.It started to move off over the eastern Whitby very slow and over western Oshawa ,Ontario.  This one is a new one for me. Could it have been military?  It was that big whatever it was  and even kind of spooky-due to the distant spread of the three white lights. It was definitely not a helicopter, it was way too long, not to mention the lighting sequence. Theruby red light seem to be rotating in flashing. I flashed my head! lights on and off twice, while driving. It appeared to flash back, but not so brightly, there was a difference in its lighting tone. After that happened as I drew closer to it, that's when it started to move off. Now, other people must have seen this one. Maybe my report on this sighting may be the first one.Hopefully may well not be the last in reporting this sighting. Other witnesses over Whitby and Oshawa must have seen this one as big as it was.This should be report by other who witnessed it . I'm sure if anybody had seen it. They were dumb stricken.PS When I flashed my headlights and slowed down IN MY CAR.Traffic in front of me also slowed down.I'm concluding they too must have witnessed this thing.I was so excited to get home that night to watch Peter Jennings- ABC ~Seeing is Believing ~ Gee, I again witnessed something incredible and unexplainable.I believe each time I witness these unknown aerial anomalies.It creates a wondering obsessive afterthought in question ? ! What the heck was it in timing to see this thing up there !!!~",2010-04-13T00:00:00,43.89253285714286,-78.94515678571429

It was a very bright white light.  There seemed to be smaller red and blue lights near the bright white light.   The lights seemed to be sort of ""twinkling"".  There was some kind of ""form"" of a shadow structure where the lights were, but I could not determine any shape.  It was too far away from me.  It was not directly overhead, it was in the western sky. It was cold outside, so I did not want to stay outside. I walked back inside and told my husband ""there is an UFO outside"". He replied ""You mean that bright white light?  It has been out there for several nights this week"".  I could not believe he did not mention it to me before. My husband went outside and said ""that is the same light that I have been seeing all week.""  He goes outside at night more than I do. I was busy cooking at the time.  I went back outside an hour later, and the light was still there.  The light seemed to have dropped a little lower to the horizen, and it was not as bright as it had been.

June 2006 my wife and I had left home and drove to the intersection of Redfox and Davenport Rd in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where when stopped at the stop sign, we both observed what initially appeared to be a cluster of balloons in a perfectly round shape we would estimate about 300 feet in the air to our right.  This was a clear day with unlimited visibility and the object was maybe the size of about 50 feet round. The object that at that moment I assumed due to the metallic gray color was a weather balloon caught our attention because it did not move for several seconds.  The cluster then started to climb ever so slowly straight up and suddenly flew up at a blinding speed and then disappeared into the daytime sky without ever making any sound. Please note, I and my wife sincerely believe now that we witnessed an object that defies anything man made due to the fact that nothing could have been still like that and then moved at the amazing rate of speed it did without a sonic boom or some sound being emitted.

I know of nothing both civilian or military that emits sparks like that, (beautiful colors and very bright as well) that can make zero noise and had no semblance of any cockpit that one could see, it was that close to the ground..  I approximate it's airspeed at around 100 knots because I could easily watch it as it came into close view and then went by and then watched as it went out of sight again..  It was said, I think, on the news that it was some type of military aircraft that went down.  Might have crashed somewhere South of Loveland, Colorado or Longmont...  Not sure exactly.

I grew up on Morningside Farm and lived there, off and on, until 2008.  From 2007-08  I have seen on numerous occasions a ""floating"" orange/amber light just above the mountain ridge as I would make the last turn coming up Morningside Lane heading home.  I have seen at times two lights, seemingly independent of each other, drift up and down over the ridge line.  Sometimes as I turned the corner and my vehicle was pointing directly towards the light(s) they would either slowly descend behind the mountain or gradually fade out.  Other times the light(s) would just sit there and remain until I reached the farmhouse.  A couple of times I stood and looked at the lights for several minutes. We often have fighter jets in the area that practice maneuvers in the daytime, so I always assumed that it was some kind of new military aircraft, but really was puzzled by its characteristics. I have heard that others in the area have also seen the same lights and couldn't identify it.  It happened so frequently that I assumed someone knew what it was and it was really no big deal.  I now wonder and just thought I would share it with you, just in case you have other reports from this area. I'm including a Google Map link to the area I'm referring to... http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=37.62222,-90.668149&spn=0.014446,0.033023&t=h&z=16   I no longer live in the area, so I have not seen anything there as of late. I am a professor at a University in St. Louis, teaching interactive media design and have an MA in international relations. I do not do any type of drugs and rarely drink alcohol. I was completely sober each time I witnessed these lights. I'm open to the idea of other intelligent life visiting us, but a skeptic by nature. This has left me wondering. I would be interested to know if you have had any other reports similar to mine in this area. Thanks for your time. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

This may sound crazy but here goes. It was approximately 2:20am on Tuesday morning, Sep 23, 2008.  I woke up to go to the bathroom.  After I got back into bed, I closed my eyes and I saw these distorted images reflected in my eyes (my eyes were closed).  These images were red, blue, yellow, green and in the shape of random lines vibrating.  All of a sudden I hear a very distorted sound, like someone playing a strange instrument with only 5 notes playing one at a time.  This continued for about 2 minutes until I heard a very loud , deep rumbling noise, like an engine, above my house. I got up to look out the balcony window but could not see anything in the sky.  All I could sense was absolute silence, no other sounds could be heard, no wind, no cars, no birds, not even an airplane which I thought could be the reason for the noise.  But there was absolutely nothing.  It was as if time had stopped.  This rumbling noise was very low, like nothing I’d ever heard, but I couldn’t see anything. There were no lights.  This lasted maybe 1 minute and then I heard those notes again.  I looked around the backyard and then all of a sudden, to the left of me, I see this greenish shaped image projected on the wall of the apartment complex to the left of my house. It was the shape of a circle with a point at the top and a flat bottom with a line running through it. It was on the wall for a few seconds then it vanished.  It must have been at least 10 feet wide and 10 feet long on the wall. I then proceeded to the front of the house thinking maybe the noises were coming from there but did not see or hear anything. I went back to my bedroom, sat there for a few seconds and then heard those notes again! I looked out the balcony door I saw it again. The image projected onto the apartment complex.  It lasted about 1 minute and then vanished. You must think this all sounds very crazy and unreal, but I saw it and heard those noises.

The rear seemed to undulate or flow energy like a jellyfish or chinese kite flapping in the back, almost like it was a wispy celestial body and semi-transparent but still with very defined edges overall.

It was very wide from the back view as it cruised off into the distance and from the rear seemed like a long white or pearly line gliding along off into the sky heading southward towards delray beach.  It moved very straight & level and much faster than any tiny distant blinking planes did that were far off in the west sky shortly after that we used for comparison.

Please suggest explanations. We were sitting in our local pub (about 50 people outside) when one of us pointed up to the sky, drawing our attention. A rather large orange-red, very vibrant pulsating light was visible moving straight across in an airplane-fashion, about the same speed. We had limited visibility through bushes and pub-inventory, when we noticed that there were additional objects with the same appearance that floated farther away from the one we just spotted. At first glance it seemed like a helicopter, however the number of objects and the rather intense light and color would not have justified that conclusion. I went on to a better spot to examine these objects and a friend followed me. Surprisingly no one else of the few people we had made aware of the objects followed, after the incident they explained it was due to disbelief. We´re not sure how many of the guests in the pub had noticed them as well. We gained full sight of the sky, about 2 objects were flying to our left, with the rest in no particular formation to our right, in front of them. They were flying level, apparently with considerable distance between them (the first one we noticed was just glowing so much, seemed much closer), and at normal, aircraft-comparable speed. After watching them for some time and taking a photo via a cellphone, one after another began to disappear. The size of the glowing balls began to shrink, until there was only a very small but shiny star-like glow visible, then they disappeared completely, one after another. It did, to me, not seem like they were speeding away as it is common in ufo reports, but rather that the light got smaller until invisible (it did not dim out). We are examining the possibility of these objects being candle-balloons, however from our observation that does not seem to be a possibility due to a) the extremely bright orange-red color of the objects and b) the straight level flight of all of the objects (horizontal, not upwards).",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

It moved from SSE to NNO silently in about 15-20 seconds, nearly overhead, passing over scattered cumulus clouds in an otherwise clear blue sky. It dissapeared behind clouds at about 10 deg. above the tree line. I estimate its angular size to be about half a degree, or the apparent size of the moon. As it was receding in the distance, i noticed some ""turbulence"" of fusiness just behind the object, and something dark gray was visible at the back, like the tail of an airplane.

It looked like a B-1 bomber and an F-16 rammed together. The sun was setting but there was plenty of light so could clearly see the shape and get an idea of it's size. The front of the craft had a standard 'high speed' fighter jet shape swept wing (30'wide) without a tail section a very long fuesalage and a large main swept-wing. I would estimate the overall length to be 90'-100'(feet), and the wing-span of the main wing to be 80'-90'(feet). The color was dark non-refective gray almost ceramic looking. This craft was moving very slowly towards the South East at around 8:30pm. I watched it for about 3 minutes then it faded out. App. 60 minutes later it came back from the South East on a North Western heading moving much faster but still silent. By this time the sky was dark and could clearly see lights on it. This craft was totally 'silent' and it had a delta (triangle shape) pattern of cream colored lights on the front half of the craft, with duller, dimmer cream colored lights on the tips of the main wing. I had seen this craft once before after dark from the side and i could tell that the front delta pattern of lights were slightly lower and a little brighter than the others.

This could not of been 5 planes they were far too close to each other........ Last night my husband and I came home from the garage, we were getting out the car, when my husband said what is that, I said what, he replied look up there, As I looked up there were 2 strange shapes, on seeing this I ran inside grabbed the binoculars and shouted my daughter to come and see, we were all stood on the front watching and taking photo's, the shapes were extremely bright and looked like stars, that were very orange in colour, only they were most definately far to big, they all came over from the same direction and moved over the houses towards ourselves, then one stopped quite close, almost hovering above a friends house, with this my daughter and myself run up the road to get more pictures, on doing this we noticed that they didnt all appear as the same shape. Though they all had an orange glow, they also had a dark casted circular appearance around the outside of the shape......... As we zoomed in to see them, one looked more of an egg shape where as another seemed more of a boomerang shape as daft as it sounds, we were zooming in when all of a sudden the light just disappeared, so we ran a little further up the road in order to get closer to the next one as we stood there my daughter spotted another was moving towards us from the far left at the end of the street, at this point we couldnt beleive what we were seeing, having no explanation for this we were obviously quite excited, then another appeared....... They all seemed to be following the others ones previous path, they would get so far up the street, only then they stopped and seemed to turn back and upwards a little,before they stopped again, this could not of been planes of that we are all very sure as they werent that far apart from each other and it was like they were hovering in motion, it was a very calm night, yet there was no engine noise or even propeller sounds, no humming etc in fact nothing at all, seriously it was very silent, the air was echoey, yet to look at they seemed so close, they were very bright to look at beautiful even, until eventually one by one the lights just dissapeared as you would expect if a light was simply switched straight off..... Now on saying that 3 of them actually appeared to be pulsing lights at one point so im not sure if the others did the same before hand, during this time there were also neighbours that had come out onto the street because of all the fuss to see what on earth we were doing only when we pointed it out they were bewilderedand also stopped dead in there tracks, they stood with us watching and taking pictures, one even climbed up onto a wall to get a better look, everyone was very loud and excited by what they saw because it was so unexpected, I mean you hear about it but as the saying goes, you never expect it to happen to you!!!!  I swear to you all now this is the truth with not a word of deception, none of us have any explanation for what we saw and even after there dissapearence we sat in the freezing cold on the wall just waiting to see if anything else happened, though to our dissapoinment it never did, we have all discussed it and firmly beleive between us, that they had to be a type of U.F.O, as none of us have encountered anything even remarkably similar ever and we are all of different ages ranging between 18-50, we would like an explanation if possible but on saying that it has left us all even my very sceptical husband beleiving that aliens or another life form of some type definately does exist for sure...We will be keeping a close watch from now on!!!!",2009-01-10T00:00:00,,

I went and got my rather small but good binoculars to reexamine the light. The red and blue lights were more pronounced and you could see how the red and blue lights seemed to move through one another unlike lights that would go on an off next to each other. The activity varies from minimal to very active some times going completely white for a split second then back to the colors. It stays in the sky at the same spot like a star from about 7:15 PM until about 7:50 where it follows the curve of the earth and disappears with the horizon (at least it did last night). As I am writing this at 7:34 PM, I walked back outside to see it again and it is now gone. I started writing the report five minutes ago and it was too high in the sky to go below the horizon that quick. Damn I knew I should have continued to watch it instead of writing this report. For those who are interested watch tomorrow night and see if it comes back. Let me know and respond on this website.

Large circular steady intense light and smaller less intense mobile companion light.,Lubbock,TX,2009-10-17T19:30:00,circle,2 minutes,"Occurred : 10/17/2009 19:30  (Entered as : 10/17/09 19:30) Reported: 10/17/2009 7:30:26 PM 19:30 Posted: 12/12/2009 Location: Lubbock, TX Shape: Circle Duration:2 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/072/S72890.html,"Large circular steady intense light and smaller less intense mobile companion light. From a location of appx +33 degrees 35' 9.14"" and -101 degrees 51' 49.89"" an object was seen at an angle of 25 to 30 degrees from horizon. If the center of a clock were our location, and 12 O'clock was dead north, the object was north northwest in appx the 11 O'clock direction. The object was quite large for a distant object, roughly 4mm of size in appearance and circular. Incredibly bright and white, it was more intense in brightness than the intensity of the streetlamps on the street below. It gave off no amount of light to the ground or area, the idea is simply to describe the relative brightness and intensity of the light. The object appeared to be at a great distance, and was no more than white light. There was no way to determine any sort of object detail with the amount of distance, but the size and brightness was utterly striking. It was holding dead still relative to a building's roofline below it (simply used to reference). It initially appeared to be an incredibly large and bright star to the observers, however it then began acting very strangely. While continuing its perfectly dead hold, a small light resembling the size and intensity of an aircraft warning light (viewed at great distance), left it. The smaller light exited perfectly from the center and bottom of the large light and had appx 1/2 the intensity of brightness and only a small dot of size, much smaller than the first object. This small light moved slowly and perfectly downward with zero flashing from either object and perfectly steady light and movement (no stuttering or jumping). It had the appearance of a falling flare on a parachute in descent speed, however over the 10 or so seconds of fall there was zero lateral movement. From the original object to its lowest point, the distance was likely 2 or 3 degrees between objects. The smaller light then stopped perfectly still and hung dead still. The total journey down lasted appx 10 - 15 seconds of travel time. The object then hung for 5 - 10 seconds dead still below the first one. At this point the upper object became very slowly less intense, until it reached appx 1/2 original brightness. This made the two objects the same intensity at this point. The small lower object then began to traverse upwards and to the right slightly at the same rate it had used on the descent but now at a relative diagonal. Eventually it passed the original large object on the right by appx 1/2 of a degree and continued until it reached appx 1/2 to 1 degree of distance upwards and to the right of the original object. Using the clock analogy again, with the larger object at the center of the clock, the smaller object was located at appx the 1 o'clock position. During this ascent the large original object began again another very gradual fade and size shift until it was smaller in appearance and eventually equal in appearance to the smaller second object. Eventually the original object became so dim and small that it was unable to be seen at all. The second object remained visible and dead steady for appx another 5 - 10 seconds before it too dimmed slowly until disappearance.  The entire encounter lasted likely 1 or 2 minutes total. The objects were both white light and circular / dot like. No defining shape or features could be seen. No flashing. No flickering. No trails or tails. No other movement in any directions or traversing of the sky in even the most minute amount unless otherwise described above. Zero chance of confusion with aircraft. Only possibilities could be orbital objects. Researched ""Iridium flare"" objects, wrong coloration, intensity, and timing entirely. Smaller secondary object is utterly confounding in movements. Cannot explain the utter lack of movement for larger object. Appeared almost perfectly like a star expect for extreme intensity and size.

I observed the object fixed in the sky. There was no sound or movement which is what struck me the most. It was a blue color that did shine very bright the starts had not yet appeared in the sky so I could dismiss that very quickly. I stared at the object for many moments till I finally had to leave to go fill a rx for my son.  I ended up at the pharmacy with the object in sight the whole time while at the pharmacy I allowed my wife to go fill it for me so I could watch this object. Moments later the light seemed to have released a 2nd light from the initial craft that was much smaller than the first. It seemed to be lowering it down from the primary craft. It was also glowing but more so a clear light. Then off in the distance I noticed a plane moving toward the object. Then glanced back to the ufo and both lights began to dim until they were no longer visible to the eye.  Local news would have us beleive this to be a weather baloon but it did not move at all or change its position and this does not explain the 2nd object I viewed either. there were many photos taken and many eye witnesses to this event including the ones I named along with my supervisor and co-workers.

On the night of October 17th, 2009 my girl friend and I stepped outside to light the pumpkins we had carved.  We sat admiring our work while we both smoked a cigarette.  I was talking to her and looking up at the stars as it was a beautiful clear crisp night.  I noticed a brightly lit object approaching at high speed from the north.  I kept looking trying to figure out what it was.  At first it kind of looked like a big white bird gliding through the air with light from below reflecting off of it.  As it got closer I realized that it was not a bird.  I immediately told my girlfriend to look and she spotted it right away. We both watched it fly from north to south at a very high rate of speed. It was a bright white light, kind of chevron shaped. At times it kind of looked like 2 chevron shapes but the whole time as only one unit.  As it headed south it took a slight, but very noticeable, left turn to the southeast and then a right turn back to the south.  It ! was hard to judge the altitude of the craft but it looked to be maybe 10,000 feet or higher.  I have seen many satellites during my career as a pilot and for sure this was not a satellite, it was low and moved across the horizon much faster than an orbiting object.  Also, the object was very visible and large with a distinctive shape, not just a star size as a satellite appears.  The speed was definitely super sonic/hyper sonic.  I saw it the whole time from a small light to the north until it disappeared out of sight to the south.  The whole incident lasted maybe 10 to 12 seconds so it was moving fast!   There was absolutely no sound at all, I listened very close for a couple minutes after it had passed for any sort of sound trailing behind it and there was none.  The exact time was 9:41pm. As I mentioned, I am a professional pilot.  I am a pretty good judge of speed and altitude.  In my opinion this was not a military aircraft as it was traveling much too fast, was brightly lit and there was no trailing sound.  I’m pretty sure military aircraft, unlike civilian aircraft, are allowed to travel supersonic speeds over the continental US; however, this was at lower altitude and over a major metro area.   I know there is an air force base in central Missouri and if someone were to check I’m sure that supersonic speeds are not allowed in the area.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

About 200 feet up (from what I can estimate) a yellow circle appeared. It was somewhat fuzzy and opaque. When I say appear I mean it slowly materialized, at first, transparent, then getting more solid-like. It also seemed to be flat, so it wasn't a sphere, I don't think. From the middle of this yellow circle a small craft appeared. One moment there was just a yellow circle. The next, the craft was there. It was circle shaped since it was against the yellow circle I couldn't make out many details other than that it was dark in color. The yellow circle then began to fade again just as it had appeared. Growing more transparent aside from more solid. As the yellow circle was fading the small craft began lighting up. I didn't have my glasses so I can only surmise at a few lights that lit up along it. The craft then accelerated suddenly and flew south. It made no noise to accelerate and no noise while in flight. Also, no visible means of flying (no engine exhaust, etc).

As I approached the washing line, by shear chance I noticed 2 faint halos in the sky, which for a second I thought was just a halo/or blur around a star or light. There was a large circular (not oval) halo with a smaller circular halo within the larger one. The 2 halos were extremely faint and I had to focus very hard to see them. At this point, scared to bits, I ran inside the house to call my brother to see this – just in case I was going crazy or seeing things. When we came outside again the halos had moved somewhat, and my brother too had to focus very hard to see them. I ran inside again to call my girlfriend, (who was in the bedroom on the other side of the house), and when we came outside for the third time the Halo’s had moved again and after about seven seconds it was not visible anymore. I don’t know what I saw, but the 2 circles that I saw were invisible, i.e.: you could see the sky and stars inside/behind the 2 halo’s, whatever it was it was invisible or transparent. It is only due to the faint rings/halo’s around the 2 circles that I was able to see it. It also appeared to be nearby i.e.: it wasn’t in the distant atmosphere, or in space as such, like the stars. It seemed quite nearby. However I’m not sure about the distance as it’s quite deceiving at night. I did not take any pictures or recordings, but they would not have been visible on camera anyways.

After a few seconds the light slowed down considerably and then grew very bright. Once the light's brightness reached its peak, the light started moving up at a 45-55 degree angle and then the light started to dim and after a few more seconds, the light disappeared completely. I told my friend who I was on the phone with what I saw and that I couldnt believe it! Anyway, that was what happened. It was odd to say the least! And I must mention, that when it happened, it was still very light outside! There were only the two brightest stars visible in the sky. And the light that I saw was very bright and then just disappeared!  It was truly bizarre!",2009-08-05T00:00:00,48.9566,-122.4325

Something shiny reflecting the sunlight caught my eye above the trees. There were three, boomerang shaped objects hovering right above the tree tops making no sound. They were larger than the size of a motorcycle but smaller than the size of an SUV. They were chrome silver in color, very shiny - unlike anything I have ever seen. I lost them over the tree tops. The traffic light changed and I had to turn onto the parkway to keep traffic moving. There were a lot of other cars on the road, this was during rush hour in broad daylight. There was not a cloud in the sky, it was beautiful weather conditions. I dismissed it thinking I may have been hallucinating since I couldn't make sense of it and they had disappeared... My Cell phone rang as I was driving and it was my mother.  I told her what I saw and she started asking me questions.  By this time I had pulled up to the light to get onto the very busy HWY 280.  I was in the turn lane to go NW onto HWY 280.  I was facing North and still on the phone with my mother looking up in the sky trying to see if I could find the objects again.  Sure enough they had made a circle from where I had originally spotted them and were flying over HWY 280 going in the same circular direction I had spotted them going in the first time only this time they were at a much higher altitude.  I told my mom I had to go b/c I was going to report this to 911 since this sighting was close to the eighth anniversary of September 11th and I didn't want to take the chance of it being some kind of terrorist surveillance or something of the sort. The light changed and I started to move away from the objects.  I pulled over into a parking lot and had my digital camera in my purse.  I pulled it out and got out of the car and waited for them to circle again.  They did return in the same flight path that I had seen them twice before but they were flying at an even higher altitude than they were the second time.  I tried to snap a picture but they were too far away from me at this point. I waited for them to circle around again but they disappeared.  I called 911 and the operator said she was getting similar reports and she was sending a sheriff's deputy to check it out.  I gave the operator my information and got back into my car and waited for them to fly over again.  Every single time i saw them they were flying in a V formation.  They were all the same size and color, hovering with no sound and could take off at speeds so fast that they seemed to disappear.  I watched them fly over the same restaurant but this time instead of continuing the circular flight path I had watched them make before they turned and flew NW over HWY 280 following the Westbound traffic.  They were flying lower than airplanes but higher than the tree line.  This time they disappeared but it wasn't like they took off it was as if they were invisible, they were there one minute and then the next they were not.  I didn't see them take off at a higher speed I just watched them disappear into thin air, it was as if they could make themselves invisible. I called my younger brother since he had a sighting near this area a few years before on a fishing trip to see if the shapes of the object were the same.  Mine were different in that they weren't completed triangles, they were shaped like boomerangs and were smaller in size than the object he saw.  He saw his at night and mine were in broad daylight and made no sound.  I didn't know who to report them to so I wrote down my experience and I found this website and I'm reporting it for the first time in writing.  I still don't have an explanation for what I saw that day and I wonder if I ever will.  (These directions are approximate since I didn't have a map or a compass at the time of the sighting).

We were going out to photograph, at night, blindly shooting down into gulleys  and streams, hollows and deep inside walled areas of trees.  Our hope was too catch animals off guard and maybe get interesting pictures. I was using a flash, on each and shot over a hundred pictures that night. We left at 8,30   Throughout  the entire evening,  we felt only that a calming ride in the country had occurred with possibly some good pictures . Pictures we'd view in the morning  on the computer. The next morning when I looked through them enlarging them on  photo gallery, I saw the two pictures and a few others.  I'm sending. 4 that night that I had no memory,, of taking. We had no memory at all of anything seen in the images, the craft, or the thing in front of the car.    No memory of being stopped.    We returned on the next night thinking something cool had happened seeing a UFO and  thought since we were unharmed it would be safe to return.  The next night we went we had similar results, a few more pictures that were strange even more frightening because of the activity in front of our car that could not be made out clearly. We were  slightly worried but more curious about the ship we had seen twice in the pictures. and after a few more days thought again it might be safe, so we returned with tape recorders in the car. And the things on the tapes were muffled but a few areas crystal clear,  one of these was our talking on the tape, and then the car stopping suddenly, the doors came open and my wife was drug out with a whimper, and the sound of me struggling in my seat unable to speak went on for some time, possibly 10 seconds, there was a humming sound in two short bursts, and I was heard struggling no longer, in fact neither of us  were heard. There is a point where a voice makes a sexual reference, one sentence,,  and then that yea their dumb.  Afterward, some time later( yea there almost ready. )  the sounds of  arranging equipment? Like picking up stuff , closing a container, etc. Within the next minute we start the car, pull away driving again, and resume the conversation we had been having before the incident. We returned home, ready for sleep, having no idea anything had occurred.  We had by mid-night the beginning of severe abdominal pain and rectal pain as well, identical. These conditions lasted for the better part of three days.  This and the things found on the tape made it clear what  had possibly  taken place . Again photos were in the large set ,of only a odd shaped vehicle outside the car stirring up dust.  Its strange sound on the tape.  There were other things said so disturbing to us, I destroyed the tapes.  The photos I'm sending are the clearest free of dust flakes that made the others unidentifiable.  We experienced a time loss of roughly an hour two times at least. During a recent  hospital trip a small round polished bead the size of a BB, the airgun ammo, was seen in my sinus cavity in a  x-ray.

Jack scott    Here a copy of somebody who saw the same thing of me 10 minutes after over the Miami airport.    At approximately 8:15PM on 9/28/09 I walked out and as usual I looked up into the evening sky.  I observed a very bright light in the northeastern sky moving in a southerly direction. What made this unusual was the fact of how bright the light was. My first impression that is was an aircraft, since I live about 6 miles from the Miami International Airport. The best description of intensity of the light that I can describe is that of Venus in the night sky.  As I looked at it more closely, I could see no navigational markers (red, green or flashing strobe) visible. During the duration of the sighting I heard no noise from the object.  The speed of the object was that of a jet flying at altitude, but the altitude was much lower, maybe 10000 ft (but that is just a guess since it was difficult to determine since it was dark).  Living as close to the airport as I do, I am familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft. This object appeared to fly directly over Miami International Airport which is unusual again based on the objects apparent altitude. Another oddity observed was during the sighting no aircraft were visible either landing or taking off.  The object continued on its southerly course and made a turn to the east. Even when it made its turn the intensity of the light remained constant. IF it had been an aircraft I would have noticed its national markers. One other note was as I watched it make its easterly turn; I noticed an aircraft to the southeast and its navigational beacons where quite visible. Once it made its turn, I moved to follow the object but lost it between tress and other houses.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,26.136914681280647,-80.21914075569657

Need clarification. December 23, 2001    To whom it may concern,   On or about October 5, 2009 I was outside at night and became interested in taking a photo of the moon through some over-hanging trees. The moon was full or nearly so, the sky was a bit misty, and it looked like it would make an interesting shot. There was a very dim incandescent yellow light behind me. I was shooting with a digital camera and had the flash off. The camera was set on auto-focus. Because it was dark I couldn’t be certain I had correct focus, and the camera was hand-held so I couldn’t be certain I was holding it still enough to preclude blurring. I took 6 or 7 shots right in a row, over the course of about a minute, without changing position. I did change the zoom a bit with each shot, blindly attempting to bracket the shots in hopes of getting at least one crisp, focused, and non-blurred image of the leaves. Sometime later I viewed the pictures on my computer. Only then did I discover that one of the images had a blue orb in it. I did not notice the object while taking the pictures.  I was using the LCD monitor at arms’ length for composition; the camera is otherwise a viewfinder that’s difficult to use, especially at low light levels. I haven’t assumed it was a UFO or a “physical” object. But I am no less curious about it, and wonder if I can have the picture analyzed. I thought perhaps it was a refraction within the lens. But, again, this orb appears in just one picture and not the others despite the fact all were shot at the same time under exactly the same conditions. When enlarging the image on my computer there doesn’t seem to be a clear indication that it is the result of refraction. Further, at maximum enlargement, the blue orb seems to have structural depth, though this might be pixel positioning or pixel structure. Considering the potential, however slight, for actual structural depth, coupled with a little imaginative assumption, I thought it might be a disc traveling perpendicular to the ground. The object is round, powder blue, and looks like a ball. It looks much like a planet might look if observed through a powerful telescope. I was shooting more or less straight up and overhead while facing roughly ESE. I haven’t altered or otherwise fiddled with this image. You’ll notice that there are “holes” in the image, areas where my camera media-card is losing pixels. I was tempted to “fix” these, but decided against it to preserve the image “exactly as it was taken”. I am e-mailing the picture to you too. Not knowing your parameters I’ll send two copies, one at the original size and the other reduced to “e-mail sizing”. Thank you",2010-02-14T00:00:00,26.70504529494382,-80.13514009831461

As I looked up the two objects seemed to be about the width of 2 fingers apart and moving west at an angle of maybe 25 degrees.  No blinking lights, no sounds.  As they passed what would be an imaginary line dividing the S/E and S/W sky, one seemd to move either upward or south and I lost sight of it, while at the same time watching the second one, which seemed to linger in a slow change of direction and began moving in a pretty much straight line toward the northeastern sky.  I followed its trajectory until somewhere high in the N/E I lost it.  As I turned to look back south, I saw 2 more, similar objects, same direction of travel initially as the first pair.  This time, the lower object continued toward the west, I believe I saw it looking sort of reddish, I kept looking back and forth between the two, then lost sight of the one headed west.  .  I looked back and saw the top one now turn also toward the N/E direction and followed the same trajectory as the one other one from the firts pair.  I thought that was strange movement for what I thought at first might be helium balloons from a party maybe.  But the night was still, the leaves on the trees around me were not really moving, unless there might have been some high winds way up in the sky.  But it they were balloons and there was wind that blew them from the S/W to the N/E, why didn't BOTH objects get blown N/E?   How could one go west and another sout! h up jus t upward?  So I don't think they were balloons, and they didn't look like nor behave like airplanes that I know.  Anyway, I saw a THIRD pair coming from the same S/E area, same trajectory as the other two pairs, but this pair did not go as far west as the first two pairs.  This third pair seemed to separate almost due south from my vantage point, not disappeared form sight maybe going further south or just ""up"" and the other took the SAME trajectory as the other 2 going N/E.  Finally I saw ONE SINGLE object coming again from the same S/E location, went twestward o about due south from me, turned and travelled toward the same N/E direction as the other three.  That made FOUIR going N/E, ONE went west and TWO went either south of me or just ""up.""   I think I can rule out party balloons and I think I can rule out airplanes because airplanes would need a wider area to change directions like these did.  What else they could have been I don't know.  I just did not see any details on the objects, such as lights, lines, windows, etc. - just a roundis;h-looking object.  By the way, these were not moving slowly like a balloon might be, and as they travelled N/E they seemed propelled and not just blowing in the wind!  If this is what an UFO does then I saw 7 of them.  If not, who knows what they were!   But they WERE!",2009-03-19T00:00:00,33.9356347266881,-118.13377170418008

I then spotted Venus off to the right and lower in the sky than the object in question. I then went into the house to get my binoculars to have a closer look. After retrieving my binoculars, I looked again and the object began to emit what appeared to be flare-like objects which were the same color as the object and they drifted downward, appearing to be affected by gravity but had some velocity to them as well. I could not resolve the object any better with my binoculars than I could with the naked eye. I could not see any detail besides the color which was an orange-red. Finally the object began to wane and then it would come back brighter then wane again. Finally it disappeared altogether. During the episode, the object did not appear to move across the sky, but remained stationary. A neighbor saw it as did my daughter-in-law. The neighbor said he saw it change position in the sky but did not think it to be an aircraft as it moved very slowly. When I first saw it, I thought it was Venus. Then I thought it might be a distant star undergoing some sort of change but when the flare-like objects started to emit from it I was reminded of a combat aircraft dropping flares to avoid heat-seeking missiles. However, there were only about six flare-like objects released from the main body of the object, and they were not brighter but rather they were the same color and brightness as the main object. There were no flashing lights or different color lights. The only change in appearance that I witnessed was the eventual fading of the object and the reappearance of the object only to fade again and finally disappear for good.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,38.34323901098901,-122.70405054945056

I recall objects very similiar to these at that time.  I was at the very northern tip of North Center Lake in Lindstrom, MN, watching a 2+ hr fireworks display.  There were approx. 200-300 people that observed the very same thing as there were 100+ people with me on the beach and 60+ large boats in the bay.  These objects were peculiar at first when we all saw them rising from the treeline straight south of us and I recall people calling them UFOs and a few even got a little nervous until them floated a couple hundred yards off to the west of us. You could visibly see outlines of the objects. They were Chinese paper lanterns... a lot of them, 10-12 sounds about right.  They were following the same line of flight and were spaced out about a minute apart (that was the time in between sightings as they rose out of the treeline.)  This sighting was out of Excelsior, which is 60 miles straight southwest of Lindstrom. EXCELSIOR, MINNESOTA, FRIDAY, JULY 04, 2008, at 22:35 hrs. (CDT)  A gentleman telephoned NUFORC on July 05th, 2008, to apprise us of a sighting that occurred near Minneapolis, MN, shortly after the local fireworks display.  He reported that many people witnessed the event, and that it was quite dramatic in appearance.  The witness is an airline pilot, with considerable experience, and he is a skilled amateur astronomer.  If anyone else witnessed this display of lights, we would welcome additional reports.  Full Report ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  The report above may have merit, but we would be a bit surprised if the airline pilot, who first reported the phenomenon, could not distinguish pyrotechnic lanterns from something more dramatic.

It was at about a 70 degree angle at about 11 o'clock or slightly to the left. I was up on a hill overlooking a small flood plain and watched it until it crossed over the horizon passing through the first hint of dawn. I would have reported this sooner but mistakenly thought that I had found an explanation. Since it went on a straight path and did none of the spectacular maneuvers UFOs are famous for I thought it might be an unusually bright satellite. Research showed that a certain kind could be as bright as Venus and decided that that was the most likely explanation. I have, however, since read that this type, the name of which presently escapes me, will only briefly appear that large and that it will quickly resume appearing the size of a normal satellite once it flashes. Since this one retained is brightness and size for the duration I think I may well have spotted a genuine UFO. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Unfortunatley, I never thought of reporting it til now, but this is how it went. It happned around mid september 2008 in San antonio Tx, on the Southeast side.  Me and my friends ((male name #1 deleted)) and ((male name #2 deleted)) were walking we were about a little past ((female name deleted)) coming down Schley going the west when Nathan told us to look in the sky,I didnt see it at first until my friend nathan pointed it out, but when I did I was like ""What the hell is that!!!""   The thing seemed to be about a mile away and it didnt seem to do much but move real slow.  But let me tell you, I watch the History channel and seen about stealth but damn this was like nothing I've ever seen.  The thing would kinda glow on and off to where when it would glow, there were about 20, what I guess could be called bulbs, floating in a triangular formation that would turn white, but then it turned transparent. It continued to do this at about a rate of 1 pulse every 2 seconds, fading white then gone, white then gone, non stop. The thing moved real slow and kinda, came towards our way as we were walking. The whole time I was freaking out to seeing something like that. At one point I tried to take a picture but my camera phone wasnt able to zoom that far or even make it out at all. So we continued looking at it until it went behind some trees and we couldnt see it anymore. Just for the refrence,  This thing was not a plane, It was not birds, or a meteroite or any natural occurance for that matter. It was something beyond my undertanding. I've never seen a plane fly that slow either, it just cant be done... I've seen planes all my childhood when my dad worked on them. This was not a plane! And I've never seen a bird change colors before. We know what we saw and I will put it on everything to stand by it. But what could this possibly mean?  Are they here to observe us?

On Saturday, 2nd August 2008, my wife and I drove from home in Idaho to Oregon City to visit with my sister and brother-in-law. My sister has a trailer for camping and when we go to visit, the trailer parked beside the house, becomes our bedroom. We went to bed and after a while I began having some sinus problems and got up to work on the problem. I decided it was time for some fresh air and stepped outside and was soon joined by my wife checking to see if I was ok. From the front door of the trailer we could see some stars but decided to move to the west end of the trailer where the view was better. Clear starry night, some light pollution since we were in a city, but because it was 1:30am all was quiet and the stars were plentiful. We saw an airplane off in the distance traveling northwest with the navigational strobe lights flashing and it soon ranged out of sight. Then we saw another airplane approaching from the south with headlights on as planes do for night landings, and the Portland airport was about 16 miles due north. At first I had a feeling that the airplane was not quite ""right"" but did not think too much about it. As we watched it approach closer to us from the south, I thought ""those landing lights are really bright."" Indeed, single lights could not be seen but the whole front of the plane facing us was lit up with very intense beams. As the plane moved through the sky it was eclipsing stars--as it came between us and a star the star of course would vanish, it then reappeared as the plane moved on. Then it happened. The very bright lights of the plane, in two second steps, began fading. Fade, fade, fade...step at a time until no lights were on.  All this while, and this was most interesting, the plane slowed to a stop.  When we first saw it the plane was at about a 15º angle above level and now it was nearly 60º above level and very close.  I estimated it was a thick tapezoid hovering less than 4 miles away over the Willamette River.  Even though the bright lights were out, a faded outline could be seen for more than a minute.  Once the headlights were completely out, we saw that there were no navigation lights flashing.  The plane had mostly vanished from the sky, at least no bright lights to say it was there.  Also, no stars were being eclipsed in any direction from where it stopped and turned off the lights.  About a minute after the lights were completely out, there was a quick small flash, smaller than the outline area of the plane, and then it actually vanished.  Actually vanished because the starlight it blocked now shown through and no star eclipses were in any direction from that point.  If my guess on distance is accurate, then the craft would have been at least 200 feet across.  Plane? I don't think so.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,45.3573,-122.60679999999999

We were enjoying an evening of surf fishing, but not catching much of anything.  The weather was warm, and the sky was mostly clear with only a few thin, sparse, low lying clouds, and a full moon.  Standing on Holden Beach, NC looking at the ocean you are facing south.  We saw the light to our left a bit, in a south easterly direction.  I estimate it to have been approximately 25 or 30 degrees above the horizon, and most definitely over the ocean.  I did not notice the time when we saw it, but I estimate it to be sometime between 9:30 and 10:30 pm. What we saw that night was a huge, sort of light-orange, maybe even amber light.  It was not a perfect circle, but rather it was a kind of very soft, square shape with long, sweeping, rounded corners.  The first time I saw it, it appeared for only a few seconds, then faded out.  I asked my sons if they saw it, but they did not.  I told them what I saw and where I saw it, and, of course, they got a kick out of picking on the old man for “seeing things”.  After what seemed to be about 4 or 5 minutes it appeared again, for only a few seconds before fading out again.  We all three saw it this time, and the next two times that followed.  After about 8 or 10 minutes it appeared again, and again for only a few seconds before fading out for about 15 or 20 minutes.  It reappeared once more for a few seconds, faded out one last time, and that was the last time we saw it. The light maintained the same altitude and exact location in the sky during the entire observation.  I used the end of channel marker light from the Lockwood Folly Inlet, and the Oak Island Light House Beacon as my landmarks for pinpointing the light.  At first I questioned whether it was possibly a ships flare, but there is no way it could have been.  It was too high, too big, and did not fluctuate at all in its position or attitude. I did some research before deciding to file this report.  I know we saw it, and I know it was not an airplane, helicopter, blimp, or anything else I have ever seen in my life time.

I just got home from going to the store and was getting out of my car when I saw a flash of light in the sky.  When I looked up I saw it was the sun reflecting off of an object.  I wasn't sure what it was so I watched it to see if it was a plane or something else.  The light only reflected of it for a few more seconds then I could see it long, and cylindrical.  It was kind of grayish in color and appeared to be moving kind of slow for a plane.  It was moving from the southwest to the northeast.   Just to the northwest of the object I could see a jet flying higher and faster in the opposite direction.  I could hear no sound from either one and could see no exhaust trail from the object but I could see one from the jet. As the object moved closer and more in front of me I could see there were no visible wings.  It was low enough that if there were any wings they should have been at least somewhat visible.  At this time I went in the house to get my wife to look at it and when I came back outside I couldn't see it anymore.  I took my groceries in and came back out and it was back but appeared to be farther away but I could still see it pretty good and then my wife got a look at it too and agreed that it didn't look like any plane that she had seen before.  We continued to watch it until it disappeared in the distance.   As it got farther away it looked like it was descending but that could've been because of the angle it was moving away at.  As it disappeared there was another jet was coming from north of where I last saw the object.  Both jets were also military type jets, in this area were rarely see any commercial jets as the nearest major airport is 100 miles away in Memphis, TN. I've never seen a ufo before but have always been interested in them and believe they exist, but I'm very objective when I look at things and if I had the slightest feeling that this was a plane I would never report it.  I'm 43 and this is the first time I can honestly say that I saw something in the sky that I couldn't explain. I'm not saying that it was aliens because it probably wasn't but I know it wasn't a plane, helicopter, blimp or anything like that.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,36.2357,-90.0421

We were sitting on the front uncovered porch and my friend was all... ""Look at that ((obscenity deleted))""  The first one was bright and the same size as a star and moved in one direction from north to south in the eastern sky.  I figured it may have been a satellite but then we saw another moving in the same direction. and another.  Then the forth one faded in from a different direction and then changed course.  When it changed course i knew right then and there it was not a satellite or the space station or space junk.  The fifth object seen we thought it was simply two of the lights moving together at the same speed and then we realized it was one HUGE object!  How we came to that conclusion is when both the lights came to pass a star the star vanished for about a second. then it came back.  this object was moving slowly as well. It simply looks like 2 stars moving from the west to the east.  Then all of the sudden it abruptly changed course to go north.  This is the most active night i have ever seen besides the lights over Phoenix Arizona incident a few years back that the government said was flares. Something that large should have made a lot of noise for how close it appeared.  But then i guessed it must be so far away.  The rest of our time we viewed a few more single star like objects move across the sky and some of them changed course.  One of them was red in color.  The last object observed was very large and at first i thought it might be a huge b-1 bomber or something flying low. the only problem with that is the speed it was moving (Fast) and no noise as well as strange lights.  one white light left one white light right and one red light in the center with an occasional bright red burst emitted from the back red light. (Blinking (Bursts) but not like a plane in succession). The object seemed to show a double image of itself on top like a mirror. WEIRD! For me to see what we saw tonight makes me so angry that the government would cover up something so huge! It is so obvious if people would simply get out from in front of there t.v's and watch the sky for them selves. I just can't understand why i couldn't see any additional detail.

UFO September 25 / 2008  I walked down to my garage at around 10 and 11:00 pm on September the 25, it was a Thursday night. I was putting my cat in the garage, but before I did that, I walked out to my gate and was looking at the western sky. It was a dry warm night, there were stars out and a few airplanes in the sky. There is nothing but a field, where I walked down to my garage at around 10:00 pm. The incident took place between re I was gazing; I live in the country. As I was looking out into the field, I saw an object in the sky, a little above tree-height - flashing colors. It was an object that seemed to flash colors as it looked to be turning. Or it looked like it was turning or spinning. The lights emanating from the object were different colors - pink, blue green; pastel colors. The object was completely silent, I couldn't really make out the shape of the UFO. I went to get my film camera and my video camera. When I came back it was gone, I was disappointed.  I took my cat into the garage, and when I came out of the garage I walked over to the shop, which is a couple of feet away; and for some reason, I looked down at the ground, looking at the bushes. All of a sudden I looked up and there it was! Staring right at me. It was at tree-top height directly across from me, in front of a house, across the road. The field I was looking at, before, is right alongside this house. The UFO appeared totally different now. It was circular, and of a star-like color, only a little warmer (color). It was white. It hovered for a minute or so while I picked up my cameras and took pictures. When I aimed my film camera, I couldn't see anything in the lens, but took the picture anyway. I got my video camera up and shot that too.  After I took my photos the object, which was completely silent, then started to drop down from the sky toward the ground. It was descending to the ground, I thought. I walked over to the gate trying to get a look at it going down to the ground and where it would land, but when I got around the gate, it was gone. It must have gone behind the house as I couldn't see it anymore. I was wondering why it had disappeared on me, but in the morning I viewed the spot again, where it had descended, and it obviously had to have gone behind the house. It had been further away than I had thought. It must have dropped behind the house and landed somewhere in a field. This is all farmland here. That is, if it landed, of course.  I took my video film inside and put it on the tv to view. To my astonishment, I did get the UFO on video! It looked like it had five or more points on the object. It looked like it was spinning too. Then I got a white circular object and, a green circular object. Funny thing, the UFO that I saw on the video looked totally different than the one I saw with the naked eye (which was a circular white object at that point). While the circular green object, I didn't even see! It was like there were three objects out there, and my video camera picked up three UFO's. The flashing, turning UFO, the circular white UFO - plus, a green UFO. I thought that the flashing UFO probably traveled closer (across the field) and changed into a white circular UFO. ...But I don't know. The UFO's were in sequence, one right after the other on film, so I didn't see all of them at once. It could have been only one UFO changing form, though… Who knows?",2008-10-31T00:00:00,38.9312,-84.1063

On July 2, 2008 at 3:00PM after being informed of severe thunderstorms about to enter the southwest area of Greenville Michigan, I stepped outside with my Canon EOS 40D digital camera to catch some images of storm clouds and possibly some rotation from the approaching storm. I took several digital images of the storm clouds before being forced inside by the heavy rain and wind gusts from the storm. My only intensions were to capture digital images of the storm and nothing else. After the storm left the area, I took the CompactFlash card from my camera and inserted the card into my card reader in my computer. I downloaded the digital image files into Adobe Photoshop CS3 Bridge. I took the CompactFlash card out of the card reader and put the card back into my Canon EOS 40D camera and reformatted the CompactFlash card for storage of new digital images. On the afternoon of July 5, 2008, I started to review the digital images from the storm from the afternoon of July 2, 2008. As I started to enlarge each digital image file, I noticed an odd object that appeared on the right side of the trees across from the condos near my apartment. I enlarge the object trying to see if I could make out what the object was. I sat at my computer and stared at my LCD display in total disbelief. Then I started to check other digital images taken about the same time and I found another object near the storm clouds in another image file. I enlarged that one and found an object that appears to be coming out or going into one of the storm clouds. I had no intentions of trying to capture digital images of strange objects as my intent was only to try to capture interesting cloud formations to send into one of our local television stations in our area. These photos are 100% original and I did not altered these actual digital images in any way except for cropping and enlarging the images as I tried to determine what they actually were. I know this object is not a conventional aircraft as anyone around this area has observed before. I have my own impressions as what this object(s) appears to be but as of now, I will not divulge my thoughts to anyone until further study has been completed.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,43.20879999999999,-85.2665

It was at very low altitude and seemed about 2 or 3 miles away flying above the trees and straight across my path. I stared at it for maybe 2 seconds. It was a long slim cylinder of shiny metal with two colored sections-one red and one black each about 1/4 of the length of the craft. I saw no wings, tail section or engines but assumed this was due to looking from the side of the plane and maybe some subtle reflection of sunlight was hiding the tail. Also, since it is extremely common to see aircraft approaching nearby Raleigh/Durham International Airport, I had instantly dismissed it as an airliner and looked slightly away from it to maintain my lane position but glanced right back within about 1 second to confirm what type of plane it was. Within that one second it had vanished. I blinked my eyes repeatedly like people do in the movies... but due to the craft's low speed and relatively wide sighting area I had in front of me I would have had to look away for at least 5 or 6 seconds to miss it going behind trees and buildings in the distance.

I looked up and saw this blinking orange light in the sky at about 8pm.  I know that it wasn’t a light from an airplane because I've grown up looking at planes and know what their running and landing lights look like.  This light was a lot bigger than any you'd ever see on a plane and it was blinking at a lot slower pace than that of plane lights.  As a matter of fact at the same time I could see a plane off in the distance and was watching both things at once.  The blinking orange light seemed to be standing still while I could see the plane moving across the sky towards it.  I then ended up driving under where the light was and I could see that it was actually moving straight up.  At this point I thought it may be a rocket launched by NASA or something, but I checked NASA's launch schedule and their last launch had been on the 14th and wasn’t due back until the 30th.

It did not when it went past me.  I was approximately 3 linear miles from the town of Ionia, and the object appeared to have the halo around it when it was over the town.

As we stopped at a red light at the intersection of Hwy 80 and Hwy 280, my husband finally asked me if I could see the lights too and if I knew what they were.  At first these were seen through the trees and resembled street lights in the distance but as we sat at the red light I noticed these lights were actually moving at a slow pace. We continued East on Hwy 80 and tried to keep our eye on the lights as they became more in to view. Soon we noticed more and the few lights we were seeing were actually 9 or 10 so we were a little intrigued as to what would be flying over in this number, but then I was able to count about 19 or more. They were appeared large and seemed to be very high in the sky.  They changed direction from going North to moving East in front of us.  This acutally looked as though they just started moving sideways. We tried to keep up but kept getting stopped by red lights.  We then could only watch as they continued to get farther away.  At one point it appeared that there were more appearing from the atmosphere and looked to be almost dropping slowly.  At this time my children  began asking if these were meteors or something else falling from space. Once they got to the horizon, they seemed to disappear.  We tried to catch up a few minutes after they got away from us, but there was nothing at all in the sky.

On the evening of 19-Oct-2009 I was outside after dark testing a propane heater for winter camping use.  Time was approximately 2030 hours, CDT, US.  My attention was drawn to the clear night sky by the noise/flashing lights of what were obviously military jets, about a half dozen of them, very high up. Military jets are a common sight here, originating usually from a major Air Force base about 70 miles east of where I live.  Daytime flight training activity is pretty heavy usually.  However, nighttime military activity is rare, especially a half dozen jets that seemed to be canvasing many miles of the sky—they were visible essentially horizon to horizon, passing overhead and making broad, sweeping maneuvers. I was curious so I sat down and watched.  As I was watching one jet, going west to east, approximately 70 degrees from horizontal, a nearly linear pattern of amber-to-red lights appeared about 50 degrees from horizontal, south-southeast.  There were about a half dozen of them that rapidly ramped up in brightness (not instantaneous).  They were stationary and maintained a fixed pattern, no variation in relative position. The pattern was about thumb’s width at arm’s length. There was a slight warbling in intensity of most of these lights, similar to distant lights on a hot night-heat distortion.  It was a similar effect, but I’m not saying that is what it was because it was a chilly night.  After a few seconds of visibility the lights faded about half as fast as they had ramped up—about three seconds to completely black out.  They did not fade all at once, but in a random pattern.  Of course, there was no noise except from the distant jets.  About a minute later there were two or three individual lights that appeared, then disappeared, in about the same manner.  These were east-southeast at about 30 degrees from horizontal.  These were not all stationary while they were visible, and were visible only one at a time.  I ran inside, called my parents, and asked dad to walk outside (we live only about 30 yards apart), which he did and he later said he saw one of the lights.  I’m not sure he did.  From the direction he said he was looking he could not have seen what I was seeing east-southeast, but he could have be observing similar lights further to the west which I would not have seen because I was watching the east-southeast lights.  The canvasing activity of the jets continued for as long I was willing to watch, about 30 minutes.  From the video I have seen of the Phoenix Lights phenomenon, this event was quite similar in the way the lights ramped up, warbled in intensity, and faded out.  In fact, these could very well have been flares, which was the “official explanation” of the Phoenix event.  All I can say is if these were flares someone is damn good at placing a group of 6 and having them appear to be “tied together” on a structure or separate and holding a rock-solid pattern for several seconds.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,,

Me and my wife noticed two bright orange/white light’s flying maybe a ½ mile apart from each other coming into our direction, which would have been my 1 o’ clock position, and going rather slow, and flying maybe just below cloud level, I didn’t see wings on them, and I could not hear the sounds of an airplane or helicopter, and there were as many as a few hundred people who were present around me awaiting the show, so I grabbed my binoculars from my truck and started tracking the front (nearest) UFO and it appeared to be glowing, and I was having trouble determining the shape because there were no distinctive wings, there were no strobe lights normally seen on aircraft, and no noise, I heard a man about 70 feet behind me say “what the heck is that ?” I didn’t respond, I followed the front UFO for just a minute, and I turned my focus to the rear UFO and just after I focused in, the Glow disappeared but I was still tracking it in the sky as a shadow, my wife was viewing with the naked eye and could no longer see it , and I told her that I had a lock on it, I told her at this point “ this is definitely not an airplane, it’s a UFO “ it was going rather slow, and appeared to be slightly inverted in the shadow, by my best estimation it was round in shape, as it came across my view flying south parallel to main street. (State Route 101) It was more over top of my view because I was now looking through power line wires and was getting a better reference as far as speed and how high it was , my best guess on speed was around 50 or 60 mph because of my vantage point following it between the power lines in my binoculars, it took some time to cross each line and then it started going into some clouds and it was becoming more difficult to follow and at this point, I went to look with my naked eye and I lost track of it. I’ve seen various air traffic around the area before and after this, all were distinguishable airplane traffic, these other two objects were something completely different, And I would not be surprised if someone snapped a picture of this given the number people waiting for the fireworks looking at the sky directly over Clyde Ohio.

I got up in the early hours of the morning for a cigarette, and it was a clear sky, with a large cloud to the west. I was standing on the door step, and something caught my eye shooting past. I thought it was a bird flying low across the houses, and then maybe 3 or 4 seconds later i noticed a reflection in the sky, something going up into the atmosphere. I can still picture it exactly in my mind, and it seemed to shoot up and across the sky. The object i seen was definitely not an airplane or anything man-made, it had a circular/spherical form. and was only properly visible while the sun was reflecting off it. There were no chem-trails for the duration of the sighting (which rules out a jet, or fighter plane), although as it went ""up"" into the atmosphere, it left a blurring trail behind it which lasted for a couple of seconds, then disappearing from sight. The glow it gave off, maybe lights, or reflection from the sun gives me the solid impression it was metallic. I cannot think of anything man-made of which fly/moves/appears in this way. The path it took across the sky, was a straight line... at a very high speed. As it almost went behind the houses in the distance, it shot up, in an arching motion into the atmosphere. I cannot really tell what color it was, but i can say it was definitely metallic, and after browsing you-tube for similar footage to explain to my friend what i had seen. He mentioned seeing a similar metallic ball shoot across the sky a few weeks back. I hope this report may help towards any other possible sightings on that day, because i am still confused as to what i saw.

I looked up, and saw what I first thought was a low flying plane going through the clouds.  The reason for this is because there seemed to be a bright light with a ring around it, like a headlight looks going through the fog.  As it got closer, I realized it that the light looked more like a flame than a light.  It's hard to describe, but it was an orange light that seemed to change shapes as it went, and changed positions.  If you can imagine a small circle, it was almost like the light was going in a circular motion, but again, changing shapes like a flame.  The next thing I thought of was a hot air balloon, but again, it was going way too fast for a hot air balloon, but that is what it looked like.  Almost like a flame flying up inside a balloon.  This object was flying lower than the clouds that were out.  I literally watched it appear in the sky above the house next to me, and then walked to the side of my house to watch it continue as it disappeared behind the tree line, which is about a mile from my house.  I sit out on my patio many nights a week, and I have never seem anything like this before.  Like I said earlier, it almost appeared to be a hot air balloon from underneath, but again, traveling about the same speed I see planes flying after taking off my Nashville International Airport.  It also appeared to fly underneath another plane that was well up in the sky, I am guessing around 25,000 - 30,000 feet.  I'm not kidding, it literally flew directly underneath it.  If they were flying at the same altitude, they would have hit each other.  It appeared to fly at a level low enough, that if it were a regular single engine plane, I would have heard a noise, but I didn't hear a thing.  I was also listening to some music on my computer, turned down low so that it wouldn't have covered up any aircraft noise, and I never experienced any electrical probl! ems.  It flew on a straight path from east to west.  I didn't see anything coming out of it, or any light beams radiating from it at all.  I am guessing at the height it appeared to be at, which was around 5,000 feet, it traveled numerous miles in a matter of less than 30 seconds.  Not sure what else to say, other than I hope someone else saw the same thing.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,35.86454842975207,-86.40341190082644

I was camping out behind my house with my 4 year old. We live in Spartanburg county about 3 miles from the Greenville/Spartanburg Airport. We were hanging out playing video games until about 10:30pm when we decided to turn in for the night. As I was getting our blankets ready I looked up and through the mesh door of the tent which was facing to the west. Through the mesh I saw an incredibly bright red light of considerable size moving slowly over the treeline. My first thought was that it might be an airplane, but I have lived in this area my entire life and I literally see planes come and go every night. This was like nothing I had ever seen and I immediately knew that it was not a plane. I fumbled around in the dark for my video camera, unzipped the door of the tent and was able to start filming the object about 20-30 seconds after it originally caught my eye. At first the bright red object continued slowly moving South, but then unexpectedly a much smaller white light emerged from the top and went upward at a fairly rapid pace. When the light was a good 2x higher from the ground than the red light, the red light quickly disappeared. The white light continued to stay in view and continued to move southward at a speed of perhaps 3x faster than the red light was traveling. After a bit it flickered and disappeared. When the red one disappeared, it just blinked off like a switch was flipped, but the white one flickered and faded more subtly. I got the entire thing on tape, and the footage of the small object emerging from the larger object is quite good. My only regret is that I zoomed in to try to get a closer look, and some of the footage is rather jerky... serves me right for always making fun of people who don't seem to be able to hold a camera still while filming a UFO. Still though, it's pretty exciting video. Here's the link to the video on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II9G-kvdzh0  I was very excited to see this. I've kept my eyes open for stuff before when I'm looking at the stars, but this was completely out of the blue and entirely unexpected. Plus, I NEVER carry my video camera with me, so the fact that my camera on hand is still amazing to me. Skeptics may point out that: 1. this sighting took place very close to an airport 2. the sighting took place on July 3rd (fireworks)  Had I not seen the object myself for the duration that it was visible, and especially the emergence of the smaller white light, I too would have argued these as possibilities. However, the footage easily dismisses these arguments. It made no sound, and it moved unlike any fireworks I have ever seen. Especially the way the white light speeds up after separating from the red light. My 4 year old can be heard in the background trying to figure out what it was that we were seeing. No mention of ""fireworks"", but he did say ""maybe it's a rocket ship"". Whatever it was, it was a blast being able to see it and film it.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,34.921413615023475,-82.21619812206572

Of course, I say it is a UFO, not an alien because I believe it may possibly be able to be described.  I was not the first person to see it, but it was drawn to my attention within a minute of its appearance.  The night was semi-cloudy, and there was a haze from everyone shooting off fireworks.  There were few stars, and the moon was not a factor given the objects location.  It was probably somewhere between 1,500 and 3,000 feet off the ground, several miles west of Clinton, traveling south to north.  It appeared to put off its own light, and was roughly the color of fire.  My first thoughts were that it was a meteor that was starting to enter the atmosphere, however I quickly dropped that idea because it did not leave a tail, did not seem to be breaking apart, and was moving at a slow, steady pace at the same elevation.  It can only be described as a glowing ball.  It did not flash or change colors, and the brightness stayed roughly the same.  I do not believe it was a conventional aircraft.  I grew up in the area, and it is only about 30 miles from Whiteman AFB.  This was not a typical flight path for the aircraft from that base, and it was too low to be a commercial jet.  It is possible it was a helicopter from an odd angle, but again, the speed and color make that highly unlikely.  The object was moving probably somewhere around 150-300 miles per hour, as it was in the normal speeds of aircraft that I have seen.  I was mostly writing because I was hoping that someone else had witnessed this as well and would be able to explain what my entire family saw.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,38.3859,-93.7431

I peered out the window to get a better look at the traffic, and in the sky I saw 4 lights in a triangular formation; 3 white lights in each corner of the triangle and a single red light in the center. It was dark, and all I could tell from the lights were that they did not flash or blink in any way. I know that there were some power lines around, but if there was a solid object behind those lights, it was enormous. I'm sure others saw it, but I can't be sure. The craft did move, at a speed I estimate to be about 5 mph. I know that this was not the illusion created from the moving car, as I saw it move even when we were stopped. I didn't bother to tell my mom and sister, as they would just think I was joking. I've heard of the theorized TR-3B ""Government UFO,"" and I think that what I saw might bear a resemblance to the infamous Black Triangle. The lights were still there, even after the traffic started to pick up again. The next day, we took the same route to and from Tae Kwon Do lessons.

This was early on November 6th, 2009 in Saquarema, a beach town in Rio, Brasil with only low rise homes. It was quiet and dark all around except for one light inside the room on my right. My friend was sitting by a table on the same veranda and stepped inside for just a couple of minutes. First sitting:  This was around 03:00 or later and as I leaned my head back on the hammock I looked straight up and saw 3 reddish orange lights, shaped in a triangle, equidistant from each other, all the same size, approximately the size of a nickel coin at arm’s length. These 3 lights were not moving, just still in one same spot, strong lights but not shinny nor flickering, each one was the same and had no variation of color. From the angle I was looking (up) they were in an arrow shape and I can’t remember if this way  : -   or this way  - :  , and I was quiet, analyzing what I was looking at when just before my friend stepped back to the veranda, these lights all of a sudden, altogether in the same shape took off to the right at lightning speed, they did not leave any streak behind, and I could not follow them further because the roof of the house created an obstacle to my view. This entire sighting seems to have lasted only about 10-15 seconds, just enough to appreciate it. There was no sound from the lights the entire event. Second sitting:  I immediately made a comment to my friend of what I had seen pointing in the direction of where the lights had gone but at the same time I looked around the sky when I spotted another single light, of a smaller size, about the size of a dime coin at arm’s length but white, it was further away and not overhead and located in the opposite direction from where the other 3 orangey red lights had gone. This whiter light was similar to the color of any big star in the sky but bigger, and it was also standing still when I saw it, just bright, not flickering, and just as I was guessing it was not a star it zoomed off horizontally that other way (to the left) to quickly disappear in the black. My conclusions: What I saw had nothing to do with the characteristics of any balloons, nor fireworks, nor any earthly manmade airplanes, nor a manmade satellite, nor falling stars or comet, nothing that we know made today on Earth can move as fast and silently in the sky from a still position. It was definitely something not Terrestrial. Me: I believe in non-human extraterrestrial intelligence existence. I have been a photographer for many years but did not even try to get my camera so not to take my eyes off of what I was seeing, and it lasted only seconds anyhow. I have always wanted to see a “UFO”, a real one myself, not in pictures. I was not scarred, I was not surprised, I would say I was momentarily perplexed. I just looked up, saw what I saw, and enjoyed it. And: To my curiosity I googled the date of my ufo sitting and was pleased to see that someone from the beach in Saquarema photographed a strange dot in the sunset sky over the ocean the day before. It was good to know someone else also saw something unusual in the area skies the previous day.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,,

We were taking off from Heathrow Airport in London on a BA flight to Boston at around 9:00 am.  I was sitting in the window seat of the aircraft, as I enjoy air-travel and watching our take-off's.  Heathrow airport was busy at the time, and I was watching many other planes around us out of the window.  We had reached about 1000 feet when I saw a dot about 500 feet below us, at a perpendicular angle towards the plane.   I followed the object, looking intently, expecting to be able to identify the aircraft as it approached closer.  As it approached I was very surprised to see that it did not materialize into any sort of aviation related object.  It was a perfectly spherical shape, a light yet dull metallic gray in colour, with no visible markings or imperfections in the purely circular shape.  It caught my attention, and I struggled to figure out what it was.  I assumed it must have been a stationary object on the ground until it passed approximately 500 feet below the ! plane at a relatively high velocity.   From my guess it was relatively small object, no more than 5 metres in diameter.  I was completely and utterly puzzled, having never seen anything like it.  I have excellent 20/20 vision, and it was a perfect day visually, no clouds/precipitation or fog, and the sun was not too bright.  I was quite alert at the time, and was not tired. I made out the object very clearly, and could easily define the spherical shape and dull metallic colour, it was not blurry in any way and definitely was not a speck or smudge on the aircraft window.  That bizarre sighting has puzzled me ever since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",2010-02-14T00:00:00,,
"Large hovering light that changed into five separate, smaller lights.",Delta,OH,2009-11-15T18:00:00,light,30 minutes,"Occurred : 11/15/2009 18:00  (Entered as : 11/15/09 18:00) Reported: 1/11/2010 8:34:14 AM 08:34 Posted: 2/14/2010 Location: Delta, OH Shape: Light Duration:30 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/074/S74057.html,"Large hovering light that changed into five separate, smaller lights. At about 18:00 on Sunday November 15th I was at work, in the forklift pulling hot steel coils off of the beam and placing them outside in the storage yard.  I looked up in the northern sky and saw an extremely bright but small light traveling east in a straight line and it just looked very wrong and out of place.  It was hard to put my finger on what was wrong about it.  The light was too bright, it didn't strobe or blink, but it was changing.  I didn't think of this at the time, it only occurred to me the next day, but I think one reason that it looked so out of place is that I see plane after plane, all night long, make their landing descents towards Toledo Express Airport, but all of those landing descents take place in the southern sky - well south of my position at work.  But this light was in the northern sky. Anyway, I didn't think much of it, other than a kind of ""that was weird"" notion, and I went back inside to pull another coil off the beam.  This time when I came back to the storage yard outside, there was the brightest light I've ever seen in my life sitting in the northern sky.  I literally said out loud ""Oh my God!""  The brightness of it looked like someone was welding or torch-cutting the sky.  That's the best I can describe it.  If you've ever looked at somebody welding without a visor on - it was that level of brightness.  It was stationary - it was not moving, and it was huge.  I'm not good at estimating it's size but I would figure it was maybe about the size of 4 or 5 two-story houses put together.  It did not have a shape.  It was constantly changing.  ""Boiling"" is almost a good description of its manner and consistency.  It was like a bubbling glob of light in the sky.  It's colors alternated between white, red, and green.  Now I know that white, red, and gree! n are the colors of every single airplane at night but I assure you this was no airplane nor did it even remotely resemble an airplane.  It didn't have lights that were blinking or changing color, it was light and it was changing color, and it was doing so about thirty times a second.  I would compare it to when someone blows into a pinwheel.  That's how rapid the color-change was occurring.  I'm also not good at estimating it's altitude but I would roughly guess somewhere around 5000 feet or so.  It was a clear night, but had there been clouds, it would have been below them. I called my coworker on the radio and asked if he was in the office.  He said that he was so I told him to step outside and look above Winchesters (the truck stop on the corner of State Route 109 and County Road H.) ""WHAT THE F**K IS THAT!?!"" he said. ""Ok, I'm just making sure someone else is seeing this,"" I said. It was absolutely amazing.  My heart was racing, my hands were shaking, and it wasn't out of any kind of fear.  It was out of excitement and out of the fact that this didn't belong or have any logical place in the sky that I've been looking at all of my life.  This made no sense.  We watched transfixed as the light behaved the way I described above for a minute or two. Then, while we were sitting there watching it, two much smaller orbs came off of it (out of it, through it, I don't know) and began to fly independently.  The main light was stationary but these orbs came off of it and flew east.  My coworker and I started shouting and swearing like lunatics, making sure the other had just seen that happen.  After the two orbs flew off, they began to increase in size and brightness and the main light began to decrease.  Soon all three lights were the same size.  At this point, I grabbed my cell phone and called my fiance because I wanted her to go outside and see if she could see this from Swanton.  She didn't answer but she still has the voicemail I left describing the event as it was happening.  I did not think to try and take a picture but I doubt much would have shone through a cellphone camera anyway.  In hindsight, I should have tried to call everyone I know. Soon the three lights formed the shape of a triangle and then held it for a minute or so.  Then a fourth light appeared out of nowhere.  The other three lights broke their triangle formation and began flying around.  The flying was not dramatic in the sense that they were zipping all around the sky, because that was not the case at all.  Almost all of the flying was relatively slow but it was obvious that these lights could, and were, moving in any direction they wanted.  They could fly in a direction, stop on a dime, then head back the other way.  Same thing with up or down.  It did seem very deliberate to me and impossibly exact.  It wasn't chaotic.  At one point, they formed a straight line, at another they would be jumbled together.  I don't know if there was any noise because I was in the forklift but my coworker didn't hear anything.  The most I saw was five lights flying at the same time. Then, one of the lights flew in a straight line heading east, away from the rest of the lights.  Once a considerable distance away, it stopped and then dimmed completely into disappearance.  At the exact moment that it was dimming away, a new light began to shine into existence in the western sky, on the other side of the rest of the lights.  This would continue for a while.  One of the lights would fade out while another one would simultaneously fade into existence.  But that wasn't always the case.  Sometimes two would fade out and no new ones would appear. All the while, I had work to do so I had to keep returning to the beam to grab coils but then I would sit and watch the lights for a minute or two before I would have to return to the building again.  The whole incident from start to finish was about a half hour.  The whole time it was occurring it looked like the event as a whole was slowly moving north.  At around 18:25 all I could see was one large light in the sky, just like it had started, but it was much further north than when it first appeared.  Then, around 18:30 I returned to the building to grab another coil and when I returned the light was gone and I never saw it again. Luckily I have a witness to back this story up but I didn't think that was going to be valuable or even be an issue.  I could not wait to get home to watch the news that night because I thought for sure every single person that was traveling on the Ohio Turnpike or Airport Highway (Rt. 2) had to either be calling this in or recording it.  To me, there is no way anyone traveling on either road could have missed this;  Or anyone in Fulton County, for that matter, with a view of the northern sky.  I honestly expected helicopters or airplanes to arrive at any minute to investigate.  This was too unmissable, unnatural, and bright to be missed by anyone in the area.  I thought for sure this was going to be story #1 on every single news program that night.  So you can imagine how disappointed I was that night when there was no mention of anything on the news.  To this day, I cannot find anything about strange lights or UFOs on any of the local channels' or the Toledo Blade's we! bsites.  I've also searched YouTube to see if any footage has been posted - If there has been, I haven't found it.  But I've also searched YouTube to see if I can find any footage at all from around the world that resembles what I saw that night.  So far, I've found a clip or two that is similar, but nothing at all that makes me go: ""There!  That is what I saw!""  It is surprisingly frustrating. The only tiny piece of validation I have, other than a 2nd eye witness, was a friend of mine who works at the Air National Guard base at Toledo Express Airport.  I was telling him about the sighting and he confirmed that he was working the night of my sighting and he heard a group of coworkers make the joke that ""Well, it sounds like the mother ship has landed.""  They were discussing the UFOs in the sky that night.  My friend didn't think much of it at the time and he didn't have any other information.  He didn't know if calls were coming into the base to report the UFOs or if the base itself was able to see them on radar.  He did not know if jets were scrambled to investigate (I never saw any.)  But he did confirm that the base was at least aware that there was strange phenomena occurring in the sky on that night.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,41.5861,-84.0181

The difference being now we were slightly under the craft and there were 3 white lights of equal distance apart. I could not see the shape of the craft, just the lights. I did see dim multi colored lights between two of the lights slightly forward of them leading me to believe that that section of the craft was slightly rounded there.

It always appears out of the western hemisphere, and does nothing but sweep from north to south for roughly one hour at a time then just disappears. The way I know it is not a series of stars is because even when cloudy outside the lights are still there, and they create a shimmer on the clouds as they are passing by them. Here lately a second set of lights has appeared over the sky so that there is now a total of 6 lights between 21:00 and 23:00. Have not seen any more than that but do know that every night the lights are again out and about doing whatever it is they are doing. The formation they tend to fly in is an over and under type formation with a slight stagger in between the two. The first ship will by slightly higher in altitude and a good bit above the second while the second tends to move a little bit slower almost as if to be scanning for anything the first ship did not pick up or see. Each night they move closer and closer towards the actual city. The size of the object is really hard to tell because of how far out it appears to be, but at the best estimate I would give the object roughly 1mile in length due to the size it appears and the distance it seems to stay at. The two people who I know may have seen it would be myself and brother. Both of which are completely fascinated by it because we have some sense of background with airplanes and knowledge of the air force from family history. I myself have studied planes because I wanted to be a pilot and this object is nothing like any air plane I have ever seen or ever even thought about. Its movements are the biggest reason it comes across peculiar to me because it does not move like any aircraft known to man can move it moves almost as if its just floating from point A to point B. The other unique thing is that unlike most aircraft that make a slight noise when flying even from a distance this object makes no noise, and seems to draw almost no attention.

Compelled by this strange feeling, I picked up my flashlight and looked around the local area. I found nothing, and I decided to go and sit down again. I sat there for the next 20 minutes,with a growing feeling of uncertainty and discontent washing over me. That's when it happened. The air around me grew very warm, a high pitched sound reached my ears.  Unsure of what was happening, I stood up.  A bright light, with a red tint to it surrounded me.  I felt myself loosing consciousness, and I fell to the ground. I drifted in and out of consciousness, each time I awoke, I remember seeing a bright light and blurry silhouettes all around me. The most apparent thing to me was that the figures were very short, no taller than a meter or so, and the table I was lying on was very close to the ground. I remember that occasionally the abductors would speak to each other, always in a high-pitched, rushed sort of way. Many hours later, I woke up. I was outside. I stood up, and I felt dizzy. Stumbling, I looked around the small clearing I was in. I finally found my tent, after walking around for nearly 15 minutes. I wasn't exactly sure of what happened. I packed up my tent, and other camping gear as fast as I could. I drove back to my house and went to bed. My dreams were disturbed with strange dreams of symbols I'd never seen before, as well as that same strange high-pitched noise I heard the previous night. Since then, I had a psychological evaluation done, and it came out completely fine. I am thoroughly convinced that I have come into contact with extra-terrestrials of some kind. Before that incident, I was like many people, a skeptic. I write this now as a believer, one who has experienced abduction, and has to live with it's horrible repercussions for the rest of my life.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,49.05030250696379,-122.29588941504178

Looking carefully, I see a boxy, rectangular, dark gray shape tumbling through the air.  There was no sound coming from it, and it appeared to be a long way away.  It, for all intents and purposes, looked like a bag inflated with some lighter than air gas that had been released, and yet it did retain its shape rather well.  I reached for my digital camera in my pocket, and took three pictures (I will include these as attachments).  I also took a short video clip (about 1:01), but nothing was obvious when I watched it later.  Approximately 3-4 minutes after I first sighted the object, it disappeared into the cloud cover.

I first noted Venus, then turned to look at Orion (roughly to the East) and said ""Look, Orion!"" (typical behaviour for me).  To the left upper side of the constellation, I noticed a very bright star that didn't seem to belong there, but I shrugged it off and  turned to get into the car, when my boyfriend, who was still looking up at the sky said ""A UFO!""  I turned back to see that the white dot of light that I'd first mistaken for a bright star was slowly moving downward through the field of the Orion constellation.  The light zigzagged slightly as it moved downward and toward the left.  The lack of blinking and coloured lights, as well as the pattern of movement made both my boyfriend and myself remark that it couldn't be a place.  The light was also far too small/far away to be a helicoptor.  After about a minute or less, the light had reached the area right below the constellation, when it began to dim until it had disappeared entirely.  We waited a bit to see if it would return, then got into the car.  As we were exiting the parking lot, I looked up toward Orion again, and this time I did see an airplane traveling northeast, though I doubt that was related.

I stepped out onto the balcony just to have a look at the ocean and see if there were any other ships around. I did not see any other ships. What I did see were three red lights in the shape of a triangle,one light above 2 below, possibly 1-2 miles away, in the sky, probably 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. The sky was clear with scattered clouds. At first I thought these three red lights were some sort of helicopter formation.I am an Air Force veteran, I quickly dismissed the helicopter formation as these light were, infact, perfectly stationary. They made no movement and there was no sound coming from them. I assumed that I was too far from the object to hear any sound anyway.I looked at the lights for maybe 5 to 10 seconds, watching for any movement and could not detect any. Next, I turned a! way from the object and looked around the sky , deliberately trying not to view the object. I once again found the object, still in the same location, unmoving. It was at that point that I called for my wife to come see this object. My wife had been occupied with doing something else and by the time she got to the balcony the lights just disappeared as I watched them.Just as though someone turned off a switch, as though turning off a light in a room. Gone! I have no understanding of how or where these lights came from. I can only say that they were real, not some transparent reflection of a common item which I mistook as something unexplanable. My immediate impression was of a helicopter or some sort of military aircraft, which I dismissed. Then I thought it might be some sort of marine navigation device such as a channel marker, which I also dismissed.I then began to get the feeling that these lights were ""watching"" us as I was watching them.

One was leading and the other was always trying to catch up!,,the leader was also waiting for the other now & then. They both passed me about half a mile away at still roughly 100 feet high, thats when i seen two more!and it got a lot more interesting!!.They followed more or less the same flight pattern , i couldnt work out what they were and i was puzzled because they were silent i thought they may be hot air balloons but it was a crystal clear night with tons of stars out and perfectly calm,not even a whisper of wind!.Then to my surprise the leader of this second pair deviated and travelled straight toward me,as god is my witness ive never seen anything like this in my life on tv or in the flesh!,,it was amazing!!!, it stayed at roughly the same height and stopped moving and just hovered in front of me but it was really close!,id say about 60 feet away horizontally. I witnessed in crisp detail what this thing looked like even at night!,ive got a good sense of perspective and id say it was sixty to eighty feet in circumference completely round and covered in what looked like huge bunsen ! burners and individually these were changing fast from low to high flame,i realised this was what all the flickering was at a distance!. I could see the object behind the flames was dark in colour maybe grey or black, i was amazed to see these jets so big and very close yet completely silent!!.Then after hovering there for about 40 seconds it began to make its way back to the other one and they both travelled the same path as the first two till they all came together roughly two to three miles from where i was standing.Thats when another puzzling thing happened, one of them moved away a bit from the rest then stopped and in about five seconds just faded out, then one by one each of the remaining went to the same spot as the first and disappeared the same.Id consider myself an excellent witness & will never forget that night!,hope someone out there witnessed as much as i did as it would be great to get the sighting verified as a genuine ufo sighting.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

No not a depression  more like an opening or a hole in the ocean and from our estimation it looked to be at least 90 miles or so across if not more and the nearer we got to the lip of the opening the harder the C-141 was to control and keep in flight. Suddenly our Flight Compass started spinning and other flight instruments started malfunctioning, All at once  our aircraft dropped from 30,000 feet to 15,000 feet in matter of seconds where we were finally able to regain the aircraft's control that's when me and my flight crew noticed them flying below us there were six disk shaped aircraft.

It perked my curiosity because it was much brighter than any star and was not moving like an airplane would move.  As I continued watching the object, I could pick out three distinct flashing  colors, which were red, white, and blue.  I also noticed movement in the object, such as zig zagging, a dipping back and forth motion, twitching movements, and a downward swirling movement. It has also darted away to the left, only to fly back in from the right and stop in the same location.  It has showed up for the last five nights in a row, Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday night, Monday night, and Tuesday night, between the times of 9:00pm and 11:00pm.  Generally, we locate it in the northeastern part of the sky.  However, last Monday night, it was more towards the northwest and in a couple of hours had moved to its usual location in the northeast.  My husband, my two children, and I have viewed it through my son’s telescope on two nights, last Sunday night and last night, which was Tuesday night.  Through the telescope three very bright red, white, and blue lights appear to be flashing and chasing each other in a circle on this object.  It is definitely not a star, planet, airplane, or a helicopter.  It is something very technological in nature.  As each night progressed and the time became later and later, this object appears to climb higher and higher into the night sky, almost out of view.  Any busy or fatigued person just glancing at it would probably just shrug it off as star when it is sitting still or an airplane when it is moving straight through the sky. It really has to be studied to pick up on the three brightly colored flashing lights and the unusual movement of the object at times.  It is amazing and very fun to watch.  It has made an interesting addition to our home school.  My children can’t wait until dark to find out if ! it is ba ck in the sky.  They love to view it through the telescope, as do I.  This lighted unidentified  object would be perfect for anyone wanting to research or investigate  further, because it has appeared without fail now for the last six nights, and I anticipate it will also appear tonight.  We would love to share it with the world, but we do not own a video camera and a simple still photo from our distance would not do it justice.  We have told family and friends to look out for it at night; however, they are all already in bed when we bring out the telescope and I would feel kind of silly reporting it to law enforcement. It really has to be seen with your own eyes, and then you still won't  believe what you are seeing, and you will not want to stop watching! ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star.

I was putting my cat in the garage, but before I did that, I walked out to my gate and was looking at the western sky. It was a dry warm night, there were stars out and a few airplanes in the sky. There is nothing but a field, where I walked down to my garage (at around 10:00 pm). I was gazing at the sky; I live in the country. As I was looking out into the field, I saw an object in the sky, a little above tree-height - flashing colors. It was an object that seemed to flash colors as it looked to be turning. Or it looked like it was turning or spinning. The lights emanating from the object were different colors - pink, blue green; pastel colors. The object was completely silent, I couldn't really make out the shape of the UFO. I went to get my film camera and my video camera. When I came back it was gone, I was disappointed. I took my cat into the garage, and when I came out of the garage I walked over to the shop, which is a couple of feet away; and for some reason, I looked down at the ground, looking at the bushes. All of a sudden I looked up and there it was! Staring right at me, at tree-top height, directly across from me, in front of a house - across the road. The field I was looking at, before, is right alongside this house across the road. The UFO appeared totally different now. It was circular, and of a star-like color, only a little warmer (color). It was white. It hovered for a minute or so while I picked up my cameras and took pictures. When I aimed my film camera, I couldn't see anything in the lens, but took the picture anyway. I got my video camera up and shot that too.  After I took my photos the object, which was completely silent, then started to drop down from the sky toward the ground. It was descending to the ground, I thought. I walked over to the gate trying to get a look at it going down to the ground and where it would land, but when I got around the gate, it was gone. It must have gone behind the house as I couldn't see it anymore. I was wondering why it had disappeared on me, but in the morning I viewed the spot again, where it had descended, and it obviously had to have gone behind the house. It had been further away than I had thought. It must have dropped behind the house and landed somewhere in a field. This is all farmland here. That is, if it landed, of course. I took my video film inside and put it on the tv to view. To my astonishment, I did get the UFO on video! It looked like it had five or more points on the object. It looked like it was spinning too. Then I got a white circular object and, a green circular object. Funny thing, the UFO that I saw on the video looked totally different than the one I saw with the naked eye (which was a circular white object at that point). While the circular green object, I didn't even see! It was like there were three objects out there, and my video camera picked up three UFO's. The flashing, turning UFO, the circular white UFO - plus, a green UFO. I thought that the flashing UFO probably traveled closer (across the field) and changed into a white circular UFO. ...But I don't know. The UFO's were in sequence, one right after the other on film, so I didn't see all of them at once. It could have been only one UFO changing form, though… Who knows?",2008-10-31T00:00:00,38.9312,-84.1063

This is when things got odd.  This second object slowed down almost to a crawl (still moving smoothly like a shooting star).  Never coming to a complete stop, it turned hard right, accelerated, and made a circle, spiraling inside the circle towards its center before disappearing. Do 'shooting stars' do loops??  Seconds afterwards, as I was attempting to begin to describe what I saw to my wife, two USAF fighter jets flew in a path that took them directly over my neighborhood, and  at a much lower flight level than I've ever seen out here. FYI I am on the far northern end of the valley.  To my East is Nellis AFB.  To my NW is the bombing range.  However these planes sure must have been in a hurry to have been flying so low.

At first I figured it was an airplane until it registered how fast they were going and that there was no noise whatesoever.  I then saw them change formation into what appeared was going to be a V shape formation, but then changed into a diagonal line (from my perspective at least) like so .... but diagonally from left to right. The color of the lights were white/yellowish with a hint of light blue, but were behind a thin layer of clouding so I can't be sure the exact color.  I'm sure it wasn't a commercial aircraft because of how fast it was moving and the fact that the lights moved from their original formation.  I can't rule out that they could have been military craft, however the following is what leads me to believe they are not.  (or at least what military craft are available knowledge to the public.)  1. They made no noise whatsoever.  Not even after they were gone.  There was no trailing engine noise. 2. The speed and seemingly effortless way they manuevered into another formation.  They changed direction faster and more fluently then military aircraft would be able to handle.  As I said earlier, they went from :: to V to a diaganol line .... in a matter of about 5 seconds. 3. The fact that they were just lights... just a circular light.  No flashing, no additional lights, just a solid circle of light. 4. Under a minute later some helicoptors could be heard in the vacinity..  Tho as to whether or not they were there for the spectacle is beside me.  If they were, there would be no way they could have matched the UFOs speed. So that is my sighting.  I personally am convinced they were not commecial or military aircraft.

The object did not appear to be moving relative to my position.  It was circular and appeared to be a dull orange color.  The object appeared to be glowing from within.   Shortly thereafter I saw a second object ascending from behind the tree line in the same direction as the first. This object was somewhat closer than the first one and I was able to determine that it was a balloon with a light inside. The sky that night was very clear with little wind.  I believe that these balloons are the objects that many people saw on July 4th in the Midwest. They were larger than regular party balloons and possibly as big as a weather balloon.

The object didn’t give off any engine noise and didn’t have any flashing lights on it.  The object flew very straight.  It made a sharp right turn and headed west at the same rate of speed and altitude.  That’s when I ran in the house to get my camera.

Just as the third object was moving out of sight – the forth object appeared.  I was able to get some good video of the forth one as well.

The rotation seemed to be fairly slow as all three only made one full rotation.  We observed this pattern until one of the objects on the bottom of the triangle dropped out of our view and the others followed.  The objects were bright white in color.  Also to the east of our location is DIA (Denver International Airport).  At first, we thought it may be planes, but the object’s flight pattern would be almost impossible for a plane to follow, especially for a commercial plane that would be at DIA.  We also do not think it was helicopters either because the angles at which the objects rotated and then dropped would be too sharp.

At this time my children, seconds after their mom, noticed this object and asked me what it was. So, now having my whole family point out what I was quietly viewing gave me enough cause to run inside and get my digital camera and attempt a picture of the object. As I got the camera which I used just 20 minutes prior, I tried to turn it on to no avail. Trying to move quickly I opened my TV remotes to swap out working batteries, put those in my camera, and the camera still did not turn on. Disappointed about the camera trouble, I proceeded outside to see where and if the object was still coming in my homes direction. After searching a few seconds where I’d guessed the object should be I surprisingly saw it over my neighbor’s house south of my front street facing door. The best I could describe what I saw from this vantage point which was low flying about 100 yards away, was this circular object with no sound, and a glowing light  [whitish fire color] surrounded by a jellyfish like sack hazy to transparent to the eye, Flying off at a constant slow speed into the South West sky till it was out of sight.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,41.6604,-83.448

My estimation is that the lighted object was in the valley, about ½ to 1 mile from my house. The lighted object was oblong in shape, wider at the end headed downward, like an elongated teardrop.  In relation to how the moon appears in our sky, the length was about the diameter of the moon, with a tail of more diffused light extending further out.  The width was about a third of the moon’s diameter.  The color reminded me of a Halloween glow-stick, so it had a florescent look.

It looked like a balloon on fire but as I watched the object I realized it was nothing normal.  The object looked as if it was on fire at first but as I watched it I realized that the fire might have been in the center of it. It could have possibly had a clear shell on the outside of it.  But as I began to watch it, it started to float out into the sky at a very quick rate . Before I knew it the object was so far away and it looked like just a little star in the sky. This object floated into the sky around 500 feet away from me and had disappeared into the sky in just around 1 minute. I have never seen anything like this before.

There were about 50 people in the front garden of the Inn on the Green Public House, Harpenden (a number of people around me had noticed it as well) when I noticed a fireball shaped object appear from a North Westerly direction and travel East until it disappeared into the distance.  It was a bright orange colour.  There was only 1 object and it was about the size of a large aircraft travelling at about 10,000 feet.  At first it looked like an aircraft of this description in a ball of fire.  The fire was not round in shape but more of a star shape.  The light did not change shape and it didn't twinkle or flicker like fire but did glow like fire.  There was no trail left by the light.  It was also brighter at the centre of the light as if the ‘aircraft’ was burning then the light was radiating out in the star shape.  At this stage I would not have been surprised if it had lost height and crashed but it stayed at a steady height as it travelled across the sky.  It took about 10 - 15 seconds from when I saw it to disappear into the distance.  It seemed to travel faster than an aircraft would.  If a large aircraft travels at 500 mph then I would say it was travelling 800 - 900 mph.  It was a very clear night with no clouds and it was not obscured from my view at any point.  I have never seen anything like this before and at no point did it make any sound that I could hear.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,,

That being said, it is also July 4th and sometimes the F-16s give air shows and the F-16s remained in the area for sometime after the object left which makes me question whether or not they were actually chasing the object or not.  I could clearly hear the F-16s but not the object.  I am an aircraft owner with 950 hours of pilot-in command time.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,42.6789,-71.0292

This shooting star came to a complete stop. It was motionless for about 20 seconds and sped off in a verticle climb and stopped again. It continued to speed off in different directions, leaving a light path as it did, and would come to a complete stop, wait for 20 to 30 seconds and speed of again.

I don't recall the exact date, but I have witness these crafts twice, on November and on December 2009. It was between 7 and 8 pm, it was dark already, some clouds. I was having a smoke on my balcony which faces west. I see planes almost every day far and close, so I know planes. I lived for over 8 years near the Miami International Airport, before I moved to this new place. I know airplanes, how they move their colors, the sound, just the way they move is enough to tell me that what I was seeing that night were not planes. They move too smooth and no noise, the color of the lights also was different. Planes are required to have green and red lights so that it is possible to tell if they plane is approaching or getting farther away. Those crafts I saw had no lights like this. What they had was lights bluish white which blinked, like on and off, on and off. They just felt strange, this is the only way I can describe. After seeing planes all my life, these jus! t were different. Now they were traveling from my left to my right, since my balcony faces west, they were moving from south to north. There is nothing south except the sea so go figure were they came from. My first sighting of these strange crafts was on November probably mid November 2009. Then in the middle of December, I was smoking again at around 7:30 pm and I saw them again, this really stroke as fancy, I mean do they do this every other day? I have not seen them anymore. There were maybe 5 to 7 of these things, they were not in any kind of formation. I would say they were in a circular formation, if you can call that a formation. Both instances I saw them at the same angle of view, I would say 60 degrees, I think, with the horizon being 0 and straight up from my head being 90. It is hard because I live in the fourth floor. There used to be a base down here, the homestead base, but it has been close since the mid 1990s. Now I want to tell you about another sighting I had a few years back, the reason is that that craft was also coming from the south. This craft I saw in this occasion I got to see its shape, it was a charcoal triangle, not black, dark but it had a sort of blue around it. This was seen by 4 people, including me. We saw it and then some one said, that is what people see like UFO don't you think? No nose and the same smooth going which planes don't have, it is like they are not feeling the resistance of the air around them or something, this is the best way I can explain. I believe in the so call aliens, not only because of the sightings in modern times, but I think these beings have been coming and going way before man ever walked the earth. But I don't know why I have the feeling these triangles are “Made in the USA” just something. You have seen how the government can hide things like the stealth fighter, the blackbird SR71, and Aurora, we are talking technology which was developed 50 years ago, so imagine what they have now. When will we see this technology? As soon as they have a better one. I also believe that not all aliens come from this universe by traveling billions of miles, I think there is enough evidence to show some come from other realities as well. I guess those too fall in the alien category.  Can contact me if it is worth it.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

While outside I noticed the Y part moving around. As well was the craft, though the moving from the craft was not much. I was still able to see it was not fixed in space as stars appear to the nacked eye. About 5-10 minutes I noticed the waether went from clear skies to being covered in clouds. Although the clouds moved in, these lights could still be seen as they are the brightest object in the sky. As i watched and thought about what was before me, I could notice the light would get brighter and then fade almost enitirely out almost. It was from the clouds! Remeber I am an artist, so I have a keen eye for proportions in perspective to that of our visual field. The light getting bright was it coming closer to me. As the light got closer it intensified in brightness and size!  While outside watching them to determine what I was seeing was real. I noticed that they both emitted some type of search/spot light. This could be seen as something clearly above the clouds was lighting clouds up below it. This light appeared as a search light of some sort. At this point I was starting to get frightened. Basically I was right by the entrance of the house, as uncertainty coursed through me. As I watched the light circle around, and at times lighting up the clouds. It came to stop on me. I stood there helpless, wanting to run inside though was unable to move. Which lead and leads me to believe this was or is some type of probe of some sort. Standing there it fealt as if information was being expelled from me. I too took notice it seemed to extract the information in waves, rather than all at once. It seemed almost rythmatic!

I would first of all like to apologize as i do not have the internet on my computer.  I do however have it on my phone and in respect to your wishes I will do my best to make it as professional as possible. Over the past month I have noticed unusual occurences daily in the nights sky.  I have recorded several of these sittings on both a camcorder and my phone.  One night the image was so clear i was able to depict an unusual craft suspended in space!  Needless to say I am an artist and was able to render a picture of the craft in the air. The first sighting I saw was around the beginning of December.  Nightly I look to the stars and the Universe in search of answers as many have done over the expanse of life. This particular night I stepped out with my dog to allow her to use the restroom. Looking into the Universe as I have done every night past. I noticed two unusually bright stars in the sky, so I stood outside and watched them for sometime. 30 minutes perhaps I would say. Emitted from the objects i noticed what appears to be a unifomity thats not noticed from stars. Looking at light closely we notice it steches into what appears to be a burst of light and there is no formality among the light. Unless the light is directed! Nor is it geometical to the eye. However I noticed a pattern in the light that i saw. Which is clealy distinguishable among the stars, as the light emitted from them differ from star light. Coming out of the object on the top or upper side of the object is what appears to be a triangle of light. This triangle of light appears to be beems of light one would have to assume. I do not know what else to make of it. Emitted from the bottom half of the craft or object is what appears to form a upside down ""Y"". I have gotten my girlfriend to see if she could see anything and she said it looked like a peace symbol. Thats extremely close to what I have been seeing and she see's it too.

Altrincham, Chesire a metropolitan borough of Trafford. I arrived home from work at 2-45 am in the morning, the first thing that I did was to put the dog out in the back garden, I then remember switching on Sky news and then I made a coffee. It was just after 3am when I was stood at the back kitchen door drinking a mug of coffee and smoking a cigarette watching my dog sniff around the garden when I spotted the strange light. The light was a very bright whitish/orangish/reddish object and appeared to be a jagged triangular shape, I have to point out that the actual colour of the light, especially around the edges was much more of a fiery orange colour, but has showed up more of a reddish colour on both the photos and video, I suspect this could be due to the fact that the camera I was using was a cheap digital phone camera? The object was almost directly above my house and it is difficult to say how high up in the sky it was, it appeared to be several hundred feet from the ground but it could have been a lot further away? I am pretty sure that what I was seeing was the bottom/stomach of the object, it was completely silent and I could not see any movement, it seemed to be completely still. Also, what else that is not seen on the photos or video is that at times the object appeared to look like it was on fire and I am pretty sure that I saw what looked like smoke or steam around the object. The li! ght appeared to the naked eye to be roughly the size of a 5 pence piece held at arms length. I stood and observed the brightly lit object for about 45 seconds before I went inside and got my mobile phone. I took 7 still photos in total, 2 normal and 5 at full zoom (5x digital zoom). I then started to video the object on my mobile phone, what happened next was just completely mind boggling and quiet a spectacle. After filming the light for about 30 seconds, suddenly a smaller circular shaped light, greenish/white in appearance appeared from nowhere. I stood and observed the second object and watched as it blinked on and off several times, whilst also disappearing and re-appearing in different parts of the night sky as well as moving around the larger triangular object. I have to say, some of the manoeuvres and speed of the moving light was just simply stunning, mind boggling and just plain weird. After roughly 1 minute the circular light shot off in a north-westerly direction at tremendous speed and blinked out and just simply vanished. I continued to film the main o! bject for roughly a further 30 seconds before it just went out, it was like someone switched a light off, there was an orangish/reddish flash and the thing was gone, I am pretty sure that I saw an orangish streak dart away, this only lasted for no more than a second and unfortunately does not show up on the video clip. I must have gone in and out of the garden about 15 times over the course of the next hour to see if I could see the thing again, I never saw anything else and I went to bed. I have to say, at the time and after the sighting, I never really thought that much about it, I wasn't thinking UFOS, Flying saucers, aliens or anything like that, I thought "" that's pretty weird"" and that's all I remember thinking. It was the next day and the following few days that it started to dawn on me just what I had seen. I have done some research on the Internet in the last week and I am amazed how much stuff is out there regarding UFOS, I never ever had any interest before my sighting and I didn't realise that there was so much on the web. I have shown the photos and video to several people and the main reaction that I received was ""wow"", ""weird"", I showed the footage to a good friend of mine, he thinks that what I witnessed was nothing more than some kind of military aircraft. I suppose that I could not rule that out as an explanation but, I have visited many air shows over the years and seen lots of stuff on the T.V and DVDS about aircraft and jets etc, and I can honestly say that I have never seen anything that can perform manoeuvres and move as fast as the objects that I witnessed. I am not saying that what I witnessed was aliens, but I would love someone to show me something man made that can perform like the objects that I witnessed, I have never seen anything remotely close. I will have to go as time is getting on and I have a million things to do, I have decided to contact several people in the world of UFOLOGY and see what they have to say. I would be grateful if you could perhaps get an expert in analysis to have a look at my evidence and please get back to me. I am more than happy to share my evidence with people and please feel free to publish it, all I would ask is that you please withhold my name and personal details, please remember, I am a professional guy and I would not like to be subject to any kind of ridicule or unwanted attention that such a claim could bring. I look forward very much to your reply. Thanks,  ((name deleted))",2010-02-14T00:00:00,,

After being asked by others to describe that smell, I could at best state that it smelled like a steamy-metallic odor, almost like iron mixed with steam. It was not a chemical smell (i.e. our hot tub chemicals can be odorous), nor was it a burning smell made by charcoal, wood or other fire-causing source. Although I have smelled a car radiator over heat, this was not comparable.  Additional Activity  Immediately following the incident as described in my initial report, the following activity took place. Please note that at no time before/during or after this unusual situation, did we lose power.  Cellular Telephone: My cellular telephone began to sporadically malfunction. I had to contact my mobile service provider and had technical support try to trouble-shoot the device and problems, which consisted of:  Frequent inability to make calls ‘Call Failed’ just seconds after making a call (when I could) The phone turning itself off A loud, electrical interference while conducting what little calls I could place  The battery was fully charged and prior to the incident and I had not experience a problem with the phone. Technical support stated that it did not appear to be the SIM card, but seemed more like a device malfunction.  Other members of the household whom were not at home at the time of the initial incident, did not experience any problem with their mobile telephones. Our service provider had me place calls from both my device, as well as from another family member’s (we are on the same network). My device was problematic but theirs was not. The technician noted the odd electrical nterference and stated that my only other choice was to get a replacement device if the problems persisted. I agreed to wait a day or two and see what would happen. After two days of problems post-incident, my cellular phone problems were gone and I did not have to replace the device.  HD-DVR Cable Box: Our HD-DVR cable box ceased working and kept giving us an ""Unrecoverable Write Error"" message that technical support stated indicates the drive has been damaged. Due to our cable provider’s inability to fix the box, we had to exchange it for a one.  Behavior of the cats: Two out of three of our cats exhibited non-typical behavior. All three remained somewhat skittish for the remainder of the day immediately following the incident, however, at approximately 22:20 on the evening of the incident and after retiring to bed for the evening, my son woke me concerned for one of the cats.  She was hissing, crying and pacing on the ledge of the window in the rear bedroom. She was upset to the point that she crawled up the screen and had to be pried off, only to remain very bothered for an additional 20 minutes or so. Upon inspection of the yard(s), we did not see anything, however, are surrounded by dense woods.  At approximately 03:45 that same night (date was now December 4th, 2009), I was woken when a different cat was literally running and jumping into the sliding glass door window as well as jumping onto the drapes that covered the windows. He was howling and crying as though something was on the lanai, next to our hot tub. Worried that he would hurt himself by running into the glass, I tried to pick him up but he was so upset that he scratched my hand and arms and jumped away. After approximately 5 minutes of this behavior, he retreated to hiding underneath a loveseat where he continued to cry for several minutes. Further inspection of the lanai and yard(s) revealed nothing.  Note: The side and backyards are open, but the woods extend from the fences, outward. We have had raccoons, armadillo, possums and bobcats get around the fencing from time to time, but even then the cats act in a more curious fashion and will actually go to the glass doors or windows to observe, never intimidated. We are at a loss as to what could have caused this abnormal behavior. Aside from the incidents above, they have been fine.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,27.076209523809524,-82.22327976190476

After less than five seconds, the lights were gone. A few seconds later, I saw the same thing a little to the south - I believe this one only showed two lights. I quickly knocked on the car window and my family got out. We watched for a minute or so and finally saw a single light to the south for two or three seconds. Within a few seconds, we saw a single light in about the same place where I had seen the first one. This light quickly split into the four lights again. Within just a few seconds it was gone. During this whole period we also saw several white lights slowing blinking and moving around slowly in random directions. These lights were not real bright, about what you would see from a plane, but the blinking rate and random movement appeared very unusual. I don't know if the bright planet in the west in the evening is Jupiter or Venus, but the amber lights we saw were several times brighter than this planet. The distance between each of the four lights was probably about the same as the distance across a full moon. So the distance between the first and fourth lights was probably 3 to 4 full moon diameters.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,31.6393,-98.977

The unknown light stayed the same.  It still looked the same size as we traveled west on country roads. Description:  Large white light.  At intervals very small red lights would flash.(around the edges) These red lights were so small and hard to see that I had to watch for awhile to make sure I was not seeing things.   The intervals were not constant.  The light would undulate, getting larger and smaller ( or brighter and dimmer?)  The light did not move.  The stars were out and clear.  DFW airport had multiple planes flying and there were 3 helicopters that we could see in the distance.  We used these to compare with the large white light.  The large white light was nothing like I have ever seen.  I have lived in the desert where stars are big and clear, yet I have never seen anything like this. The light disappeared on this night at about 9:30 pm. We have been seeing this light on and off for about 1 ½ weeks.  We looked at the light with binoculars, but could only see a bright light.  One night as we watched, there were a few dim blue lights. These blue lights would shoot along the middle of the white light. This light is too high to be a part of a tower.  We also have multiple towers with lights on top that we could compare.  Nothing in the area looked as bright or as big as this light. This morning, we noticed on Fox news that someone else had seen the light.  We have called several news agencies in the area and no one seems to know what it is. Thought we would pass this on in case it is of interest to you.  Now I wish I had a telescope! ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Venus??  PD))",2009-03-19T00:00:00,33.336,-96.7491

Looking out the window, in a southwestern direction, toward the mountains, quite a ways out in the distance, I saw an extremely bright light ""falling"" straight down. At first I thought it may have been a comet (however, the light was ""brilliant"" and there was NO trail) and then it stopped...just stopped...and the brilliant white light suddenly disappeared and a horizontal strobe of varying colored lights came on the object. Still not certain of what I was seeing (I thought it may have been an airplane that had a close call and perhaps the lights were on wing tips as I was admittedly trying to talk myself out of what I was seeing) when suddenly a very long, diffused looking white light shot straight down from the object for about 2-3 seconds (the light was about 1/3 the distance between the object and the horizon from my viewpoint) and then that light went away. (If it had been daylight, I’d say it looked like a long, large jet-trail--going straight DOWN!)  As I noted the object had been in one location for a while now, I quickly went to the living room and opened the blinds and was relieved to STILL be able to see it. The view from the bedroom had been better, so I went back and as I was watching it, 2 very long, diffused looking white lights shot out horizontally (one to the left, one to the right of the object) again lasting about 2 seconds. There had been no movement of the object now for a number of minutes. About 2 minutes later, the 2 horizontal lights came on for about 2 seconds again!

While walking alone through a backyard during a usual routine of exercise I had stopped for a glance in the sky as I ordinarily do on clear days when in the air straight up above me at an altitude of about 3000 feet I had spotted a round ball-like object hovering in a slow but steady glide toward a southerly direction.  This visible object did not in any way appear as what would normally have been a bird or plane, no wings or tail were seen.  With the extreme force of wind current and at it's estimated height, it would not have been possible for any winged creature or balloon to hover so sternly, as they would have shown an air pattern in a more turbulent or vibrational path.  Additional note:  Using my very sharp and accurate vision I was able to depict that because of the slow steady movement it presented, this was not a star nor even a meteor.  Either one would have displayed a more split-second sparkling streak or no movement at all.  The object remained in sight for at least one minute and as the cold wind began to water my eyes I glimpsed away briefly and when I quickly returned to what was a very open part of the sky, the object was nowhere in sight.  After another whole minute of observing that area of sky and with the awareness of how the sun will divert things at different angles and colors, there was nothing visible.  In retrospect from what similar reports have stated, it seemed very possible that the object must have made itself off at a high rate of speed.

On the night of my last camping trip to the northern wilderness of Vermont, the night sky was crystal clear.  As I was used to doing, I pulled my chair up to the campfire, sipped a coffee, listened to the CBC on the radio, and enjoyed the glory of the heavens.  Before climbing into my tent, I hit the ""head"", which was a patch of bushes at the back of the site. I paused to take one last look into the clear, starry night. As I slowly scanned to the left of my field of view, I noticed what appeared at first to be a star, but soon realized that it was moving. It was a small, bright white light. It was no larger than an average star. There was no sound, and no other lights. Moved in a steady, unwavering path. It appeared to be quite a distance, perhaps orbital distance, but that's just a guess. I would say that its speed was twice that of a commercial airliner at that altitude. I thought, ""Hey, I think that must be a satellite"", but it was now 2:00 AM, and satellites are not visible at that hour in my region. I followed it, with my eyes trained on it, as it moved from far left, until it reached the center of the sky, directly overhead. Suddenly, it was gone! I kept looking, further to the right, trying to pick it up again. No, it was gone. After desperately trying to relocate it, I looked back to my left again. Again, I spotted a bright white light, larger than the first, and traveling the exact same path. It was the same as above, but larger, about thrice the size. I followed it as well. When this second one reached the same, exact spot as the first one, it too disappeared from view! I was shocked! It was right there, and in an instant, gone. Again, it was a crystal clear night. There were no clouds. There was no sound. Early that night, and on other nights, I had watched jets cross the night sky, only to disappear beyond the horizon. These two craft, simply disappeared. Needless to say, I didn't sleep too well that night. I am still wondering just what it was that I saw that night.

He was found to be a literate and well spoken individual currently employed as a computer technician and is a former police officer for a large Atlanta-area police agency (graduate of the Georgia Police Academy). He reiterated his written account and added additional information. The witness, with his brother-in-law driving, and his 18 YOA son in rear of mini-van, was returning to Fayetteville southbound on I-75 where I-575 intersects about 20 miles NW of Atlanta proper. About mid-night on 24Sept09 (may have been shortly thereafter making it 25Sept09) the driver pointed out a glowing light in the sky ahead and brought it to the attention of the witness about the time the witness too saw it. Witness stated that as they drove southbound (actually SE toward Atlanta) he observed a steady circular glowing light moving E to W (left to right) about 45 degrees above the horizon. The course seemed to be more or less straight and horizontal, but as it approached the extreme right of his field of view (about 2/3s of the way through the duration) it seemed to gradually arc slightly downward. THE DURATION OF THE OBSERVATION WAS ABOUT 4½ TO 5 MINUTES, THE LIGHT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MOVING AT THE SPEED OF THE MANY REPORTED FIREBALL METEORS. The traffic began to slow down and backup as they watched, as if other drivers were also observing this event. Witness thought that he lost sight either by it going into the distance or perhaps some obstruction eventually blocking the view. During further discussion, witness stated that he did not notice any burning-like effect, no glowing debris breaking away, no smoke or luminescent trail or terminal burst. It just appeared circular, steady, glowing bright blue-green, no fuselage-like structure observed. No electromagnetic or physical effects were noticed. Also observed was a large aircraft, perhaps large airliner size, moving rather fast in the distance, but unknown if related to the original observation. Witness stated the light's size was about that of three (3) lunar masses, but he could not specifically equate to the lunar diameters or mass. He estimated about the size of a quarter held out at arms length which is about three lunar diameters = about 1 1/2 degrees. GPS Coordinates for I-75SB @ I-575 Interchange: 33°59'53N and 84°33'39W. A check of the data base at the 'Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies' revealed no scheduled man-made reentries for the time period of the event described herein. As well, a check of the database of the 'American Meteor Society' found no recorded observations of any fireball activity in the SE United States for the same period. The witness agreed to continue his assistance and provide more data as this inquiry unfolds. This investigator has requested identification data and a statement from the two secondary witnesses, but this has not been received as of 24Nov09. Additional research in this matter has included checking for NASA launches involving various atmospheric experiments as in the 'barium cloud' launches that generated several reports in past years. Information from the official NASA website indicated that on 19Sept09 (five days prior to this event reported to CMS) NASA launched the below described experiment. As indicated in the NASA mission profile below........""STPSAT-1 will track the 'CARE' dust cloud for DAYS or even MONTHS.......first space viewing of an artificial noctilucent cloud.......visible ONLY when illuminated by sunlight from below the horizon while the earth's surface is in darkness......""  --------------------------------------------------------  Description of mission from the NASA web site, Wallops Flight Facility;  ""Night Time Artificial Cloud Study Using NASA Sounding Rocket09.19.09 A NASA Black Brant XII rocket launches carrying the CARE experiment Credit: NASA View Larger Image A rocket experiment that may shed light on the highest clouds in the Earth’s atmosphere was conducted from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on September 19, 2009. The experiment was launched on a NASA Black Brant XII Sounding Rocket. The Charged Aerosol Release Experiment (CARE) was conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory and the Department of Defense Space Test Program using a NASA four-stage Black Brant XII suborbital sounding rocket. Using ground based instruments and the STP/NRL STPSat-1 spacecraft, scientists will study an artificial noctilucent cloud formed by the exhaust particles of the rocket’s fourth stage at about 173 miles altitude. Ground based cameras and radars were based at various observation stations along the Atlantic coast and in Bermuda. Because of the optical observations, the launch required clear skies not only at Wallops but also at the multiple observation stations. The Spatial Heterodyne IMager for MEsospheric Radicals instrument on the STPSat-1 spacecraft will track the CARE dust cloud for days or even months. The SHIMMER instrument has previously viewed natural noctilucent clouds for the past two years. The CARE is the first space viewing of an artificial noctilucent cloud. Data collected during the experiment will provide insight into the formation, evolution, and properties of noctilucent clouds, which are typically observed naturally at high latitudes. In addition to the understanding of noctilucent clouds, scientists will use the experiment to validate and develop simulation models that predict the distribution of dust particles from rocket motors in the upper atmosphere. Natural noctilucent clouds, also known as polar mesospheric clouds, are found in the upper atmosphere as spectacular displays that are most easily seen just after sunset. The clouds are the highest clouds in Earth’s atmosphere, located in the mesosphere around 50 miles altitude. They are normally too faint to be seen with the naked eye and are visible only when illuminated by sunlight from below the horizon while the Earth’s surface is in darkness. A team from government agencies and universities, led by the Naval Research Laboratory, is conducting the experiment. In addition to the Naval Research Laboratory, participants include the DoD STP, NASA, University of Michigan, Air Force Research Laboratory, Clemson University, Stanford University, University of Colorado, Penn State University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Haystack Observatory"". End NASA mission description. 9Dec09, this investigator spoke with Dr. Paul A. Bernhardt of the Navy Research Laboratory, Plasma Physics Division, Washington D.C., 202-767-0196, bern@ppd.nrl.navy.mil  Dr. Bernhardt was the chief scientist and supervisor for the NASA 'CARE' rocket launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on 19Sept09. This event was described to him, and he was asked if the resulting experimental noctilucent cloud could have drifted near or over Georgia in the days after the launch and experiment. He responded that things at that 100+ kilometer altitude (ionosphere) were very different and winds below would not influence the cloud. However he stated that it is feasible that the cloud, or a part thereof, might have drifted over Georgia or vicinity, but would definitely need to be illuminated by sunlight (as stated in the mission abstract) to be visible to the human eye. When asked, he replied that the color of the cloud at the time of the experiment, immediately following the launch, was blue. During additional comments, he stated that another type of experiment connected to research at Clemson involved a release of TMA or trimethyl aluminum. TMA chemically reacts with oxygen thereby creating a bluish effect or cloud that is self-luminous. A check of the various science departments at Clemson indicated that the TMA launchs were from several years ago and no recent activity was noted. The witness in this case stated that their observation occurred about mid-night on 24Sept09. This FI is of the opinion that the sun, being almost directly on the opposite side of the earth, would not provide any light in the ionosphere over or near Georgia to illuminate a cloud such as that created in the 'CARE' experiment. Orbital satellites are not visible after about 10-11PM and until about 5-6AM, thus the lower altitude of any said cloud would likewise be in the earth's shadow. General information-only descriptions of this event/time/date were forwarded to Peter Davenport at NUFORC and the independent TUFORC (Truckers UFO Reporting Center)in an effort to locate any potential motorists/witnesses in the event vicinity on 24Sept09. Potential witnesses reading this request at NUFORC and TUFORC will hopefully contact MUFON of Georgia.

This Interstate intersection is also about 20 miles NW of Atlanta. A dramatic observation took place at this time and date from the described location. MUFON of Georgia is seeking additional witnesses. If you observed any unusual aerial activity on that occasion, please contact Tom Sheets, State Director-MUFON of Georgia at ; After 1Jan10, contact Ralph Howard .

Tom Sheets, SD MUFONGA  --------------------------------------------------------  During the week of Christmas, this writer was back in touch with the witness to remind of the importance of interviewing the two co-witnesses (family members) and obtaining the sketch of how the event appeared through the vehicle windshield. In a 23Dec response, the witness advised that things had not been going well, citing a family death, a serious illness, as well as his aformentioned extreme financial distress. He did state he would arrange all of this as things were resolved. Nothing more has been forthcoming as of 22Jan10.  As cited in the below email to the PAO of the nearby Dobbins Air Reserve Base, the PAO had failed to respond to the email request, as well as several phone messages left for him during November and December. One message was also left in the Operations Center of the 94th Airlift Squadron, the major unit utilizing this base. In mid-January, this writer emailed the PAO again explaining all that was needed was some information regarding the night of the event.....anything that the squadron may have been doing that might have been observed by the witness and mistaken for an aerial phenomenon. Furthermore that if this could be done by a simple phone call, it would prevent the red-tape of my filing under the FOIA. On 19Jan10, this writer received a phone call from a XXX XXXXXXXX who stated he was the PAO. He was immediately rude in tone, condescending in nature and openly hostile to the purpose of MUFON. He stated that the reason I had not heard anything from them was that they ign! ored anything to do with 'UFOs', 'space' and such things. Furthermore, when such things came in they just put them aside and went on to something else or words to that effect. This writer then gave him a short 'MUFON 101' explanation, concluding that there were members within our organization that militarily far out ranked him and his associates and that our goals and objectives were based in science and so forth. Before concluding, he indicated that nothing had occurred that would have caused such aerial activity as observed by the witness, but his statement was couched in terms that clearly indicated he would NOT have told us even if something HAD occurred that could be mistaken for an aerial phenomenon. This PAO was directly opposite in attitude when compared to the last such request from this investigator which went through LtCol. XXXXXXXXX of the Georgia Air National Guard......... LtCol. XXXXXXXXX being a true gentleman and professional, and very helpful.  At this point, 22Jan10, the aerial event described herein exists only through the claims of the primary witness. The data in this report was discussed with him in several long phone conversations and emails. He appeared rational and cooperative throughout and had initially told this writer that his situation at home was degenerating as the holidays approached and was due to the economy, his frustrating search for a better job and various health matters within the family. At such point in an investigation, this writer has an expectation of having successfully interviewed corroborating witnesses and receiving a witness sketch. This has not been accomplished due to the reasons explained.  In classifying this case, the probable cause used to do so is WEAK in this investigators opinion, but the witness will be given the benefit of a doubt in anticipation of him providing the needed information as his situation improves i.e. the case being re-opened at that time in hopes that the corroborating witnesses will have come forward.  This case is classified as Unknown-Other, but subject to being re-opened when the additional data is received.

Sheets of Fayetteville Georgia here, State Director for MUFON of Georgia (Georgia Division of the Mutual UFO Network....the largest and oldest international scientific group researching aerial phenomenon).  We are currently looking into an event that occurred on 24Sept09 at about 12:00 Midnight. This occurrence was observed by multiple witnesses that were traveling southbound on I-75 at it's juncture with I-575 in Cobb County, putting their position a few (+) miles north of the base at appx. 33°59'53N and 84°33'39W, looking generally SSE or SE.  A brilliant blue-green round light appearing to be the mass of 3 lunar diameters was observed moving from E to W about 45° above the horizon. This light did not move at the speed of the commonly observed fireball meteors, bolide meteors, or even returning space debris. It was under observation for about 5 minutes (a long time as these things go) as the vehicles drove south on I-75. The light seeming to move E to W (left to right) at a more or less horizontal angle (perhaps the reported movement of the light may have been an illusion due to the forward motion of the Interstate traffic). The traffic began to slow down and back up due to the dramatic nature of this observation. We are currently scrutinizing the experimental artificial noctilucent cloud that was created by NASA on 19Sept09 after the Black Brant XII launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. NASA has advised that this cloud may be visible after dark for weeks or months when the sun is illuminating it due to! the extremely high altitude. It is possible that this extremely high altitude cloud could have drifted over Georgia in the days after the launch and thus was illuminated after dark by the sun hitting it from the daylight side of the earth. That is one possibility we must check.  Anyhow, I wanted to ask if you could advise us if the 94th Squadron, Lockheed, or any other entity from the base might have been conducting training, flight operations, or tests of any sort that might have been responsible for what was observed. If so, we don't necessarily need to know the exact type of operation if it might be classified or confidential and so forth. We're just in the process of our elimination procedure common to all of our investigations. About 95+% of everything reported to us is eventually proved to be prosaic, mundane everyday occurrences, natural or misunderstood man-made etc. However, the remaining 5 or so percent does often get classified as unknown. As well, did your office receive any calls from the public on or about 24-25Sept09 regarding observation this event?  Any help you can provide will be much appreciated.

I’ve had weird, unexplained things happen to me over the years but on 11-02-2010 it was visually strange.   It was a clear night and I had just left Fred Meyers store at about 8:30 pm  As I was driving up Central Ave. toward Ocean Blvd.  I thought I saw at the top of Central and Ocean a green light over the flashing yellow light.   My first thought was oh no they didn’t put a stop light up here!  But as I got closer I realized that the light (the same color as a green traffic light) was bigger and higher up then the flashing yellow light.  It looked like it it was behind the Methodist church where there are big power lines.  It wasn’t like a regular green light because the light glowed and moved around, like millions of fireflies.   Now my curiosity as to what I was looking at kept me driving toward it.  Just as I realized what  I thought it was there was a flash and it shot straight up in the sky leaving a yellow trail of something that had been shot! out of it.  I was so shocked at what I saw!  You hear about them but you never plan on seeing one.  Total time from seeing it to it vanishing was about 30 to 45 sec. I went home as scheduled and told my children who believed my story.  I didn’t give it much thought after that. A week later on 11-07-2010 I had just gotten out of my car from work and  again it was around 8:30 pm when for some reason I looked up over my apartment.  It was again a clear night and I saw a white star move.  I continued to look at this ‘star’ which as high as it was I figured it was over Empire Lakes which is behind my apartment building complex.  As I continued to watch the star it started to glow bright and get larger.  Then it shot off north leaving again a yellowish trail behind it shooting south.  I was shocked but not surprised.  This also took about 30 to 45 secs.  Again I went in and told the kids that I just saw another one.  Again they believed me. The only thing that really makes all of this weird is that two days later I woke up at 10:00 am.  Everyone in the apartment, including the cats were still asleep.  I found this odd as my 9 year old granddaughter who slept with me at the time is usually up at the crack of dawn.  My cat Yuki cries at the door at 9:00 am every morning like clockwork to be fed.  I was the only person awake.  Gradually, everyone was up and about and seemed sluggish.  I discovered that I didn’t feel well, had a headache and my throat and windpipe were extremely dry, like bone dry.  My lymph nodes in my throat were swelled up to bursting and I had three horizontal cuts on the bottom right side of my mouth.  I felt like this for about five days.  I didn’t get checked out by a doctor as I didn’t have any health insurance at the time.  I do have an appointment in March and I will ask the doctor to check out the marks in my mouth.  Previously in 2003 to 2004 I had lived off Seven Devils Road in a secluded spot on the ocean on Tokyo Lane.  I didn’t write down exact times of the things that happen to me while the kids and I lived there.  I was constantly plagued by the Coast Guard helicopter flying directly and very close to my house at 2 or 3:00 in the morning several times a month.  When I say close I mean just over my roof top!  I thought that they may  be rescuing someone but there were never any reports of vessels needing assistance and they weren‘t near the water.  One time I woke up to what I thought was a spot light over the house and thinking the Coast Guard was at it again.  I got up out of bed to flip them off.  Just as my feet hit the floor I heard the Coast Guard coming?  The light went out and I got back into bed to hear the Coast Guard once again fly as fast as they can from the station, south toward Bandon. I woke up one time with every joint  in my body on fire.  When I say joint I  mean every place that a bone connects to another bone.  This lasted  for about 20 min. and then the pain faded away.  It was an uncomfortable feeling living there and night time was always stressful.  I was fatigued all the time, the children said they felt like they were being watched.  We left in 02-2004 and the children and I were grateful to leave and move back into town. Apparently, it doesn’t matter where you live.   I have shared this with very few people.  My friend in California believes my stories and is greatly concerned.  Hopefully, this will help and in some way be another piece of the puzzle.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,43.37392718446602,-124.14838155339805

I had drunk a couple of cans a lager and wasn’t sure at first but it seemed to move so slowly, almost hovering across the sky that I knew it was not normal.  It was a very large Ball of Fire. At first I thought it was just a firework due to the fact it was bonfire night, maybe a rocket type but it was moving slowly towards us.  I could see that it was not an aeroplane or a Helicopter because of the speed it was moving. It started in the sky about 2 miles away and within seconds it hovered across our garden approximately 500-600 metres up in the sky, as it passed over head I could see it.  A large clear Orb with a Ball of Fire inside once it got 200 metres away it suddenly shot upwards very quickly and disappeared out of sight within seconds. I knew this was not normal and told family who of course took the Mickey out of me. I have never seen anything like this before and am certainly not the type of person who would normally tell people about this or fill in this form but today is the 10th April 2010 and I and my Wife have just seen exactly the same thing again. My wife did not believe me when I told her in November but she was just with me smoking a cigarette on our balcony in South Ockendon, Essex and she witnessed it with me.  Again it was a large Giant Ball of Fire in the sky approximately a mile away from us and I would say about 500 metres up into the sky.  It was so clear that you could see it was fire and it was hovering slowly from right to left of our view.  It was far too slow to be a plane and had no noise to it.  My wife could not believe what she was seeing and I told her it was what I saw before.  We watched it for maybe 30 seconds and the Orb changed route and shot extremely quick straight up into the sky and out of sight. I am both amazed and confused to what I have seen and still not quite sure how to explain it.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

This sphere was hovering in place perhaps 2/3s of the height of the Stratosphere building. slightly to left of the building from my perspective, which would make the sphere be on the North side of the building, 2/3s of the way up. I wasnt sure what it was and immediately it peaked my curiosity as soon as I saw it, it didnt really change in brightness from what i could tell, I was in a moving car. As soon as i got to the end of the street, i turned right (South) and the stratosphere was now being blocked by a commercial building across the street that i turned right onto. When i saw the stratosphere again, maybe 20 ft after made the turn, the sphere was gone. I also noticed a black helicopter heading toward the stratosphere from the North, and it looked like it was flying around the same height of where the sphere was. There should be a point made that there is no way that the helicopter could have been the sphere i saw, because the helicopter was MILES North of the Stratosphere, headed TOWARD the Hotel.  I did not see the bright sphere again. this was around 6pm, and in las vegas it is still very bright at 6pm, so it would make no sense for a massive light to just be hovering around buildings, especially that close to one.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,36.14124586319218,-115.18659190010857

Just below the constelattion was a small star, same size as the others and same colour as the rest of the stars but it was moving very very slowly. It may well have been a satellite or the space station but after witnessing both of these on many occasions I found it a little odd that it was so distant and so slow.  I find satellites tend to leave a trail as a shooting star should and are fast and the space station when we see it is very bright.  first time we saw the space station i thought it was some kind of spy plane.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

After a while of shooting, my friend told me to come to where he was and pointed out what looked like a star that was changing colors from a pinkish color to green to white, blue and yellow.  We both thought the color changing was strange, but he told me to keep watching. A moment later, the color changing light moved very erratically up and to the right.  The movement was similar to what a sheet of paper would do if you dropped it, only moving upwards instead of down.  We both watched it for a while, trying to figure out what it was.  We thought it might be an airplane or helicopter, but the movement was not like any type of aircraft that I know of.  The colors were also not that of aircraft that I know of.  Sometimes the movement was kind of slow, others it moved a great distance very quickly. We watched it for a while, and after a while we both had to get some sleep, and went to bed.  We both thought about reporting it, but figured nobody would believe us, and think that since we are photographers that we were trying to pull off some sort of hoax.  We were both very confused just trying to figure out what it could be. It wasn't until I talked to my brother about it that I decided to report it.  He told me it sounded similar to the lights sighted over Stephenville, Texas, recently.  I looked for photos of this event online, and found something that was very similar to what I had shot, and decided that I should report the incident.

We saw a few aircraft flying over as evident by the flashing lights on them.  Just above the tree line we both noticed a pulsing light.  We both yelled at the same time, “You see that!”  The light pulsed a brilliant white as it.for lack of a better word….zipped, raced, moved EXTREMELY fast across the sky.  The object was moving so fast it left a light trail behind it each time it pulsed this brilliant white. I began to explain that it could not have been a satellite as they move relatively slow across the sky, and one just happened over that I pointed out to her. Given the 180 degrees from horizon to horizon I extrapolated that the object covered approx. 110 degrees, in our sight line, in 4 seconds.  Each pulse of light seemed to be about a second apart as well. We have NEVER seen anything we could not explain away.  This dumfounded us both!  Needless to say, we had a very difficult time sleeping that night after what we saw. I took a photograph of the tree line and the area of visibility between the clear area of observation.  I will try to include the photo with some drawn lines on it to show a representation of what we saw.  The object was not directly over the trees.  I tried to recall my days of being a meteorologist for the Navy in judging distance and altitude. Not really certain about distance from us.  but to wager a guess..heck, I don’t know.  It was distant…could have been 5 mi, could have been 8??  The altitude…again, not certain,  perhaps 1000-1500ft.

I didn't think too much of it till the next morning when I went out and got in my car. All of my car settings had been reset to factory defaults. I own two later model BMWs. I got curious and went to the other one to see if something effected that one too, found out to be the same exact issue in the other one also!! Everything in it was also reset to default factory settings, like stereo, gps and other settings. Even the seat memories had been lost, in both cars.

I immediately turned on a northerly cross street to pursue the object which appeared to be a a very low elevation (40 to 50 feet). and climbing steadily.

Our building is near a rock quarry so I assumed the noise was from an oncoming truck carrying materials to/from the quarry.  I initially ignored the noise thinking it would pass and I could fall back asleep and not worry about the noise awaking my young child.  But the noise did not stop after 5-10 mins.   Finally, I went out onto my balcony and looked for the oncoming or idling truck, but there was none.  So I looked up and that's when I noticed the rectangle shaped object hovering above my building.   I sprinted back into our room to wake my husband and force him to come out into the cold to look into the sky.  He eventually agreed, looked and saw the object and stated its probably a helicopter.  But there are no rectangle shaped helicopters to my knowledge.   He later confessed that after coming back into the apartment he thought to himself ""a helicopter would be way more louder than that object"".   I tried calling both the town police department and county department.  The town department told me I was out of their jurisdiction and the county department told me their system was down the day I called (about a week or two after the sighthing).   I'm not sure if this matters, but my apartment building is located near the Center for Innovative Technology building about 2 mins from the Dulles Airport.

At first I thought the lights were stars but then I could see other stars in the sky and they were not as bright and big.   As I waited outside the bar I noticed that the two points of light had moved slightly to the right.  To make sure I planted my back to a tree and used a distant tree branch as a reference point, and the straight edge of my lighter as a guide.  I walk away and waited for my friends-about 5 minutes.  I walked back to the tree, planted myself in the same place and noticed that the lights were not in the same place. Each light had moved as if they were connected, although I couldn't see any structure connecting them.  Ten minutes later I returned to the same spot and the lights were noticably moved away from my intial reference point.  The streets were mostly empty as most of the people have left town for the holidays.  I also noticed a red blinking dot, like a helicopter flying in the area of the lights.  My friends pulled up and I showed them the lights and they stared for a while but the lights were fixed and outside of there brightness there was nothing spectacular to them-I'm sure.   One hour or so later we returned to the bar and the lights were gone.  I usually stare at the sky and I have noticed how with time stars change positions in the sky.  Specifically I have observed the constallation Orion change position on many evenings.  The difference is that it usually takes hours for this to happen.  These object were moving very slow, but to fast for stars-due to the Earth moving.  Another thing is that while I was staring at this thing I felt like something was communicating with me (this sounds nuts, I know).  As my friends husband looked at it I noticed that he was also grabbed by something, almost in a hypnotic state for a brief moment.  On the somewhat empty street, earlier, for some reason, I found I couldn't stop looking at it.

I was sitting on my couch watching the movie X-Men Three. The way the room is set up is that you walk in and there is a couch on your right, and a chair to the left.  The television is in the far corner of the room against the wall. So directly in front of the couch is this big window. I don’t know why but I looked out the window and at that moment there was this bright object.  It was circular I think. It was bright yellow kind of golden. It left this beautiful blue trail. The object was going down diagonally like it was crashing but it went behind the trees so I couldn’t see it land. I don’t know how far it was away but it fell to the east of my house pretty close I’d say within 25 miles. It was at 8:55 PM. I know this because I looked at my cell phone right away.

My friends and I were out for the meteor shower, we waited till midnight, then looked up toward Orion as we were told to.  We saw a few nice meteors, then my friend points out a satellite.  As soon as I see it drifting across Orion, it stops at the feet of the constellation.   I immediately tell my friend, this is no satellite.  We discuss what it could be for about three minutes, till it began to move again.  It drifted, dropped, darted to the lift and the right, came back to stationary, and generally danced around like a bumble bee.  Once I was sure of what we were seeing, we grabbed a few more witnesses.  At one point, the craft moved up to Orion's right shoulder and sat there.  My friend and I were afraid we had lost it, until it started to move up and down, over and over again: waving Orion's arm at us.  It had to be within 15,000 feet, because I could make out a shape, and distinguish colors of light that it flashed: red, blue, green, yellow, and white.  They wer! e brighter than Orion's belt, twinkled, and were distinguishable by a haze or glow it emitted. Several planes entered the area but stayed far away from the lights.  The night was super clear, just a sliver of a crescent moon, and not a cloud in the sky. By the end of the night, I had spotted three more disk shaped objects, two were moving in unison. Then there was one large rectangular thing with a round front end with a strange pattern of lights on it, it was much larger than the saucers as well.  I went to bed at 3:30, and they were still there, the one I saw originally at the feet of Orion was no longer distinguishable, but was a tiny bright white dot in the atmosphere.

I’ve lived here 8 years and I have never heard about any bears coming into city limits. I decided to walk home anyway. I was pretty damn paranoid most of the way. I did not want to run into any bears so I kept my eyes open a little bit more then usual. Anyways… when I got home I grabbed my keys out of my pocket and walked up the ramp, I triggered the security light.  I knew it would happen so I didn’t pay it any attention.  I got to the door and put the keys in and I heard our neighbors dog come out barking. I looked out and for second I thought I saw some random guy standing over by the fence where the dog was just kind of chilling there, not looking my way.  I let it go went back to unlocking the door but something wasn’t right.  I looked back and the dude was still there only this time it looked like he was looking back. I got the door open looked inside cause the T.V. was on, looked back and he was gone but it looked like a trail went from where he was up into the fog.  I was freaked out.  And then up in the air off to the right of my vision it looked like a thicker section of the fog just kind of blew away. It was a light fog but I swear it was thick fog in that spot one moment and then it was like the rest of the fog. It looked like a gust of wind blew that part away. I knew the guy chilling over by the fence could have just been anybody. That can be explained but the way the fog was thick and then it wasn’t… like the thick fog moved away through the light fog. There was no noise other then rain, it wasn’t windy either, not even a breeze. I am creeped out more then I have been my entire life. I don’t know if this sight is official or if anything taken seriously is investigated or whatever. All I know is I can’t explain what the hell happened with the fog. I told you about the story as best I could and as short as I could so you would take me seriously. I thought you should know I was already a little paranoid that night, and it was late. I know what I saw, a section of the fog in the sky was thicker then the lighter fog around it… then it blew away and then that section was the same as the rest of the fog.

He was extremely panicky in his voice and was running down the road at the time of the initial call as he and his partner believed that a UFO had landed on the green at the end of his road. n his panic he mentioned 'the peckham ufos from 20th october' which can be viewed on youtube. I left my house and went outside to see if I could see anything but I couldnt, bear in mind he lives about half a mile from us a little down hill. I asked that he call me back when he returns home.  His return call approx 10 minutes ago I took the following information.  Apologies if this information is a bit lacking, i felt as if I was interrogating the poor bloke!  Before I start please let it be known that I asked on 3 occassions wether it could have been 'chinese lanterns' (especially as there appears to be some kind of party going on in Morden Park which is quite local) but he swears this is not the case.  This is my assumption.  There was absolute panic in his voice, knowing him for years I have never heard him like this before.  We don't even talk normally on the phone apart from pleasantries as he is my partner's friend.  He even asked me if this could be linked to 2012 end of times. I am fascinated by UFOs and the 2012 end of times and other 'things' and so he chose to call me, by which im flattered but slightly freaked as we have not discussed 2012 at all.  We have discussed UFOs though. Anyway what he told me is exactly as I have written down and as follows... 7 orange objects triangular he witnessed one similar object on 20th October 2009 (the date of the Peckham sighting) 1 object came very low over their house disc shaped flying over the Rosehill area silent and made no noise not flying high seemed as low as the school building opposite their house 7 witnessess including his partner and brother what appears to helicopters flying around [we live half a mile away and could not hear helicopters outside as we would expect] first sighting was at 9.30pm there was flashing lights almost like lightening and not from planes all over the sky the lowest 2 craft were disc shaped and as they passed extremely low over his house the lights went off but then as the craft passed over the house the lights returned as the craft passed over the house they were black and triangular  I have all of this written down should it be needed. I promised I would report this.  I believe it probably was chinese lanters but a few bits niggle at me.

I looked at my watch to clock the time of the thunder so I could tell how far away the storm might be. About a minute later, I saw another flash of light in the same spot in the sky. Exactly one minute after that I saw the brightest flash of light, which lit up most of the sky. These flashes of light were blue and reddish in color. After that neither of us saw any more flashes of light. There never was any thunder either.Right after these flashes of light me and boyfriend witnessed most of the street lamps on my street start to flicker a white light. All of these lights are orange in color under normal circumstances. Around 12:00 am my boyfriend left to go back home (which is about 5 miles away). His roommate told him that most of the street lamps on their were flicker on an off and their lights had gone out. Even stranger, co-workers have said that they experienced electrical problems as well. My boyfriend's mother lost power at her house for close to 45 minutes after these strange flashes of light. She also happens to live closer (to the south of where I live) to where we saw the flashes of light. I do NOT believe this to be lightning because the light was only coming from a small point in the sky and the flash never seemed to try to reach the ground.

Secondly, it appeared to be motionless for at least five minutes, if not longer as we first watched it.

We were facing north and the light was coming towards us slightly to the left side of the north, and to see the lights we needed to lift our heads up slightly in the distance the objects were coming from. When the object reached about 90 degrees to the left of its location, the object started to rise upward. As it did, I saw two more objects appear from the same point as the first one. The same thing happened. By the time the other two objects’ reach the other on, two more came out and the first object was very high in the sky and diminished. The angle we had to look at the first object was at that 90 degree angle from the way we were looking when it was closest to us. The object had seemed to rise a little below the stars and faded away.  This happened up to about ten objects. Time frame is around 15 minutes. We did no further investigation because I am skeptical and we had guest over watching the fire works. However, we believe in “anything is possible.” Today I went online to see if anyone reported this. I did find someone in Bartlett, Illinois. This town is about 10 to 15 minutes away and east of our location. He explained it in a similar way then the way it happened here. That confirmed to me that these were coming from other places. If these were homemade, I do not think the person could do this in other location that far away and have these objects follow one another. The man from Bartlett said the object got to a point where they formed in a line together. Then, I remembered looking on the internet and seeing that it has happened in other places than Illinois. I have seen similar pictures on the internet of that formation of lights. The object's sizes were almost the size of airplane lights off in a short distance. The lights, to me, glowed ever so softly, but were powerful in brightness. When I was observing how they were approaching it as though they were dangling from something, like a tiny helium balloon. However, we could not see any object connected to these lights. There were other people there is well and they saw the same thing. They may come forward, but who knows. We will try. One last thing,  Back in the early 1980’s, my ex-husband told me that he was walking in an old area by his house and saw a hovering craft. He said he was approached and told if he said anything that he would be killed. This happened in Carpentersville Illinois in a vacant area off of route 31 in Carpentersville, Illinois. The land used to be a race track. Which is technically North of where I live now. This is all I have to offer. I do believe that there is something. Are they spying ships for the government, UFO’s? I will never say they are a hoax anymore. There is something. Thank you for your time.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,41.9909,-88.3201

The wife and I were sitting on the back porch. I had caught a flash out of the corner of my eye. So I kept watching the sky and it flashed again. It was a very bright white light like a star but may be even brighter. It was too high for an air craft and it would seem to move form spot to spot in the sky. It would flash ever minute or so. In different spots but not too far apart. And not in a straight line. I’m thinking maybe there were two of them. Because I had saw it flash in the same spot that I had saw it the first time then again in another spot. Like they were signaling each other. I had seen this once before over Lake Pleasant here in AZ. But to nights sitting went on for about five minutes then just vanished. And in the lake experience it had moved so quickly it had left a like vapor tail of light but it was a flash at the same time. I thought it might have been a satellite but it did not keep moving across the sky in a straight line. I thought it might be the space station adjusting its solar panels and they were reflecting off the sun. But it would flash and move its position and then flash again in a different spot. And then again in the spot I had seen it the first time in the sky. The flashes were in 5 to 10 min intervals. It went on for about about an hour or more. This was not a normal pattern for objects of this world. But it was very abnormal in both sightings and I’m positive that they were not of something we have. When I saw it out at the lake it was in the middle of the box of the little dipper region in the sky. This was in June Labor day weekend of 2009. Like I said it was way too high for one of our planes . It appeared to be out in the stars. I just don’t know .

(Distinct shape) My friend and I were sledding at approximately 12:00AM on February 5th, 2009.  It was a particularly beautiful night, snowing kind of heavily, so we went to the park.  Everything was completely normal, so we proceeded to sled with no strange thoughts or fears.  After about 15 minutes of sledding, we were both resting at the top of the hill.  Suddenly, we saw a giant flash of blue in the sky.  It was an intense blue-white light that lit up the whole sky.  I did not see anything but the light as I was looking down.  However, my friend claims to have seen a black, non-solid, ovaly-rectangular shape in the sky, omitting the light (unexplainable because she saw it so quickly.)  She says that the shape was not completely solid (picture an open black folding chair, upside down but more oval-shaped.  The sky was visible through a hole in the shape.)  The object flew over the horizon.  The event was about two or three seconds.  It scared the living hell out of us.  We quickly left, assuming the incident was some sort of terrorist attack.

One night my dog  was extremely anxious and began to bark angrily and excessively at the back door. I was reluctant to get up and let her out as she had just been out. I had gotten off work late and was eating dinner at the table, my dog was going crazy (like when someone knocks on the door) I finally got up and took her out, she ran out with the hair on her back standing up. When I got outside to take a look around I looked and saw what I thought was the police chopper, It was a large light hovering pretty low. I went back inside to finish my dinner, however my dog continued to be very upset, so I went back outside to physically carry her back inside. When I went outside I stopped and watched what I originally thought was a police chopper, and as I watched I realized it was something else. The light seemed to grow in size and it shot a smaller ""star"" out and that star shot out and we watched it glide across the sky, ! it shot north and we watched it until we could no longer see it. It also appeared to have what looked like a streak of grey afterburner smoke under it. Naturally I called everyone I knew to tell them about what I had seen, my brother suggested that I keep my cell phone on me and try to get a picture of it, if it happened again. I decided that was a good idea. I never thought I would see anything like that again, however the next day I had my phone in my pocket, and my dog began to bark excitedly again. I ran outside and looked up and around for a while, then right above me  I spotted a red laser looking thing shooting out of what I thought was a star. At first I thought it was my imagination, but I put my cell phone on video and held my arm up for about half an hour and suddenly I actually saw it again and got it video taped on my cell phone. After that point in the days to come my dog continued to bark excitedly and sure enough when I go outside if I look up in the general direction where she is barking, I almost always get a shot of a ""star"" shooting a laser usually white sometimes blue and red only twice.  It  has been a! year and I probably have around 60 videos of these things. I can only surmise that they make a sound that we cannot hear but that my dog can hear. Aside from the ""stars that  shoot lasers, we also have videos of what looks like 5-6 ""stars"" and suddenly one ""star"" like light comes out of the bottom of one ""star"" and slowly goes up in to another. I keep referring to  the word ""star"" because if you do not know what you are looking for they just look like stars. It's my dog that hears or senses something that alerts me to something strange up there. Often times there are three ""stars"" in the shape of a triangle out there and the two bottom stars of the triangle shoot lasers. I  have been hesitant to report anything because I don't want to be classified as a crazy person, however I need to report to someone, I know what I have seen and what I have on video. I live in a town where there is a military base, and I sometimes wonder if they are experimenting with something, but I am tired of seeing things, I am tired of my dog getting so upset and I just want to know what these things are.

While at first i thought it was just a plane I kept watching it and saw the lights shift position in which the light kind of circled around each other and each light changed positions until it came around into a straight line. The unusual part was a few things, first, the four lights were not connected but if you focused in the lights you could see a faint light connecting all the lights together as if it were four lights on a string that would shift around as it moved through the sky. The second unusual part was that you could definitely see helicopters/airplanes following it like they were chasing it and as the helicopters/airplanes got closer the object would shift-shape and fly faster, i saw the object go from my left side of the car (north) to the front (east) to the right side (southwest) in less than a minute.

The only reason that I would come to conclusion that this could be a ufo is that I had seen these same actions on two different tv shows at two different dates on the history channel in which these exact descriptions were portrayed; four lights appearing to be shape shifting starting as a v then turning into a straight line kind of like Orion’s belt, but four lights, moving through the sky.  The other identifiable aircrafts were following it and having trouble keeping up. Again please let me know if there is another like story like this or if you know of aircrafts that do these kinds of actions thank you.

This object seemed to maintain its position due East and was flashing.  This rate of flash seemed to follow an erratic pattern in terms of time.  I observed this object for about 10 minutes and it seemed to vanish behind the lowest layer of clouds and reappeared during this 10 min. duration and then again vanished with no return. The remarkable aspects of this object were that it seemed to maintain its position and the major characteristic was that it was mostly made up of light which was visible in the afternoon sunlight.  In other words, this object hovered too long for it to be an airplane and too high to be a helicopter and noticed its light emissions in the bright sunlight.  When I turned away 180 degrees for a brief moment (for about 45 seconds after 5 minutes into my observation) and then turned back 180 degrees and looked back at the approximate direction of this object, it was visible in the exact spot of my last view. I am unsure of the altitude of this object because I do not know the size. My opinion is that this object was quite large and that it was much higher in altitude than say an airplane flying at about 15,000 skipping in and out of the view against the lower layer of clouds.  I am unsure of the color and shape of this object but I can describe it by stating that it resembled a drop of mercury. There were other bathers present; however, I am unaware if these bathers noticed this anomaly.  There was a seagull flying in the distance and I did not remember seeing any planes in the air.

On Friday, September 26, 2008, I was standing on our deck with my daughter, looking at the sky when she noticed that there was a really bright star and asked what it was.  I looked and then realized that shouldn't be in that spot of the night sky (facing N/NW at a very low altitude). I went inside and grabbed my husband, and we watched it for about 5 minutes.  At first he thought it was a planet until it started flashing. It never moved, but kept getting brighter and putting off red and blue flashes, though it seemed like it was just one light or object that the flashes were coming from. We went inside and grabbed the binoculars and realized it was actually a cluster of 3 lights, white, red, and blue. My husband and I took turns on and off with the binoculars, while the other watched with the naked eye.  You couldn’t see it with the naked eye, but in the binoculars you could see that at first the lights were horizontally aligned, then would instantly change, though you couldn’t see the transition (even in the binoculars), to a pyramid shape, then to one on top of the other, with the third next to it. The lights pulsed one at a time, going around the formation. They were very rhythmic in their movement. About 15 or 20 minutes later, it still hadn't moved, when a plane came close to it. The plane had to suddenly adjust its course and go up and over it very quickly. As it did this, the lights jerked sideways, like they were moving out of the way. All in all, the lights stayed for almost 45 minutes in the same spot, and were relatively low, lower than normal air traffic. The plane was a small plane, headed right towards centennial airport.  There wasn't a sound associated with the lights, though you could hear the small plane as it flew past. The light then moved down and our vantage point was blocked by a tree across the parking lot from our apartment building, then reappeared at the top of the tree line.   The light then faded, almost like it was receding and heading N, NW, but staying at the same elevation, and then disappeared. All in all, the “event” lasted close to an hour.  We were facing the N/NW, in castle rock, the northern area, facing Sedalia, with RT 85/Santa Fe directly west of our apartment.  The “object” was no more than a mile or so away I’d say, and not very high in the air, maybe 200-500 ft?",2008-10-31T00:00:00,39.38157092651757,-104.84837571884982

When it passed overhead of me, I could see 3 big lights in the corners of the triangle, with small pin lights connecting to each of the 3 lights on the edge of the aircraft.  The air craft was dark slate or black. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",2008-10-31T00:00:00,,

The lighning we had been wayching was several miles away froms us and there had been no lightning above us at all. We both saw the sky above us light up, at first we thought it was the lightning. My sister and I looked up at the same time and in a small cloud we saw what appeared to be a bright blue light. It was still in the cloud for about 3-4 seconds. Then the light shot acroos the sky to the right and was gone. we looked at each other in disbelief. And asked both of our husbands if they saw it. neither of them had seen the actual light but they did see the brightness from the light that lasted longer than a bolt of lightning. There was no lightning above us at all that night so I am not sure what it was we saw exactlly but it definatly was not a plane or a jet because it made no noise. It was there in one spot and within an instant it was gone.

Holly Road towards Holly Michigan. This event lasted 9-10 seconds. This incident occurred when I was under a mile away from Grange Hall Road. I was coming back from dropping off a volunteer that I work with at an art center in Davison. I didn't drink anything and wasn't on any medication or illegal drugs. I was drinking soda and I didn't feel that tired even though it was late. My speed was slower than the posted limit, about 45 on mph, and my brights on. I do this so I can be prepared when a deer decides to cross my path. No other vehicles were present. As I was driving, I slowed down because there appeared to be a very large creature digging in someone's trash next to the right sight of the road. It was located 20-25 feet away from my car. I began to slow down to get a better look. This thing was really tall and too huge to be any 'average' animal that I normally see in roadside trash bins at night. My first thought that came to mind was, ""What is it??"" I remember calling out words of animals in my head to determine what this thing could be. I thought, ""rat no to big..kangaroo? Its grey! Red eyes..rabbit..no.not a cat..it jumps and leaps kind of like a rabbit...I don't know what I'm looking at..can't be a Chupacabra??..Could it..In Michigan??""  This creature was holding a piece of trash..didn't appear to have paws.. more slender hand-like. It had huge, round and red glowing eyes. It reacted and looked kind of surprised to see me as if it thought no one will ever find out that it existed. That was my impression. Its eyes just stared at my vehicle while holding onto a piece of trash for nearly 4 seconds. Its triangular like grey face reminded me of a dog but it was more pointer and triangular towards the end of the nose and mouth. Its presence didn't seem ordinary and those gigantic glowing red eyes made me feel something was out of place here.  Its ears were large and rounded sort of like a mouse. Its arms were bendable and closer to its body then its long flexible legs. The body was heavier in the bottom and kind of reminded me of a kangaroo body but he was completely grey. Maybe, grey short haired fur I am not sure, but the body was definitely grey in color. It had a skinny tail that was similar in appearance to a rat's tail but it was much longer and slightly wider. I barely noticed the creature's tail until it maneuvered out of the way from the garbage can.  In summary, this is the way the creature reacted when I came upon it. I noticed the creature digging in the garbage and it was holding a piece of trash. It stared at me for 3-4 seconds then dropped the trash forcefully like a human would with both hands. It was standing upright and appeared to be over 3 feet tall in height. The creature bent down to the ground and jumped forward on all fours then got up a bit and turn to the left to aim for the woods. It reached for the ground again with its front arms and jumped forward with its back legs swinging in front of it like a rabbit.  The creature didn't make any sounds that I could hear even with my windows open and it didn't try to attack me or hiss at me. When the event was over I wanted to turn around and find out what that thing was. I knew that would not be a good idea. My gut tells me that this thing had to be a Chupacabra. I looked up a Chupacabra on the internet the next day discovered a photo that was taken by a rancher in 2004 that shot and killed one. The creature in that photo looked very similar to the one I witnessed, except, the dead animal had less flesh on its bones and I couldn't see slender hands but it was hard to tell from the photo. I was planning on getting some land so I could let my pet cat out at night but now there is a change of plans.

The sighting occurred at approx 7:30pm on July 5, 2008 in Guilderland New York.  I was visiting two of my sons.  My two sons, one of their wives, and I were all sitting in chairs in the back yard when one of my sons pointed up to the sky and said ""what is that?!""  It looked like a bright round object, similar in size to the planet Venus or Mars when they're visible in the sky.  Except we first saw the object just above the tree line and it started to move upward. I would estimate that the object was about 10,000 feet up.  We watched a regular passenger jet fly right by it (but it looked as though the plane was at a different altitude).  So we continued to watch this object.  It moved higher very slowly.  It would sometimes stop and hover, then start moving up again.  No noise at all.  Then we witnessed a second UFO pass directly under the first object.  It was in the shape of a rod, cigar, or a surf board.  It was reddish-brown in color.  It streaked right below the first object to the east at a high rate of speed. One son managed to find a pair of binoculars and looked at the first object in detail.  All he could see was that one side was brighter than the other.  One side looked speckled or blotched.  I don't know perhaps this could have been from the sun reflecting off of the object. Then one of my sons thought he saw what he described to be a puff of smoke coming from the bottom of the first glowing round object.  It started to move up again.  We observed it for a total of approx 15 minutes before it was so high up that we lost sight of it. I, along with my two sons would be more than willing to speak with you about this sighting.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,42.7051,-73.8994

As we stopped, I noticed it had a faint white glow around it. It slowly ""flew"" away. The entire encounter lasted around 2 minutes. I managed to get a photograph after several attempts. I took four pictures in total, but only one is clear enough to see. I have never seen anything like it. There were no flashing lights and no audible sound. If you have any idea what this was please let me know!! I hope that you can zoom in on my photo more than I was able to do. Thank you.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

My dad, mom, and my 2 brothers and I all seen this object.  I have kep't this under my hat for about a month now.  We all looked up, and noticed this light moving across the sky.  Can't really remember the direction it was traveling, but I know it wasn't going the opposite way from us.  It was just a light moving across the sky at a very moderate speed.  What got me is when we all seen this light it started to dim out, and flicker off.  So at this point of me being a local community ufo investigator I stopped to think of any explanation for this light.  First I eliminated the plane/jet theory.  No way possible that this was of these two.  Next I eliminated the planet suggestion.  This light/craft was moving, and it flickered off.  We was moving in our van about 80mph, but I know this light object was moving.  I look in the sky's alot I know this stuff.  There was a alot of clouds out.  Almost whole sky was covered.  This object was under cloud level.  So this means that the flickering, and dimming was not due to the excessive amount of clouds in the sky.  There was no way this was a satellite, or shooting star just by examination of the object.  I finally had to come to a conclusion that this object was most likely extraterrestrial.  I mean this object/light would flicker on and off, dim a little then become real bright again.  My mom had the best view, and she said that this was the most bizarre ufo related event that has happened to her.  I agreed right along with her.  I have reported other reports to you guys.   Not to long ago I reported a report to ya'll about the orange like object that turned into a what looked like a star zooming across the sky.

That and given the distance of the object to us (at arm's length it was about 1/4"" diameter), the object was too large to be debris.  I ruled out a flare as it wasn’t falling.

My husband and daughter (14) had just left through the front door to go to the store.  My son and I observed two very large bright white lights in the southern sky.  They were about 30 degrees above the horizon.  The lights were larger than any planet that we have ever seen.  One light was located about ‘3 inches’ above the other light.  Both lights were behind the branches of a neighbor’s tree (about 75 yards).  They were stationary and we did not hear any sound coming from the lights. We went inside and tried to find some information on the internet about the evening sky, but didn’t find anything. So, my son and I went back outside to view the lights.  This time we went out the front door and observed the lights from our front porch.  The lights were no longer behind the tree branches.  This time, the lights were to the right of the tree at the same altitude and intensity. We went back inside. About ten minutes later my daughter and husband came home from the store.  I asked them if they saw the bright lights outside.  My daughter said she saw the lights as they were walking to the car to go to the store.  She said she tried to tell my husband, but he was talking on the cell phone.  I asked her if the lights were still there, and she said she still saw them as they walked back into the house. I went back onto the front porch to take another look at the lights.  Both lights were gone!  I called my husband, son, and daughter to see that the lights were gone.  We were baffled.  We went back inside and shared our observations with my husband. I went back outside the front door, but this time I walked about 20 feet out onto the front lawn.  Further away and about 10-20 degrees from the horizon, I saw what I think may be the same two lights.  They were located south-south-west of me.  Their lights were smaller and dimmer.  The bottom light seemed to be rotating as different colored lights were being emitted.  (yellow, orange, green?) I went back inside and called my son and daughter.  They also believe that the two distant lights were the same lights that were previously much closer to our house.  We watched the two lights as they very, very, slowly descended into the horizon.

At the beginning it made me think that it was a chopper from the local news stations and since I live very close to the Miami international airport near to one of the landing runways paths it was seen pretty normal to me that an aircraft were low flying around the area. I am very familiar with the direction and altitudes of the approaching airliners but this one came on a very odd approaching from south to north instead of the normal west to east trajectory as I seen them all the times. Since my home is located parallel to the palmetto express way on the 79th avenue and 52 street  I thought that this weird flying trajectory aircraft was following the palmetto express way from south to north as some chopper news does sometimes. At the beginning I thought it was a jetliner but seconds later change my mind because the jetliners have a set of headlights or approaching lights at the front and also in the wings but this one does not have any of them only the very bright colorful lights blinking on a sequence like the police troopers cars. I was about to resume me daily routine of walking my dog when I noticed that my dog became a little bit nervous which is something not normal for her and I decides to wait until she decides to resume her sneezing of the grass as she usually does but instead she begin to look up to the approaching aircraft at this time very close to me over my head. I was the moment when I noticed that the approaching craft does not have sound as a jetliners or a chopper will have but it flies silently until it passed overhead  and I began to hear the sound of a jet engine passing over me but the sound does not really sound as a normal jet engine but more sound like if the sound came from a laud speaker or something producing the sound from the rear of the aircraft which make me look up and noticed that weird shape of this aircraft more like a oval wing with a black hole or opening on the center from where I guess the sound of the jet engine are being produced. The jet sound was very odd and sound more like it was played on a device to create the sound of the engine without being a real one or like if the aircraft or forever it was trying to camouflage itself by making people think that it was a real aircraft and not something else as it looks. At the front the oval flying thing only has the set of blinking lights but in the rear of the aircraft it has a two sets of yellow and clear lights and a huge vertical windows probably about 10 to 12 feet tall for 6 feet wide and those were about five or six of them all together. The windows run from side to side and the strobe lights were on set below the windows and one set above and here comes the weirdest vision which was the few figures of some kind of small and skinny people walking along side the windows more like if they were doing some kind of work because they were not looking out thru the windows but just more casual walking inside the aircraft. At this point my dog was very scared and she was trying to release herself from the leash and run away making obvious that she was very afraid for something. The figures or entities inside the aircraft were about 3 or perhaps 4 but nor more than 4 and the jet sound came from the aircraft was not making any air waves of any kind as a normal jetliners does I could compare them because just a few seconds after this craft has gone a jetliner approaches my area and I could notice and compare the differences between the previous sight into the regular and normal jetliner. After few seconds of this sight the aircraft disappeared over the near by buildings leaving me kind of shaking due to this one of the kind experience even thought my dog does not known what was it she acts weird before and during the sight and only became a normal dog after the flying thing disappeared thru the distance. At the front I did not noticed anything odd at all beside the strobe lights since I begin to noticed that it was something not normal only after the aircraft was almost flying over my head. Hope someone could explain to me what was it of perhaps someone has see something similar before.",2009-01-10T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

The sky was perfectly clear, except for the very beginnings of a small wispy cloud. The objects were in no clear formation, but close together in the sky. (an area smaller than the palm of your hand, perhaps two inches square) They looked metallic to me, as they seemed to shimmer. They were about the size of a pencil (softly dulled) point at this time.  They looked to either be white, or red. There was one that was definitely red. While trying to keep track of them, it looked like something was swinging from below them, kinda back and forth. I thought maybe paratroopers, but i dont see how i would be able to see some one that small that high in the sky?  Two of the objects seemed to stay in the same spot. I was looking through wires going across my yard, and they stayed in that same position for approx a min. I got up to look for a better vantage point, trying to see if maybe moving to a different area if i could see them clearer  I lost track of two, couldn't see them any more. Three of them looked like they were in triangular formation, equal lateral. I watched two of them for a period of time, they remained close to each other and finally were too small for me to see in the bright sky.  I sat back down and caught sight of two of them again, just sitting there in the sky. I would say the total time of my watching them was approx 5-10 minutes.  Again, they drifted, till they were too small for me to see.  About 20 min later, I took notice of a silver tubular object that crossed the sky from west to east. I continued to watch this object watching for wings or something to show it was a plane. Again, nothing was visible. I looked away for a sec, and back up, and it was gone.  It had been above my house, and then it was gone. There was nothing blocking my view of the sky, and it wasnt that high up that i wouldn't have been able to see it anym! ore.  Th is item looked to be the size of a plane, silver. Clearly visible. I watched this item for about 10sec total. I am not sure what these items were. The first five is what really grabbed my attention, this second item was just odd.  I am 37, single mom with a college degree.  I have spotted odd things in the sky before and reported them. I am a believer in UFOs, but am still skeptical of them as until I see one that is beyond a shadow of doubt of alien origin, personally.

Being outside in downtown Elk Grove, I saw two illuminate orbs similar to stars, but unusually bright to have been stars. I had observed this strange phenomenon for about almost an hour, and from this observation I had noticed that it had not moved one bit from its original position, which in fact looked to be very close to a large, tall, radio station antenna in Elk Grove, observing it at a vantage point about four miles away. The two orbs of light could have been connected to form one spacecraft or separated as two different spacecraft because it had looked like they were in a straight, diagonal line above the ground. The bottom orb was brighter than the top orb as they both were hovering just above the tip of the 15 story-tall antenna; the illuminate orbs being about 100 feet separated from each other.  At the end of the hour, both orbs had disappeared, as I went outside again from my house to check on it.  It was a really extraordinary thing that I had never seen before in my life, and I would really like to know exactly what I was looking at and if it was indeed a UFO.

What clouds there were, were light in nature and sparse and could be seen at a height exceeding (approximately) 20 - 25,000 feet.  At approximately 8:35 PM, My two sons and I were driving southbound on Main street (n Crystal Lake) heading towards Rakow road when my oldest son (who was sitting in the front passenger seat of our minivan) pointed out that he was seeing some very strange lightening flashes. I told him that there shouldn't be an lightening as there was too few clouds and no rain ot severe weather at that time.  He then directed my attention to a small patch of semi-transparent clouds that were very high in the sky (as stated above).  From this small patch of cloud, bright/intense multi-colored lights could be observed flashing in a strobe-light-like fashion in what seemd like a definite pattern... there were blue, white, green lights and gold lights flashing v! ery quickly one after another and almost to the point (at times) of occuring simulaneously at times. the entire sky lit-up - but only where the small patch of clouds was, the light's did not flash far beyond the cloud patch - if at all.  As the ligth's flashed, the cloud became virtually transparent and the shape of an object could be seen. It was very large - especially considering the height it was estimated at being at and was long, thin, and cylindrical/cigar shaped.  We observed the flashing lights for approximately one to two minutes. The second to the last flash we observed, lit-up the entire cloud patch in bright white - making it completely transparent which allowed us to see a much clearer outline of the cylindrical/cigar shaped object itself!  The bright white flash stayed lit for approximately 5 - 7 seconds, which allowed us to see that the object was an orange-ish gold color and was several hundred feet long (on the low-end) and up to approximately 1000 feet long on the high-end. There was one last flash of white/gold light that we observed before the object vanished. The following day, my kids and I checked in with the Lake in the Hills Airport about what we had seen and to check if any one else had contacted them, and were told that there had been no other reports made on this incident.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,42.238146428571426,-88.3069732142857

This night was different however, because I immediately noticed bright lights in the sky in an arrangement similar to the big dipper. My window faces east, so I was looking that direction. This link video footage of exactly what I saw, with a few minor differences:  http://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/7790/UFO_RUSSIA__SUMMER_2008_NEWS_BIG_DIPPER_FORMATION/   Like the formation in the video, the formation I saw had only two objects forming the handle, except the formation I saw had the handle tilted diagonally upward. Also, the formation I saw was staying pretty much stationary, with the exception of one of the objects (the lower object in the dipper handle which was sort of swaying back and forth, not in a dramatic way but ever so slightly, and it was this that caught my eye) and the only other difference is that the formation in the video seems to be more tightly packed in, and the formation I saw was a bit more spread out. All the objects I saw were dimming in and out, and the object that was swaying would occasionally flash a dark red. A lot of things I witnessed are similar to the video like the altitude, the brightness and coloration, size, and of course, the formation itself. Off to the right of the dipper formation, were four objects in no particular order or formation that slowly moved together to form a crescent shape or half circle. During this time, the dipper formation stayed in place, dimming in and out. Eventually, the object at the bottom of the crescent began to flash wildly, first in it’s “natural” color, then in dark red and blue. It struck me as sort of like a morse code, or signal of some kind, and I assume it was “communicating” to the dipper formation, at which point I got spooked and went downstairs to make coffee as this was all a bit too much for me to handle. I’ve always been a skeptic about UFOs and this has pretty much shaken up my whole world view. I can no longer deny that UFOs exist. In the video link I provided, it appears that formation is regrouping into separate formations, ! and I can only assume that is the activity that I was witnessing, but I didn’t stay to witness the whole incident because I was pretty shaken, so I can’t say what eventually happened. When I worked up the courage to come back up to my bedroom and have a look out the window about a half hour later, both the dipper formation and half circle formation had gone, nowhere to be found.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,38.45256501240695,-122.71790012406949

The movement from our vantage point first moved from right to left fairly slowly which seemed like it could have been an airplane. However, after about 30 seconds of this right to left slow movement the object was still for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then the object moved very little from left to right for a short time of around 10 seconds. Immediately thereafter, the movement started going down towards the earth in a straight line. This downward movement lasted about 15 to 20 seconds as the fire type light started to fade away in intensity. After the full downward movement of 20 seconds or so the light did indeed fade into darkness.

It was on a steady path and it seemed to be moving in a line. It didn't waver, and it seemed to be progressing quickly.   After about a minute and a half, I stood up and walked about three and a half feet to join the other 13 individuals who were observing its progress.  None of us were drunk or on any kind of medication.  We all noticed that it had a red light and seemed to be flying about the same level as a commercial airplane.   After about three minutes, the object was getting smaller and smaller and it finally disappeared.  One individual had a camera and was able to capture a few pictures.  I am no aviation expert, and I don't know exactly what it was.   The above statement is true and accurate to the best of my recollection.",2009-08-05T00:00:00,47.29995649484537,-122.18088288659793

It was dark outside with high cloud cover. However, visibility to the cloud cover was very good. At the top right hand side of my front window I noticed a green, nearly perfectly sphere shaped object cross to my left going downward. It moved faster than an airplane would, in close to a straight line at around a 30 degree angle with respect to the ground. The sighting lasted between 3-5 seconds and then it was behind trees some 100 ft. in the distance. The rate and angle of descent was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. There is no airport in the direction of the sighting. It is unclear how far away the object was or what its actual size was since I had no point of reference. The object was between the size of a green pea and a chick pea held at arms length. It was uniformly a lum! inous green in color, not bright or directional, as an aircraft light might be. The center area of the object appeared to have a slightly less greenish color, but the object did appear otherwise to be perfectly spherical. In general, the object appeared to be traveling from north to south, but exact directions were impossible to determine. There was no sound (windows rolled up) and no hint of any crash. Nothing was reported on local news about this incident or any type of airplane crash. I was returning from shopping and had nothing to drink that would impair my judgement. I observe commercial jetliners overflying this road at night on a regular basis heading towards Manchester, NH airport. Manchester airport is situated to the east behind my direction of travel. This object was unlike anything I have observed in many decades of watching the night sky. The object was definitely not a meteor. A meteor often has a streaky appearance, sometimes a tail and in my experience they! are never uniform spheres with defined edges.

As i passed the object out of my site, i took the next available exit to backtrack and investigate. I turned off into this vacant parking lot, parked and got out of my car. There at cloud level, above and out in front of me a ways, was this hovering object, silent, with 3 white lights. I looked through my binoculars and could hardly see what the object was. It was a very very dark object, I grabbed my digital camera and took a couple of pictures.

Before i made a right turn down the street, i noticed a vehicle in the sky, at a distance in front of me, it had a white light and a red strobbing light, as i made the right turn, i noticed the object began to move in the direction i was moving. As I sped up, so would the object, when i slowed down, so would the object. The street I was on comes to a T, where you have to make a right or make a left, I made a illegal U turn to see what the object would do, and to my amazement, the object was again going the same direction i was going, I hurried home and didnt even go to the 7/11 store because i was totally frightened.

Those of you that have been deeply detailed in the study have, without doubt, identified the same understanding I have been given through studies I have conducted.  I am not published as I do not have that aspiration, nor do I seek notoriety for my point of knowledge. Briefly, we have been and are continually “visited” by those who intend no harm, but are seeking to communicate to us, the insanity of our ways.  Those “visiting”, have been in contact with the world governing class and have articulated their concern as nuclear aggression and the probability of detonation of those weapons on a large scale does effect the “space” where they are resident. As many of you who are well versed in quantum science and have knowledge of the “visitors”, there are certain understandings that must be embraced.  An important item of knowledge and professional trust we must embrace, as we, the inhabitants of our planet, share a common space with various forms of energy, mass and conductivity.  Within the energy, mass and conductivity are media and presence that is (1) unseen, (2) unheard) and (3) un-quantified. In its simplest description of fact, we are constantly, consistently and collectively aware there is a determined perception, postulated by the governing classes of the world; Un-identified Flying Objects do not exist. However, also within fact, they do exist.  The state of technology being used and that that has been given to us for many years allows “them” to come and go effortlessly, hidden beyond our visual color spectrum and below and above our frequency aspect.  In the same manner we have been given “stealth technology” and have used it successfully, “they” surpass the level of technology currently available to us. Their being and lack of presence is purposeful.  However, from time to time, with purpose, they make their presence known through frequency modulation into our “band width” of frequency perception and within our “spectrum” of visual color range.  Occasionally, the “sightings” are seen because of technological components that malfunction, causing the frequency and color range to fall within our ranges of sight, hearing and quantification.  It is clear; there is an ever present presence by the “visitors”.  There are an infinite number of parallel “space” that is occupied and is bound by frequency aspect and color spectrum that is different than ours. There is much to know and understand.  But, knowing and understanding the “visitors” are here is not adequate.  We must challenge our governments worldwide to clearly state the truths as they know them.  There is an alliance between the “visitors” and those in the world governing class.  The “visitors” have been asked to cooperate with the world governing class and have shown great reserve as they believe the world is on a course that threatens the existence of the world population and at the same time threatens the “space” occupied by the “visitors”.  We need be clear in our understanding, nuclear holocaust or open physical contact with the “visitors” will occur in the very near future.   Discussion?

I watched how the ""lights"" seemed to play with each other, moving like no human aircraft could possibly move.  I noticed how one light seemed to follow the other, almost as if it was chasing it. The speed went from, rapid to slow back to rapid, speeds like I've never seen. I noticed the lights plunge only to stop then shoot off in all kinds of directions.  I was absolutely amazed. After around 3 minutes, one of the lights seemed to go very small but still visable for a while, almost as if it wasmoving away. The second light waited for around 20 seconds then went really bright and bigger before disappearing in the same way- again almost like it was moving away. I studied the skies for some time after this and I saw nothing.  I believe that what I saw moved like! nothing human ever did.

I wanted to share with you a sighting I had about 2-3 weeks ago in my home town outside my apartment.  I am not saying it was a UFO or anything, but I have never seen something like it and was wondering if you have heard about anything similar to it. To start out, I live in a small town(about 25 thousand people) in central Nebraska no where near any large busy airports and airplanes are not a normality to see.  During the day, the only planes we see around here are small privately owned planes or crop dusters.  Within my town, there is also a large hospital with medical helicopters that often fly through the sky, what I initially thought it to be.  However, they have a distinct chopper sound and can be easily heard. I was leaving my apartment walking out to my car.  When I got in and started it up, I noticed a strange large round light in the sky.  What confused me was the fact that it was sort of a reddish amber color in the sky AND it was flying very low and very slow.  I stopped and just stared at it.  It took forever for it to traverse the sky.  I got out of my car to get a clearer look of it, and also noticed that there was no sound.  Seeing this light completely perplexed me because it couldn't have been any aircraft normally seen around my town especially at that time.  I don't know of any aircraft that ONLY has a red light either.  Furthermore, I have never seen anything fly so slow or low to the ground.  The fact that the light was so large (I would estimate it to be 60-75 feet in diameter) was even more strange because it didn't match any aircraft known to me.  I stared at it for a good 5-10 minutes because I didn't want to miss anything else if it were to happen.  It finally got too far away for me to see.  As stated earlier, I am not saying that it is a UFO, but to me, I can not personally explain it. I am not sure what I saw that night and have never seen anything like it.  I would just like to know if this description matches any known aircraft or if what I saw truly was a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

Around 5:15p.m. on 02/05/09 I was driving north down County Line Rd. to the Cat Hospital to pick up my cat. I noticed a plane with 3 lights in the shape of a triangle, something about it intrigued me and I could not stop looking at it. As I was driving I noticed the plane was not moving and coming towards me as it should have been. So, I keep my eye on the plane and when I got to Heritage Elementary I saw that the plane was hoovering over the school about 5 to 10 feet above tree line. I could not understand how a plane could do this with out falling out of the sky. I noticed it was a gray military plane with no markings on it. I was so weirded out by this I literally had my head over the steering wheel looking at the plane and was wondering if I was the only person that saw this plane hoovering. After leaving the vet I was not thinking about it and drove right past the school and then I thought to myself I wonder if the plane is still there after seeing a smaller plane flying in front of me. As I looked in my rear view mirror I saw that the plane was now flying and going south down County Line Rd. towards the airport. I keep watching the plane the whole time and felt like it was following me, it stayed 15 feet behind me the whole way. As I turned East on Palmer Rd. I thought the plane would fly over me, but no it proceeded to go down Palmer Rd. with me and the weird part is the plane did not turn left like I did, it stayed facing South but flew side ways down Palmer. At this point I was terrified and thought my mind had to be playing tricks on me. I speed up and after passing the Palmer park I came into the group of trees and the plane seemed to have stopped, almost like it couldn't see me anymore. At this point I slammed on my breaks next to the Madison Water Dept. and watched the plane. It proceeded to start flying ""normal"" and going South towards the airport. I keep my eye on the plane as I drove towards Sullivan ""Wall Triana"" and once I turned going South on Sullivan I could not see the plane. A plane this big would still be visible from Sullivan, but it disappeared and was no longer in sight.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,34.71265882352942,-86.75229705882353

It really startled me because it didn't look like it could be more then 1,000 feet high in the sky. Looking directly at it the size might have been the size of 2 basketballs put together.  I used my neighbors roof peak to give the fall a direction.  If the peak of their roof was 12 o'clock the fireball fell to 3:30 in 10-15 seconds.  I ran from the porch to the sidewalk.  Just when I thought it was going to crash into the houses about 1/2 block north of where I was standing it went poof and was gone.  By poof I mean that it got dim and just disappeared.  It didn’t shatter or fall apart, it just got dim and was gone.

Me and my friend were outside. I was looking at the stars when I see a light in the sky. There were no other stars around it. It looked so weird, I didn't take my eyes off it. Then I see 4 lights flash off the side, in a straight line. I was amazed. I looked around to tell my friend. He came over and looked up. The look on his face went to confused, to scared. He walked inside saying it's too much for him. I didn't move at all. I wanted to see exactly what it would do. 5 minutes passed. The lights continued to flash. Then, it started to spin. I started walking a little closer, but then at the corner of my eye i see another light. I look closely at it. Then a craft came out of nowhere and slowly hovered almost above me. Almost as if they were watching me. Then it got to the end of our fence. This craft was floating above the house, it caused our lights to flicker. As soon as it got above our house, it went blurry and just disapeared above our house. It vanish! ed, it didnt move it just disapeared. My friend comes outside and he sits down on the chair. He was talking to his girlfriend acting as if nothing happened. He didn't see what I just saw. I turn to him and start walking toward him. All I said was Joey, then passed out on his porch. I woke up in his room in the chair. Every night since that night I hear things above my house. Around one to four. One night i actually saw lights flash through my window. I never sleep anymore. Im terrified of what i saw. Its been 2 months. I continue to hear hovering every night. I thought it was my fridge, but when i unplugged it and went upstairs, it got louder. I didn't want to see what i saw. And I know how most people want to see one so bad, but believe me, you don't want to encounter one.

Witnesses: 1 Azusa, CA  At around 21:05 hours. Evening dark sky partly cloudy. One witness was at his work walking his normal route. As he walked outside of the building he was in. He looked around at his surroundings and a very bright red light in the sky caught his attention. He looked to the south eastern sky and saw a group of red lights. They were blinking or turning on and off. It seemed to be in a pattern then turned randomly and one small white light in the middle of them all on for the duration of the sighting. It was slow moving to the north west from the south west. The witness looked at the lights and could not make of it any conventionally known craft other than experimental. The planes that usually fly by have red, white and green lights that are flashing or blinking in a sequence. These did not match of those seen normally. And military aircraft run infrared or red and green lights. At about 21:09, the witness took some video and pictures with his cell phone but are useless due to th! e poor technology in cell phone cameras. The red lights were traveling north west to the San Gabriel Mountains near Azusa, CA when it makes an abrupt turn north. And goes north over the mountains and seems to be exactly leveled with the peaks of the mountains which are around 6,000 ft. And was not seen again at about 21:11 hours. No body or fuselage could be clearly seen with the red lights. The red lights all seemed to be attached to something other than being in formation separately. One white light in the middle of the other lights that seem to be on at all times but very dim. The red lights seen were 2-3 red lights at front of the group of lights, 2-3 on the sides of it and 2-3 at the rear. The witness thinks the object was a triangle shape due to the position of the lights. The altitude would be an approximate of 7-15,000 ft. No sound was herd from the lights. Nothing else unusual was seen that night. The witness is has seen many commercial aircraft in the area before and is knows what to look for in normal characteristics. This sighting could be an experimental conventional military aircraft of sorts but it was unidentified flying object that could possibly be the real thing.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,34.1748,-117.8751

I live in a single-family home on approximately 3 acres. The night was clear and cold. I looked up to the stars as I usually do, as we walked in the backyard. Something caught my eye for a moment to the east in the sky. It appeared to be a low flying craft, with a bright light, what I assumed were landing headlights. I see them all the time because my home is situated under a normal flight path for Logan, and there is a municipal small craft airport about a mile from my home so it’s not unusual to see several aircraft in the sky along with the nightly stars, so I didn’t pay much attention. At that time the “light” was approximately 15-20 miles away. As my dog was finishing up her “business” I looked back at the light because I thought the angle of the light was odd. A direction I hadn’t seen before so I stopped and gazed up, facing directly east now the light was of a pattern and configuration I! had never seen before, and I watched and waited for it to come closer, as I am in the habit of doing, I like watching the different jets pass overhead again I spend a lot of time outdoors here especially at night, I have a nice telescope that I enjoy using an outdoor fireplace, so the backyards a lot of fun. Anyway as the “what I think” is a jet gets closer, I start to see odd lights Like on the “belly” The first thing that came to mind was that it must be some promo like you see at the beach, when planes drag those banners in the sky except this must be something knew, because its like so bright and so BIG and there is 2 white lights and this big red sort of like times square blinking symbol. Of what I have no idea. At this point I notice 3 odd things. One the ozone smell is stronger than I've ever smelled, the air seems to be electrified somehow and this thing passing directly over me now is NOT A PLANE, it’s something I’ve never seen before, wedge shaped, triangular, si! lent, slow, and HUGE, 2-3 footballs fields huge. I watched it ! pass ove r me, incredulous to what I was seeing, not believing, The craft moved from direct to east to direct west. After it disappeared in the night’s horizon, I went back in the house, sat down and decided I wouldn’t tell anyone, because I don’t want people to think I’m a nut. BUT. Its kind of been bugging me. I think about every day and replay it in my mind several times. I don’t want to keep silent. I saw this thing. I’m not saying its extraterrestrial. But it is something that I have never seen or felt before. And it was so obvious, so UNSTEALTH like, just there. HUGE.  Unfortunately I’m unemployed right now, and my cell phone is “off” so I have no pictures or video, ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

The sighting was 5-7 minutes long.   We stopped my father’s pick up truck, got out and viewed this massive triangle with a light in each corner.  The front light was huge and lit up the night, though it was as if a spotlight illuminated the ground below.  The other two lights were not as bright.  It was quiet, slow and defied what we knew of how planes fly.  My father is now 85.  A WWII vet and I am 55. We told only family at the time as it was and remains quite puzzling.   Fast forward.

I took some photographs from my car going up, a few times I pulled over to take the pictures.  I did not notice the image I captured having the triangle in it when I took it.  I simply took a picture from about 6000 feet of the summit.  When I viewed the taken image on the viewfinder, I saw it immediately, but thought of it as an orb.  When downloaded, it reveals what you see.  I know it appears to be invisible, but a daytime photo of this craft does not exist that I am aware of.

After the event it seemed to take about ten min. to get into Kettleman City, traveling on Highway 41.  If the direction of the road that we were on was 12 o'clock, the lights were at about 12:30. The lights were in a triangle position with equal distance between, if they were connected on the perimeter.  There were seven lights that were red and that did not blink like an airplane.  The lights then began to move an incredible distance in a short amount of time, going from the 12:30 position, to the 2:30 position within 5 seconds, and then stops.  It seemed 20 miles off now, and about 10 times closer than when first spotted with the lights in the same formation.  We then pulled over off the road to try to get video on the cell phone and that is when it elevates straight up, what had to be a couple of miles, stops for 2 seconds, and ! then accelerates off at about 3 o'clock until the lights faded out within 2 or 3 sec.  It seemed odd that before we got back on the road after about 2 min., that no cars passed by us.  It was odd because about two miles before we saw the lights, we passed two slower moving cars going in our direction. I drew a picture of the lights when i got home. If you want to contact me i could fax the drawing. I told two people i trust the most about this and I'm not bringing it up again. It didn't go over to well, just not worth it. I own a construction business in California. My perception of angles and distance are sharpened every week, so what I can not explain is how something could move so far, so fast, then stop, and then elevate straight up.",2010-04-13T00:00:00,,

Cassiopeia looks like a W or a crown in the night sky but it looked much different tonight.

They looked like two bright white satellites only they weren't moving. We watched them for probably 10 to 15 seconds and they didn't appear to move at all which I knew was strange. Then they slowly moved in formation off to the northeast and got dimmer as they moved that direction. I kept track of them for a while but then lost them.

My parents were vacationing in St. Pete, Florida on Sept. 28th, 2008, and were driving on US-19 at around 9 P.M. when they noticed the clear outline of a large, dark, diamond-shaped object that seemed to be hovering three-fourths of a mile to the side of the roadway. The diamond-shaped outline could be observed as it blotted out the stars and all other light from behind it, and even more noticeable: a row of brightly-lit windows stretched down the length of the object. They described the object as large as a house, but probably even larger, due to its distance from them. My parents had slowed down considerably to observe the object, and they described the object as “hovering”, because not only did it appear to be totally motionless in relation to their speed, but it also appeared totally motionless in relation to other low-altitude planes and aircraft, which were moving normally even while the object receded behind them as they drove on. They also described the object as being well above the horizon and high in the sky, not apart of or constituting any kind of ground structure, such as a building or power lines. My parents actually turned around at the next available opportunity, some five or ten minutes later, and drove past the area where they had seen the object, but could not find any trace of it; instead, they did observe three helicopters flying in unison and passing in the direction they had seen the object. Traffic was somewhat heavy at this time, and my parents were wondering if anyone else had observed this object and had reported in.

We were facing West.    Hmmmm they were not there before ???    If you take a ""/"" one star at each tip perhaps one ""inch"" apart if you had a ruler at arms length.  I pointed to them and my wife acknowledged them with ooo's and ahh's.  I looked back at the band and perhaps a minute later looked back at them.  They were still in the same area but only 3/4s as bright.  I thought this odd and again pointed to them.  Then as we were both looking at them we commented ""There moving and fading""  The movement seemed UP but again - using a ruler they probably moved 4 inches until the ""stars"" grew slammer and dimmer.  My first thought was ISS with the Shuttle near by????   It was as bright as a month ago with ISS/Shuttle attached flew over.  I was sure it must be that.  We both have lived around airports all of our lives, we both agree there is no way they were aircraft.    The gap remained constant between the ""stars"" has they faded and shrank.  Yet - upon investigation there were no satellites in the sky that night near us.  There were no tell tale colored lights from aircraft.  Perhaps F18 or F16 from Truax?  But we both do not think so.

The light pulsed evey two seconds and was about the size of a pea held at arm's length. Two other restaurant workers joined us. We remained mostly silent in order to try to hear the object- at no point did we hear any sound. I tried to sight it on my camera phone but could not pick it up. After about a minute, the object turned white for about two seconds and then resumed its initial color. The light did not illuminate any structure such as wings or a gondola and never blinked. There was a fairly uniform overcast at about 2-3000 feet and at no point was the light obscured by the clouds. After moving east for a few minutes the object decelerated and hovered. At this point I called my wife and told her to look south. The light moved slightly to the north and then turned white again.

I saw my first UFO as reported on June 17th, 2008. Since that night, I spend about 1 hour per night watching the skies…hoping to see it again. Since June 17th…I swear I have seen white orbs between 9:25 pm and 10:35 pm Chicago time…every single night except one night.  In fact, I stopped reporting them as they became regular…and I am speaking to someone in a few days from MUFON.  Now…people have told me to get a photo or a video of it…and I have, and will download some of them as soon as I get access to a DVD drive…or have one installed.  But…tonight…I filmed a orange/white orb heading due north…pretty high altitude…and as reported…before…it stopped…and hovered.  But this time…it turned off the lights on the craft and it hovered somewhere.  I tried to re-acquire the orb for about 20 minutes with my video camera…but I lost it up there in the night sky soon after it stopped.  I kept looking.  Suddenly…just north of where I thought it stopped….The orb lit up the entire sky around it.  It was by far the biggest and brightest light that I have ever SEEN in my entire life.  It looked like lightening in a huge circular sphere.  It was lower than when I first filmed it too.  I swear I pulled up my camera…and it immediately shut off on me!!  It took off slowly for one second…and the 2nd second…it took off faster than anything I have ever seen fly before!!  It streaked away…with a huge white trailer. It is so frustrating…because even if I was totally ready…and the camera stayed on…I would have missed it…it was simply too fast…It was gone in a blink of an eye.  It makes me almost skeptical of other videos.  Who the hell can catch these things on film so easily?  I mean…who has a video camera on their shoulder all night long, like I just did for the last 4 days?  Now..I have said before…and now I am reporting again….watch the skies between 9:25 pm…and 10:35 pm…Chicago time…just east…and just south of the big dipper…and get on this site…and report it.  I have seen them start up from a dead stop…three times now…and it is the most amazing thing I have ever seen.  It is not a shooting star or meteor for sure.  It is a craft…it hovered…shut the lights off…and s! tarted u p again…and took off.  Something is controlling it…and I just don’t think it is the TR3-B…unless it lights up like a lightening bolt.  I will take a polygraph and provide my video evidence soon.  2 or 3 fly by without stopping per night…sometimes they are real high…and sometimes…they are lower…and someone out there will see them for sure.  Report what you see to this site…no one believes me…and it is so frustrating…people think I am nuts….but it is the truth.  I DID catch the orb on film before the light went off…We will see how it looks later…I had the camera zoomed all the way in too. You can see it moving for sure.  Even if a skeptic was here tonight…and saw what I saw…he/she would believe from tonight on. Now…I finally know how other people who have witnessed these UFO’s feel…you cannot sleep…you sit up wondering what the hell it was.  I just don’t think it was human. Now…I am NOT a trained observer…but growing up five minutes from O’Hare Airport…I know what a plane looks like.  I lived in Arizona for 8 years, and I know full well what a meteor looks like.  This was neither…it was the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen.  I would say that at the speed it was traveling…it go from Park Ridge, IL to Milwaukee in only a few minutes. If you are in the midwest...check the skies…for one hour...and you will see something for sure.  This could be something different than anything else before because it is CONSISTENTLY happening.

As we looked to the south sky you can plainly see a very bright light, this light has rays from it (you can see blue rays if you look closely). This light will stay in one place and then move to any side or up and down quickly. There is no sound heard. It does not move at a constant pace as an aircraft would- instead it just sits and then moves randomly. My son also witnessed it move rapidly one night at a diagonal angle straight toward the lake near where we live and disappear. This appears many nights near our home.

I noticed the lights because I frequent the area and had never before seen lights in the area.  The lights first appeared in front of the car, off in the not-so-distant sky.  They were evenly spaced, one on top of the other.  At first glance the two lights looked as if they were on a tower of some type, but there was no tower in the area. I decided to try and get a closer look, so I started heading south on Gill Hall Rd.  As I crossed the Allegheny/Washington County line, we were on top of a high hill.  The two lights were still in the same spot.  I began to notice a slight orange color in the light on the bottom, which was slightly larger than the top light.  The lights appeared to be only a few hundred feet off the ground, just high enough in the sky to be clearly visible from many locations.  I was set on getting a closer look so I kept driving toward the lights.  Before I knew it we were on Rt. 19 in Washington, with the two lights still off in the distance.  Just in front of us a large meteor-like object passed in front of us, giving off a bright green light.  The lights and the shooting star do not appear to be related, because the lights were still there after the shooting star passed.  By this time it had long been ruled out that the lights were stars, since they were much too bright.  We passed through the brightly lit mall area on the north side of Washington and the lights were gone. We never caught sight of them again. ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter and Venus, we suspect.

The weather was cold and it was a really clear night.  I looked through some trees and a light in the sky caught my attention.  I figured it was just a plane, or even a helicopter based on it's movements, but then I kept watching it because it was moving so sporadically.  I told my friend to look at it as well.  He thought it was odd and noted it didn't seem to be a regular plane because there were not the typical lights, such as the strobe.  We got the third person with us to come outside and look at it as well and he was just as shocked. The object moved in ways typical planes don't.  It would travel across the sky slowly, then zip ahead faster and take a nose dive quickly and sharp turns.  There appeared to be two lights on it, one blue, one red. A red color for sure. It was hard to tell just what the shape of it was because it was a few miles away no doubt.  But it appeared to almost be rectangular, or to have some type of wings across similar to a normal plane I guess. The object flew around for more then five minutes at least, then disappeared for five, then came back for probably five more minutes.   Our buddy did manage to get some video of it and a photo, but it looks like any other UFO footage caught on tape...a blurry little light moving about that's hard to make out.

All of the sudden I saw a rectangular shaped light fly from directly above my head from the roof to a tree in my backyard.  The light was about six inches wide and nearly one foot long.  The roof was about twelve to fifteen feet tall.  The light moved in a straight line from the roof to the tree (about thirty feet).  It moved about sixty feet in about one second.  I looked up in the tree to see if anything was there.  I did not have a clue what it was.  At first I thought it might have been a white owl or bird although there are not many in my part of the town.  This is because I live in a suburban area.  I did not see the light up in the tree after that.  About fifteen minutes later I saw the same exact light from the same spot zoom into the tree.  Then, unlike the first time I saw the light, this time the light went from one branch over to the next parallel to the ground.  A few seconds after that it went from that branch to a lower branch about two feet beneath it.  From there the light seemed to squiggle down to the ground.  When it hit the ground it immediately bounded twice away from my house and towards the road behind my house.  Each bound was about forty-five feet in length.  Once the light had bounded away from my house it seemed to disappear after it hit the ground on the second time.  It landed in a part of our garden where we had rocks as our landscaping.  I never saw the light resting there and I never saw it move from that spot again.

They were heading in a southeasterly direction silently towards the ocean at about 30 mph. They were a brilliant orange in color and were the size of a quarter at arms length.	There was approximately 1000 feet between each of the orange “balls”. There was a slight altitude difference between one “ball” and the next but the distance separating each ball was the same. They were all generally flying on the same flight path. They kept coming one after the other and we estimate between 6 and 8 of the orange “balls”.

The casino is located on a hillside with an impressive view of the Snoqualmie Valley.  We drove to the top floor of the parking garage in hopes that we would be able to view the fireworks displays in the valley. We were not disappointed.  We enjoyed the beautiful displays across the Snoqualmie Valley.   We were nearly ready to go home when we noticed a large, red, oval light moving very slowly across the sky.  The light was high in the sky just north of Mt. Si, a mountain in the area that is 3,500 feet high.  We watched the craft move slowly across the sky toward Mt. Si.  The light was not blinking, but was a large, solid red light in the sky.  After watching the object for approximately two minutes, the craft suddenly turned and disappeared. Another couple was standing near us.  They also saw the object.  We began to discuss the large, red, slow moving object in the distant sky.  We all agreed that it was not an airplane, helicopter or fireworks. Excited and amazed, the other couple told us that they had seen the same type of craft the night before, July 3rd, while visiting their son in Sultan, WA.  They had left their son’s home in Sultan and observed two large, red, slow moving objects in the sky.  That night they called their son on a cell phone and he went outside to observe the two red lights in the sky.  They told us that the two lights moved slowly across the sky that night as well. However, they also moved up and down at different times and then disappeared.  This couple was shocked and surprised to see another red object in the sky the very next night. We estimate that the object was 7-8 miles from us at the time we saw it at about 10:15 PM.  It was approximately 3,000 feet high in the sky. Based on the distance away and the size of the object, we are convinced that the craft was incredibly large.  The shape was that of a big circle that had been slightly flattened.

After the local fireworks display, I noticed a bright light (maybe -1.0 magnitude or ""Venus bright"") in the southern sky, SSW of our location.  Speed and trajectory was similar to ISS and other satellite flyovers, but the color was bright orange and didn't appear to change (i.e., no flashing). The light continued in a northernly direction, passing to the west of us and maybe an altitude of 70 degrees or so.  Somewhere in the NW direction, it faded in very much the same way that satellites do when they enter the Earth's shadow. Total observation time seemed to be 1-2 minutes, with the light maintaining its magnitude the entire time, except at the end when it quickly faded and disappeared.  The orange coloring seemed to be the oddest part, and given the time of day, I could see how this could be red sunlight from below the horizon glinting off of a satellite (though the length of time and the prolonged intensity makes me doubt this). There was no sound detected. The sky was overcast, and the position of the moon could be easily determined, but no features could be made out through the clouds.  The orange light was clear enough to appear to be beneath the clouds, but there was no way to determine for sure whether the cloud cover extended across the entire sky (i.e., it's possible that there were clouds blocking the moon, but not this light).  Intellicast.com is reporting the ceiling at 8000'. Three of the adults present, myself included, have worked in the air freight industry, and are familiar with witnessing commercial aircraft on approach from 10 miles out and closer.  We all tried to debunk this as an aircraft, but could not detect any indicator of such, like wing markers or red strobe lights (especially as the light moved in relation to us, where such indicators should have became apparent).

I followed this tiny light and noticed it kind of curved towards the western direction and it came to a hover this time there seemed to be more lights that I had not noticed earlier – it almost looked like a ! string of lights or set of lights.. it hovered and then started descending and moving back towards the East…ran inside to get my binoculars and see if I could take a better look, but when I got back with them – this thing was gone, I waited for a while as to see if I could see it again , but with no luck.

It had 3 white circular lights in the shape of a wide obtuse triangle.  There was just enough light out to see that it was one object and it was very large.  It was bigger than any airplane.

I returned later on coming from the same direction to see if there was anything that could’ve deceived my eyes and there just wasn’t.  There was just sky and space.

I asked my daughter if she saw it and she said, ""Yes I do. What is it? Is it a ghost or a demon or a spaceship?"" It moved very gracefully, then turned south and began to fly over us. It never increased or decreased in speed. It appeared as a triangle with a hollow center, sort of like a boomerang with stripes. There were no lights but some sort of very small illumination like a glow which gave it the ghostly appearance. It was gray, a light gray and made no sound at all. The thing continued to fly, very smoothly and gracefully, to the south until we could no longer see it. About a minute later what looked like a star, just a simple star, began to zigzag across the sky. It disappeared twice and then flew to the southeast. We went inside and told my boyfriend, who laughed at us. Then one of my other children suggested we draw what we saw (the triangular thing) in opposite rooms. We did and the pictures are identical. This concerns me as I've had weird things happen to me all my life - playing with strange objects in my room as a small child (that no one else ever knew about as they visited me at 3 a.m. or so), a triangle cut into my back in the middle of the night (as with a laser) that I never felt happen, a metal rod instered into my heel that I never remember the trauma of receiving (showed up on an x ray).",2008-10-31T00:00:00,32.36501233766234,-88.64420324675325

Felton Delaware I was going to go pick up my friend and this thing that looked like an airplane flew over my car in the driveway really, really, low.  It had about 8 huge headlights that were white and really bright and a blinking red light in the center of it.  I actually stopped to look at it because it was so strange.  When I went and got my friend I told her about it and she said I was stupid.  On our way back to my house I pointed it out to her and it was hovering over some woods on my road, it was very big.  My friend started freaking out and I tried to follow it.  When I stopped in the neighborhood next to mine to sit and watch for it, I was outside my other friend’s house and told him to come outside.  He came outside and we stood and waited for it to appear, at this point all of it’s white head lights were off, and we could only see the blinking read light.  All of the sudden the thing turned around and all of the lights were back on.  It was headed straight towards us and was still very low so I got back in my car and went home to tell my parents.  I recorded it on my cell phone but it is a very shaky picture because I was nervous.

Near mile marker 31 I stopped and parked facing west next to a white gate on the south side of the road.  Immediately after putting the vehicle in park I looked out my front passenger side window facing north and watched 4 lights in a diamond shape configuration moving south in unison then change direction traveling east.  I noticed the time was 1:25am.  They were solid white amber lights facing down toward the ground. The lights did not blink or flash or change color. I stepped outside of my vehicle and watched the lights with a pair of binoculars and did not notice anything different as for changing colors or flashing lights.  I kept watching with and without binoculars as it traveled in an easterly direction.  Then as I looked again for it with my binoculars I noticed a bright flash of white light thru the binoculars.  I did not see the source of the flash or where it emanated from but it did appear to come from the direction the lights were traveling in.  I was unable to keep track of these lights because they flew behind the horizon of a hill about a ½ mile just to the north of where I stood.   My friend on the passenger seat observed the lights in motion and the sudden bright flash of white light.   I have been a outdoorsman my whole life and know this region very well.  I am very familiar with aircraft because aircraft is a hobby and so is the night sky.   There was not a cloud anywhere in the sky that night.  And I don’t know what the heck caused that bright flash of light to occur.  It was just like a flash of lighting at night going off in the distance is what the flash of light resembled.   Even with binoculars I never got the impression or suggestion that “ahh…its an airplane or a jet…”.   It was different and certainly something I had never witnessed before.   This great little experience lasted no more than 2 minutes.  After this occurred I got back insi! de the v ehicle and turned around to travel east to look for these lights about a ½ mile to a mile from where I was parked to get away from the hill that blocked our view and was unable to find these lights again.  Below is a simple sketch of the light configuration I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

It was a bright, yellowish light, far brighter than any star in the sky. It seemed to be at high altitude, but I can't be positive as we could easily see it move back and forth ahead of us. During the first 10 minutes of observing, it would be bright and then dim itself until you could not see it anymore. It would then light itself back up in a different area of the sky than it was before. After the 'cycles' it stayed brightly lit and hovered around. We seemed to get fairly close to it at times while driving, but not close enough to identify a shape. My friends claimed to see a seperate light protude from it at one point, but I did not witness this as I was sitting on the other side of the backseat during that time.

It all started in the same kind of fashion.  I as well was being entertained with the neighbors fireworks, when all of the sudden what appeared to be a plane on fire was in the sky in front of me.  the reason I say on fire was because of the unusual orange lights.  Since I've never seen anything like it I immediately thought of fire. It appeared that the front right engine was on fire because of the concentration of light on that area. The lights were very bright but thats when things got strange. One why would lights on a plane if not fire be pointing upword more than down.  Two at that point it was moving so slowly just a straight path no funny movements but I'm still thinking plane on fire . Then I realized NO NOISE which would mean the plane should be coming down (no sound = no engine). But in fact it stayed at the same highth the whole time. I told my nephew to go get everybody else they had to see this.  The ""plane"" was directly above us at this time. still no noise. But maintained an altitude of what I assumed even using a single engine plane for reference of about 10-15,000ft. My GF was amaized at what she saw, normally being the skeptical one, so much so that she didn't want it to scare the children so she took them inside. once the ""plane"" was past it just all of the sudden disappeared... Now I know it was nothing that I have or will ever see again knowing that it wasn't identifiable by me.  After it disappeared I actually hopped on my Motorcycle and went to the Clark County Airport expecting to see some type of search plane which is normally done in a single engine plane crash but they acted like they saw nothing.

I was taking photographs on 7/7/08 at approximately 8:07pm of the view from my balcony. The sun was just going down and the moon was visible at one end of the sky and the sun setting behind some mountains on the other side. There was not a cloud in the sky. It was still light out (sea blue sky). After taking the initial photo I checked it in the review screen (digital camera)and saw that there was an object in the picture that did not appear to have been in the sky at the time I took the picture, or afterwards, when I checked the sky.  I took 4 more photos and the craft is present in 3 of the shots. In the remaining 2 there is a cloud that seems to have ""absorbed"" the craft. Upon enlarging the photos and examining the details, I found that this almost perfectly circular cloud was present to the lower right of the craft in all of the photos that had the craft in them.  Upon examining the photos in the order they were taken, in the first three, the craft seems to have moved in a v pattern in the sky. Then in the fourth the cloud becomes prominent and the craft is gone. This is more evident in the fifth shot, where the cloud is seen very prominently at the top of the photo as if it was rising upwards.  The following night I took more photographs of the same area and although I did in fact capture this cloud once again, the same craft does not appear to have been present at that time. Although two smaller objects, that were present in the 7/7/08 shots, were in fact visible and were photographed on this day as well. I did visibly see in the sky, which did not move in conjunction with regular star patterns.  Upon enlargement of the 7/7/08 photos, what may be the most clear view of an unknown craft can be seen. It appears to have changed its alignment in all three photos. In one it appears to be two diamond shaped objects that are connected at some center point. There is a light on each side (almost as if a flame exhaust) that obscures detail of the craft and it is a brilliant white in the center with a almost electric blue peaking at the top and at the bottom.  In the second photograph, the vessel is more prominent and appears to be more like two Isosceles triangles on the sides connected by a tube or cone like center. The lighting on the craft is more of a greenish white on both sides at what would be the base of the triangles, which escalates into a definite electric blue at the tips. the center seems to be reflecting the light from the sides. the final photo (which is actually the second) gives the clearest view of all. It would appear to be two side propulsion elements attached to a main structure in the center. The sides appear to be shaped like the front of a clothes iron with the exact detail of the center is definitely rounded in some way, but is obscured somewhat by the light emanating from the sides. The entire craft has a green glow to it, that seems to come from two dome like elements atop the side structures. They glow the color of a green GE ""party bulb""and have an electric blue ""aura"" above them. i would like to include a website where the pictures have been posted as well as a video I am in the process of making with closeup shots of the craft, however to keep anonymity, I obviously can not. I will check this site more closely to see if there is some way I can link the site to this site or have the link posted.  I have over 1000 photographs of the same area and am diligently examining all them ( I have already found additional images that may contain a similar, or the same object and/or its lighting track.) This is absolutely not lens glare a reflective surface or any other such camera ""tricks"" that are frequently attributed to such photos. The photos were all taken at 100 ISO which would have required the objects to be remaining relatively still (or moving very slow) due to the shutter speed. Photographs of airplanes moving through the air taken at this setting, will appear as a streak of light in the sky.  I have your e-mail and will submit some photos to add to this report after they have been properly processed.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

It was a large metallic object that just hovered for over 30 minutes On Monday, July 7th, I was moving into my dad's house, as I was putting stuff into my room my dad yelled for me and my brother to come outside and look at something.  As we came outside to see what he was talking about he pointed.  We all just stared, trying to figure out what it was.  My first thought, by the weird shape it was, is that it was a kite. It was just hovering, then I realized there was very little wind (pretty much none), so I ran inside to grab the camera so we could get a better look.  After trying to get a good look at it, we realized it was too far away for a good picture of it, so my brother ran inside to grab the binoculars. When he was grabbing the binoculars we went into the back to have a better view, without the house in the view. My brother came outside with them and all of us were looking through them in disbelief. We noticed one of our neighbors that lived on the other side of the pond was out fishing, which is a teacher from our community, and asked him if he had noticed it. He responded by saying ""yes, but what is it?"" He observed for a few minutes then went inside. I suggested calling a news station to report it but they would probably think we are nuts, so we called the local police station to ask if anyone has reported a strange aircraft in the sky. They had told us no and to call the F.F.A., we didn't want to go that far but proceeded to call the local airport, but there was no answer. My dad ended up taking a couple of picture of it to see what we could get out of it. As it started to get dark we had noticed it had changed directions a little and started to shift. When it started to disappear my brother and dad went to go chase after it down one road running east and west and I went to another road a mile away running the same direction so we could try to keep it in eyes sight but it was gone. The funny thing is, is that this was during the daylight, plains were flying lower than it was hovering, and there was nothing in the paper or the news about it. I wou! ldn't sa y i wasn't a believer, but I was a skeptic on things such as U.F.O.s and now seeing what I had saw,and then seeing pictures that had been taken and downloaded on the computer it was obvious the shape it was, was like nothing I had ever seen before, it was extremely quiet, there was no motors or propellers. The best two ways I can describe it, is that one way it looked like a fighter jet nose, then behind where the cockpit would be, it was twisted, then the wings, of whatever it was, was almost in a v shape but not quite, it looked like a piece of metal was crunched up and it came out to be in a crumpled but smooth v shape. It is so hard to explain. The other way I can describe it, it looked like a goose flying, but 10,000 times larger and it definitely appeared to be metallic and had straight lines. I will be keeping my eye on the sky but not to become obsessed about it.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,39.727,-85.8908

It had a green light at one side a red one at the immediate opposite and an amber light on the bottom with a amber an red flashing one on what looked like the top.

Then when I pulled off the road it started to head north but the lights were still where they were at first, as if it didn’t even turn around.  So I went to my parents house down the road where I was headed anyway but when I got them to come outside it wasn’t in sight from there house and that’s where it ended.  But when I saw it moving it was way too slow to be a plane and there was no noise like a helicopter, but way too small to be a blimp.

The objects would form a line and then transition to a circular formation and back to a v-type formation.

The formation began to move in slightly different directions, even stopping at one point.  The changes of direction were not drastic, but certainly enough for me to notice. The objects moved in a very ""mechanical"" fashion in that the movements were smooth yet deliberate (if that makes sense).

First time I seen this thing was about two years ago in 2007. The shape of this thing looked like two crome balls about the size of a giant beach ball, (from the distance that we were from this object, which seemed to be about a football field away), These two balls had what looked like electricity circling around each one, I say electricity because we could here like a buzzing sound from it, and these two balls would fly together one above the other and at some instances join together and form one ball and then back to two, and when they would split we could here like an electrical popping sound. also it seemed to be scanning the area beneath it cause we could see very faint beams of light shooting out from it,(looked like 10 beams in all). This thing would be right in front of us and in about 2 seconds it would look it was as far as the stars. I've seen this thing a couple of times since but not as close as the first time. Now as in right now I can walk ou! tside my house and look up at the sky and see about hundred of those things and who knows how many more are out there but something is going on cause every night I see more and more of them. You can spot them out pretty easy. Whenever you see a star and it looks like two side by side its one of those things and they're not that far up, some are but every day more of them get lower and there is one main one that sits the lowest and is the shiniest one out of all. If you have a bright laser, (I use a green laser) you can point it at them and watch them move out of the way of it.

Out of nowhere a gigantic, extremely bright circular blue light appeared over the Piedmont cemetary.  It was so bright and sudden that we both at the same time said ""Whoah what is that!""  It was easy to see the light there because the cemetary is one of the only areas in the cityscape that is completely black at night.  At first i thought it could be cops in the cemetary shining lights or a helicopter, but after about 1 second it was obvious that it was neither. The light was huge, bright blue, circular, and had defined edges. It even lit up some of the trees directly around it. Then for a split second it looked like there could be two circles.  This only lasted for about 3 seconds and just as fast as the huge light had appeared it disappeared.  Then the weirdest part happened.  About 1-2 seconds after the circle(s) disapp! eared, another blue circle (or possibly the same one) appeared at least one mile away to the south.  This time it was merely a flash for about one second after which it disappeared for good.  I cant stress how huge and bright blue this circle of light was, and how defined its shape was.  Looking at the view it was about the size of one of the houses around it.  I couldnt see any sort of craft, just the bright solid light light.

PD)) I went to sleep at 7am in the morning.  I had a dream that my parents bought a new house and then a friend and I where checking out a room in the house. The room had a back sliding door (glass).  We went outside for some reason and down from the sky past a tree with no leaves a bunch of these tiny balls floated down. well they didnt float they descended down under their own power it seemed but slowly.they started out as barely visible dots in the sky.  These balls looked to be about 10 inches in diameter maybe a little bigger.  The balls I saw were see through navy- light blue that looked plastic with a solid orange core about 3-4 inches in diameter.  They floated around us and we ran inside. One of the balls managed to get in and i picked it out of the air with both my hands cuped around the bottom of the ball.  I dont remember it feeling like plastic or not like plastic, i just remember it feeling like a smooth surface thats how plastic probably feels im sure.  It was very light pretty much weightless.  Anyways it came in and I picked it out of the air and put it outside quickly because i was freaking out on some calm level. when i tryed to shove it outside I closed the door while i was putting it out there so it couldnt get back in kind of what someone would do if they we putting a bug outside. when i put it out it seemed like it tried to get back in as it was ascending but couldnt fit through the 3 inch crack of the door. It ended up going straight up and over the house and the gutter. After that in my dream i was trying to call the police but i couldnt for some reason. Then this is the seemingly fake part that makes me think it really was just a dream. It was a dream but ever since i woke up it just felt so real i have never had such a realistic dream in my life ok heres the fake part. After the ball went over the house i went to the front of the house and there was this small auditorium facing a bunch of glass doors not sliding ! doors like in the back of the house but like office building d! oors. th e seats were facing the front doors. On one of the seats of the auditorium was this sprinkler head looking thing spewing out some kind of dark smoke on two side as it was spinning. it was deployed from one of the balls im pretty sure, so then i grabbed it off the back of the seat and threw it outside onto the ground. Then for some reason the auditorium was full of young to middle age people after i turned back from throwing the sprinkler looking thing out the front door. I remember this all vividly and perfectly but the end part is a little hazy. I remember telling anyone around me to call the police and the military. The police never showed up but i do remember a military guy wearing a decked out military navy blue uniform with lots of metals like you would see on a navy officers coat. Most of the metal were on his left breast like in real life. The military guy was the only one in uniform and he was in the front row of the full auditorium standing up looking at me along wi! th a few others in the front row standing up. He was the only one that stuck out in my mind. This all was probably just a dream. All my logical tells me it was just a dream but my emotions and feelings and body tell me it was real. It was so vivid, it seemed so real and it still does, even while typing this up 3 hours after I had this dream. I have never seen or heard about these types of blue balls with the orange centers so i dont know where i would get the idea about them. very strange. After i woke up i looked outside to see if they were out there and thinking that they would be; there was nothing. This was not at all dissappointing i hope to god it was not real it really freaked me out. I was scared when the balls came down the only reason i grabed the one and put it outside is because no one else was going to so i had to and i feared for my life. same with the sprinkler thing i thought it was trying to harm me in some way. It was probably just a dream but if not i don! t want to see it again and for that matter i hope i never drea! m about it again. disturbing.  I appologize for wasting anyones time for reading this if it was just a dream. I just felt like i really really had to tell someone about this and see if anyone has had a similar dream or experience. i looked on the internet to see if these ball things were common but i couldnt find any thing similar. thank you for your time.",2009-12-12T00:00:00,39.5744,-76.5928

But, the lights were much too large and they were quite high above the horizon, and I believe my mind was trying to be “logical” about what my eyes were seeing. I watched these two lights moving at the same distance apart and slowly down until they were below the ridge and out of my eyesight. I believe that I watched them for a couple of minutes.

Between 6:15 to about 6:23  I left my office at around 6:10 PM.  I am about 3 miles from home.  As I was driving down the main street I notice three lights in the sky in a straight line. The sky is typical heavy traffic area for planes heading to the St. Louis Airport, which is approximately 27 miles east of this occurrence. What caught my eye was these lights were spread apart quite a bit, but consistent in distance and they were in a straight line and blinking in sequential order (1-2-3, etc.)  I thought that perhaps that what I was seeing was a tower of some sort that I didn’t notice before because it would be abnormal to see places flying in this formation.  Plus, these planes were not headed towards the airport, nor were they, from my position; coming from the direction of the main airport.  That’s why I thought they could be tower lights that warn low flying planes at night. But, that was not the case. As I continued down the main road (which is a busy road) I stretched to see them out my front and passenger window.  I don’t ever recall seeing lights like this as a steady fixture, so I was trying to think of what it could be.  Once I lost sight of the lights, since they were in my blind spot, I continued on and entered into my neighborhood.  Once I am in my neighborhood I have to back track towards where I came from to get to my house.  That’s when I saw the lights again.  It was clear that it was not a tower as they appeared to be moving west. I ran in the house, asked my husband to go outside in the back yard and tell me what that is in the sky.  I didn’t even turn off my car or park it in the garage as I wanted him to see this and explain what it was that I was seeing before it was out of our sight line.  He is a 23-year military veteran and very familiar with various military air craft.   Looking through the bare trees in our yard, he said he didn’t know, but was sure that military planes wouldn’t fly in such as straight line with lights that blinked sequentially.  I went in and grabbed the camera and went out front of the house to see if I could get a better view.  A house was blocking the view, so we got in the car.  We figured we could get to an open space and at least be able to get a better view. Both of us thought to head west as that’s where it seem to be going towards, and we were going down a road that had  a wide open view of the sky.  We should have at least been able to see the object in the distance, but we drove a few miles and saw nothing but the normal air traffic that is common. This was in a busy area, so I think that my husband and I can't be the only one to see this!  IF there is a logical explanation, it would be nice to know what that was flying over Missouri.",2010-02-14T00:00:00,38.8251,-90.7289

I was parked across from N.H.'s house on 1st Avenue, while my children walked their paper route nearby. I had the car stereo on so didn't hear anything (window closed). I was thinking how the sky was still rather cloudy but had a few clear patches, and I was wondering about how the upcoming weather would be. My eyes were drawn to what I thought might be a ""falling star"" but it was greenish-yellow glowing ('emerald green') It did make me think of something burning up after entering atmosphere as it was far higher than a flare might reach. I wondered about meteor showers but thought they'd come in multiples. It lasted maybe 3-5 seconds, long enough for me to form some thoughts and wonder about it 	There was a plane trail quite far to thte left of where this occurred, but unrelated I think (The plane's path was towards the Coquihalla and Vancouver). One bright star was visible to the left of where I was the light show. The falling trajectory was not straight down, but at an angle. Account 2: (Son, 13)  The yellowish-green sphere fell over the music fest area. It glowed yellow and green. It was around 5:00 pm. It was kind of 3-d. There were clouds behind it. It didn't make the clouds glow (no reflection), the clouds which were a medium distance behind it. No foreshortening on the side opposite the direction of movement. Like a falling star, falling across the sky. Nothing was heard, no sounds. Definitely a single light. No airplane trails. Lasted six seconds from the time I looked up to see it.

It was Saturday, February 7. I was out to dinner with my parents and children in Belmar, New Jersey. We were leaving a restaurant, and getting in the car. We were parked just next to the inlet, where Belmar borders Avon-by-the Sea. It was about 7:30 PM.  Right over the water, in the softly clouded evening sky, were four “fuzzy” edged looking white lights in formation about 15-30 feet across from each other, making a large box or diamond shape. They appeared to be about 300-500 feet up – not very far away from the bridge watchman’s tower.  They were faint, but you could see them.  They were silently moving in pattern, almost like a clover, but not continuously in a circular rhythm. Sometime they would stop still, staying an even amount of space apart, in their symmetry. Sometimes, two of them would cross, or come together, then quickly dart back to an exact perimeter but never leaving the initial “box"".  Unlike event/publicity floodlights, there was NO beam of light coming up from the ground, making a visible line up to the sky. I tried to take pictures with my camera phone, but I am not sure if anything has come out – the globes were so faint against the sky.  My parents and children saw them as well. The children were actually scared.  We stood out in the parking lot while I took several photos. We got in the car and drove westward. The lights seemed to follow us. I could see them hovering now over Shark River, but they seemed to be higher up, and larger at this point. As we curved south along Route 35, and made a right on Belmar Boulevard, they stayed over Shark River. I saw them until about Camp Evans then they were out of sight as I moved westward to my parents home.  I drove back to Bradley Beach 2o minutes later the time now 20:00 hrs., and the lights were still there along the same route over the Marconi  area of Shark River. They were even more faint though. By the time I got further north towards Bradley Beach, and away from Shark River – they were gone.

I was outside alone enjoying the warm weather. The sun was shining brightly and there were no clouds in the sky.   I was looking up at the sky in a northeast direction with my back to the sun.  I saw what looked like a flock of white birds flying in an oblong circular formation around one single bird. As this is nothing strange to see in the country, I started to notice that the ""birds"" had no wings. Also, they were flying much too high to actually be birds. After closer inspection, they now appeared to be silvery white egg-shaped orbs. This realization happened within the first ten seconds of seeing them.  As I looked closer, I could tell that the central ""bird"" was much shinier than the others. Then they broke their formation and started to dart out in all directions, flying around in circles on their own. Each craft circled and stayed relatively within its own zone. This happened about 40-50 seconds after I had begun watching them.  At this point, I counted nine of them, including the shinier central one.   Then they began to move in a different series of maneuvers. They began to spread out more; flying closer back to the center and then farther out again. Then, in another change of maneuvers, they started to scramble all over the sky.  At about 90 seconds into my sighting, they started flying in what seemed to be straight lines jetting out from one another and making very abrupt and sharp turns. At this point, I started to think I should run and get my camera, but I had become so amazed by what I was seeing that I could not tear myself away. I quickly turned in a circle to view 360 degrees of the sky around me in case there were more of them. I then quickly turned back and started to watch the crafts. They started looking farther and farther away from me.  This was about two minutes into my sighting. At which point, the one that was farthest to the left disappeared.  Then, about five seconds later, the one farthest to the right disappeared as well. This now left seven egg shaped orbs to remain, still looking very white and silvery gray.  Then the orb that was closest to the bottom of their dissassembling  formation disappeared. Then the two that had been above the center one disappeared.  While the last four orbs remained, three of them made a formation in the shape of a pyramid, or triangle with the point on top surrounding the shiniest one in the center. Suddenly, all three orbs in the triangle formation disappeared. The only one left, the one that seemed to have a metallic almost aluminum shine to it, darted left, then right, then down, then up, then back to the center point. Suddenly it just disappeared. As I stood still staring up at the sky, I then started to realize that I had seen something very out of the ordinary, and that I might have just witnessed a UFO sighting. At that point, roughly two minutes after the last orb disappeared, three grey military jets, coming from the west, flew by in a spread out formation all flying in the same direction and at the same altitude where I had seen the orbs.  The middle jet flew right into what could be considered the center of the orbs’ flight pattern. The jets also appeared to slow down a bit once they got to the exact area the orbs had been. Once the jets flew by and I could see where they were in the sky, I gauged that their altitude must have been somewhere between six and ten thousand feet.  It is also important to note that all three military jets were letting off huge chem trails. After a few minutes the sky filled with long, thin and spreading clouds. I saw birds were now in the sky and I could tell that the wind was again blowing. It is not strange to see any airplanes fly by at a very high altitude, or see one of the many small ultralites or hobby planes flying at a low altitude. After living in this area for the last 20+ years, I have witnessed many varied aircraft on their way to and from the Oshkosh EAA annual Fly-In as well as normal air traffic. The only times I have seen low flying military jets in this area is when they are on their way to the EAA annual Fly-In or some other public event.",2009-03-19T00:00:00,,

Even though it was of a light quality I had never before seen, I assumed it was one of my other brothers shining a light in my face. I ignored it and was about to go to sleep when my dad walked up the stairs and asked if we had been messing around with a strobe light.He then thought that maybe a police helicopter or swat team was searching for somebody. It was then we all concurred that we saw something extremely odd. We all walked toward the window and then again, this time only about 5 seconds, and it vanished. We could see nothing else in the sky because the whole sky lighted up, but the beam branched out to concentrate in out attic. We have never seen anything like that before or since.

At first I dismissed it as an airliner since it was close to the typical flight path of passenger jets I often see flying overhead.  What caught my attention however was that I DID see an airliner and at that point I could compare/contrast the two.  The bright orange light had no blinking navigation lights, no spot lights, and was easily traveling 3-4x the speed of the jet – on which the blinking lights were very evident.  There was no evidence that the orange light was aware of the jet or visa-versa.  The light traveled from south to north-east crossing the night sky in about 30 seconds at about a max of 40 degrees elevation.  The color was a very distinct orange that never wavered.  The flight path seemed constant, but the distance away was hard to determine.  There was a faint sound of jet engines but since there was another plane in the sky I could not pinpoint the source. My next thought was that this could be the ISS which I have taken time to spot a few times with my son.  So as soon as the light passed behind the tree I did a quick online check and verified there are no ISS sightings for our location for a few more days.  And since the shuttle flight was canceled yesterday, there was no need to check its flight path. So all that said, I still cannot dismiss it as satellite or even a very high-flying advanced aircraft of some type.  It did remind me greatly of other ISS passings and being about an hour before sunrise, a satellite makes sense.  However, the speed, brightness, and orange hue were unique enough for me to submit a report.",2008-10-31T00:00:00,37.369108797653965,-79.18785337243402

The sky was semi-clear with a few occasional clouds.  As I  looked up a saw a light hovering – not overhead – but in front of me, probably about the height of a airplane midway down to landing.   The thing that caught my attention was that this light wasn’t moving – it literally was hovering.  As I walked along and got focused on the light it looked like a star-shaped light (individual lights in the shape) at the bottom that were blinking/rotating.  I thought it was odd as I have never in my 52 years seen something in the sky that resembled this kind of light.  After a few minutes of staring at this light a cloud went over it.  When the light reappeared it then looked like there were two sets of star-shaped lights that were blinking and rotating.

Tampa Palms (North Tampa) Florida on Bruce B. Downs at Super Walmart.  I was walking out of WALMART, and I saw a bubble... or so I thought. At first it seemed to be about 25 feet off the ground and about 50' ahead of me. I kept walking toward it to where my car was... and as I stared at the bubble I wondered ""how would a bubble survive out here too long? I walked expecting to see it burst any second. It didn't. As I watched it... I then saw it wasn't a bubble at all as it started to get almost above me. I stood next to my car. The attached photo is my Photoshop rendering of what I saw, and its pretty accurate.  It had been cloudy and drizzy, and there was a low canopy of clouds. I noticed it had two round looking lights and a lighter third in front. No lights blinking. The lights were very clear, and not like you'd expect headlights on a plane. I listened for sound and heard nothing. Then I suspected I was seeing something unusual. I then checked and nothing blinking, no stobe, no red beacon. The lights were not REAL bright but were very pronounced resolution-wise... without halo or atmospheric glaring quality. The blueish round lights seem to be directional, like laser light travels, defined. The seemed about 2.5 or 3 feet in diameter. Then as it started to get over top and past Walmart I knew it was not a plane or chopper. I suspected it was a Black Triangle and I watched to see SOMETHING that would reveal it. Then... it slowed down very gradually... and before it had a chance to STOP... it ascended straight up. I appeared to travel UP faster than it did since I spotted it traveling a horizotal flight path. As it moved up, the position of the lights stayed fixed... meaning that it didn't turn nose up to ascend. The bottom stayed facing the earth. It went up what looked like around 700-1000' until it pierced the cloud cover and disappeared.  It made no noise. I detected no outline/SHAPE to it... but the lights suggested a triangle. A plane climbing like that would have made noise!!! This thing moved silent;y and very SMOOTHLY. It matched the Triangle video taped at Wesley Chapel a couple months ago... VERY close... minus the blinking read light and the bottom lights were a wider diameter.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,28.1532756097561,-82.48028585365853

It also seemed to move slowly up and down and left to right in a series of right angle patterns. The object was surrounded by stationary helicopters in a rectangular formation (they were easy to see with their red blinking lights and were not airliners heading to Dulles or National airports which we've seen before). A few times at least one or two helicopters moved closer to the object at which time it would decrease its glow.  I grabbed my camcorder and recorded between 10 to 15 minutes of footage, first by hand from the bedroom window, then using a steady tripod outside in our cul-de-sac. When I zoomed in the object was distinctly diamond shaped with pulsating light moving across the object in a circular motion (white, red, yellow, and greenish). The light was not sequential as if a series of lights were being lit but more like a morphing prism of blended light colors rolling into each other.  I've never seen anything like this in the six or more years I've lived at this address (or anywhere else for that matter) and we routinely see jets, helicopters, and even the occasional blimp overhead as we live about 5 miles north of the Quantico Marine Base and 10 miles south of Fort Belvoir. We also live along the flight paths of Reagan National and Dulles International airports. So, we have a pretty good idea of what normally appears in the sky around our home which is why this just stood out as something very unusual.  As for the weather conditions, other than being a bit humid, the sky was crystal clear and the moon was clearly visible behind me to the southeast as I filmed the object which was northeast of our house. Other stars and aircraft (including the previously mentioned helicopters) were also clearly visible and easy to distinguish from the glowing diamond-shaped object in question.  As for my background, I work for a major university in Washington, DC with a long career in media and public affairs. My wife and I have a fairly decent knowledge of the night sky and the various aircraft in the area and frequently observe meteor showers, shooting stars when they are forecast for our area (not too mention extended viewings of the Hale-Bopp Comet when we lived in North Carolina) which really made this object all that more unusual to us.",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,

I drove for a couple more seconds then looked again out of curiosity and noticed it was moving towards Springville and not the Buffalo airport and that the lights were constant and not flashing. This observation caused me to slow down to almost a stop, now my curiosity was peaked, what could this be I thought. So I figured after another couple seconds of driving to just stop and watch it. I pulled over and put on the emergency flashers and got out of my car and climbed on to the roof to get a better view. This craft seemed to moved very slowly for about 5 minutes and then suddenly it stopped moving over what seemed liked woods from my point of view.

There was no noise. All of a sudden, a red orb appears directly below the white orb and starts flying around at incredible speed. I watched for several seconds in disbelief and then ran upstairs to grab my camera, which has a crappy video mode also. I was able to capture about 15 seconds (the limit on my camera) of the red orb (the white one wasn't easily visible against the backdrop of the stars). I could tell the two objects were miles away, but the red orb moved across the lake in a split second - it must have been moving at thousands of miles per hour. Soon afterwards the red orb appeared to go above the white, stationary orb and then disappeared from view. I was shocked. The video attached is very low quality and only the red orb is visible moving around.

The object seemed to be triangular or saucer shaped, with one big yellow light and a small smaller light either side. The base had many small lights which were moving and gave the impression that the object was spinning.  I am very nervous about describing the object because it appeared to change it's form a few times as it drew closer.

I have no idea what it was but I do know that it is impossible that anything from this planet to travel at this speed or change direction so easily. Estimated speed 5000 mph ?  My friend lives near there and noticed it come back after 15 minutes to repeat the actions previously listed. It was hovering around for about 30 minutes this time presumably because there were no car headlights around ?",2008-08-12T00:00:00,,
