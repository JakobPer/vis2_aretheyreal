I also see the planes climbing out of Hayward Airport just to my south.  And I see the eastbound traffic from San Francisco International, straight across the bay from me.  So I'm familiar with air traffic and their procedures in this area. The ufo was about a mile and a half to the EAST, looking up the opposide direction of my street, which looks towards the Hayward hills.  The ufo was, from my perspective, slightly higher than the telephone pole at the end of the street. At first, I thought it was a large jet about to turn and head south to Fremont, where they make a u-turn onto the final approach to Oakland.  But the lights were all bright red.  And not blinking. I could only see the lights. I couldn't tell if they were part of one craft or five seperate, individual lights. It was the size of a 747 and in the shape of a capitol A or triangle, if you prefer.  One red light at the top.  One at each crosspiece and one at the bottom of each leg. It was flying towards me, but then unexpectantly stopped and held position.

At approximately 8:30 am, Dec 12, 2015, I was outside my home, waiting for a co-worker to pick me up for work.  It was a very mild & breezy morning & the sky was mostly clear except for some clouds here and there.  As I'm usually want to do when outside,I enjoy the nice sky.  This morning I noticed an airliner very high up, at a guess anywhere between 10-20,000 feet traveling in a roughly east east-westerly direction.  As a I watched it, a glint of light far behind it caught my eye.  I suddenly saw 5 gleaming spherical objects trailing the airliner going the same direction at approximately 1-1+1/2 miles.  The objects were keeping pace with the airliner & were in a ""diamond"" type formation with the closest object behind the airliner being the ""bottom tip"" of the diamond & the other four, one each, at the ""points"" of the diamond.  All objects traveled in the exact same direction & were equidistantly spread apart one from another, perhaps hund! reds of feet.  At no time during the brief sighting did they speed up, slow down, change direction, move away from their positions or ""phase"" out of view.  I immediately ruled out the possibility of high flying birds as all the objects were visibly flying, at some points, ABOVE the highest cloud layer, which the airliner was also doing.  If they were birds at that height (which as a far as I know, birds don't fly that high) they would've been far too small to see with the naked eye & certainly would not reflect a metallic gleam as these objects did.  Also, being that far above a cloud layer that high, as I saw their shape, they would've been FAR too large to be birds.   If I had to guess  at their size at that distance in order to be seen from the ground the way I did, they would've had to have been at least a hundred feet in diameter apiece.   As mentioned, the sighting was very brief, merely a minute and a half or so.  I was anxiously awaiting my co-workers arrival to h!elp me verify my sighting but sadly, he arrived literally a few seconds after they & the airliner they were tailing, all disappeared into the distance.  If anyone has seen these objects at nearly the same time I did, I would very much like the corroboration.

The lights disappeared at 20:52 and further recordings showed no more lights in the same area as our first recording with the two lights.

To Whom It May Concern,   For the last five days, November 13, 2015 – November 18, 2015, my father and I have been observing several pairs and trios of lights moving in the night sky over Manchester, Connecticut, USA. They move in all directions without any visible signs of turning, and the behavior is unlike that of an Airliner or meteorite entering the atmosphere.  The points of light appear to move in unison, with one brighter point always leading a dimmer tail end. We've watched them for between 10 – 60 minutes, and have used a telescope during several of these viewings, just to be absolutely positive, the first night we chased one across the sky with the telescope, as it wouldn't stay still.  During a couple of these viewings, we could clearly see lights alternating between blue and red, which initially lead me to believe these were airplanes, but with further observation I noticed they did not in fact behave at all like any jet I've seen, moving in any direction at will, as I've said before, seemingly without turning. Just tonight we observed three of these pairs/trios as of 1:50 am, and on 11/15/2015 we witnessed no less than five.

Another bright light reappeared nearby the other.  One left its location and slowly crossed the sky.  It decreased in brightness and traveled east to west.  If you split the sky in 18 sections, it would cross one of these in a little less than a minute.  Planes flew by but were fast and not nearly as bright as even the traveling UFO.  The light they emitted was pure white.  When they traveled they usually got dimmer.  I took off my glasses and the only light I could see in the sky, including stars, were these lights. We starred at them freaking out with excitement for an hour.  They would occasionally disappear and reappear in a nearby location.  My boyfriend and I argued of what he thought was a plane at about 8 o’clock.  It had two very dim white lights flashing very close in proximity and moved faster than the UFO’s before.  I convinced him that it was a UFO because the lights were not consistent in spacing.  They also would fly back and forth from east to west. Also I do not know if it was just me because I was wearing glasses, but they individually appeared to be elongated vertically.  The light looked like it came to a small point and expanded to the rest of the light. It was very subtle, but he said he could kind of see it too. We ended up leaving before they were gone.

Deep Cove UFO sighting: Jan 6, 2016. Personal background I am an adult, part time artist, living in Deep Cove, North Vancouver.  I have lived in the area of Deep Cove, in North Vancouver, B.C. for most of my life, around 25 + years.  To give a brief description of my personal background I believe in peace on Earth, and aim to contribute my energies there.  Lately, more than before in previous years I have been seeing objects floating in the night sky that are hard to identify or even explain.  Many of these experiences have been UFO sightings. Description of the UFO sighting I witnessed with my father on the night of Thursday, Jan 6th, 2016, at approx. 9:30 pm.:    At approx. 9:30pm, as my father and I were sitting at the benches on the hillside next to the proximity of the kayaking facility/rental business, just south, facing north of Panorama Park, in downtown Deep Cove, we both witnessed a massive unidentified floating object, or disc, hovering at the height of approx. 100 - 200 meters above sea level; floating absolutely silently over the Marina, initially appearing from behind Seymour Mountain.  It had at first appeared at the top of the mountain peak, near beside a popular look out - Quarry Rock. This object was round or disc shaped, appearing dark in color. When it first appear, however, it was just a singular light.  Then it proceeded to leave the area coming over the Marina, directly hovering over the ocean (cove inlet).  It stayed there for at least a minute, shining its lights (which was initially just one singular, then became three lights, then became multiple). As the object descended from the mountain over the ocean, it expanded and became a massive round shaped disc, approx. 10 or more times the size in diameter - to that of the moon the in sky- multiplying its array of displayed visible lights, to approx. over one dozen bright lights.  The lights at first were the same size and large, and as the object expanded over the ocean and became a larger disc shape, the lights became different shapes and sizes (large-round & small-square), and were arranged in symmetry around the object’s outer edge.  Pattern of the lights around the edge: was one large-round light, then three to four little ones, then one large one, etc. At this point the UFO then proceeded to shine these lights out in all directions.  The light itself was very bright and powerful, but not seemingly blinding.  It was a contained light, and not ‘radiating’ outward, but ‘concentrated’, spotting certain areas. My father and I were both facing north at the time of the sighting, and were both standing at approx. 30 feet above sea level.  There was a thick fog in the sky.  Although I have a hard time recalling if it was in fact clear out, or if there was stars visible.  The photo we snapped appears to have many star like lights in the image.

She remembered that this thing became visible, and she was devastated, because she would then not be able to reach the perfect stuff.  She got upset and tried to awaken me,  I just lay still. Then, she accompanied her 'young Grey', and recalls floating above flowers and grass, a small patch, and then came face to face with an older, very large Grey.  She called him Wisdom. He then, telepathically spoke.  She told him what's she saw and what happened with the mist thing..

I think I left the top at around 5:15 to 5:30 p.m.  caused a stayed a few minutes after complete sundown to observe the red clouds, etc. •	At approx. 4:00 p.m. I laid down on my blanket on my back looking up to the sky •	Buzzards flew over •	Few air craft flew over •	And then these small white circles flew over.  I saw approx. 8 to 11. •	When I first saw the first one, I thought it was a piece of trash, high up in the sky that the wind was carrying.  Then after several more, I started waiting and looking for the next one. •	Then, I finally realized, hey, this is some sort of little white flying circles streaking across the sky.  There speed was faster than the jets that flew over, but it would be hard to guess if it was twice as fast, 3 times as fast, I’d have to have some help on that one.  but it wasn’t so fast that I couldn’t follow them, but they were moving on pretty good.  If I had to guess, I would say Mach 1 or so.. •	And, there was no sound, no exhaust, no nothing.  I small white circle going across the sky in a straight line, no varying at all.  Like it was under magnetism on an invisible magnetic bridge.  It was a straight vector. •	The last one I saw, which is the main topic of discussion here, is, that I felt like I recognized a movement that it did. •	I am an electronics trained technician/engineer guy. •	This is with in reference to how what is called how a “servo” works. •	This round white circle came from the W, SW when I saw it.  Well, it stopped and did a shimmy type of action, back and forth with small increments, within its stopped area.  It appeared to have lost its “home” position and had to briefly “re-home” itself. •	After this, it took off again at like a direct Right angle from the vector it was on, which would have put it I guess N/NW?  anyway, it looked like it was a 90 degree change of direction, from a stopped point.  Hard to tell on top of mountain laying on your back looking up and never seen anything like this before. •	It also appear to have stopped over Kerr damn when it did this, but can’t be sure because of my direction from it and the damn. •	Finally, when it took back off, it was like it went from a stopped position to a full blown standard velocity that it had when it stopped, meaning, it did not ramp up it’s speed.  It liked stopped, shimmied, then took off at a R angle, with the exact same speed.  It did not ramp up its speed when it took off from this “re-orientation stop” that it did, nor did it put on the brakes when it came to a stop and slowed down to a stop.  It was moving, stopped, started moving again in its new direction.",2015-12-10T00:00:00,,

I ran outside to see what was going on, and in the sky over us was a large glowing blue orb thing, with a huge circle of haze around it.  The blue was an intense, ultra blue. And it was night, so the sky was black.  As we watched, the orb lights seemed to be moving VERY slowly, which I guess was an indication of it being pretty high in the atmosphere.  The part of the scene we saw slowly dissipated until we couldn't make it out anymore, and the circle of haze around it disappeared.  Our friend called her grandmother who lives on the outskirts of Ramona to see if she witnessed the event, and her grandmother said yes she had been watching it for a while. She said before we saw the orb thing, she had seen some type of explosion out of the light, and she said she thinks the blue orb and haze were a result of the explosion. And the full event was over an hour.  While we were outside, I heard our neighbors all around us freaking out over the orb and they were taking pictures too. And my kids also saw a green line on the orb, but I couldn't see this with my poorer eyesight. I did capture a bit of the event on my cell phone, but it's hard to see because it was dark and the object was not extremely bright.

I noticed the first fireball while driving east on Chapman ave in the city of Orange at around 06:15.  I watched it come in and out of sight for over thirty minutes as I rode to work with my friend in her car all the way to Santa Margerita.  The fireball was heading north/northeast and had a long tail of fire.  It was about 30 degrees high at first and gradually worked its way down to about 15 degrees high after about 35 to 40 minutes when it suddenly burned out fell straight towards the ground.  The fireball turned into a large ball of smoke before it fell, and the straight tail of fire was replaced by a serpentine smoke trail.  We picked up another worker in Santa Margerita and headed towards El Toro shortly after 07:00.  I saw another fireball identical to the first and at about the same trajectory that I had last seen the first one disappear.  I thought it was the same fireball initially, and I puzzled over how it could burn out, turn to smoke, and fall from the sky only to reappear ten minutes later.  I watched this second fireball flying in the sky for about five minutes before I lost sight of it behind the hills.  I sighted Two more fireballs within a minute of losing sight of the second.  Judging by the size of the fireballs and the length of the tails, these last two fireballs were much further away than the first two and lower in the sky, but they were all heading in the same direction.  I could see what looked like a bright white light with a concave shape in front of and separate from the fire tail following directly behind it a few times and only when it appeared to be heading towards me.  It looked like a shield or something that was suspended directly in front of and well forward of a craft to protect it from burning up as it entered the atmosphere from outer space.  It was most often heading away from me, though, and it looked like a ball of fire with a burning tail.  I thought they were meteors at first, but I found out that meteors are hard to see in the daylight and usually burn out within 30 seconds when I looked to see if any one reported seeing any meteors at that time.

Just after 4:00pm Just saw a UFO from my front yard in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as I was facing towards the South/South-East.  The flying objects were located almost straight up, thousands of feet up. (25? More?  By the time the encounter was over I had observed 4 different flying objects with the 1st morphing through three very different shapes during the encounter.  (Cigar, circle, then bell- Final shape when it disappeared between flickers)   When I noticed the first object, it caught my eye by being so white and shiny there amongst the blue backdrop of the sky with a only few high altitude clouds not far off from the fast steady moving cigar shaped craft.  It was the shape of a plane fuselage without wings and moving at high speeds across the sky with no vapor trail.  I could discern no details at this moment save the shape (cigar) and a flickering color. I watched if for a minute, it was way up there past the highest clouds, small to the naked eye. A single whitish craft with slight silvery sheen around an object that’s mostly white looking although there is setting sun colored (pinky orange) flashes towards the bottom side facing the sun. (The setting sun I believe is what gave it the appearance of flickering or flashing on that side no matter what direction the craft was traveling.  It may be reflection of the setting sun upon areas of the craft as the craft spins)  (It could almost be mistaken for a plane if it were holding a steady altitude and going a normal aircraft speed which at first it was, as if mimicking a normal aircraft in speed and altitude)  So in all the cigar shaped object seemed to be flickering a weird metallic white hue about most of the craft with pink/orange flashes radiating from the bottom-front sun facing side as it moved or darted about what seems like a long ways away almost straight above my house. This thing started moving like no aircraft known to civilian science as the motions defied my minds visual knowledge of physics in action.  Everything in me screamed this motion was unnatural for machines of man.  Every cell in the core of my being knew that what I saw was not possible within my now shattered understanding of the laws of motion. This movement and motion has only been hinted at in sci-fi movies and I must say that the movements of these objects were very different than even ‘that’.  How could something survive the forces, I could only guess, were in playing upon those craft and what about the effects upon any posible biological entity. This motion from the flickering shimmering glittery pink-tinted spheres were doing some short-range fast acceleration/deceleration maneuvers, zipping and pausing and darting around almost like the motion was governed by something my mind has no concept for comparison.  Their motion was different than anything I even seen in the movies, which is what gave me such a sick odd feeling in the pit of my soul.  (I have never experienced a sensation like that, which I felt while watching these objects. Knowing I was not alone in what I saw made me feel more ‘real’ than I ever have.)  The UFO started out as one cigar shaped object flying in a straight line at very high velocity before coming to a fast stop and changing directions.  For a couple minutes it darted about instead of staying upon the course I saw it upon originally. The object moved fluidly with fast stops and starts almost like a darting hummingbird with very little curving to its flight path as you would expect from any plane or aircraft known to the US and any other nations of the world. Human craft would need to bank and arc around in a circle to change directions. This was ‘No’ plane. I have worked on many aircraft and ‘nothing’ that is not mentioned in science fiction comes close to this behavior.  These craft moved about like predatory birds dogfighting at speeds and direction changes that defy imagination. Just think of the unbelievable g-force conditions exerted. I went to the front door to call for others to come see the UFO’s. When the two other witnesses showed up I pointed up to it and noticed that it was now circular shaped and fading in and out of view while hovering and appearing to dart around in a tight area. I realized the craft I relocated, ‘This craft’ was no longer cigar shaped, but circular in appearance all darting and flickering about close to the same area I last saw the original cigar shaped craft.( Did it change or was it a different craft. When I opened the house door to get someone else to see the weird objects, I lost site of the original object). It seemed to be winking in and out and hoping from being in one place to being in another close by. My mind had a hard time believing that metal could be made to move like that. These were no known manmade objects and these flying objects were real and right there in front of us all. Then, as I am pointing at it and the others are saying how weird it was moving and with everyone looking after having located the UFO, within moments, 3 more small whitish flickering UFO objects also circular and the same size as the first, appeared out of nowhere almost on top of the first. To me, at first, the first craft I saw seemed to be winking in and out, but then I started seeing two and three winking at the same time until ‘4’ circular/sphere shaped flying objects seemed to appear into existence. (Listen to what I am SAYING. ‘They’, three new UFO’s, just appeared, right in front of our eyes. When I say appeared, I mean that the one object was there alone. ((At least there was nothing else of interest within my visual spectrum although the jet had taken off climbing in a lazy mechanical manner flying a southerly direction with these UFO craft almost directly overhead)) It was just there alone one second and then the next second, three others start showing up, flickering in and out of visual sight.    There was no interception from the ground. I absolutely can tell you there was no craft on approach from earth. (One plane did take off from the base heading southeasterly direction with nothing in common as to shape or mannerisms. When I would glance at the plane I couldn’t help but keep thinking that, ‘THAT’ was how I was taught metal was supposed to act while in flight) Now there are 4 moving around the first with 2 hovering a lot within the first ones flight path while the 3rd seemed to be chasing the first. The original would zip one direction and the 2 would move as if to block and the first one would get close and stop very abruptly, a few times they got so close they were hard to make out as 2 separate objects. The 3 new arrivals appeared to be the same size as the first. The only explanation I can think of is that they came from out of the atmosphere at unbelievable speeds from way higher up than the original UFO. This seems a lame view of what happened, as we were watching the first one, the others just showed up blinking in and out of existence before solidifying for the rest of the encounter until they vanished for good. CLOAKING? When I say they just appeared I mean they (the 3 new comers) weren’t smaller looking than the 1st craft and on an intercept course until they got close enough to see them as being the same shape and size. ‘No’, these things just appeared from out of ‘nothing’. There was one, and then there were 4 with 3 flickering in and out of existence for a few seconds longer than the first before they stabilized and remained in sight. These newest three craft just showed up like they were winking in and out existence or our visual spectrum for a few seconds (like flickering fast) and then they were all within our full view. Then the block and chase maneuver started from the three newcomers. I look at the plane that took off and marveled at how the motions of the plane and the motions of the UFO’s were so very in contrast with each other. Then I realized how unique my sighting was. I actually have a visual reference of one of humanity’s flying machines in flight in the same area as four unknown flying objects that defy conventional motion and shattered what I took to be reality of the limits of motion and metal. I saw these objects. I saw how they were moving and seeing ‘is’ believing. ‘I now know, ‘that’ kind of motion is possible, for I saw it and believe it to be as true as the flight of the contrasting plane. They were both there and they were both real and vastly different. I know now first hand of the limitations to our own reality and the hardwired from birth ‘limits’ set in place within our own minds. Limits upon our beliefs and what we KNOW (were taught) to be true, on what we think is the entire scope of reality, machinery, physics and motion. Wake up ‘Please’. These limits themselves have limits and are not permanent. We can wake up our misguided views of the world. I have been shown a true taste of what’s possible. I know it’s possible because I saw it with my own eyes. In full focused contrast against an American aircraft in flight. I liken the feeling to showing a cell phone to an old west cowboy in the early 1800’s and showing that it works and that its real and there in front of him and that this tech is possible. I feel like that cowboy. Here are my comments on the aircraft: An aircraft took off around 4:15 give or take. When sight was lost on the original and only remaining UFO I went inside to check the time and it was 4:25GMT. The UFO on last location was almost straight over the house behind me now as I am facing between Cheyanne Mt. and Pikes Peak Mt. in Colorado Springs Colorado. The US Aircraft was heading south easterly where the flight paths would cross the original encounter location albeit at a far lower altitude. The plane was in no danger of collision as the UFO’s altitude was far greater and they(the UFO’s) were in and out of the clouds during their chase. Not in and out really just behind and peeking out from around as the cloud passed by. Visibility was excellent with very light cloud groups, very small very high up. As the Plane got further and further away the UFO objects still looked far away and above the plane’s flight path. The UFO objects appeared to be staying the same size as the aircraft receded from sight and it gave me a weird kind of dual reference point from my perspective of looking at both types of craft within the same field of vision, almost straight up from my front steps facing a southeasterly direction. Then I went to get the binoculars out of the van and it was really hard to find the targets. As I was looking for them in the binoculars, the three pursuit craft just winked out first one then the other two at about the same time. The original UFO that used to be a cigar shape, when I looked at it through the binoculars, I could see a definite bell shape, that for a few seconds I thought it had flickering on and off lights. It wasn’t really flickering lights on and off, It appeared to be rotating/spinning very fast with these quick flashes of pinky white glinting at the bottom corner of the craft that was facing the setting sun. The rotation was defined by a massive black form that interrupted the whiteness as it rotated. I just saw black splotch interrupting the whiteness with a much faster sunset color flickering or maybe flashing as if the sunlight was reflecting off of several objects upon the crafts side. It was a little hard to comprehend, but there were three flashes of sunset color in the bottom side that was facing the sun, per one black flash that never blacked out the overall whiteness of the object. This gave the definite appearance or rotational motion. Then with the craft in view through my binoculars, it vanished. Now try to comprehend what I am saying here. I mean, it disappeared between flickers. From one flicker to the next it just wasn’t there anymore. This was the last I saw of the UFO’s.",2015-11-26T00:00:00,38.861478298238076,-104.78039776536313

((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD)) At approximately 6:03pm I received a call from my friend who was delivering a pizza in the Mira Mesa area, where I live. He told me that there was a bright greenish/blue spot in the sky and it was unlike any atmospheric anomaly he had ever witnessed in San Diego. 	I walked out front of my house and looked around, and spotted it immediately as it was VERY vivid. The sky was pretty clear that night so it looked like an oval indigo cloud just hanging in the middle of the atmosphere west of my position, presumably over Sorrento valley or maybe La Jolla. I confirmed on the phone that I saw it too and walked into the street a bit to get a better view. 	I spotted a formation below and to the right of the cloud, not moving in the sky. It was far away and hard to see unless I looked at in my peripherals, but I could define at least one white/red pinpoint light and what appeared to be another but was too dim and too far to visibly distinguish. There could have been a cluster of them but I couldn't get my telescope out in time to see. In between the formation was a faint stream of light running vertically, looking like a stream of glowing fog. The formation would become brighter and dimmer periodically, staying in the same spot. 	Over time the blue light cloud got harder and harder to see, and the formation below began to tilt clockwise, about 30-45 degrees before I lost track of it. I observed the two from the roof of my house until they slowly faded away and eventually disappeared.  I can't be certain of it but I believe the source of the blue glow was the formation I saw below, or it was possibly projected from the ground at Miramar MCAS nearby.",2015-11-12T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

About an hour later I witnessed a silent black triangle fly over the tree in my backyard continuing over the neighbor's house - it was coming from the northeast and flying to the southeast.   I believe it was between 10:15 and 10:30 pm, I did not look at the time on my phone until 10:44 because I was collecting my thoughts on what I had just witnessed.   The object had flown over in the 11 o'clock position and was about the size of my fingers at arm's length or about 3 1/2 inches.  It was an equilateral triangle, silent, black with pointed  corners, and the two leading edges were glowing.   About 45 minutes later probably between 11:00 and 11:05 pm - (I didn't look at the time until 11:09 pm because once again I was collecting my thoughts.) I saw two of what I assumed were the same object that I saw earlier.  They were flying north to south in a side by side formation.   The two leading edges of both objects were glowing and this is what I was focused on.  I was trying to figure out how many ""lights"" there were.  The glow was very, very dim.  There were many points of light on the edge and brightness was not consistent nor was the spacing even.  Having experience working with plasma, it appeared to be more of a plasma glow.   By 11:15 pm I had decided that was enough of that for one night and I was in the house. This would be the first time that I have experienced anything of that nature.  It freaked me out to the point that I slept with the  lights on for about a week.   I had just set up the hot tub towards the end of summer and was spending one to six hours in it per night or about 20 to 30 hours a week.   I had always believed that only a certain type of person saw such things and that most could be explained.

On a Saturday, Nov. 14, 2015, I went to get water at an outdoor water vending machine.  As I was pulling up to it, I saw what I thought was the largest spotlight I have ever seen, shining its bright light down upon the fairly small town of Rosamond, which is approximately 80 miles north of Los Angeles.   I got out of my car, thinking at first that it was a helicopter.  I realized it was much too high in the sky for that.  I could not see what the object was because of the enormous light coming down from it, which lit up a large portion of the town.   Suddenly something liquid, visible in the light, began spraying down from the object.  The fluid descended quite rapidly, spreading as it fell down.   I quickly called my mom’s number so she might see the sight.  No answer. The huge light turned off and the object was gone, but I could still see the (glowing?) mist approaching in the dark.  Above, I could see a bluish/green glow left in the sky where the mist had fallen from.   I then called my sister who lived about 6 miles outside of town because I knew she and her husband sat outside each night.  She had also seen the bright light and remnants of the bluish/green glow…but had not seen the spray fall upon the town.  I learned the next day the armed forces said they had shot a missile which had flown over the L.A. area and near our town.  But if it was a missile, why did it stop over our town to spray us with something? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The lights appeared as if the light particles themselves were contained somehow.  The deep red light I have never seen on an aircraft of any type before.  Not consistent in any way to a anti collision light.

When it turned east then north neither of lights faded out as you would expect when a plane banks towards or away from you It didn't make a sound, dead silent.   As it was moving north flying parallel to the mountain on the east side, it went straight in front of several bright stars that were rising.  As it flew in front of these stars, the stars were still visible in between the white and red lights were you would expect some type of structure to block them out.   The stars and the sky itself seemed to waiver, exactly the way one would assume some type of cloaking device would work.  It proceeded slowly north over Missoula, then West and out of site.

I yelled OMG, it's a space ship, just as it was passing my daughter walked out of the house to check on me for sitting in my car this late, and I said again, while pointing up, ""Look, it's a spaceship.  Could you see it?""  She looked up and was only able to see the weird light but heard the sound of something heavy/large passing by. The lights were in the clear of the sky but the object was surrounded by either clouds, moister, or smoke and the only way to get the full view of it was to be directly beneath it. Please know, I'm not one who's quick to believe something like this, as a matter of fact, I over look people who talk of UFO sighting, but last night/early morning made me a believer.  I witness the huge saucer object with lights located directly underneath the center part of this craft.  I'm convinced that this stuff is real.",2015-11-26T00:00:00,38.89101085271317,-76.89593565891474

Around 9:00 PM, I went outside with my dog and decided to walk down a long staircase that leads to a small dock on a lake in Hide-A-Way Hills.  I notice a very bright light shining above the other side of the lake, above the trees.  This is a common occurrence because various airplanes fly over the area.  However, this light was considerably brighter.  At first I thought it might be another plane but it seemed to be taking longer to travel overhead.  In fact, I waited three minutes for the light to fly over the lake.  When it finally did, I noticed that there were no blinking lights, and that the bottom of the craft had small white lights at all three vertices, forming a triangle shape.  There was also a red light in the middle of the craft. The craft made no noise at all and seemed to be flying just above the tree tops. I’d say maybe 300-400 feet in the air.  Most airplanes that fly over are ate a much higher elevation.  As the craft passed by my left side, I made sure to wait for any sounds of a typical airplane, but I just couldn’t hear anything at all.  It’s a very, very still night with a bright full moon. The whole time I was observing the craft looking South.  The craft was traveling North and eventually passed my left side above the tree tops and disappeared over the hill. I should also note that I had just finished watching a comedy prior to going outside.  As soon as I rounded the corner of the house to descend the staircase, the light emerged over the top of the trees on the other side of the lake.  It felt oddly coincidental.  Absolute perfect timing with a clear sky and full moon. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi! I just recently submitted a report for a sighting in Sugar Grove, OH, regarding a triangular object.

I watched the light for a few seconds to see if it had other lights on it and if it was possibly a plane (as I am in the flight path for Newark Airport), but it did not and was not… I grabbed my binoculars, and through them observed a bright orange sphere, flying due east, at the same altitude that small aircraft fly to get to Newark Airport (North West of my location), but it wasn't going toward the airport.  The orb did not pulse or strobe, and it seemed to be a brighter white light in the center, with the warm orange light surrounding it.  I could not make out a definitive outline for the object, and there were no discernable features from my perspective.  I watched it in my binoculars as it flew impossibly slowly and level for about 45 seconds or so, and when it reached a point in the sky whe! n it was exactly in front of me I said to it, 'Where the hell are you going?"", and at that moment it flickered brightly and just disappeared!  There were no clouds for it to disappear behind, and the moon was large, bright, and full to my left.  The reason this object initially caught my eye was because it was the same orange color of another UFO that I saw flying over my yard on July 4th of 2015 (which I will also file a report on, and should have back when I saw it!), although that one was a pulsing rectangle which was flying due South...This is the 3rd UFO that I have seen in my lifetime, and the 2nd one I have seen in the last 4 months!  I would be interested to know if anyone else in my area observed this orb. I would also be willing to speak to an investigator about my sightings.  Thank You…",2015-12-03T00:00:00,40.6559,-74.3045

I began my commute around 5:10 pm.  On the horizon I noted an extraordinary amount of “stars.”  Upon further thought, I dismissed them as planets as they seemed much too bright to be stars.  There was a cluster of three directly ahead of me.  When I looked to the left and right of them, I noted an unusual amount of points of light.  I thought it was peculiar.  One of the points of light, my so called “planet,” shot straight north.  That is when I told myself, “Oh. That’s no planet.  Planets don’t do that.”  Suddenly, the entire sky was nearly pitch-black.  The sunset had completed itself though it seemed faster than normal. I began watching the sky after I saw the “planet” shoot north.  I saw a flying object, triangular in shape.  It had light on the three points (red and white).  The lights were solid and then they began to flash, almost mimicking an airplane.  Then another object appeared.  I had stopped at the red light at the intersection of 72 and 47, headed east, towards Elgin, Illinois. At the light, I starred at the sky and kept watching the flying objects.  Once I cleared the stoplight, I pulled over the side of the road, slightly pass the John Deere place. I exited my vehicle and looked at the night sky.  Some of the flying objects looked like airplanes, some were triangular and unfamiliar to me.  Some made airplane noises, some were silent.  I took out my cell phone to record footage but the quality is much too poor. I put my phone away and decided to watch for a bit.  Some of the flying objects seemed to be flying in harmony—it almost looked like they were communicating.  All the vehicles were flying at different heights. I looked at one of the triangles, one closes to the ground, and I thought to myself, “Come closer,” and almost instantly the vehicle came closer, hovered above me and my car and then flew off.  Its lights were off and it felt like I was being watched.  I cannot say how far off the ground it was. My highest count at any given moment was 14 flying objects—some airplanes, some unknown. I got back into my car and drove into South Elgin, Illinois.  I stopped at a store on Randall Road.  When I exited my car in the parking lot, I checked out the sky and noted only 4 flying vehicles.  Three were definitely airplanes and the other was too far away to say.

I don’t know how to measure the speed or distance of any flying objects.  I can only give a report relative to my own knowledge. I was driving on highway 116 in Texas, heading north toward Gatesville, around 8:10 pm (pure nighttime, clear skies and no visible moon).  To my right (northeast) in the sky there was a flare of orange light, it appeared to be a four-pointed diamond in the sky.  From my vantage point it looked about the size of headlight.  The shape then appeared to move in a horizontal fashion (left to right, or west to east) while multiplying, so that there appeared to be three aligned orange diamonds, before it merged into a single shape and then disappeared.  It was about midway in the sky, well above the treeline.  The spectacle lasted about five seconds. I pulled over and grabbed my phone, but it had already ended.  However, in its absence there were multiple moving lights, each about the size of a star.  There were suddenly about three or four of them in the northeast sky, all moving in different directions.  They were blinking rapidly like a strobe light and moving considerably faster than a plane.  There was also inexplicably a shooting star that flashed between them.  I got out of my car and tried to get video but they were too dim to be recorded.  I immediately noticed that to my left (northwest) there were even more of the fast moving blinking lights, about four more.  There was a rash of these blinking lights spread across the entire sky.  Unlike the diamond shape, which was still horizon-level, these lights were moving freely about much higher, like satellites.  It was admittedly hard to gauge their exact direction due to their strange lighting, but it still genuinely looked like they were disappearing and reappearing throughout the sky. I called my friend and observed the lights for about another ten minutes.  I saw what looked like a normal plane-large, slow-moving, and with green blinking lights- appear on the northwest, heading east.  Suddenly two more very bright, very big white lights appeared directly, distantly above me.  They were about plane sized.  They seemed to be high in the atmosphere but once again, I could easily be mistaken there.  The two lights were moving down, one heading toward east and another toward the west.  The westbound light suddenly made a sharp turn RIGHT, heading directly toward the other light.  There was a loud whirring sound, like a divebomb.  My friend on the phone heard it as well. It had a made a clear curving turn and accelerated.  It was chasing the eastbound light.  Combined with the noise and the pursuing object’s speed, I thought that I was going to witness a collision.  I hung up the phone to record-however, both lights (still heading east) then grew dim and diminished in size, until they disappeared. I continued to watch the skies for another twenty minutes.  While there was still an excess of moving lights (about four to six, ranging one eastern edge of the sky to the west), they were now dim and twinkling and unremarkable.  They all seemed to eventually vanish.  However, there was yet another orange diamond shape that erupted, the same size and location as the first one.  It simply flashed out a single orange gleam, and was gone. I waited another ten minutes, but nothing happened.  By now it was around nine o’ clock. I drove for another ten minutes to my destination.  While there I waited outside and continued to watch the stars.  Sure enough, in the east there was a blinking white light jetting across the sky toward the west.  This light was about plane sized.  About midway across (at the northern point) it suddenly seemed to stop, but it was in fact only moving very slowly.  It had very instantaneously dropped its speed- however the blinking rate of the lights was still the same.  It then slowly flew eastward until it was out of sight. Though I watched for more, nothing happened afterwards of note.",2015-12-04T00:00:00,31.200200000000002,-97.9921

Halfway through the night we look up in the sky to see two very distant lights chasing each other with UNBELIEVABLE speed and changing direction on a dime...  Things that planes can not do... That memory has stuck with my all my life and is the main reason why I find anything to do with ""aliens"" super interesting, but...

This most recent sighting lasted about 2 minutes, and occurred near the northern horizon, which was the only patch of sky clear of clouds. A bright white light flashed a couple of times to the NNE, attracting our attention.  As we had had the previous sighting, I grabbed my binoculars to view this light, which we initially suspected to be an airliner.  Instead, I immediately saw that it was the same group of lights or object with several randomly flashing lights.  It was dim enough that it was only visible with the binoculars, once the bright white flashing light stopped flashing. The object moved west, estimated at about 200 mph, then disappeared behind the mountains to the north.  These mountains are about 8 miles from our house, and the object appeared to subtend 2 to 3 degrees of horizon.  This would give it a width of 1,800', if eight miles away.

Dear Mr. Davenport,  I had a sighting three years ago but just learned of your reporting center on Coast to Coast. On October 23, 2012, my husband and I were driving back home to Mitchell, South Dakota from Sioux Falls, South Dakota around 6:00 p.m.  We noticed a strange illumination in the sky ahead of us which seemed to be several miles ahead of us.  We watched it and it seemed to be traveling at the same speed as we were going and in the same direction.  I kept my eyes on it while my husband drove.  I watched it until we turned off the Interstate at Mitchell to go home.  As we traveled into the city I lost sight of the light. At approximately 8:00pm that evening, I went out to the barn that I leased to bring my horses in for feeding.  The barn was about 2 1/2 miles south of Interstate 90 on Ohlman Street.  When I arrived at the barn it was dark out.  I went to the first pen where I had two horses to bring into the barn.  I noticed a strange white light directly above one of the barn that was about 30 feet away from where I was standing.  The light turned on like someone was flipping a light switch.  I would say the light was about 50 feet above the building.  It looked very strange and I became very scared and got the horses in as fast as I could.  However, there was one more horse to round up in an adjacent pen that was another 40 feet away.  I really didn't want to go out again but I feared for the animal.  I got to his pen and he was calm and didn't seem to be affected by the light.  As I was trying to halter him, I looked at the light and it split into two lights in a blink of an eye.  Boy I really got scared.  They then turned off like someone was flipping the light switch and then on again and another light split into two.  I got the horse haltered and took off as fast I we could to the barn.  I closed the door and shook so hard.  I called my daughter to tell my husband to come as fast as he could.  Time seemed to stand still. Since we lived so close my husband didn't take very long to arrive.  I rushed him into the barn and told him what I saw.  We then opened the back door of the barn and stepped outside.  Where I saw the lights there were about a dozen or so little twinkly lights in a pack and they started drifting off to the south east sky.  It was really weird. I then remember a year of so before this we were driving back to Mitchell from Sioux Falls on Interstate 90 about half way home close to the Highway 81 intersection and again in the south sky we noticed a pack of twinkly lights like the ones we saw at the barn that night.  So this was the 2nd time I saw the twinkly lights drifting. I started to feed the horses before it got dark.  We since moved to Sioux Falls and I never did see anything again, which was just fine by me.",2015-11-20T00:00:00,43.7183,-98.02620000000002

I experienced a very unusual observation in the night of November 16, around 1930 hours EDT, in an area about 45 miles northwest of Philadelphia near Pottstown, PA.  The sighting took place while I was driving with my wife on Harmonyville Rd., North Coventry Township, Chester County Pennsylvania.  The exact coordinates of the location are:  N40.18741 degrees W75.74.242 degrees    The sighting involved at least 11 bright orange lights moving slowly together, generally in a northwest to southeast direction, and lasted in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 minutes.  I think there were a few more lights than 11, but I was counting as fast as I could because I did not know how much longer the lights would be visible and I wanted to be sure to get a rough count, at least, before they disappeared. The lights were all a bright orange, equal in color and brightness. They appeared to be randomly arranged, with no apparent rhyme or reason in their relationships to one another.  They appeared to be more than a pin point of light as you see when looking at a star or planet with the naked eye.  They appeared to have an actual dimension to them using just my unaided eye. The lights were all moving in unison in a northwest to southeast direction.  They all moved at the same speed and did not change at all in their relationship to one another, as though they were physically connected.  Nothing could be observed, however, connecting one light to another. It was the appearance an object would have if the orange lights were coming out of windows in an object that had windows but was otherwise invisible.  But that isn’t is it?  They were moving very slowly from left to right. When I first spotted them, they appeared to be stationary, but after I stopped the car to get out and look closely I noticed they were in fact moving at a steady slow speed.  They had an observable speed such as you would see when looking at a high flying jet aircraft or man made satellite passing over head. The lights I saw were about 5 to 10 degrees above the horizon at the lowest and about 20 degrees at the highest.  They appeared to be fairly close to me and absolutely were not stars, planets, man made satellites, flying aircraft or like anything else I have ever seen. The light farthest to the left, from where I stood, was on a magnetic heading of 100 degrees and the light on the right was on a heading of 125 degrees, so they covered an arc in the sky of about 25 degrees.  As mentioned above, the vertical development was only an arc of about 10 to 15 degrees, so the lights collectively were a good bit wider than they were high. As we watched, the lights farthest to the right started to go dim and then became invisible as though they were either going into or behind a cloud or fog bank.  We could not detect either, so I can not tell if they were going out or being obscured. Then, as the remaining lights approached the same area of the sky, they also slowly dimmed and disappeared. There was no sound whatsoever connected to the sighting, I was in a remote rural area and there was no other vehicular traffic or local noises, so it was a very quiet setting. I am a retired attorney with a rudimentary knowledge of astronomy, a private pilot’s license and in all my life I have never come even close to seeing anything even remotely like what I saw last night. My wife was with me and saw the exact same thing. I have simply no clue at all concerning what we saw, but, I am totally certain we saw exactly what I described above. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) 11-20-2015 16:25 hours EST Dear Peter, I just submitted to you a UFO sighting report and want to follow up that report with the two attached photos which I downloaded from the internet to show better what my wife and I saw 11-16-2015. The pic with ""163"" in the name of the .jpg, shows what the random assembly of lights looked like to us. The arrangement of the lights we saw was different, but this pic shows better than my words what we saw. Also, we saw around 11 lights, not what is in this pic. The other picture, with ""120411"" in the title, depicts the actual bright orange color we saw and shows that the lights were more than a mere pin point of light in the night sky. What we saw did not appear to show as much dimension as this picture shows. I struck out on the weather. The flight weather service man does not have the past weather records, he only deals with current conditions and forecasts. He gave me two other numbers, but the bureaucrats are all out for Happy Hour, or whatever starts their weekends. If it is important to you going forward, I can try further on Monday when the offices are open.  I enjoyed chatting with you and we both look forward to your call around 10 EST tonight. Sincerely yours,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",2015-11-20T00:00:00,,

There was another string of lights traveling with it that may have been a second triangular object partially blocked by the main triangular formation.",2015-11-20T00:00:00,42.09974517647059,-80.07763388235293

My husband went outside to smoke a cigarette, and while he was outside there was a loud roaring noise that came from outside the house.  It sounded like a huge snow plow pushing ice off the road, but the roads are clear.   My husband banged on the window for me to come outside, saying there were strange lights in the sky. I went out onto the front porch, facing East, and saw at least 4 rapidly moving lights in the sky.  Our children joined us outside as well. The lights were moving from West to East, and were orange.  The lights were larger than the stars but smaller than the moon, and they moved very fast, crossing from the West horizon to the East horizon before turning around again in less than ten seconds.   We live in a mountainous area, in a valley which makes our view somewhat restricted, but in the sky that we see the lights were crossing  from one end to the other much faster than planes fly overhead, and there were no clouds blocking our view. It was incredibly cold and clear. When we first saw the lights, there were four and they were flying separate from each other.  Two of the lights moved towards each other and at first seemed to merge and become one slightly larger light before separating again and then appearing to zigzag around each other like they were tracing a double helix.  When the lights were separate, they appeared to blink, but when they came together they stayed solid.  At one point, a third light joined the first two lights, and then all three formed a triangular formation and flew in that pattern for about 20 seconds.  Again, while flying together, they stayed solid and did not blink.  The lights then broke away from each other and made hairpin turns very quickly and moved back towards the West.   As they moved West, they were again blinking and flying in zigzags around each other.  There was a fourth light at this time, that appeared to follow the first three.  This light looked like it was actually 4 smaller lights closely together in! a cube formation, and these appeared to be green.  The small green cube followed more slowly behind the first three, and they all moved towards the Western horizon.  The whole time these lights were moving, there was a loud roaring coming from the sky that was loud enough to shake the windows in the house, and the closer the lights got to the horizon the softer the roaring was until the lights and the noise stopped. We all went back inside, and about 10 minutes later, we heard the roaring start again, so we ran back out onto the porch looking back towards the west, which is towards the back of our house looking towards the treeline.  The roaring continued for about a minute, then abruptly stopped for about 30 seconds, started again for about a minute then abruptly stopped again, repeating this pattern several times.   While we heard the roaring, we could see lights moving over the horizon towards the West, but they were blocked by the trees so we couldn't see if they were in a formation or be sure of how many there were.  This episode lasted for about 3 minutes before the roaring stopped abruptly one final time and did not begin again.",2016-03-04T00:00:00,44.1209,-72.3316

At around 3 am a tenant came and asked what is going on I told him and he grabbed a pair of binoculars remembering that I had a pair too I did the same  He said he had seen this before, and it was a satellite.  When looking at it through the lenses it moved up and down and side to side quickly it was hard to keep it in the lenses when looking at it with the naked eye it just seems to hover in one place when I told this guy that he laughed and said yea they are a trip and he left.   Well, I just looked out my front door and it is still there at 4:36 am pst it is not saucer shape it is more oblong when looking at it through the lenses it changes it is a ball of fire then just a light that seems to have two parts at times.

I continued to observe them when they drifted towards the recently created ""contrail"" which was fairly fresh and not dispersed when i noticed they were behind the trail meaning they were above it.

I was with a friend and two of our children, looking for deer.   As I came up the farm lane, directly ahead of me, I saw a glowing/fiery circular object which appeared to be enveloped in a something of a haze, lowdown in the sky, just over a small mountain about a mile or two from my location.   From my truck the object appeared to be the size of a tennis ball, but it was obviously much larger as at least a mile or so away.  The object appeared out of nowhere a little above the mountain and at a rate which seemed slow to me traveled on a downward angle from right to left and disappeared behind the mountain.  I slammed on the brakes and exclaimed something like “what the hell was that?” My friend had been looking for something on the floor, and the two boys were playing a videogame in back, so none of them saw anything.  I expected a huge explosion from the other side of the mountain, as at first I thought it was a plane or helicopter which was on fire and coming to the ground.  However, when no explosion occurred, I had no idea what I just saw. Due to my thoughts that it could have been a plane or something like it we quickly drove to the other side of the mountain and drove up and down the road looking for whatever had come down.  We found nothing. Looking back, one thing that seems strange is that this object had no “tail” such as you might see from a plane or shooting star streaking across the sky.  Further, I have seen shooting stars and this was nothing like that.  It couldn’t have been a plane or helicopter crashing as we would have seen the aftermath for absolute certainty.  As it bothered me for days I looked around Google and found a picture which looked very much like what I saw, which picture was labeled an “Orb” in a setting of UFO’s. For what it is worth, I was not under the influence of any substance.  I have never really believed in UFO’s despite once before having before seen several green “dots” chasing each other around the sky when again out in the countryside of Northumberland County many years before.   At this point, I honestly don’t know what I saw, but I am very interested in learning more, and discussing this matter with someone more knowledgeable than myself.

Hello:  I wasn't sure where to report what 5 of us witnessed yesterday evening. At approx. 7:10pm, my wife and I were out on our front patio deck with our 3 nieces.  We had taken 2 pairs of binoculars out with us, as we watch the hikers, and parasailers climb, and jump off the huge rock mountain here named ""The Chief"". We had watched 3 separate para-sailers jump from the top of the mountain.  Our patio deck faces 3 directions, south, west, and north. As we had been watching the para-sailers, just viewing with my eyes, my oldest niece watching through one pair of binoculars, and my wife and other nieces see it by eyesight as well, we saw a large darker shadowy object flying very quickly across the top of the large rock mountain.  It moved like nothing I have ever witnessed.   I grabbed the Bushnell binoculars and zoomed in on this flying object.  At this point, my 7 year old niece was already crying, and very scared.  Our other 2 nieces are younger and probably aren't as aware of flying objects.   My wife had then used the binoculars that my niece had, and she watched this flying object as well.  We both had a clear approx. 30-second view through binoculars at this flying square object.  It came in fast from the south, we spotted it once it cleared the tall tree line across our road.   As it came closer, the colors started to clear on it.  This flying object constantly rotated around, although it was square in shape.  It rotated around both in flying mode, and in hovering mode.  It hovered above my wife and I for about 10 seconds at maybe 3/4 to 1 mile from us.  It continuously rotated.  As the colors and shape appeared in the binoculars, the main square body was a tan/dark to mid grey color.   Shape, as I'm a Certified Welder/Fabricator, picture 3 large steel shipping containers set side by side tightly, and welded together.  It was square and 1/4 as deep as it was long and wide.  It clearly had 3 large circular portal areas equally spaced along all 4 sides, not the top or bottom, and on all 4 sides, there were 3 portals.  It had a total of 12 portals.  I sketched it last night, and as I looked at my diagram trying to figure out how anything square could fly completely smooth, and horizontal, rotate constantly, and can stop and hover, while still  rotating, it appears to me, as if the 3 portals along all 4 sides as they were blue/grey in color, compared to the Tan/Dark Grey main body, would possibly be a propu! lsion system.  If all 12 portals could rotate a propulsion drive in a 360 degree movement, simliar to a Harrier jet, then yes, I can see how a square object could fly and hover.  I'm a Licenced Automotive Technician and Certified Welder/Fabricator by trade here, and I'm an avid custom car, truck, and motorcycle enthusiast, so I know almost every single mechanical sound on this planet.  The rotating square object made no noises.  We could hear the hikers and para-sailers talking on the mountain side, but nothing from this square flying object.  I and my wife witnessed it, it then started to move north again, and I watched it until the roofline made me run from the front to the back deck in 3 seconds, but on the back deck, it had completely disappeared, and we have a long, large view up the valley, and of the mountains off our back deck.   Like nothing I've ever seen, or even researched online.",2016-08-16T00:00:00,49.70018787878789,-123.15563636363638

Took a little 2 hour drive and on the way home, Utica was having their Utica Fest, and we drove through it.  We drove down 106 and got onto Hillside Road, and my friend said he saw the firework show from Utica going on in the distance.   So I decided to take Aarback Road to Highway 73.  I parked the car 30 feet away from the intersection of Arback Road and Hwy 73.  My friend and I got out of the walked up to the intersection.  So we were looking North West towards Utica and it's 4 miles away from our location.  It is not that impressive watching a fireworks show from that faraway.  So we were watching the show and towards the finally a very bright meteor streaked over our heads from the Eastern sky to the South Western sky.   Then about 2-3 minutes later in the same South Western part of the sky- in the same area or direction of where the meteorite traveled to! - just above the horizon what looked like it was over 40 miles away from us- there were these weird lights that what looked like welding sparks falling very slowly from the sky.  I told my friends it's probably just pieces of the meteorite falling to Earth.  Well here is where it gets weird!  Those sparks just stop in midair and then they started to move back upwards again and then start to zip around in tight circles like fireflies.   After a few minutes of doing that, they came together to make one very bright orb in the sky.   After about 20 seconds, they separated and dance around again, still at the same height, not lowering or rising in the shy just above the horizon.   I told my friend to get out his phone to capture this.   Three minutes goes by and they came together yet again to form the bright orb, but only this time it wasn't as bright as the first time they did it.  It was visible for maybe 15-20 seconds and then it broke up again.   The sparks then looked like they were forming an elongated tube but eventually they turned back into the in! dividual sparks and then vanished from the sky.  My friend got the orb thing on his phone, but it's not very clear video.   I wish I had my camera, because I could have used the telephoto lens on my camera. I started to rationalize that maybe it was a squadron of F-16's with their engines making the spark-like lights and they we were just maneuvering around and maybe the bright orb that we saw was one of the F-16's was using it's afterburner.

My husband, myself, and our 3 daughters where at home in the living room.  Through the north facing picture window a bright light appeared.  We gathered at the window as the light became brighter and brighter until it seemed as though it could be emanating from the walls themselves.   As we peered out the window, there was at least 3 large lights moving very fast toward the house.  I was trying to reach one of my daughters hands...  Motion slowed down like trying to move through a thick clear substance with a wave motion.   The next thing we remember was that we were trying to clear off the dinner table until I realized it was near 1am.  I told the girls to go to bed.   Upon waking in the morning, none of us had any recollection of any of this...not until afternoon when my husband asked if I remembered anything about bright lights and wondered if it was just a dream.   Then the memories flooded back.  During the entire day we were all wondering what the massive influx of army helicopters flying over the house was all about.   We were then approached by a neighbor who had also seen bright lights the night before.   Being a retired colonel, he had made a number of phone calls to inquire about the helicopters.  At first they told him there were no helicopters in the area.  When he could actually give the numbers off the bottom of the aircraft, they blocked his calls.   My husband died the next week in a construction accident. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2016-08-16T00:00:00,42.7836,-74.5722

It was Halloween night, October 31, 2003, in Stafford, VA.  I was listening to the news this evening and heard the International Space Station was to be orbiting over the area and was to be visible.   Around 1800 hours, I was getting my kids ready for Trick or Treating in the neighborhood.  They left around 1810 hours with my wife while I got the bucket filled with candy.  I was outside setting up for 2 reasons:  1.	  So I was comfortable while giving out candy to all the kids.  2.	  To see if I could get a glimpse of the International Space Station. At close to 1830 hours, I saw my neighbor across the street on his deck and then immediately a huge rectangular, metallic looking object flew directly over mine and my neighbor’s house.   We looked at each other and I yelled to him that it was the International Space Station.  I also said, that I was overwhelmed that they would actually fly the station this close to earth, because it appeared to fly so much lower than what an airplane flies. I quickly went about the night and was telling everyone I saw the International Space Station.  Another neighbor when he and his kids came by was excited to hear what I saw.  He asked me to come over to his house the next night because he knew the Station would again be flying over the area the following night. When I went over to his house the following night, he had his Telescope set up in his back yard.  I kidding around with him, telling him he didn’t need the Telescope because what I saw flew so low, it was clearly visible.  He explained that the Station while flying over you still needed either a Telescope or Binoculars to see it.  I then kept my mouth shut and when the station did fly over, what I saw through the telescope, it was clearly what I did not see the night before. What I saw Halloween night was rectangular and appeared to be about 50 yards in length.   It was metallic, made absolutely no noise, and it flew off so quickly that at the time my mind could not comprehend.  More specifically, at the moment it passed over, I cognitively thought I was seeing the International Space Station, and with it in space I knew its orbit would pass quickly and what I did not calculate in my mind was the close proximity it was overhead. The UFO that I saw was not smooth and had its metal fabric skinned over every fitting it precisely.  What I’m saying is the skin had nooks and crevices.  There were no lights but appeared to have been laminated from the reflective lights of our neighborhood.  I only had 2 seconds to see and comprehend what I saw, because has fast, as it appeared it too had disappeared.",2016-08-16T00:00:00,38.44397520661157,-77.42208057851239

To the best of my recollection the event lasted about 20 minutes for the formation to go across the approximately half of the sky from North to South.  My line of sight was from Ventura to the direction of Palmdale, California, generally starting along direction above  State Highway 126 and generally along direction of I-5.  There are some tall mountains in that direction so I assume the formation was closer to Ventura, perhaps above Santa Paula or Fillmore.  I estimate height probably at 25 deg. Email as follows:  I visited your site for the first time to see if I could find any relevant info to an experience my girlfriend and I had. I saw that you had sightings for August but nothing for September.  [MUFON]  My main interest is to see if anyone reported several waves of lights in the sky on or about September 27, last month.  Unfortunately I am not sure of the date. I was mostly fascinated by what we saw but didn't think of noting times or recording any events but this is what transpired:  We live in Ventura, California.  It was between 830 - 930 in the evening when we saw a brighter than average light in the sky which initially caught our attention.  We stepped outside to get a better view.  At that time we began to see in the eastern sky, groups of perhaps five craft each heading southbound.  There closely followed another 6 or 7 groupings for approximately 35-40 craft total?  They could have been airplanes, but I have never seen so many at once.  My vision is not the best but the lights were basically white and some of the craft appeared to be flashing a reddish glow, sort of a twinkle.  They were travelling relatively slowly but something about them didn't quite make me think they were airplanes. I mentioned the incident to my neighbor and he said other people reported the event (newspaper?).  I looked online but didn't find any mention.

I had Just Arrived home from a day of wrenching at the speed shop i was working at in Ferrisburgh, VT.   I am a fabricator and performance mechanic by trade.  Motorsports is my life.                   I washed up, and then proceeded to make some food.   Finishing that up I thought to myself “it’s a super nice afternoon.  Not hot, not humid, and super clear and dry.”   You would be able to see the Milky Way belt later that night from my porch and driveway.  So I thought, “I’m going to enjoy my front porch and sit out and watch the night sky for a few hours as it gets dark. Well, only about 20min later, while sitting on my porch.  A huge caravan of Town police, State police, SWAT, FBI, Military and unmarked federal vehicles barreled down South Main Street going east towards Duxbury.  it was 10-12 vehicles at emergency operational speed all within a ½ a car length of each other doing 60mph in a 25mph zone.  This kind of thing never happens here.  So I knew something big was going on.     I ran inside and started looking online for local news channels or web sites that might be covering what was up.  Sure enough, just under a mile away WCAX was covering a story “State police had received a call to check on Paul Sweetser, 58, Monday 18th.  Family members had called police because Sweetser was threatening to harm himself.”   So at this point I went back outside to the sound and sight of a military Helicopter flying through the green mountain range over Waterbury, over route 89 and over my house going South towards Sweetser's house.   So, I went to the end of my parking lot where the trees open up and witnessed the Heli slow down, and drop a bit in altitude and start circling around the general neighborhood where the report was coming from.  They stayed at about 1000-1500ft in elevation.  But then at about 7:30-9:45pm, they started circling a much larger area than the house in question on that street, and they were frequently rotating Helicopters in and out for refueling.  I saw 5 or 6 different helicopters in the sky that night in the span of 5hrs doing the same circular patrol while spot lighting large areas of trees and woods around the neighborhood.     Spotlighting the woods.  Not even the house in question. So now it’s just after 9:50pm I have been watching the ground and aerial activity around and over this neighborhood for over 5 hrs now.   Mesmerized but what I was Witnessing.      Basically a huge military presence on the road ways, and aerial activity that the state police were not accountable for.  That also went un mentioned in any kind of official report of the incident by the state or the papers. This is when I witnessed the UFO.  It was now 9:56.  I’ll never forget the time. the last military chopper in the air to circle the neighborhood had just turned out of the patrol loop and gone back over the green mountain range towards Fort Ethan Allen.     When I saw the impossible. I’ve seen shooting stars, I've seen super sonic jets brake the sound barrier, I’ve seen space shuttles float by in orbit,  I’ve seen the international space station float on by, and I’ve seen meteors & meteorites,  I've flown drones and seen military drones be flown. This was none of the above. About a ¼ mile west of the Sweetser’s house.  Up on the ridge that parallels the west side of that neighborhood.   A ball or orb of brilliant blue/white light, very much the same color as a plasma arc from a plasma cutter or torch, glowed blue/white at the center and glowed a intense white on the edges, from what looked like heat dispersion.  It was low in the trees and then proceeded to gain a little elevation at about 10-15mph, then eventually appearing fully visible above the tallest spruce pines at the top of the ridge.  It then gained an additional 500ft in elevation above the ridge and stopped.   It sat there hovering for 5-6 seconds and then proceeded to move due East at approx. 5-10mph. right around half the speed it had been traveling up out of the trees with, right towards Sweetser’s house, it then went right over top of the house at the same elevation approx. 500ft, when It frantically and instantly changed direction and speed.  But not in a way I've ever witne! ssed. See below. Imagine if yoou will, a potentiometer that you could rotate left or right. that would supply input to a mechanical arm that holds a pen on paper.   Move the knob left and the pen moves up as the paper goes by.  Move the potentiometer right, and the pen moves down as the paper goes by, it would make a smooth wavy line left to right due to a more smooth analog input  Now imagine a 3-way switch controlling the pen.    Up, on the switch would move the pen up.  Center position of the switch would be earth, and down with the switch, would move it down.   Creating a squarer sine wave type line.   Not totally square corners or perfectly vertical lines would be produced, but I think it’s a close enough example to relate the difference in visual outcome to the difference in input  This UFO changed Direction like the square sine wave on the right And then instantly accelerated like I’ve never seen anything accelerate before. First It made the instant turn at 500ft, and then went into what looked like an inter-planetary trajectory or an interstellar one.  It looked to progressively get smaller relative to the rate it was moving, but more importantly, it instantly got up to speed after it changed direction @ 500ft, and continued at that speed until it disappeared from view.   It looked like the size of a star a few million light years away when it disappeared from view I still to this day have trouble contemplating the physics of what I saw.  It made absolutely no sense. After this was witnessed I felt very taken back, receded, an ominous feel was in the air. So I felt the need to drive over to the neighborhood where this all happened, so as to drive by the house and see if some state police where still there, and maybe spot one of the unmarked FBI or military vehicles not near that property. Or ones that hadn’t been reported by WCAX. So I went by.  A few state troopers were still there. But that was it.             So at that point I now wanted to get as close as I could to the launch location as possible.  And I thought the use of the big field between Sweetser’s house and the mtn ridge where the UFO took off from would be the best bet.     So Remember this was a crystal clear, dry, Aug night.   And up here in VT especially in the valley I live in. If it’s hot and humid during the day, clouds will settle into the valleys at night   You’ll wake up to heavy fog in the A.M. only to realize that a few hours later, it’s all evaporated and actually a blue bird day without a cloud in the sky.   The reason I mentioned this is because That field at 11:12 on a clear, clear, clear, very dry night was full of humidity & precipitation. but only hovering about 12-24” off the surface of the grass.    Very, very weird atmospheric conditions close by this aerial anomaly.  P.S.  Later that week the local Sunday paper stated that he had been talking crazy, yelling gibberish, acting erratically, and threatening to take his own life.  I hope this is summary gives you enough detail to feel severity of this sighting. It certainly was one hell of a spectacle Thank you for your time.",2016-08-16T00:00:00,44.3107,-72.8247

We observed a large black round object coming toward us from the North, initially North of the hills around Little Lake, perhaps 20 to 25 miles or more  to the North.  The black object only was visible due to burning ""sparks"" which clearly outlined its edge, it appeared perfectly round with a size as big or larger than the Moon. I pulled the car off the road, and got out to stand in front of the car.  She stayed in the car. The object came overhead, still retaining the perfect round shape, the sparking specks still illuminating it very clearly.  In my memory, I believe it looked maybe twice as large as the Moon.  Because it still appeared perfectly round, I believe it was spherical, not flat.  There was no sound, yet to be burning or sparking around its edge, it had to be in Earth's atmosphere. The object continued South until it disappeared over the hills heading toward L.A..  I would estimate the time for its visible flight of maybe 50 to 70 miles, or more, start to finish, as perhaps 30 to 40 seconds, as I had time to stop the car, get out and move to the front, and watch it pass overhead and vanish to the South.

I usually turn on the outside light but this time I didn't.  The lights in my house were also off.  I was alone outside.  There were other people inside the house but they were sleeping.  I am absolutely certain of the time I walked out the door.  It was 2:50 am. I checked my clock right when I walked out the door.   My clock is accurate.  I lit my cigarette and sat down on the bench and soon saw small and odd flickers of light a number of times for about 1 minute in the backyard, reflecting in the grass area on the west side of my yard to my right. A short few minutes later, probably about 2:55 am,  I saw a flying craft in the sky come in to view to my right from the west headed east.  There is a large area of trees on the west side of my backyard that are about 50-60 feet high.  I saw the craft as soon as it passed the treeline.   It was an equilateral triangle.  It seemed large.  If I had to guess, I would say each side was maybe just under 20 feet.  It seemed rather low flying, just above the tree line, maybe at about 80-90 feet.  The triangle was the same dull black color of the sky but the sky had stars that night and the craft did not. It seemed very thin, practically flat, I could see hardly any dimension to it.  It moved very slow.  It flew directly over my seated location above my head.  It never changed pace.  It did not make any sound what so ever.  There was an off-white light on each of the 3 points of the triangle.  After it passed I saw  an additional light in the  middle of the back side of the ! triangle that flickered at an odd but seemingly calculated rate.  I don't recall the color, I don't think it was exactly the same color as the others.  I went back inside the house through the side door again after the craft went out of view.  I went upstairs when everything was quiet and went to bed, afraid to turn on a light.  I spent probably about an hour thinking about it, wide eyed and awake, then I must have somehow drifted to sleep.  I woke up the next morning but did not recall the events until a few hours later and everything came flooding back to memory. A note about my location:  We have a large airport for small private planes which is about 1 mile west of my home.  In the summer just one year before, in 2012, we were constantly seeing black hawk helicopters coming from the direction of the airport so I assume they sometimes have military contractors using the site.  As I understand it, on record from an FAA map , unmanned military drones were not permitted to be flown in this area at that particular time.  I've seen all kinds of planes and helicopters and jets and model toy drones and even Chinese lanterns but I have never seen anything like the triangle I saw that night.",2016-08-02T00:00:00,42.05010904159132,-88.09256772151899

In approximately three seconds it disappeared behind a cloud. Exact E-Mail sent to a friend in Chicago:  About a week ago, I was sitting on my second story balcony.  I was looking at a glob of cobweb on several of the nearby trees and remembered that we had eight papershell pecan trees on our farm and lost three to the same caterpillar worms that created those webs.  I thought that they were catalpa worms, but I was mistaken.   I gazed over to another much taller tree and was looking for the same glob of cobwebs that I had seen before in that tree.  Then I jumped up from my seat and was amazed at what I saw crossing the sky, almost out of sight.  It was so high.   I went inside and returned seconds later, with binoculars (10x20) to see the same object disappear behind a cloud.  I never got the binoculars up to my face.  I fear commitment into the local sanatorium, should I mention what I saw that day. It had all the appearances of a flying boxcar.  No, no, not the WW 11 Flying Boxcar.   This object looked brown in color and had no wings or appendages of any type.  It looked like a railroad boxcar.   Now then, if you want to have me evaluated for mental exhaustion or dementia of the worse kind, I will gladly keep my door unlocked if you tell me when they might arrive.  I know I saw what I saw, if you know what I mean.  I made the mistake of telling my immediate neighbor whose door is two feet from my door.  She is a nurse at the local hospital.  We are friends and she is getting married in September.  She playfully said that ""OH, no, your not seeing things, those do exist and I can't remember what they are called.""

The sky at the time was sparsely partly cloudy, low humidity, with fluffy clouds with very clear areas of visible blue (but dark) night sky, and, clear visible stars, jet planes etc.  Winds were calm.

It didn't move location in the sky the classic UFO remained stationary it just appeared that it was spinning or the light was changing orange and white making it appear to spin, but once again it was stationary in the sky.  Then all in the same moment the UFO disappeared and the blue dots that I assumed where stars in the location made a giant circle in the sky.  The inside of the circle that the blue dots made was a visably darker black then the rest of the sky.   Then all at once the circle collapsed in on itself like it hit warp drive.  Before the circle collapsed or disappeared or shot off it took up a large portion of the sky.  The circle formed by the blue dots after the classic orange UFO disappeared was much larger than the classic orange UFO.  The only way I can explain it is it looked like a classic UFO opened a huge hole in the night sky then disappeared through it all in a maybe 5-10 second time frame.  The classic orange UFO was hovering in the sky for maybe five minutes before the circle formed around the dark black hole in the night sky.  It was me and one other friend standing in my yard.  No more than 30 seconds after it was all over as many as five human planes that appeared to be military aircraft were in the sky in the area this event just happened.

On 05/24/16 at 2:04AM, I was wide awake reading the news of the day on my cell phone, when suddenly I proceeded to hear an oncoming sound that was rapidly increasing in volume.  This noise was so distinct that I could make out the direction of travel from inside my home.  The increase in volume became extreme in a matter of seconds to where I was expecting to see lights before actual impact.  The reason I say lights is because I live very high up on a hill and the only thing that could be that high would have to be an aircraft.   The problem was that the unbelievably intense sound that I heard was that of what a semi truck would make when it gears down, not that of an aircraft. The moment I was sure of impending impact, everything became silent.  My first reaction was ""a commercial plane just buzzed my house and it was way too close.""  I was mad enough to where I looked out my large window into the overcast darkness to get a visual of this ""plane.""  What I saw was a large white light appearing in my window while slowly moving until it disappeared from view due to the window frame.   All of a sudden I see a second large white light now appearing in my window where the previous light had been  before it moved out of my sight.  I  thought that it must of been two planes that buzzed my house and made the noise I heard.  I got up and walked to the window to get a look at the source of my anger when I realized that not only was there two white lights, but a large steady red light that had been out of sight because of my window. These three lights made an absolute perfect triangular shape in the sky.  So precise was the formation that I was searching to see the body of what was holding these lights in such perfect form.  I could see nothing except these three lights.  There was no solid body, blinking lights, noise, straying out of the formation, nothing.  I stood in awe due to the perfection of the formation as it slowly started to disappear heading North over the tree line.  I did not leave the window but watched until all I could see were the trees. I had to have some kind of affirmation that I was not alone in what had just happened, so I called 911 asking if anyone had called in due to hearing an unbelievably loud noise.  I knew there was no possibility a person could of not heard what I had.  The operator told me that there had been no reports of such a noise and then asked me what had happened.  After I explained what I had experienced, she gave me the phone number of the Washington State UFO Center and also the Air Force Base located outside Seattle, WA.  I then called my husband who had been at work and told him what had happened. The next day I called the UFO Center and was instructed to document my experience.  Since I did not have internet access up and running yet, I told the UFO Center that I would as soon as I am able.  I also proceeded to call the Air Force, wanting to see if they had a report of anything  unusual.  I was told someone would look into it and get back to me.  A day later I received a call informing me that the Base had 3 Black Hawk Helicopters flying over my area on the same day around the same time frame of my experience.  What is interesting is that 2 weeks after my incident happened, my husband found on the internet that on the same day of my sighting there were 2 other sightings in different locations of 3 solid lights in triangular form moving North.",2016-08-02T00:00:00,46.0133,-122.70799999999998

The object would pulsate with three small pulses that were not very bright and then a fourth pulse that was extremely bright almost comparable to a welder's arc.  The pulses were not in a pattern they were intermittent. It started from the West and traveled East bound sometimes staying stationary.   As this object traveled in which the speed was never constant did not make any noise nor a trail that was left behind.   It appeared to very high in altitude but hard to confirm.   When the object would emit the bright pulse of light it appeared to start from the middle of the object and spread outward which made it look like a cigar shape. Once this object was straight overhead a second object appeared near the original object and was conducting itself in the same manner as the first object.   The second object did not last long however, it lasted only about 3 to 5 minutes and disappeared.  Then the object went to a North East direction and out of sight.

But seeing the recent reports in the northeast about three lights travelling so close together around the time of my sighting, I feel compelled to submit a report of what I saw. I don't remember the exact date, but it was around the last week of July, perhaps July 26th.  However, I do know that it was between 5:30 and 5:40 A.M., because this is the time that I go to work. Details:  As I was headed northeast on I-99, I noticed three bright lights in the northern sky, only several degrees above the horizon.  These lights remained very close to one another in a vertical formation, never separating more than about one degree from the other.  The movement of the formation was very slight, but there was definitely movement. The lights were bright white, almost silvery.  I could not distinguish a tail or anything of the sort.  As an amateur astronomer, I know for a fact that they were not planets because they were well north of the ecliptic. Conditions: Seeing conditions on this morning were clear.  During this time frame, it had been very hot in my area, with highs from the upper 80's to the mid 90's, and lows from the mid to upper 60's. If you could mark my position on Shiloh Road, looking toward the northeast drawing a straight line, the line would pass over Pleasant Gap, State Game Lands 295, and Williamsport.  There was no way for me to guess the distance of the formation. Hopefully, someone saw the same thing and can corroborate this sighting.

Preface:  My Father was a career aeronautical engineer, specializing in the design of aircraft power plants, having worked for Curtis during WWII (P40 Fighter), Piasecki (H21 Helicopter), and Boeing Vertol (All Models of the Helicopter Division). As a youth, much of our family talk and day trips were about aircraft and air shows.  As an adult, I lived near Fairchild AFB (Spokane WA) and am familiar with the sights and sounds of low and high flying B52 bombers & C130 tankers.  I now live near Davis Monthan AFB (Tucson), and am familiar with the sights and sounds of various low and high flying military Fighter Aircraft.  UFO Observation/Summer of 1993:  After arriving well after dark at a beach front hotel in Ocean Shores, WA, a former girlfriend and I walked onto the deserted beach and down to the water's edge.  After a few minutes of enjoying the sounds of the mild surf in the dark moonless, cloudless, yet starlit, evening, we started to walk back to the motel room.  For whatever reason, I glanced directly upward to look at the stars of the night sky.  What I observed did not look familiar.  I stopped in my tracks and alerted my girlfriend, ""Look up! Do you see what I see?  Yes, I see it!"" she said. We then stood silent, as we observed what I can only describe as a very large ""shimmering geometric shaped cluster of many white lights"" silently move from directly overhead, traveling ""slowly"" in a straight Inland direction, until out of sight, backdropped by the starlit night sky.  I can only project its size as ""very large,"" as if I were to extend both arms and index fingers overhead to an approx. 30 angle from where I stood.  Both index fingers would have indicated the location of the left and right edges of the UFO. We heard no aircraft engine noise during the sighting.  Only the light surf noise could be heard. Having no camera or phone, I ran to the nearest phone booth and called 911.  I asked the 911 Operator if anyone had reported a UFO sighting over Ocean Shores within the past hour.  No was the response.  So much for a mass UFO sighting. This experience is my only UFO sighting, and to this day, I do not know what I observed in that Ocean Shores night sky.",2016-07-08T00:00:00,46.972,-124.14320000000001

I've recounted this story to friends over the years but never officially reported it because I figured it was no big deal.  But after searching your database out of curiosity, I changed my mind and thought I'd share my observations. I don't remember the date, but know it was in the summer months of 1983, late evening, about 23:30 hours.  I found an incident in your database from 6/15/1983, at 23:30 hours in Garden City, Michigan.  That date and time are close to my sighting, and coincidentally, Garden City is not far from Waterford Township to the north. Anyway, my friend and I left work late one evening, walking home through the neighborhood behind my home.  It was an overcast night and was very dark.  Suddenly, I noticed the neighborhood around us light up, as if there were a clear night and moonlight was covering the ground.  This caused us to look up.  We saw the clouds opened up above us and a huge oval shape hanging in the sky in a hole in the clouds directly overhead. The shape had a row of large bright lights (which I likened to arc lights) along its center.  It was completely silent.  We stared for what seemed like only a few seconds in disbelief.  In an instant, the object shot straight up into the clouds and disappeared.  I'm very familiar with aircraft and have never seen anything like this.  It made absolutely no sound, and traveled the speed of light. My friend and I discussed what this meant for some time afterward.  I simply chalked it up to being some sort of a spiritual encounter.  Perhaps demons or Angels.  They are known to travel and appear on this planet.  The Bible indicates that Satan and his host have been cast upon the Earth and he is presently the prince of the power of the air.  This is why I never officially shared my story until now.  I just figured it was no big deal and was simply a natural phenomenon that could be explained. However, I was intrigued when I read the description from the Garden City sighting.

The craft continued to descend and then disappeared behind the downtown of our small community.  There was no sound what so ever.  I excited! ly told my son I thought a Jetliner was going to crash, or land.  Our country side is prairie not a lot of trees, mostly rolling hills.  I told one person about this and was made fun of so I have never mentioned it to anyone other than immediate family since.  I remember the incident clear as day.  I am 79 now, but was in my 60’s at the time.  This leads me to another incident that was told to me by a elderly gentleman who I have no doubt was speaking sincerely. He said that a good number of years ago, he and his wife and daughter were on their way to Blynn College at Schulenburg Texas.  They lived in Yokum Texas.  The road from Yokum to Schulenburg is a good highway.  And it is about 35 miles between the two hamlets.  It was about 4:AM.  He said an object descended across the Hwy. directly in front of them, they all saw it very plainly.  I ask him what it looked like, and he said it looked like an old Pullman train car.  He said as they were watching it crossed the roadway and stopped by the livestock fence than ran along side the road. The fence being about 40 feet off the road, along the right of way.  I ask him what happened next.  He said he stopped the car and got out, although his wife and daughter were screaming for him to keep driving.  He said about that time, it disappeared.  He had no explanation for the disappearance.  There was no sound. I’m telling you about these incidents because I have a theory.  Maybe a poor one, but maybe not.  Shiner and Yokum are ten miles apart.  BUT, the San Antonio airport is about eighty miles or so from these two towns.  I believe that we both saw some kind of mirage.  I failed to ask this gentleman about the weather when he told me his story.  Perhaps he had dense low clouds as I did.  I think somehow images from the airport could have been bouncing under, in or around those clouds.  I have read about the many surprising things mirages do.  Their have been other incidents in this area, I have heard of them but never talked to the witnesses personally.  Thank you for your time.",2016-07-08T00:00:00,29.4794,-97.17649999999999

"Elderly woman nearly 100 years of age reports being floated out to vehicle at night by three tall ""doctors.""",Hancock,ME,2010-02-08T02:00:00,cylinder,1 hour,"Occurred : 2/8/2010 02:00  (Entered as : 02/08/2010 2:00) Reported: 7/4/2016 7:04:01 PM 19:04 Posted: 7/8/2016 Location: Hancock, ME Shape: Cylinder Duration:1 hour",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/128/S128253.html,"Elderly woman nearly 100 years of age reports being floated out to vehicle at night by three tall ""doctors."" My mother passed away a few years ago at 102 years of age.  All her life she was a very serious person with virtually no sense of humor.  Although I could occasionally make her laugh with a joke, she would never joke herself.  Watching comedies on TV for her, at least by watching her reactions, was no different from watching a business show.  She took everything with the utmost seriousness and never made up stories.  As a child I was not allowed to read Winnie the Pooh which she thought was silly.  Also she literally ""hated"" cartoons. She worked as an editor for 30 years or more. My mother told me one time that she had seen an unusual light outside her window.  When I asked for details, she almost immediately became defensive as if she thought I did not believe her.  At the time, she said it was very unusual and looked like a spacecraft; that is all I recall about that incident, which occurred  back in the 1980s I believe. The second time was different.  (These events are the only two unusual events she ever reported to me.)  I came into the house one morning and my sister said, Mom, tell him what happened.  So she told me that she had been in bed asleep but was awakened by three tall men in the room.  She said they were quite tall, with large eyes(?) and she assumed they were doctors.  She said they had robes or gowns on as if it was a medical team.  They seemed to be explaining something to her and made her feel calm about the situation, similar to the way a good doctor would do in a hospital examination setting. Then she said they took her out into the yard to a ""bus"" or some kind of vehicle; they did this by ""floating"" her out of the room, thru the large sliding doors which were closed (and remained closed as they did this so that she was somehow moved through the material of the door and glass etc.).  Then she was on board a bus or large vehicle of some kind. Other people wer! e on it also, and everyone seemed to be relaxed and comfortable as if going on a voyage or day trip; there was no fear involved.  She said the journey was very interesting and informative but she did not recall exact details.  She said they brought her back the same way. (At the time, my mother was bedridden and would occasionally fall and was in danger that way, so we always kept a beeper alarm on her for safety.)  I asked her to tell me again about the ""doctors"" and she repeated that they were tall and seemed to talk with her without moving their lips but they conversed with her in English and she understood them perfectly.  She did not say they had hair or hats or anything and it was hard to get her to clarify that kind of thing. Then I said, okay, so were these doctors like about 4 feet tall with big eyes and with no hair? and she said, ""No, *those are the ones who work with you.*"" When she said that I was absolutely astounded because she said it so seriously as if she knew about it, whereas I know of no such beings ""working with me."" And you have to remember again that my mother never joked or made up stories as long as she was alive. It just was not in her to do that. As for ""science fiction,"" she simply called it ""a contradiction in terms."" (Her father was a university professor in mining engineering.) She knew that I was interested in UFOs; but when I discussed it with her, she had little interest; one time she explained to me that she felt about the ancient Egyptians & pyramids the same way I felt about UFOs, she was obsessed with the art & culture of ancient Egypt, the architecture and so forth. I had discussed the ""ancient astronauts"" ideas wi! th her which she found somewhat interesting. But these events happened at a time of her life when she was becoming more and more somnolent so that it was generally hard to catch her interest with much of anything. The point being that she was definitely not a ""UFO buff,"" nor did she seek to view UFOs or watch UFO related movies and reports. Those things didn't grab her at all. She never discussed this event further with me but my sister and I felt that it was a positive experience for her, as if it showed her there was something real in the afterlife (which I also believe, but never tried pushing this belief on her--she was always an atheist or agnostic even though we did pray at bedtime some when we were children and she taught us the Lord's Prayer, which her mom probably taught her).",2016-07-08T00:00:00,44.5274,-68.2517

On August 3, 2016, I was driving to a recycling center in Costa Mesa, when I saw 2 rectangular wall shapes made up of white circles.  One wall was coming in from the left and the other from the right and they looked like they were going to collide with each other.  Suddenly, they came together into a huge ball and then split like atoms.  I saw the individual white circles glow like flames as I was approaching the recycling center. I parked my car, grabbed my cell phone and started to record the lights move in a dance. Some white lights glowed brighter than others.  The lights looked like alternating flames of brightness.  I screamed and told folks to look up.  All the people ran and stared.  At first, we thought the lights were balloons until the alternating light and dance happened in unison.  Folks grabbed their phones and started screaming and filming.  The man filming next to me can be heard saying “there’s too many of them” and I can be heard agreeing with him.  I was very excited. It was impossible to count how many crafts there were.  I estimated about 15. A few minutes later, they started leaving as they ascended past the clouds.  Only one lingered behind, sitting on top of a cloud.  After all the others were gone, the one that stayed behind flashed and disappeared!!!  The video footage I posted was slowed down so that you can see the white lights.  When played in slow motion, you can see some of the lights glowing. I paused the one light that lingered above the cloud.  Look at it on the left. The sun was too harsh and made it difficult to capture the video.  This is why my camera is moving so much.  I have been following these lights for over 4 years now.  Most of my encounters have been at night.

About 75 to 100 yards away was a matrix of green lights, some in evenly spaced square formations and some appearing in diagonal formations; we estimated 15 to 20 lights were visible.  The slowly moving object appeared quite large as the wall of green lights passed over the trees.   Our view of the object was at about 20 to 30 degrees from horizontal.  My headlamp was pointed directly at the object, but no form could be seen other than the wall of lights.   There was no wind or air disturbance which might have been evident if a conventional aircraft or turbine powered hovercraft were taking off or passing over.  After about 15 to ! 30 seconds the wall of lights and whirring noise vanished.

We were sitting in the lawn area overlooking the ocean when we heard several people in a parking lot next to us to the south speaking loudly and pointing to a blinking object in the sky.  The object was about ½ mile south of our position, at about a 30–45 degree angle from our position, hovering over the beach at maybe 500’ (?).  From our position it looked small maybe about the size of a penny held at arm’s length.  It looked like a sphere with a ring around it, kind of like the planet Saturn.  It had a lot of lights on it many different colors.  Very bright white/silver, green maybe others, not sure.  The white/silver lights were constant and there were others blinking.  There was a violet one on the bottom that blinked a lot slower than the others, maybe once every second.  The others were faster. The object hovered for about a minute that we observed.  It then slowly turned west then south arcing slightly as it did.  It then headed south slowly then VERY quickly picked up speed and continued south down the beach until we lost sight of it. My wife noted there was a small plane approaching the object from the north and when the plane got really close, the object turned and quickly sped away.  As my wife said, ""It hauled butt."" I had difficulty getting my phone camera to focus in the dark, but managed to snap one picture as soon as I saw it, then started video recording for 30 seconds or so.  I turned off video so I could snap another picture.  When I turned it off, the object had started its turn.  I turned the video back on until I lost sight of it. We are not sure what this was.  It was definitely not a plane or helicopter.  It couldn’t have been a drone as the drone would have to have been a big one, at least 10-15 feet in diameter.

At around midnight, I started watching a movie on television.

Just to the left of my TV is a large, south-facing window that I keep open this time of year.  While there are a few tall but thin trees across the street from me, I have a pretty good view of the sky from where I was sitting (on my couch).   There was not a cloud in the sky this night.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what I initially thought was a distant lightning strike as the entire skyline lit up enough to put the trees in silhouette.  But.... no thunder... I dismissed it, believing perhaps a distant power transformer had popped...even though the hue of the light was markedly blue.   Ten to fifteen minutes later, it happened again.  At this point i! dismissed it as some kind of visual distortion... it was late...perhaps i had my eyes open too long and glanced at the window and imagined the flash...and as I was looking out the window, it happened again. My cat started going berserk about this time.  Normally, he is lazy.  Suddenly he was all about chasing invisible things, and meowing incessently. This went on until approximately 3am, at seemingly irregular intervals.  I finally decided to get up, go outside with ALL of my house lights off and look to the sky to make sure I was actually seeing what I thought I was seeing.  I noticed that the dogs in the neighborhood were quite vocal, which is unusual. I was nearly finished with my cigarette, when *FLASH* it happened again.  I immediately activated the stop watch on my iphone to see if in fact the flashes were occurring at regular intervals or not...and, of course, not a single other flash happened after that... I did not see any *craft* per se, but this was bizarre... and after reading the post from thie person in Renton on the same night at the same time, I felt highly compelled to let them know that they were not alone in seeing this strangeness.

At the time of this incident, I was waiting for a crucial phone call after my second interview for a job.  I was concerned that filing a UFO sighting report might not help my chances of getting the job, so I never got around to filing the report, until now.  (I never did get that fucking job.)  I went out for a later-than usual walk at about 9:45 p.m. on Friday, November 25, 2011.  After a little more than 5 minutes, I was heading westbound on SW 178th Terrace, when I looked up and saw what looked like one of those “orange fireball” UFOs that Linda Moulton Howe had been discussing on her Earthfiles website, a few weeks earlier.  The object was headed southbound, going slowly.  I was trying to discern whether it was one of those Japanese sky lanterns (a candle suspended under a small, parachute-type thing that retains the hot air for lift).  There was a guy about a half-mile southwest of this spot whom I had seen launching those Japanese lanterns, although he was downwind of this location. The wind was blowing from east to west at this time. Once the object got as far south as the street I was on, it sped up and changed its heading toward the southwest.  It sped up from about 10 m.p.h. to about 75 m.p.h.  I concluded that it started moving too fast to be a Japanese lantern as the wind was blowing perpendicular to its course when I first saw it and it was still on too much of a southbound trajectory to be blown by the wind as a Japanese lantern travels. Beyond that, the “fireball” section was too big.  It was an exposed fireball (not enclosed by any lantern covering) and it was large enough to have immolated anything that could have been keeping it aloft. I observed 3 smaller orange lights trailing the “fireball” part, which appeared to be mounted on some structure (apparently some sort of beam, similar to the beam behind the engine on a helicopter).  After it turned, the smaller lights appeared to be surrounding the fireball – so it changed configuration at that point.  It appeared to be about 1,500 feet above ground level, depending on its size. Just as it was disappearing from view, I approached a house with the father, mother and (approximately) 20-year-old daughter all looking up at the object.  The daughter was photographing it with her iPhone.  I had been trying to do the same thing but it was too dark.  When I got in front of the house, the mother looked at me and asked:  “Did you see the UFO?” (I never thought that someone would be asking ME, “Did you see the UFO?”  That’s the question I usually ask.)  I went over there and we discussed the event. The mother said that she observed a triangular shape to the object.  They had been watching it longer than I had been and she had more time to look for structure.  The daughter was unable to get a good picture because the iPhone of that vintage was ill-suited for such photos.  I had the same problem with my first-generation iPhone. As I walked away, it was exactly 10:00.  I was thinking that the object appeared to be headed toward Key West, and by 10:00 on a Friday night, everyone on Key West would be drunk, so no matter how many witnesses there might be – nobody would ever believe them.",2016-07-08T00:00:00,,

It may have been flying at 5-10,000 feet relative to the eastern patch of clouds.  I noticed how it covered the stars as it passed ! above, which made it easy to track its  flight path in the sky.  I only observed the craft for approximately two minutes or less and it was out of my line of sight quickly.  I was standing 20 feet from my one-story apartment door which impaired my sight to the west.  I doubt I would have observed much even if I went to my backyard as there are trees and other houses on the other side of the street that would have also impaired my sight.  I entered my apartment shortly after that and did not observe anything else.",2016-07-08T00:00:00,39.503644,-118.30940000000001

On WestJet flight 166 from YVR to YEG, we spotted an object out our starboard window, approximately 700-1000 meters from the plane. It was about 40-50 minutes into our flight.  We had reached cruising altitude approx. 35k ft. When we first saw it, it looked like a large ball at the front with a long net-like or skirt-like structure trailing it.  At first we thought it was a scratch on the window, then it started moving in a flowing like manner. The ball shape at the front was always at the lead of the direction it was moving.  Same direction as the plane - or so it appeared. It was black. We were stunned and trying to understand what we were looking at for about 1-2 minutes before I started taking pictures.  At that point it had flattened out or turned and appeared flat. The object was by our side for approximately 3 minutes until we past it. It had structure.  It was not smoke or a contrail. I can only roughly approximate the size as it was far away but close enough to see detail. 10-15 meters long and 5 meters wide when spread out. We stayed on the plane until everyone had left and asked the pilots if they saw it.  They said they did not. Trying to understand what it was.  Can't explain it currently.  Looking for help or someone that has seen something similar. It was a safety concern.  It was close to the plane.  Whatever it was, if it got in the engines, it would have been trouble. Thought it might be a drone, but that is high for a drone, especially with the long thing flying behind it. Aerodynamically, the flowing skirt doesn't make sense.  It creates drag.  Kites use ribbons for stabilizers, not for lift.  Only thing similar I can think of is a sail, but the ball thing was at the lead, not the skirt.

Me and my wife were driving down East street Ludlow, Ma.  There was just this EXTREMELY bright circular object in the sky, it was almost as if it was glistening.  My wife said she felt as if it was two put together in one, like one behind the other, not saucer nothing like that, just these circular balls of light.   The object was extremely bright during the dusk in Ludlow, MA around 8:15 pm. It was so bright I could barely pay attention to the road. It was not blinding me from driving, I just have never seen anything that bright in the sky before. We turned onto the bridge in Ludlow Ave and just like that it was gone.  There were two helicopters in the air, I just felt odd because I knew they were looking at the same thing we were looking at.  They looked like army helicopters, the ones with the double propellers.  It was just so bright…   My wife is usually a skeptic, but years ago I had a sighting at a lake out in the Indian Orchard area of a friend’s house, right in the vicinity of that area.  I thought I would never have seen another anomaly in the sky again.  The last sighting made me feel as if I was crazy,  I just couldn’t understand the reality of what I had seen, not literal crazy.  It was a clear blue sky, grey looking flat thing,with some kind of fog or haze appearing right before my eyes, not even like a saucer.  It lasted for about 3 seconds maybe?  I only say this because what I seen tonight, had made this my second sighting?  Or so I like to believe.  It just helped me to revalidate the questioning of my own sense of reality.  I saw something very BRIGHT.   I work at a fitness gym, I also run a few of my own businesses along with my wife.

I am 57 years old and a paralegal for an investment advisor firm in New York City.  I live in a studio apt on the top floor of a 4th Floor walk-up in the Kip’s Bay area on the East Side of Manhattan.  There is a balcony in the back of the apt that has a view facing the skyline looking out over the East River towards Queens and Brooklyn.   I often go out to the balcony on warm clear nights to look at the stars and get some fresh air.  I went out 2 nights ago, on June 21st, around midnight, when I spotted a strange object hovering over the East River.  It looked like a roundish, oval shape that was not illuminated except for the city lights shining up on it and the nearly full moon behind it.  It looked to be about  1/5th  the size of a normal full moon from where I was standing which was about 5 blocks from the East River.  The altitude was higher than the Empire State Building which stands west of my vantage point.  It looked to be at least as big as a house in my estimation. 	It was a clear night with just a few small puffy clouds still hanging in the sky near the object and I thought that maybe the object was just a small portion of a cloud but there was a breeze blowing North and the other clouds soon blew past the object and dissipated while the object remained in the same spot and hovered completely motionless.  At this point I thought I might have something out of the ordinary here so I ran back into my apartment and got my binoculars.  I steadied the binoculars against a balcony railing and managed to capture the object in my sights.  It looked oval shaped and had sort of a greenish, grayish color.  I could not discern any details such as windows or defining structure because it was difficult to keep in focus.  I thought I may have seen a few tiny pinpoint size colored lights but cannot be certain. 	After a few moments it began to slowly move north towards upper Manhattan and I could see stars passing behind it as it moved.  I could not hear any sound coming from it.  After moving north for a few hundred yards it changed direction and started heading due East over Long Island City in Queens.  I lost sight of it after a very tall tree in a neighboring yard blocked my view.  I waited for a half an hour to see if it would return but it never did.

A couple of cars pulled over to the right shoulder and stopped.  I told my wife to grab her phone and take some pictures.  We both have new iPhone 6SE’s.  She took six pictures as I was driving.  She doesn’t know how to do much beyond voice and text on her phone, so she didn’t think to use the video camera.  The pictures are pretty blurry from car movement and her trying to use the camera portion of the phone.  We did get the lights, though it may not be of much use.  Included are the photos just as they are from the phone.  This was the night of the solstice moon, but this was not the moon we were seeing.",2016-07-08T00:00:00,48.5323,-122.3184

It was around 6:20pm, so the sun was still high in the sky.  It was sunny and partly cloudy.  A shiny object in the sky caught my eye.  I would say that it was like an oval-ish shape, I couldn't see any sharp edges but it was solid.  The reflection was bright and it made it hard to see the actual shape of the object was.  I did not see it appear, I just happened to notice it.  I was around I-10 and Dairy Ashford and it was on my right, north of I-10.  It was wasn't too high but it wasn't too low on the horizon to where the view of it could be obstructed by trees or anything.  I just stared at it.  There was some traffic so I wasn't driving too fast so I was able to see if it had a trajectory path but it did not move, it stayed at the same position.  I was trying to see if it was a plane, but the way that it shone, it could have not been because it wasn't small enough, the reflection was too bright and it would require a lot more surface area.  The shape of a small plane could of not have cast the amount to light or reflection that this object did and from that distance, it would of been too small anyway.  At first all I could notice was the bright reflective surface, but the more I looked, I could see that it was silver on the bottom part.  Again, it was hard to see the actual shape of the object, but it was solid. There is a small airport on Groschke Road that is between Barker Cypress and Hwy 6.  I occasionally see small planes take off so its not out of ordinary for me to see things in the sky,  I have even seen colorful hot air ballons come from south of I-10 in Katy,  I am not too sure where exactly they come from but it has been a while since I have seen those.  However, this object or I guess UFO was rather large but at the same time seemed far away.  If I would guess where the UFO was on top of, I would guess that it was between the Mason Rd to Fry Rd and Saums to Clay Rd area.  So as I am driving I pass under the Hwy 6 overpass and when I look at the same spot in the sky, it was gone.  I looked around to see if it moved lower or higher but it was nowhere.  The Hwy 6 overpass only obstructed my view for about 5 seconds.  The length of time that I saw this UFO was no more than 1 minute. When I first saw it I felt curious and I was thinking of all the possibilites of what this could of be! en. When I continued to see it, I felt kind of confused because I couldn't understand what the object was and when it disappeared quickly I was just shocked and I also felt upset at myself for not taking a picture of it. I am sure that it would of been visible. If somebody knows what this object was or if you saw it too, please leave a comment.  I have been trying to forget or to talk myself out of thinking that I saw a UFO.  I am not one of those kind of people that think that there are aliens out there or those that do a lot of research on conspiracy theories but I cannot explain what could that could have been but I KNOW what I saw. I can't talk myself out of this and forget it so I wanted to let others know. Sorry this is so long but I wanted to be highly descriptive!",2016-07-08T00:00:00,29.775480377035134,-95.78561259640104

On August 6th, 2016, I was in attendance at the stock car races at Meridian Speedway in Meridian, Idaho.  The lady seated next to me and I had been talking about my line of work as a pilot, and she began to put a couple of eye drops in her eye.  As she looked up, she said, “Oh, and there’s an airplane now.”  I, too, looked up and immediately noticed what she was looking at was most definitely not an aircraft of any kind. At first glance, the object appeared to be directly overhead the speedway at an altitude of approximately ten to fifteen thousand feet AGL (above ground level).  The object was quite bright in the evening sky.  The object was VERY slowly moving west.  The object’s shape was hard to decipher, but it was definitely not perfectly circular.  The shape was more oblong than anything, or perhaps even cylindrical shaped.  I noticed other people in attendance at the speedway were beginning to watch the object as more people had their heads turned.  I kept a keen eye on the object and noticed that it’s almost imperceptible movement began to slow after a few minutes.   The object moved from directly overhead Meridian, Idaho, to directly over what appeared to be Nampa, Idaho, in the span of fifteen minutes.  During the first few minutes of observation, my guess was that the object was a weather balloon.  Weather balloons are launched over the Treasure Valley twice daily from the National Weather Service station in Boise, Idaho.  I looked at my watch and discovered that the last weather balloon was launched over two hours ago.  The object never decreased in size during the entire hour that I watched it, indicating to me that this was definitely not a weather balloon.  Weather balloons decrease in relative size from the naked eye as they gain altitude.  This object was not gaining altitude and was remaining the same size during the entire viewing.  The object appeared to be emitting its own light, and as the sun set and the other stars and planets became visible the object appeared to become much more red in color. The lady seated next to me was quite interested in the object and tried taking numerous photos of the object with her iphone, but none of the images showed anything of merit.  After about 45 minutes of watching the object the lady seated next to me decided to go to her car and view the object with a pair of binoculars she had in her car.  She left and I last viewed the object almost an hour after first witnessing the object.  I looked up again a couple minutes later and the object was gone.  The lady returned a few minutes later looking rather flustered and stated that she was at her car viewing the object with her binoculars, looking directly at the red orb, when in vanished into thin air. I know this was not an aircraft, as I’m a full-time pilot, and I’m quite aware of what aircraft of all types look like in the sky.  This object was not a weather balloon, drone, or blimp of any kind.  The object emitted a very bright light in the evening sky and emitted a very bright red/orange glow after sunset.  The peculiar shape of the object and the odd movement of the object are what baffle me. I know dozens of other people at the speedway that night witnessed the object, so hopefully they too will write reports. I first witnessed the object at 20:17 and last saw the object at 21:13 local time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

This even took place August 6, 2016, at around 9:30 PM, just before dusk turned into night in Boise, Idaho.   It was a beautiful evening, and there wasn’t a cloud in the sky.  Mars and Saturn were visible in the southwest skies, along with Jupiter in the west, just below and to the right, of the crescent moon.  Vega and Arcturus were barely visible and directly above of us.  Right in the middle of those two stars was what I thought was Venus.   My wife was nearby and I showed her what I thought was a cool looking planet.  That’s how bright this circle in the dusk sky was and it looked like it was reflecting back the Suns light just like Venus does.   She told me, “Go get your phone and use your Sky app and see if it’s Venus for sure.”  I observed this for about 10-15 minutes and the object was STATIONARY the entire time and it appeared to be in outer space and not in our atmosphere.   I went inside and got my phone and when I came back outside and looked up the object was gone!  Naturally!  So in any event, I still fired up my Google Sky app pointed it up where the object was and that’s when I found out that Venus was on the horizon in the western sky and I just couldn’t see it because the tree tops were obstructing the view.  I’m VERY certain this wasn’t an unusually bright star that only appeared in the sky for about 20 minutes.  If this was a satellite, then it was as big or bigger than the ISS (which I have seen dozens of times flying overhead west to east) and it had some form of exotic propulsion system, or maybe the solar arrays changed location and were no longer reflecting back the light, rendering the object invisible, I don’t know.  This being my 4th UFO sighting tripped me out big time because i! f this was some type of UFO then it was absolutely gigantic, like maybe a huge mother ship.

In the binoculars it was still quite small but I could see a much higher level of detail.  It was perfectly circular with what appeared to be an indentation in the center and a horizontal darker patch running across the circle.   I grabbed my hunting rifle to see it at a higher magnification and could see a much more detailed view.  It appeared to be a plate shaped disk with two proportionately large tubular curved pieces above and below the darker horizontal line which now with the higher magnification seemed to be some type of structure running across the center indentation.

When we looked up, we noticed the plane, but also noticed a silvery round object that appeared to be stationary.  We watched the object for nearly an hour, with a fair wind, clouds passed under it and three aircraft flew passed it, but it didn't move.  Somehow it was geosynchronous.  After exhausting our SkyView and GoogleSky apps we determined it wasn't something that showed up on either.   We drove north about four miles to a friend's house and borrowed their spotting scope.  The object was still in full view; under a 45X view the object appeared shimmering silver and almost translucent, a spiral pattern of ribs was clearly visible on the bottom of the object.  One individual reported clearly seeing blinking lights in fixed position on the lower portion of the object.  Five of us watched the object through the scope until about 10:00pm when it started to! fade with the dimming light.  The individual looking at the object at the time reported that, while he had a clear view of it, it vanished right before his eyes.

I was sitting in my living room, inside my apartment, watching TV.  I turned my head to look out the screen door of my balcony, thinking it might be someone flying a toy helicopter (because I was not expecting what I saw), and instead see a green light just sitting there, about the same brightness of a star, but bigger than the typical one observed in the sky at night.  As it just sat there still, the whirring noise had stopped. 	About five seconds had passed, when I then said out loud to my mother, who was sitting next to me, “What is that?”  I watched it for about another five seconds, and as I stood up to get a closer look, the light started to move again.  As it moved, I got a clearer look at if the light was coming off of anything – it was coming off of a grey disc/saucer shaped object.  The object made a slight turn, almost like a U-turn, and then ascended up higher into the sky and came towards my apartment building, flying up and away above it.  The whole time it was moving, the whirring sound occurred. 	I went outside onto my balcony and looked around but I could no longer see it. My mother had not seen anything but she believed me when I told her what I saw.  I only observed one saucer but it was moving much faster and stranger than an airplane or helicopter would.  I am not sure if anyone else observed this, whether from their balconies or the street below.  I am almost positive that what I saw was a UFO. 	About 5 minutes after the sighting, my cat started acting extremely weird.  She started running around the apartment, jumping and sliding on our rug.  I don’t know if UFO’s have the tendency to affect animal behaviour, but I found it extremely weird for her to starting acting like this all of a sudden.

Amazing to see such a close bright vibrant red star, and somewhat next to it was a red star nearly as bright and also seemingly closer to the Earth too.  Then the brighter of the two just started rising high up into the sky.  Once it got extremely high it would seem like just another hard to see star.  It would flash a time or two and then disappear.  Then the other star next to it moved off to left of it in a westerly direction, and slowly started to move high up into the sky just as the first one did, and then it did the same thing.  It just blinked out.  As soon as it did, another very bright red star popped into existence low into the sky and just sat there, still, not moving.  After about 5-10 seconds, it repeated what it had done before, just as it would be ready to blink out from being seen (it would reach a high level in the sky and then stop; and then vanish from being seen), there would appear a super vibrant red light down low in the sky and this pattern repeated again and again for 3-4 cycles.  We stopped to watch this in complete awe, and then after watching it for 5 minutes, it all just stopped.  About 3 minutes later, 2 very bright red lights/sphere just appeared high in the sky, but relatively low (like when the GoodYear Blimp is very high up, but comparatively low in relation to clouds/stars).

The rest of them just disappeared; some went across the complete sky.

I could not determine what it was I was looking at-it was simply a very small white dot against the bright blue, sunlit sky. I brought out binoculars and thru them could tell that this mystery dot was an object much farther away than the tops of the trees.  But even through binoculars it was still just an odd white circle.  I then brought out my 8-inch telescope and for the first time in my life a “mystery object” stayed exactly where it was while I sighted in on it instead of disappearing to let me ponder what I’d seen.  When I popped in my 40mm eyepiece, I was shocked at the view. It was like nothing I’d seen before.  The object looked like the protective grille of a fan, with highly reflective, or independently lit spines, radiating outward in an arc.  Inside the fan grille shape was what looked like a bowl tipped sideways.  Protruding from where one end of the bowl met the grille, there appeared to be antennae of some sort. As I watched I became aware that this object was slowly rotating, placing the antennae away from me so I could not see it, and then bringing it back into my view.  As it rotated, it also presented me a view that brightly reflected an “S” shape within the grille.  It also started to slowly move across my field of view in the eyepiece but I was easily able to follow it. I called my aunt in Boise, who lives near the foothills on the northeast side of town, and asked her to try to spot this thing, and she was able to immediately, but there were a few thin clouds over her area, clouds that were extremely low on the horizon for me as I faced northeast, watching this object continue to rotate and pick up a small amount of forward speed.  It was still visible, though growing smaller and appeared to slow its rotation when I quit watching…  Thankfully I’d snapped several fairly detailed pictures with my cell phone and then with a digital camera, by holding both, individually, up to the eyepiece of my telescope. I even took a few video clips that are of decent quality. I was so excited to see this object that as soon as I had sighted in on it and realized it was not something common, I called your hotline and made a brief report while the sighting was occurring. Last night, my aunt and I tried to identify what we might have seen, trying to debunk our own sighting, but we could not. The closest thing we could compare this odd object to was a Loon Balloon, but both of us agree that was not what we had seen.  Our object was stationary for quite a long time overhead when I first noticed it, but rotating very slowly and the appendage that appeared to be antennae was solidly affixed so that it was able to be suspended horizontally as the rotation continued, and did not hang from below.  When it began to move it was following a fixed path in the sky,  It appeared to be controlled in some intelligent way, until it reached an area northeast of Boise then it began to shift more to the north. What is also of extreme interest is that the pictures my aunt took with her phone depict more than one object-or this same object was able to change its shape-not something I had been aware of but I had taken my eyes off it several times...  But I will let her share that part of the story within her own report.",2016-08-16T00:00:00,43.56891901408451,-116.56197605633803

It seemed to be on a northeastern path, exactly toward Bogus Basin Ski area in the Boise Mountains above where we live.   As I was taking photos, I noticed that this ball changed from the single big white ball to a single smaller ball then two balls the three balls in a triangle shape, then a purplish looking tube shape, then a couple of odd shapes before it went back to the bigger single white ball shape.

On the last night of the Gimli Film Festival, in a crowd of hundreds, sitting on the beach of Lake Winnipeg after dark, watching the screening of The Goonies.  It was warm, humid, very few clouds (stars and moon were easily visible).  About half an hour into the feature I noticed above and to the right of my peripheral (the film screen--which is on the beach--faces west) I saw a fairly bright red light moving West to East in the sky.  They were nearly as bright as a distant road flare, or about the brightness of a traffic light.  I'm guessing they were no more than about 1 or 2 km away. I watched this red light as it moved in a more-or-less straight line at first moving slowly then about the speed of an airplane, towards the left somewhat behind the top of the screen. What strikes me odd is that there was no discernible sound as you'd expect from any airplane (granted the intermittent sound from the movie speakers may have masked it), nor were the lights blinking at all in any way (as you'd expect from any airplane).  At first I thought it might be a drone with a light attached to it but a drone would not have continued travelling so far out over the lake. Within one minute from the moment that first light appeared I see a second identical light, following a similar path, they were perhaps 500 meters apart (or the length of two hands held up).  So for a minute or two I watch both objects as they seem to either diminish or speed off into the distance across the lake, and at a higher altitude, possibly into distant cloud cover, but unsure since I recall still being able to make out pinpricks of light before they were completely gone. I estimate their average speed was 250 km/h; sighting lasted under 5 minutes, lights appeared to cross the lake which is about 25km in that direction. I considered taking a video on my phone for evidence but figured surely it must be something ordinary what with all these other people seeing it also. Then again I'm pretty sure if the lights were from an aircraft they would have stayed within view for a lot longer as I have previously seen planes fly across the lake at night; it takes more time for a light to travel out of sight, especially the further it gets.  In other words a plane's lights appear to move faster when it is near, and slower towards the distance.... these lights were precisely the opposite--slow when near, faster in the distance.  I can rationalize a great many lights or objects in the sky, but I don't have a good-enough explanation for these two.  If they were some kind of lit-up balloons they would have stayed visible for a lot longer, and with little to no wind would not even have traveled from the trees, across the beach and over the water in so little time.  If they were meteors/fireballs/etc., they'd have fallen in a downward--not upward-direction.  If they were planes there'd have been a blinking green light, unless it was taking off or landing then a br! ighter white light. Maybe a military plane has just a steady red light, but then I'd have definitely heard the sound of a jet engine, especially if accelerating to vanish into the distance towards the other side of the lake.  But let's suppose it was a plane with a solid red light just it was too high to have been heard... then how could the light have been so unmistakably bright over the beach?  Bright enough to distract an entire audience from watching a movie?  Not even the Northern Lights managed to do that until the movie was over.",2016-08-02T00:00:00,50.6333,-97.0

I was coming home from work and had just pulled into my driveway.  I exited the vehicle and glanced over the top of my house to the north...I always do this when I come home from work.  I do not know why.  I live in a pretty dense neighborhood (my lot is .18 of an acre), but being a weeknight it was quiet..no dogs barking, no people out so pretty typical. I live in the flight path of two airports, one that houses mostly business jets as well as recreational aircraft; the other regional jets to international flyers.  I also am subject to the hospital emergency helicopter, aka LifeStar, from time to time and also grew up in the flight path of a military base and get buzzed by the Met Life blimp once a year due to a PGA Golf Tournament that is run a few towns over, so I am pretty familiar with what I should and should NOT be hearing above my head. Like I said, I exited the vehicle and glanced above my house to the north.  My routine.  I was stopped short because I heard something that didn't sound right.  It was a low steady frequency with absolutely ZERO movement to it.  It did not sound mechanical.  I focused my eyes to where it was coming from.  Then up and above my house and over the tops of the trees this massive vessel/craft/ship appeared, strong and steady. It was a long, blunt triangle shape.  Think of a triangle with the tip cut off.  On each of the 4 points there was a steady bright white light I took to be the indicator lights.  Between the back 2 white indicator lights, there was a big bright red light that blinked, not fast..slow and steady.  On the blunt tip between those 2 indicator lights there was what seemed like a wall of lights that only shone straight ahead...like headlights per say.  This ship was either very low or very big.   As it passed overhead heading in a southerly direction, I just stood there, quite literally frozen to the spot, mesmerized by what I was seeing.  I had my iPhone in my hand but I didn't want to take my eyes off it even for a second so I could be present and remember what I saw so I could keep every detail in my head.  As it passed,it was all I saw, all I heard and nothing else mattered.  I was not scared..  I was more, interested and curious.

Then it would stop before cutting back in a different direction. It was white when I first saw it, but as it moved it began to change colors.  Not blinking... but more like shifting through many different colors.   I went back into my house to get my phone so I could video it, but it was too dark for anything to show up.

This photograph was taken last evening at my house near Bow during a test session with my Leica R lenses and a new Sony A7 Mark II camera. I was shooting at the open blue sky at f/11 to see whether the imperfections on my images were caused primarily by dust motes on the camera sensor or in the lenses. This particular shot was taken with a 35mm f/2.0 Leica R focused at infinity and stopped down to f/11. I saved the images to my laptop, then pulled up each one and put it in Paint so I could examine it closely, and then draw circles around each ""dust mote"" to see if they remained in the same place (sensor) or only showed up on a particular lens. I was examining each magnified photo,seeing that I had also photographed some distant birds flying quite high, and came across what looks to be some sort of large and long metallic cylinder, obviously shining in the sun. You can see that the side facing the sun (right and west) is reflecting the light while the other side (left and east) is in shadow conforming with the sun being lower on the horizon tot he right (west). I did not actually see this object but only discovered that I had unintentionally taken a picture of it after the fact. As I finished marking the slide, I noticed what looks to perhaps be a second cylindrical object, far less clearly defined but it looks the same (lower left). The primary object would have been too high to make out with the naked eye. The object does not appear in any of the other lens shots so it is likely that it was moving. I cannot figure out what this might be.  Checked for the ISS but it had gone by much earlier here and besides would not likely show up with a 35mm wide angle lens. I am thinking that if this is an item inside the lens, it would also be out of focus and there would not be sunlight shining on it. Cannot think of any obvious explanation for what this might be. Incidentally, I have been an ornithologist for 50 years so am a very experienced observer of items in the sky.",2016-07-08T00:00:00,48.566,-122.4441

Last night (08/09/2016) I lay in my bed watching Netflix as my fiancee goes to open the front door for his friend.   After a short while, they both call my name, screaming.  The way that they were yelling made me think my cat had run into the street and got hit or something.  I jumped up and ran outside, only to find that his friend saw orange orbs in the sky.  At first, I was calm, and I replied, “Oh, I see these all the time I told you ufo are real... I see them all the time.”  His friend thought my statement to be strange; she suggested we go inside but at first, I wasn’t afraid because I see them all the time.  She was so frightened that she left.  My fiancee decided that we needed to record this, so he went inside to look for my real camera.  Now I will describe what we saw. On Bryden St., between Joy Rd and Livernois, we spotted 12 orange orbs popping up in threes to the left of the sky just over Dearborn, Michigan, Warren Ave, and Wyoming area if you were facing west like we were.  The orbs appear from nowhere low in the sky and slowly floated up over the clouds.  Once they got high over the clouds, they changed to match the clouds they became the same color and even made themselves appear the same texture as the clouds, however, they had become disc shaped.  Once in this form, they floated across the sky towards us which was north to joy from Dearborn.  They appeared to glide across the sky, and they were silent.  Once directly over my hear I could see two dark gray circles on the bottom of the craft spinning.  Once they got just across Joy Rd almost to Chicago on Central, they began to lower they turned dark grayish black and dropped down from the sky to the ground. At that point, I was crying and panicking because I never saw them do that before, and they seemed to be trying to be invisible, and I was terrified, so I ran into the house crying.  I called my best friend the only person who would believe such a crazy story, and she doesn't believe in ufo, but she believes in me… she calmed me down and told me to pack an emergency bag just in case.

A few seconds into viewing the object, it flared, increasing greatly in brightness and then dimming.  I am aware of what satellite flares are, so I was not surprised at this point.   The object continued to dim and then a bright white/green flash appeared below (?) the object, about the diameter of a quarter if held at arm's distance.

(Being a fan of coast to coast of course I said “All of the yes!”)  I looked at the sky, out towards the field and at first, I just saw flashing red, white, and green lights and thought it may have been a drone but as it flew closer, I guess the best that I can describe it was kind of like a spinning blinking triangle.

My uber driver told me to look out for a meteor shower from midnight till six. I was standing outside smoking a cigarette in my driveway when I heard a strange sound. It was almost like a helicopter blade, but it sounded fake. A few minutes later, I saw the UFO. it flew low to the ground from my right side, making an arc all the way around my horizon and disappearing out of view behind the school across the street from my house.  The craft looked strange, with piercing white lights on it and one red light at the front.  The whole thing was lit with an orangeish hue. I pulled out my phone to record this first incident.  I texted my best friend who is a fellow believer and told him I'd send him the video-only to discover the video was completely gone.  There was no trace of me recording even though I had clearly done so. Freaked out, I sit on the curb on my driveway and watch the sky.  A shooting star appears and flies right into the spot I saw the craft disappear from view.  I try to calm down and I make a wish as one is supposed to do.  I'm sitting there watching the sky closely and, texting my friend. I get the strange feeling I am being watched so I stand up and shout ""I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE THERE.""  Five minutes pass and I see the craft again (possibly a separate UFO of the same kind).  I am so frightened this time, not only because it has reappeared but because it seemed to have heard me.  It comes from the same direction I saw the first ship, but takes a slightly less direct route.  It makes no sound this time. Again, I try to record it with my phone.  This time, my phone actually goes completely dead out of nowhere.  The craft lazily disappears out of view, the same way the other one did. I sit down again and begin to shake.  My heart is racing and I'm scared for my life and my sanity.  I keep watching the sky only to see four or maybe five shooting stars all in the same area I saw the UFO's.  Just as I'm about to go inside and charge my phone and grab another cigarette, a third craft appears.  This time, it's coming from the left of me, and it seems closer than before. The craft appears to have a rotating circle of white lights that almost look like stars. The orange hue is very prevalent and I can clearly make out the shape...  It's almost like a ""cigar"" with lights.  I watch the craft fly towards the meteor shower, make a right turn, and then turn into a single red light.  It was almost as if it was cloaked. My friend arrives on the scene shortly after that.  Scared shitless, we sit in my driveway and watch the sky.  My friend points out a very skinny cloud on an otherwise clear night that follows the path I saw the first craft take.  We don't see anything else for a long time, until I notice a star that is blinking and changing colors, and even moving slightly.  My friend and I grab my camera and walk a few blocks, using the camera to zoom in on it.   We eventually go back to my place and I can tell the inadvertent doubt has set in for my friend.  ""Maybe it's just a star, man.""  After all the things I saw last night, I can't be so sure.  Not to mention, now on my iPhone there are four black images where the video files should be, and the first time I tried to look closely at them my phone died instantly.",2016-08-16T00:00:00,35.98046262866192,-78.8981362628662

That's when I knew that it was moving at the same speed as my truck.  And then it was on the other side of my truck almost as if it was pinned on me, for the next few minutes it traveled through rolling hills switching sides being in the front and then gone and then I'm the rear. It was a bright white light that flashed in roughly 1-2 seconds segments.   And it appeared to be only one, but I took a video through my side mirror and you can see the flashes moving in a direction and then the next flash it was well behind that, faster than any man made machine could possibly have done.  This occurrence also happened after I was at a rest stop and felt my uhaul truck swaying and I look at the long grass and trees and there was minimal wind it would take gusts to rock it the way it was rocking while the truck was not turned on.  I didn't think anything of it, but I felt that there was someone in the back and went an opened the back gate and even asked whoever was in there to please get out that it was not safe to ride with all the furniture.  Saw and heard nothing.   Got back into the cab and after a short time the rocking proceeded.  I banged on the back of the truck and said at least ride up here with me I have potato chips I can share, and to keep me company, as I was just joking not thinking anyone was in there but to take my mind off of it cuz it was making me paranoid.  Well, after the strange encounter with the flashing light that followed me for a good 5-10 miles it slowly disappeared into the distance very high in the air.  I got out to check the back again and the lights on the outside ! of the truck were flickering, just enough for me to notice as ! the were not flickering before the flashing unknown object laid before me.   I fell asleep in the truck an hour down the road and proceeded to call it hallucinations for the exhaustion from moving all day and driving all night.   That evening after work, I was telling someone about my hallucinations and how real it seemed and how paranoia can really mess with someone's head, when I remembered I took 2 short videos of the occurrence in a quick manner and had not looked at them yet.  Expecting not to see anything, it terrified me to see the light as I had seen it the night before on that very dark country highway leading into Colfax, Washington, and I even called my wife during the whole thing to tell her how scared I was and asking why is this light following me.  She even thought I was just tripping.    Well after I saw the videos I have never been more scared to be outside after dark, it really puzzled me on how real this was and how much it seemed to be a fantasy in a made up story book.  It was a moment I will not forget soon, and I went from riding a fence in existence of aliens, to full blown belief of them, and I was better off not knowing or seeing the event from that night.",2016-08-16T00:00:00,46.85819999999999,-117.44440000000002

The night of Tuesday, July 26, 2016, I was up late watching a movie.  I cannot state where I live as I also work there, and any mention of the organization I work for by name gives them the right to own this report, but I can say I am a fire lookout.   At about 22:30, I had to go to the bathroom and walked out onto the catwalk of my fire lookout and noted a white light with red and green flashing lights to the north just off the horizon.  I assumed it to be an airplane, but took note of it because it was not on the general metropolitan to metropolitan flight paths that cross over my area, and it appeared significantly lower than standard planes.  The lights were also brighter and larger than far-off commercial airliners. I went back into the lookout and finished my movie, and at about 23:00 I went out on the catwalk to brush my teeth and noted the object was still there and appeared to have not moved at all.  This surprised me, as neither airplanes nor satellites stay in the same place for that period of time.   After brushing my teeth I returned inside and looked at it through binoculars briefly, then pulled out my spotting scope and fixed on the object at 60x.  I cannot accurately gauge the object’s distance, but judging by the increase in size of the object through the spotting scope I would estimate it to be 30 to 50 miles away with an exact azimuth of 22.2 degrees from my position (as measured with an Osborne Fire-Finder 1934 model).   The object was kite like in shape, but narrower side to side and longer top to bottom.  It had a white/orange light in the center similar in color to an old halogen headlight, with a red light below and right of the white/orange one, and a green light above and ! left of it.  The object itself was dark, and I can only estimate at its shape due to the visible light emitted from the white/orange light.  The white/orange light remained constant but the green and red lights alternated strobing.  As this is the standard pattern for commercial aircraft, I then wondered if this was a helicopter and my mind was simply making the shape with the visible light it could see.  Within the 60x magnification of my spotting scope however, the object did not move out of the frame from 23:00 to 00:00.  That would require an object to remain absolutely still, uncharacteristic of helicopters. At midnight is when I witnessed its only visible change.  At midnight exactly, another object entered the sky while I was looking through the scope, so I did not see it immediately when it assumedly rose above the horizon.  It was below the previously listed object, slightly to the right, and did not come more than a few degrees above the horizon at any given time.  I also looked at this one through the spotting scope. The shape appeared to be two isosceles triangles facing down, connected together at the widest point.  The color was red at the top, orange in the center, and yellow at the bottom, with these three colors seeming to be lit up in a repeating wave pattern from top to bottom.  One triangle was dark while the other was lighted, and once one triangle went through its lit cycle of red-orange-yellow, it went dark and the other one repeated the cycle.  The rhythm of this light show of the two triangles was extremely fast.  The right triangle appeared in full and to perfectio! n as I could see all three corners; however when the left triangle lit up its top right corner was cut off at an angle.  This leads me to believe the right triangle was closer than the left, and the object was slightly turned away from me so I was not viewing it straight on.  Upon first viewing this object was rising above the horizon, stopped, hung at a single point without moving for exactly two minutes, then at 00:02, dropped below the horizon.  During the two minutes the double-triangle shaped object was in the air, the kite-shaped object previously listed in this report, rose in the sky 3.5 degrees (measured with an Osborne Fire-Finder) straight up at the exact same azimuth it was at previously.  The Osborne Fire-Finder can observe a tenth of a degree change for any given azimuth, and the kite shaped object did not move a tenth of a degree. I remained awake until 01:30 hours when I had to fall asleep as I had work the next day.  I am used to waking up at 06:00 so I was extremely tired.  The kite shaped object was still in the sky and still located in its second position listed in this report.  I awoke after daybreak at 07:30 and the object was not visible.",2016-08-02T00:00:00,,

I found it so unusual, I ran out to the end of our dock on Lake Whatcom and watched it eventually disappear over the distant mountains.  Never seen anything like it before.

At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks but while I was watching it seemed as though it jumped across the sky to the right.  To be honest I was so shocked I couldn't speak to signal my friends.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  As I kept watching it jumped again this time downward horizontally to the left.   I leaned my head out of the window to get a better look.  I was finally able to find my voice.  I shouted over my friends loud music, ""Guys!  It's a ((deleted)) UFO!""

Best Guess is June 21, 1975.  I found a note I wrote about the incident right after it happened (emailing note to you) as even at that young age I knew it was significant.  The note does not have a date on it unfortunately, but does say “Saturday 75”   The sighting was reported to the Black Hawk State Police Headquarters in Rock Island, Illinois, by telephone.  Back in the 1970’s, they were called the State Police District 7 officially.  If they keep records, an investigator should be able to search their telephone records on Saturdays (from April – October of 1975).  As the state police did say that they had received other calls about the object. It was around noon (Best guess 11 am -1 pm) on a Saturday. Nice day. Not too hot at all. My parents were pulling weeds in our front yard. I was 8 and bored so I laid on the ground near by facing the sky to watch clouds. I noticed an object appear in the Western Sky and move towards the North slowly before stopping and holding itself in mid air.  It was metallic colored.  In terms of positioning in the sky, it wasn’t as high as the clouds – definitely under cloud level, but not as low (but close) as a helicopter would be if it was flying over.  It looked large.  I had seen helicopters fly over before.  It was probably 2 to 2 ½ times the length of a helicopter.  The shape of this object was unique.  I had seen images of saucer shaped ufos before in magazines and on the television even at 8.  It did not have the expected round shape of a flying saucer.  I will tell you what I thought at the time in my mind as a 8 year old in terms of the shape – It very much reminded me of a model kit! I had from AMT called the Star Trek Romulan Bird Of Prey.  I’m not talking about the entire model just the main body (if you took off the wings and the supports to the wings) and just kept the main body – that would be the basic shape of what I saw (metallic colored). As what I saw was wingless. I called my parents over to look at it.   My mother saw it and my father didn’t see it.  I kept trying to point him in the right direction but he had trouble spotting it.  The object remained motionless for 30 seconds.  No lights.  No sounds. Then it immediately shot straight up at an extreme rate of speed.  This happened in 1975, and to this day, I have never seen a craft accelerate so fast.  If I had to describe the acceleration I saw in one word – it would have to be insane.  In about 1 second it was completely out of sight. Unfortunately it did not go up through a cloud but straight up between clouds where there was blue sky.  So it didn’t puncture any clouds. I asked my father to get his binoculars in case it came back so he went inside the house.  My mother went in to call the Black Hawk State Police head quarters in Rock Island (about a mile or so from our home).  State Police told my mother that they had received calls about an object and were looking into it.  The three of us spent several additional minutes watching the sky but the object did not return.  We checked the local papers the next day and saw nothing reported. The two things that still stick in my mind most was the shape and the unreal acceleration when it took off.  Even in 2016, I have not seen any craft accelerate that fast to date.  The acceleration is what made me realize even more so than a wingless craft, that what I had seen was extraordinary. I recently found the note that I wrote as a 8 yr old immediately after the sighting detailing what I had seen.  I have been looking for this for several years before I was going to contact you with this report.  Will send that hand written note (I even signed it as a 8 yr old) immediately following the 1975 sighting attached to this report along with a photo taken in 2016 from the position in the yard where I saw the object, a map of the yard,  and a drawing of the object.  In the 2016 photo, I circled the section of the sky where the object had been in 1975.  The tree in the photo was not that high in 1975 so our view was not obstructed.  We had a clear view. I looked online to see if there were any other reports from my area at the time and all I could find was a Princeton, Illinois, June 14, 1973, by three girls traveling who saw an object and reported to State Police District 7 in Rock Island Illinois (That’s what locals call Black Hawk State Police – Their head quarters at the time was in Black Hawk State Park in Rock Island).

On August 10, 2003, a Sunday, my husband and I were traveling back from Cape Cod, Mass. to our home in New York.  As usual, we were stuck in traffic on Route 6, and it was bumper-to-bumper, but this was more traffic than usual and we were stuck from the bridge back to the Hyannis area, which is some 5-6 miles away from the bridge that takes you off Cape Cod.   As we were sitting in traffic, all of a sudden, from the north and moving south, my husband and I saw a huge, somewhat triangular/almost oval, silver object moving at a slow pace over the highway.  Everyone who was stuck in traffic at that location and on that date would have seen it too.  There were no wings, no jets, no propellers, and no obvious means of propulsion.  It was moving at a steady pace, and my husband and I both saw it.  We have been talking about this for years but I did not know there was a place to report it.  This morning I checked my journals to find the exact date and found it in one of my journals, with a date of August 10, 2003, a Sunday, which is consistent with the day we travel back home -- a Sunday.   My husband and I are both educated and I'm an attorney.  I'm also a writer, and consider myself to be an accurate reporter.  This is what I wrote in my journal, in addition to what I wrote here.  I said:  ""Oh my God, look at that.""  My husband saw it, too, and we were both incredulous.  We both said that no one would believe us.  We made sure that each of us had seen it, and we confirmed that each of us had indeed seen it.  There were no windows to be seen and no occupants to be seen.  It was a huge, silver object moving at a slow pace over the highway and not more than several hundred feet above us and slightly in front of us -- not directly overhead.  My husband first thought it might be some kind of weather balloon but he realized that that was impossible because it looked nothing like a balloon.   We have talked about this for years, but have not known where to report this.  When I found this site last night, I wanted to lo! ok for my journals to find the exact date that we saw this.  I found my journal and my entry for this date, and, indeed, I had written about this incident in my journal, describing the moving object, where it was, what it looked like, and how my husband and I were hoping we hadn't seen what we had just seen.   The event took approximately 20 seconds.  I wish I had had my camera out, but I didn't, and wasn't able to get it in time.  This was in the morning, it was a sunny day, the sky was clear, and it was visible in clear daylight around 11:00 a.m..

He was in the driver's seat and I was in the passenger seat.  It was late and windy.   The rig had a wind skirt on to protect the rig floor guys from the wind.  Our truck was backed up to the catwalk looking south.  I was turned around in my seat on the passenger side, digging in the cooler, when my coworker says, ""What the hell is that?""  I recall caring more about the tone of his voice more than the words.   When I turned around, there was a long cigar/cylindrical/worm-like light that was seemed almost translucent.  It was very bright.   As is SOP on right locations you are suppose to wear PPE at all times.  I recall my co-worker shaking and just staring out of the front window.  I wasn't sure what I was seeing.  I wear glasses and had safety glasses on and there was the front window of the truck.  I opened the door got out of the truck, and now there was only glasses and safety glasses and the object was still there moving slowly towards us and to my left..  I removed the safety glasses and the object was still there.. and I even removed my glasses and it was still there.. I recall being totally amazed not by the object itself, but because of its behavior.  It was silent.  It didn't fly nor glide but almost swam through the air.   As it got closer, it passed over a stand of trees to the left of the vehicle, and at that point, it passed us and continued off.   The creepiest part of the whole ordeal was the light.  It did not cast shadows through the trees, it didn't illuminate the ground.  My coworker looked at me and said not to say ((deleted--anything) about this ever; if his wife ever found out, he would have to quit his job.   I've seen several things over the years, e.g. lights in the sky in Alaska and in Washington..  But nothing like this.   I still get goosebumps just thinking about it.",2016-08-25T00:00:00,,

The object moved extremely fast from one end of the valley to the other within 60 seconds, and based on trajectory, would have touched down somewhere between Kingman and Valle Vista.  We heard NO noises.  Wild guess at the size, HUGE at least 1 football field in length.  Shape could have been cigar or saucer...long and linear.   We continued to watch as a bunch of airplanes started to circulate along the trajectory and probable crash site. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris? Probably the re-entry of a Chinese booster.

I got my kids, 19, 18 & 11 and they all described the same thing. I noticed they were closer than stars, which we could see and were much farther away and looked normal.  We live in town so it’s hard to see stars because of all of the streetlights. All four of us could see the exact shape and colors and they were all identical.  They resembled a star (white), with four lines coming out under them in a shape similar to a penciled hangman.  Two lines went out to the sides (perfectly parallel) and two angled downwards like an upside-down V. There are at least twenty of them and they were all across the sky, in all directions. A few of them flickered, one went out and then came back a few minutes later, a couple seemed to move a little bit but not much, but most never moved and we stayed out there an entire hour.  We gave up watching after that hour but they were still there. There were a couple of planes that flew over while we were out there, so we knew these were not planes.  There would never be that many planes where we live.  We thought about Chinese lanterns since it is so close to the 4th, but most of them never moved.  We thought about satellites, but why so many?  And they seemed really close. They seemed to be just over our town.  I thought about drones, as I have seen a couple but why at night and so many?

UFO report of sighting 8-11-16.   The purpose of this report is to identify objects that I have seen through my telescope, and not to claim a sighting of extraterrestrial aircraft. On August 11, 2016, at 8:10 pm I observed a bright spot in the sky with my naked eye that was obviously not a star as the stars were not visible this early in the evening.  After a few minutes I realized what I was seeing was not something I have seen before so I shot a picture and a short video with my cell phone and got my wife to come outside to have a look also. Using a 7x35 binocular I was able to resolve the object into a disc shape but no other detail was visible.  I set up my C-8 Celestron telescope to have a better look.  The object resolved into an orange color object that was oval shape, had a flashing light on top, was rimmed with what appeared to be many lights around the circumference of the bottom side that were dimmer than the light on top, and seemed translucent like a fabric. After a few minutes of observing, I attached a video camera to the telescope and recorded a few minutes of video in two recordings.  After bumping my telescope I was not able to find the object again as it was getting farther away and dimmer during the observation. The video capture settings, frame rate at .844 per sec. is to slow to stop movement so there is some motion blur in the images but enough detail to see structure of the object.  The orange color had faded to whitish purple by the time I got the video recording.  I do not see the lights that were around the bottom of the object in the video image that I saw through the eyepiece of the telescope. The sighting lasted from 8:10 pm to 8:53 pm about 43 minutes until I lost sight of it.  The direction of travel was southeast, and the object got smaller by about half and was viewed by me and my wife, before I went to video capture. My telescope was hastily set up and there were no stars to polar align the mount so the tracking is off a little with respect to the stars.  The tracking motor is running at sidereal rate and I used the manual slow motion controls to center the object when it ran out of the field of view.  I have been using this telescope for 18 years and this camera for only a few times.  I am experienced with deep sky astrophotography with several camera types and several telescope types for 17 years. Technical information:  Telescope, Celestron C-8 telescope, 200mm mirror f/10 with f/3.3 focal reducer.  Calculated focal length 686 mm.

Lights/orbs seen crossing the sky with no noise.,Herron Island,WA,2016-07-09T22:15:00,light,30-35 minutes,"Occurred : 7/9/2016 22:15  (Entered as : 07/09/2016 22:15) Reported: 8/24/2016 7:51:06 PM 19:51 Posted: 8/25/2016 Location: Herron Island, WA Shape: Light Duration:30-35 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/129/S129480.html,"Lights/Orbs seen crossing the sky with no noise. This event happened on the night of July 9, 2016, at approximately 10:15pm.  At the end of a week-long camping trip, myself and a friend and his son were staying with friends at their cabin on an island in Case Inlet in Puget Sound, just north of Olympia, Washington.  My friends’ cabin is on the south-west side of the island.  The day had been mostly overcast and breezy, but the clouds had been clearing off in the evening and the breeze had died down.   All five of us were enjoying the evening conversations on the lower deck, standing around a campfire we had built in the pit.  I started to walk up the path towards the upper deck and the cabin when I noticed an orange light/orb rising up through the trees, towards the center of the island.  It really surprised me because the light was very bright and very orange/red and seemed out of place.   I turned back to the other four people and asked “what is that?” as I pointed to the sky.  They we perplexed as well.  The light looked like an orange or red LED light.  It was very intense.  I thought it looked like fire, but with no flickering.  We thought that maybe it’s a firework floating under a parachute, since the day was just past the fourth of July.  But the light continued to rise and come towards us from east to west and slowly arched towards the north.  The breeze that was blowing around 5 to 10 mph, was blowing towards the east, so the light was traveling against the breeze.   As the light arched to the north and was almost above us, it suddenly blinked out.  I mentioned to the others that it made absolutely no noise.  I would estimate the light/orb to be approximately 800-1000 feet high. Just as the light “blinked out,” another light appeared from the same area as the first and began to come towards us.  It took almost the same path in the sky as the first, but came further to the west.  Again, no noise and it arched towards the north and disappeared above us.  This time I noted the light was higher, but still below the clouds.   We again began conversing as to what this could be.  Someone mentioned a drone.  But no noise and why would its lights turn off above us?  Someone else asked if it could be military flares.  But no variation in the light and no smoke visible or no parachute.  Maybe a paper lantern?  Again, no variation in the light like a flame would make.  And why were they moving against the wind direction?  Again, just as that light disappeared, another rose through the trees, followed immediately by a fourth light.  At this time my friends wife and I began walking through the yard and around to the front of the cabin and on the road to get a better view.  My other three friends remained in the back yard.  Both lights traveled the same but slightly wider arch across the sky, moving about the same speed as a small airplane would move.  Both of those lights disappeared behind some trees that were blocking our view now.  A fifth light appeared from a slightly different place (or maybe us changing our location made it seem as so).  As this fifth light moved across the sky I heard the sound of a small airplane approaching.  I turned to the south and saw the plane flying towards the light.  I could tell it was an airplane.  The sound and the navigation lights, definitely an airplane.  The plane flew what looked like beside the light, but I noticed the light was a little lower than th! e plane.  I lost track of the airplane, but the light was straight above us and it had stopped in the sky.  This time I took a very good look at the light.  It looked like fire, but with absolutely no flickering of the light.  It had the intensity of LED lights, both red and orange like in a small cluster.  I noticed stars above it, because the sky was clearing.  As the light was stopped straight above us, it also blinked off.  I looked at my friends wife and she looked at me and we both asked each other “what are we looking at?” and “what is this?”  I told her I was going to my car and getting my dsl camera.  I also grabbed a very powerful flashlight.  I remembered all of our cell phones were inside the cabin being charged. Another light rose through the trees as I returned with my camera.  I tried to take a photo, but the camera only flipped up the flash and wouldn’t take the picture.  Too dark.  I took out my flashlight and turned it on and shown it directly at the light which was now moving directly above us.  The orange orb stopped in the sky when I did this.  I was flashing my flashlight on and off.  My friends wife looked at me and said “what are you doing?” In my mind I suddenly realized that I might not want to signal this thing.  I turned the flashlight off and the orb again moved across the sky.  As it got to our north, it also blinked out.  I guess I was trying to see if there was a balloon or parachute holding up these lights.  I saw none. After these six lights, there was no more.  We waited for another 5 minutes and saw nothing.  It was getting cold outside, so we decided to go in for the night.  My friend (the owner of the cabin) went down to the lower deck and made sure the fire was out.  When he returned to the cabin, he said there was one more orange orb that appeared.  The whole evenings events lasted approximately 30-35 minutes. The next day we discussed the occurrence from the night before.  Two of my friends seemed to laugh it off.  The other three of us were still perplexed.  I have never seen anything like this before and I cannot get it out of my head.  I checked on the internet and ran across the UFO reporting website.  While scanning through the sightings database, I came across a report from the town of Enumclaw, Washington 5 nights prior to our sighting.  The similarities sent chills down my spine.

I woke up laying on my back with my arms spred  out to my sides .  I was in a huge field full of tall weeds . There was no trail to where I was .  My feet were clean along with the rest of me .  Than I started to walk back .  As I got up to the road I looked back to see a definite trail where I had walked only one.  By the time I just got up to the road I was covered in burles and weeds (so I have no idea about how any of it happened but especially how I could have got to the middle of the field and be totally clean) by the time I walked back to my car a few hours later my feet were destroyed.  I have NEVER SLEPT WALKED BEFORE and even if I did for some insane reason there's NO WAY I could have made it there without being cove! red in weeds and had bloody feet .  This has bothered me so much lately I have no memory of anything but when I think about it my heart starts racing like ALOT so I have to sit down and recompose ... This is the strangest thing to ever happen to me.   When I got back to my car all my things were locked inside including my keys my shoes and socks were there as well even tho when I went to sleep they were on my feet ...  If u have any idea what I should do about this PLEASE HELP ME  I have lost a lot of sleep over this I'm scared to fall asleep now and I'm a 29 year old man ..

It was moving slower than any aircraft that I've seen, and was heading southeast in what appeared to be a downward motion.  It then disappeared into the forest. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.

The ball shaped object looked to be similar to a burning sparkler like the type kids light on the 4th of July.  The object was flying approximately 50-100 feet above ground and navigating between larger objects in the area.  At first glance it looked like a meteorite with the trail of sparks but it was too low and seemed to navigate around large standing trees, power lines, and two story homes.  I've seen other strange things around this area, but nothing quite like this.  I went to take a closer look to see if maybe it were a crashing plane or meteorite but there was nothing where it should have landed.  I first observed it through trees and assumed the trail of what I'm going to call sparks were just glare, but when it came into the clearing I saw that it was not.  There also seemed to be a dark residue in the sky in the objects flight path, but not smoke. No sound was heard from the object, just a visual observation.  I'm curious if anyone else has seen this object.  I've seen other lights that would hover and make figure 8 patterns in the air, which I tracked for miles while driving home where it settled over an old building and put on a show for 20-30 minutes before disappearing into thin air. This light looked like a police siren that would flash green for a while, then red, then blue, then purple and repeat in no discernible order.  I took a video of this but it somehow got deleted off my phone. When I had looked at this video I saw other strange lights that I didn't see when filming with my phone. This was approximately one year ago. I've seen other very similar lights but just dismiss them now because they are so common. I'm not sure what to make of what I've seen but it keeps getting stranger and stranger as time goes on. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD))",2016-08-02T00:00:00,38.57580181028241,-121.45009956553221

I took out the telescope and when focused, discovered it was moving very slowly.  It took about a minute to move across the lens frame.  I kept moving the telescope to keep it in sight.  It travelled very slowly in a southern path along the pacific coast.  It had to be at a very high orbit to move that slowly.  We watched it until dark, when it disappeared by getting smaller, presumably by gaining altitude.  The lights were not visible to the naked eye, because the object was too high.  The focused image in our small telescope appeared with the distinguished bright lights in an arc along the top, and dim along the bottom.  The image in the center changed form, but generally resembled a T.  The base of the T pointed in different directions, from straight down to about 4 o'clock.

I turned left onto Hwy 234 and just before crossing Dodge Bridge over the Rogue River, I saw a large blue streak of light on a fast downward path.  It appeared like a fireball or meteor, but was not high in the sky to seem to be piercing the atmosphere, but rather a crashing craft.  The blue light streak was wide like a comet tail with what appeared to be pieces of debris in its path. The direction of the downward path was from right to left and appeared like a craft could have been crashing near Table Rock.

A solid object that made no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Photo forwarded by source of report appears to show no sign of anomalous objects overhead.  Rochester Police Department has no record of multiple police vehicles being dispatched to the area of the alleged sighting.  PD)) My daughter and I went out to view the Perseid Meteor Shower late on Thursday, August 11, at a small park in Rochester N.H., and while we were looking overhead toward the South we spotted a small light moving slowly in all directions.  As we watched we realized it wasn’t moving away from us.  After a few minutes we realized it was shaped like a triangle with a bright light toward the front and two dimmer, green-tinted lights in the back.  We also noticed that there were very faint green lines forming the triangle and connecting the three dots.  It was a solid object and the lights never changed distances from one another. The movement did not resemble a helicopter, airplane, satellite, drone or anything we had ever seen fly in the area before.  It made no noise that we could hear and it clearly had nothing to do with the meteor shower. It in no way looked like a shooting star.  Sometimes it moved quickly to the left or right.  Sometimes it moved forward in the direction of the brightest light and then backed away in the direction of the two green lights.  However, it always remained above us with no real pattern of movement. We were in an open field surrounded by trees and it remained above the open area from 11:45 p.m. on Aug. 11, and we left the scene on Aug. 12 at 1:57 a.m. At one point it seemed to not only move toward the spot where we were sitting, but down towards us.  It then quickly backed away again to its original spot in the sky. While it did move some distance, it never left our sight and was almost always directly above our heads. I made phone calls to the Pease Air Force base nearby and asked them to look to see if they saw anything on radar or any other equipment.  However, they said they could only see flight plans and transponders.  The man on the phone said he would look into our sighting further. We also called the Rochester Police Department and they responded with three vehicles.  The officers observed our UFO and somewhat laughed it off, but nicely.  Both the police officers and the man from the Pease Air Force Base wondered if it might be a drone, but I do not know of any drones that are solid, triangular with three lights.  It flew in so many directions for such a long period of time and made no noise of any kind.  In any event, our sighting was documented by an airport and the local police. Through the entire event the object never moved very quickly, but it did change speeds and stop and start again. My daughter noticed that there was a grey coloring in the solid area between the lights.  She also so on the side of the triangle lights, smaller rectangular lights separated almost like windows. This was the first UFO sighting that either of us has ever experienced. We saw no evidence of aliens. All we saw was the object itself. From what the police told me later, they had many calls from other citizens who saw the ufo and one called this national reporting hotline as well. The police also said that Rochester has no drones nor does the New Hampshire State Police.  They also said that the military would have informed them of any surveillance going on in the city.  They had  no military notifications that night. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Here are two of our pictures...Only the bright light in the front of the triangle was visible on the phone camera picture but there it is. We have other pictures but they all look similar. We tried taking video and I'll look at those next as well. Here are the two pictures we managed to get.  ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter,  This is my written report that I put together when I got home the night of Aug. 12.  From what my daughter said you  may not have received it.  The written report that you received, while it was happening, was hers.  She said it was mine because she was embarrassed to put her name on anything.  I'm going to send it in this e-mail with an attached microsoft word document as well.  ((NUFORCE Note:  Witness alludes to report which appears above.  PD)) ((END ADDENDUM #2)) ((ADDENDUM #3 FROM WITNESS)) We first saw it on Aug. 11 at 11:45 p.m. and kept on watching it until almost 2 a.m. on Aug. 12.  If it makes it easier we saw it for more time on Aug. 12.  Hope this helps. ((END ADDENDUM #3)) ((ADDENDUM #4 FROM WITNESS)) I'm really glad to help.  I've never dreamed of seeing anything so weird in my life and I want to know what others think of it.  The thing that strikes me most is that I never heard of a black triangle up to our sighting.  I have since done a lof of research and see they have been around a long long time, before any drones were in the hands of the public.  I truly don't believe that huge triangle was a citizen's drone.  It was something much more.  It was just too big and too quiet.  I saw a video from Concord, NH, with a triangle that was similar to ours, but it was taken in daytime.  There have been so many of these sightings in NH and the East Coast.  Why is that?  Very very interesting and very very strange. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((ADDENDUM #5 FROM WITNESS)) It was much larger than the moon in the sky above us.  To me it seemed as big as a football field, maybe a few football fields, high in the sky and way above the trees.  It flew higher than the small planes.  It dwarfed the small planes that flew around us all night.  As it hovered over us, we got very nervous, even scared, as it moved lower towards us, almost like we feared it was going to fall on us.  My daughter was making strange noises for a short portion of the 2 hours we saw it.  I also remember my heart racing a few times and my hands were trembling like I had too much caffeine?  My voice was trembling when I talked to you on the hotline, and it was hard to catch my breath.  I had a sick feeling in my stomach, but I was so excited to see it at the same time.  She wanted to leave but I wouldn't go.  I couldn't take my eyes off the thing.  I also forgot to mention that at the end it did move out of the area very slowly to the North and out of our view.  The police saw the tail end of it all.  Actually it seemed to move away more directly when the police cars arrived in the parking lot with their headlights and flashlights aimed at the object.

At approximately 15:00 on July 17 2016 we were getting ready to leave Boulder Lake campground in the Mt. Hood National Forest.  We were observing hundreds of insects buzzing overhead and trying to discern what kind they were.  (Mayfly species)   Skies were crystal blue, no clouds.  Occasional airplanes with contrails overhead were observed throughout the day. While looking at the insects flying directly overhead, I noticed a strange object out of the corner of my eye, away from the main group of insects.  Turning to look, I observed what appeared to be an oval or egg shaped object as it quickly dissolved into the blue sky.   Edges of the object were not hard to my eye, but clearly something there.  Maybe a halo.  Object then proceeded to disappear, or fade, very quickly into the blue of they sky.  There was no perceived lateral movement. Direction would have approximately S/SW, but very high due to trees. I took pictures of the insects, but failed to take a picture of the object as it happened so fast.  I stayed for quite a while trying to see if it would reappear.  It did not. There were no jets, or contrails overhead at this time.  This was also away from the main body of insects overhead and appeared to be at a great distance in relation to the tops of the trees overhead and insects. There was no sound.  Total length of observed time was less than 10 seconds. I was the only one who saw it in our group.  I was a little stunned and didn't say anything to anyone at the time, waiting to see if anybody else saw anything.  Nobody did, however I was the only one in the group looking in that direction at the time. I'm an avid outdoors person, and am familiar with most types of aircraft and cloud formations, though not an expert.  It certainly could have been some kind of atmospheric phenomenon that I am unaware of.  It was odd, and not something I've ever observed before.",2016-08-25T00:00:00,,

They were low and fast and caught my attention because I could not discern their marker lights.  I thought to myself that some hotshot private owners were out for a fighter joyride and acting like hooligans. Their flames made them look like fighter jets, but these were not fighter jets.  They were completely silent and I noted aloud as they flew that we should have at least heard their roar by that point in time and at that distance.  The speed they were travelling would have produced more of a scream at that proximity. They approached from the East in a staggered flight pattern and proceeded South perpendicular from my perspective, single file.  By their appearance at profile, they did seem to each have a craft in front of the fiery ball, but it was nearly invisible.  Truly the size of a fighter jet. Absolutely silent. I was chided by my wife, my witness, for being overzealous in my intrigue. 7/1   My wife and I were out stargazing when a single orange fireball made its way into view above the tree line.  I pointed it out immediately and we both discussed its features and lack of markers again, as it approached.  At this time we noticed a smaller, single propeller airplane at a much higher altitude, moving along the same path of travel. The sound of the plane was obvious, yet there was no sound from the fiery object, again.  We watched as it approached from the East and swept South just like the first 2 we'd seen last Fall.  This time, when the object turned South it became obscured by a small bunch of leaves and immediately disappeared.  The bunch of leaves is that of a dying willow, so they are small, sparse and not continuous.  At the speed and proximity of the object, it should have reappeared from behind the small leaves in a fraction of a second and would not have been completely obscured at any point, yet it never reappeared. My wife repeated that it'd come back about 6 times before she realized it'd just disappeared before us. We were amazed. We are not UFO people and have never had an experience like this before, so we were apprehensive to believe what we'd seen...until Google brought us here.

Sightings during official launches of missiles at Vandenberg AFB 1965 to 1978.,Vandenberg AFB,CA,,cigar,30 minutes (each),"Occurred : 6/1/1968   (Entered as : 1968) Reported: 7/9/2016 9:08:17 AM 09:08 Posted: 7/15/2016 Location: Vandenberg AFB, CA Shape: Cigar Duration:30 minutes (each)",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/128/S128388.html,"Sightings during official launches of missiles at Vandenberg AFB 1965 to 1978. I am now a 73 years old male, who, for over 15 years, worked in the Aerospace industries at Vandenberg AFB, in the early years of missile activity, from 1965 through 1978, Delco & Santa Barbara Research Center, in Goleta, CA. It’s getting to be late in life, for me and I have little to lose any more, so I have decided to discuss my experiences while at Vandenberg, pertaining to UFOs. As an Employee of Convair, MAB5, involved with the Atlas D & F series, launch facilities, with access to Bldg. 7000, I have been included in many conversations where UFOs were discussed.  I have witnessed several incidents, while launching Atlas D missiles from South Vandenberg (Point Arguello), LF04 & LF05. Most of my tenure, at VAFB, was while it was the designated Western Test Range and part of the Strategic Air Command, or,  SAC.  While it was Military, most of the locals received critical launch activity reports from various locations all over Lompoc and Vandenberg Villiage, where most of us worked.  Because of my work with the rehab of the launch facilities after a launch, I knew of the upcoming schedules and was cleared for the Fallback areas during launches, for both Atlas and Thor missiles. On many occasions, I was allowed to view the launches using the “Big Eye”, a 4400mm telescope, and, later, view the Range Camera data, at Bldg. 7000. The “Big Eye” was used to receive immediate sight data to verify the flight profile for each missile launch.  During the Thor launches, it was imperative that the BlueStreak (much smaller missile used for gathering exhaust gases data for analysis by Douglas Aircraft to improve the main engines).  While viewing some of the launch films, it was quite common to see UFO activity paralleling the flight.  Given that for many of these years, the Thor was considered the fastest ICBM that we had, on launch. The BlueStreak was a small, extremely fast, single stage missile used strictly for gathering various data about the missile flight.  It was fired T+10, into the exhaust trail, in the case of the Thor, to within 1,000 yards of the missile.  On many occurrences, UFOs were seen to “catch” the BlueStreak, track with it, then speed up and “catch” the Thor missile, tracking it for a brief time, then speed away at a terrific speed. One thing about the launch radar units of the day:  These radar units were capable of tracking at speeds of up to 10,500 m/h.  In fact, they were used to find and identify the, at that time, Top Secret flights of the SR-71, when notified of it passing through the Hawaiian Air Space, insuring that it stayed in the flight lane it was authorized for, and it flew at a reasonable speed of 3,500 mph plus.  I mention the radar capability to address the flight of the UFOs….the radar couldn’t track beyond the max speed.  The increase in speed was immediate and it was extraordinarily fast, outrunning both missiles. At the time, the launch films were classified as Secret.  If they still exist, they would likely be held wherever SAC stored such data, after turning the base over to NASA.  All of the film data is analog, not digital. A comment on the film, “Out of the Blue”, where it describes an incident at VAFB where a UFO supposedly shot lasers at, and disrupted, what appeared to be a Titan Delta flight;  I was at VAFB at the time of the first Titan augmented flights and no such incident happened that I was aware of. During my time at VAFB, I was a Mechanical Designer for Convair Division of General Dynamics.  I also worked for Regional Communications, GTE and General Electric on various contracts to SAC.  While at Delco and Santa Barbara Research Center (Division of Hughes), I worked on the design teams for the F16 Highspeed Fire Controller and, for SBRC, the Thermal Camera enclosure for LANDSAT IV.

Looking on the ground, I saw what appeared to be a piece of cellophane-like, metallic, plastic-ish, if you will, but it had a shine to it,   of course I picked this object up and as I started playing with this object I crumpled it in my hand, and it straighten itself back out, it was also cool to the touch, I can always remember how cool it was.  I kept this piece of material and I kept playing with it in my hand because I was fascinated at the fact that it kept going back into its original shape which was more or less flat with a small curve to it and I had continually played with this for 3 to 5 hours and I kept on playing with this  shiny somewhat metallic plastic and watching it I was fascinated This is where the story gets even stranger.   As I hiked back in to Vegas an unmarked Cruiser stop me and asked me what I was doing that time of night and I replied I was just walking home they then asked if I wanted a ride of course after hiking all day I said I would love a ride thank you very much not realizing what was about to happen this is when it takes an extreme left the next thing I know I'm being driven to the Clark County Jail I've committed no crime I've done nothing I'm arguing asking why I'm going there... they told me that I broke into a car, I did not break into a car!  I am not a criminal!  I would never break into anyone's car!  as I was being processed, they then told me that I assaulted a female officer.  When there was a male officer in the car, not a female officer.  When I was brought to  the Clark County Jail, I was driven there, I did not have cuffs on.. I was brought into processing and told that I had assaulted a female officer and broke into a car!!  It gets better!  I don't do drugs!  They said that they found syringes in my jacket!! well you know I've never done anything of that form!!  EVER!!  I knew that this was  about the material I found.  Now here I am from the state of Maine, visiting a friend in Vegas who went on a day hike, found this material and ended up in jail well there's still even more to the story they knew my name... they had me listed as John Doe for 3 weeks.  My friends in Vegas were looking for me!  My family in the state of Maine going nuts trying to find me! No one knew where I was!  My father was about to get on a plane and come looking for me physically because I had literally just disappeared.  Well then one night while I was sitting on my bunk in the jailhouse as John Doe, I got tackled by  guards I was forced to the ground and they pumped me full of Thorazine everyday I gotta ask what I had found i! n the desert!  And I told him I had found nothing!  After being listed as John Doe for I believe was 5 weeks pumped full of these drugs told that I broke into a car told me that I asaulted an officer...a female!  Which I never did!  My court day date came, they told me they had a deal for me.  To this day I still don't understand, they told me to plead guilty to the charges, they would buy me a plane ticket send me back to Maine, and I was never to go back to Las Vegas I was basically told never to go back.  Well, I took the deal I pled guilty they brought me the plane ticket and I flew back home to Maine on Clark County's Dime... whoevers dime but I was flown back to Maine on someone's expense not of mine nor my family nor my friends I've only told this story to about three people because I believe whatever I found that day was something I was not meant to find it wasn't supposed to find but this story is 100% true so help me God it was definitely a life-changing experience all from finding this little piece of material in the middle of the Nevada desert on a day hike it turned my life upside down.

Some points it would do a lazy sideways figure eight and it would begin to quickly fly one direction then would quickly ""change its mind"" and zoom back to its beginning spot.

I'll start by saying I've spent on average 2 hours a night out side looking at the sky and just in the past two nights 7/2/16 and tonight 7/4/16 @ 12-1:45am I saw 3 separate crafrs. Starting with last night.looking toward a mountain range I enjoy looking at where I have seen weird things so I regularly look in the direction to see if I can get any luck on top of this range is a fairly dim  red light(due to distance) that goes on and off as a plane warning to let a plane know there is a huge mountain right there well.  I'll get to the point I was looking that way and I see what I thought was the red light at first but it was alot brighter and bigger didn't think much of it I thought maybe it was just a clearer night well I look about a mile to the left and  sure enough the one I see is! there still dim and remember I look at these mountains every single night and have never seen this light so I look back at the other object and it's blinking but getting brighter then dim then completely fade away for 10-30 seconds at a time then it would reappear in another spot although still close to the first spot and blink then it would even stay lit for 10-30 seconds I called my roommate outside he is not a ufo believer but he knows I have no reason to play games or lie about something like this . And he sees the plane warning light and says that's just a tower to warn planes in case it's dark I said not that. And I pointed and he was in complete disbelief he couldn't even imagine what could hover, blink turn off get brighter and dimmer and even move spots we walked about a 1/4 miles  down the road from our home to get a better look we stayed looking for 30 minutes when all of a sudden. A very bright light seemed to be following us getting brighter to the point we co! uldn't even look the the direction anymore it was blinding we ! got frea ked out and ran all the way home. And we finally looked back and everything was gone and did not come back . Earlier my roommate and I went for a walk to a  bridge close to home where it's super dark at night and I told him I bet we see something he said no way. About 15 minutes of looking we see a ball of what looks to be glowing smoke hovering very low to earth it looked to be far away but close to the ground as it floated along it literally passed my neighbors house it was so much closer than we thought and it went in front of the house passed the house and kept going we attempted to fallow it but it picked up speed and was to quick for us to fallow we watched for a few minutes untill it disappeared though it never change shape never got bigger or  smaller and never got lighter or darker so it couldn't have been actual smoke this was tonight well we finally went inside to watch some TV and wash clothes as I got done hand washing my work clothes due to delicate material th! at will get ruined if put in a machine .I went outside to ring the items out when I noticed two very distant stars that looked super close together so I took out my phone and used the app space junk to identify the stars as I was doing it . I see a flash what seems to the down the road and I look up this object was also very very low to the ground maybe only a few hundred feet it was a green orb biggest I've ever seen. I fallowed it from where I saw the flash and fallowed it as it flew right over my head at a very very high rate of speed and continued looking at the object untill it faded into the night sky this was one single orb I got a good look at it considering the whole event took 10 seconds or less . I want to say I have much better things to do with my time than write this and make things up this is not a hoax I don't need any attention I am just sharing my experience. Call me lucky or cursed  but lately I have seen many unexplained phenomenon in the sky I live in a! mountain area with no light I've tried over and over to take ! pictures with my phone with no luck I am going to invest in a very nice camera I know I'll see more soon . I'd really like to know why I'm seeing so many ufo if they are aliens do they want me to see them its overwhelming so many shapes sizes colors orbs blinking blood crafts it goes on . If anyone can contact me with similar experiences I'd love to chat this isn't a joke this isn't a prank or a hoax I am saying this because last time I saw something very strange . It said possible hoax I honestly felt offended made me not want to post but I'll give it another chance. Thanks",2016-07-08T00:00:00,35.661082683982684,-105.95390714285715

At first I thought it was a plane but it was moving randomly in the same region of the sky.  It alternated between white, red, and maybe blueish lights.  I next thought it was a law enforcement helicopter doing IR sweeps but the movements were too eratic and always in the same area of the sky.  From my perspective it moved easily an 1""-1.5"" in any direction at any given time.",2016-07-08T00:00:00,41.0908,-81.1844

My wife and I were driving North from Kona towards Waimea.  We were at close to Waikaloa when we saw the light.  A bright green light, like a giant traffic light, lit up for 2 seconds, and illuminated the mountain for probably five miles.  It then happened again 20 seconds later, but not again after that.  We were sober.  I am in construction and am very familiar with commercial and industrial tools and equipment, and I cant imagine anything making that much light, that color, besides an electrical transformer exploding.  But the was not an explosion.  There were no signs of smoke, air craft, trails, just the light flashes.  We were probably 40-50 miles from the mountain range on a night with good visibility.  Every car on the road in front of us must have seen it too.  It is also worth mentioning that the area on top of the mountain, doesn't have any military activity and is mostly pasture land, with no industry, that I know of.",2016-07-08T00:00:00,,

I ran in the house and yelled for my family to run outside and see it.  About 15-20 seconds went by before we got outside, my dad was first to get outside and was looking directly upwards in the middle of the night sky.  As I was about to tell him to go further in the yard to look to the south, I looked up and witnessed a large black triangle-shaped object directly over our house moving in a north-east direction.  My aunt lived about 500 yards to our north and was hanging clothes and also saw the object.  The UFO was very silent with some sort of white gases and some kind of faded starred lights in the middle of it that seemed to move with the object.  I remember thinking to myself that how could such a large object make no noise.  It went dir! ectly over the local phosphate mine (2 miles away) where my uncle worked and we watched it for about 30 seconds until it was out of sight over the mine.  Due to the dark sky, it is difficult to judge the altitude of the object, but I believe it was about 2-3 miles high.  My dad said if it was 100 miles high, it would be the size of Florida.  The next day on local radio, my dad said that he heard many people calling and talking about an object they witnessed. I don't know if the fireball and the triangle object were related, but I believe they were.  Presently, my dad is still an auto mechanic, my mom and aunt retired from careers in education, and I will begin my 23rd year as a teacher in August.  That one minute in time changed my life as we were extremely fortunate to be witnesses to something that we still speak of to this day as we are still astonished.",2016-07-15T00:00:00,28.02172891566265,-82.12932289156626

I was terrified to the max! I kept telling myself not to listen to it.. It seemed calm but kept max pressure on me to understand it and listen.. I couldn't stand pressure and the fear and decided to listen even though I thought it was lieing. In my mind I said I would pray and immediately SAW a lighted or glowing entity ( taller and more frighting)( but to me I was glad li was there) to my left in another doorway, they  seemed To battle (lots of energy flashing)  with other entity..(I did not see battle, just felt as though it was) Next thing I remember was a light coming out of my middle section that made a triangle that seemed to bounce off the wall in front of me and somehow it was going in my middle section and ended with light, circling going up into something not far above my head.. I could feel and see circling, serene peace that I have never felt before... That's all I remember..be it a dream or encounter..it was real! I also had another encounter of flying in very small craft.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2016-07-15T00:00:00,30.068837269372693,-94.17593579335794

Noticed 3 large, bright orange crafts while driving home from Sandy, Oregon, on Hwy 26.  I pulled to the side of the highway, along with multiple other vehicles, and got out to get a better look.  2 of the orange crafts seemed to be chasing after the 3rd one and moving at incredibly high rates of speed.  In addition, all 3 crafts were able to change direction--either straight up, straight down, or backwards, all while maintaining the same rate of speed.  At one point, 2 of the crafts seemed to combine into 1 and then back into 2 separate crafts again.  The man in front of me suggested we get back on the road and out of the area--I agreed with him and we left.   Later that evening, the news reported on it as multiple witnesses were calling in.  They chalked it up to 'space debris'??  Space debris wouldn't be able to chase after itself.   Those of us who witnesses this fascinating event know for a fact it was definitely NOT of this world!
