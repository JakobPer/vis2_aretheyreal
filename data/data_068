The actual date I have now forgotten.  We live on the route of a nearby airport and I see and know what planes flying over looks like and we also live very close to an army depot which reported NO activities this particular evening. We were standing facing the open sky and I saw a glowing green flash hurdle to the ground descending from South to North...  It looked as though it hit the ground less than a visible mile from my house.  (Though we didn't witness ground impact).  The green glowing ball had a tail of sparks trailing behind it.  I have no idea the size of the object, but it was way bigger than a falling star and traveled slower than one time.  By the time I saw it, I had enough time to tell my friend to look too and we both witnessed it fall.   We stood outside long after, nervous of what might happen next and trying to explain what we saw.  Suddenly between 5 and 10 white lights appeared in the sky.  We at first thought them to be airplanes (comparably to the size an airplane light leaves in the sky)  However, these lights were doing figure 8's in the sky and would continuously travel towards and away from one another in a star like pattern.  This lasted for at least 20 minutes, and we had no video c! amera to record it. I called everyone I knew in the area, who also went outside and saw the event of the white lights.  About 15 people witnessed it during those 20 minutes.  I posted that I had seen a UFO of some kind in the area on facebook and got a response from two different people who were traveling a nearby highway who saw the green light also hurdle to the ground.  Both described the sighting exactly how I saw it without my going into detail first. No one ever mentioned the happening again.  I checked the newspaper the next day to see if anything had been said or reported or if their was an explanation and we couldn't find anything.

I live in a very small town of 1,500 people and tonight I was on my driveway looking up at the stars with a friend of mine looking for Orion (but its not summer), and she wanted to download an app on her phone called the Google Star Map. I was looking at something similar to Orion’s belt towards the West, when I saw a “Shooting Star” shoot towards it.  Immediately after that occurred, she said her phone wasn’t downloading right. I didn’t think much of that, so we started walking towards her car to charge her phone. There was a problem though, everything was dead silent. Usually you can hear my dog barking, but nothing, dead silent. So then, I look back in the direction of the “Shooting Star”, when I see an EXTREMELY bright light coming towards us. It was heading East. I asked my friend if that was a satellite, (but I’ve seen satellites before, and it was moving way to fast to be one) she said no, its too bright. As it moved closer, it got brighter and brighte! r from a light blue to a violet haze at its peak, just to the north of us.  At the UFO’s peak it took a dramatic turn heading Northeast. The entire time it was “wobbling” from side to side. She yelled for me to go get my sister and simultaneously, the craft started to get dimmer. So I ran to the house, and got her out there and she spotted it too. Then, it vanished. This thing was moving at a phenomenal speed. From one part of the sky to the other, it took around 30 seconds tops for the UFO to go to from one horizon the other.. There were planes in the sky at the time, so we indicated it wasn’t a plane, due to the fact it didn’t have any red or green lights illuminating from it. Also it was moving way to fast. After it exited our sight, everything went back to “normal”, the dogs were barking and her phone was working too. If I had to estimate the height, I would say around 20,000 feet, and if it was at that height, it had to been huge. And, if it was a supersonic jet, you w! ould of heard the sonic booms because I’ve seen the space shut! tle take off.  I didn’t know what that thing was, other than a UFO. Just earlier today I was watching things all about these kind of events. I just want to get this situation figured out.

It was daylight and approximately 8:10-830 in the morning.  I looked up because the moon being visible in the daylight caught my eye.  Then I looked to the left of the moon and saw a rectangular object hovering overhead.  It was clear enough that I could make out it was rectangular in shape.  It was silent and seemed to be gliding or hovering very slowly.  It was not flat and there was something underneath it more like a square shaped box attached to the rectangular portion.  It was silvery white and very shiny.  It was not very high up but there was a haze and glare that prevented me from seeing clear details.  I said to my friend what is that?  Could it be a plane?  I really couldn't believe what I saw.  She looked up, but as we were both continuing to walk towards my car our view became obstructed by trees.  I said lets get on the other side of these 2 trees, you have! to see this so I'll know I'm not crazy. It only took us approximately 5 seconds to get past the tall trees. After I cleared the trees it took me a few seconds to find it. It was way higher up and way off in the distance and now looked like a distant shining star.  My friend said where is it.  I tried to point it out to her but within seconds it traveled so fast it became what looked like a distant star to completely vanishing. My friend never got a glimpse of it.

I first saw a shiny teardrop-like object around 5:30 PM while working Friday night.  My co-workers also saw it.  One guy said, ""It's just a hot air balloon.""  I was a bit more suspicious.  We parked the truck and all got out, soon to be astonished.   The object in the distance sat suspended almost completely still aside from its candle light sort of bob (I can best describe it as a shiny, glowing, white candle light...maybe not so much a teardrop).  It begins to appear to fly up and left in a curve.  I tell myself that most planes fly straight.  It moves very slowly.  I begin to notice a small tail behind it.  Then, we notice two more.  We did not see where they came from.  One begins making a slow descent toward the ground or maybe into the horizon.  Very slow.  It begins to stretch vertically across the sky into a long, thin sliver.  It takes about five minutes for the object to completely stretch out and eventually split apart.  At this point, it looks lik! e it has made a slice into the clouds.  By now, the second object began doing the same thing but much less dramatic (possibly further away).  The first object moves ever closer.  The tail is very apparent now.  It is very much shaped like a cone moving across the sky.  We start to make out a body.  When it comes in really close range, I notice another candle light-like object off in the horizon.  The one nearest to us now appears to be splitting between the ""body"" and the ""cone.""  It also appears to be dropping some sort of mist out of the back - very similar to a crop duster releasing pesticides.  I see no propellors.  I can vaguely make out what appears to be wing(s).  There is no sound coming from the object.  It gets near enough to where it flies almost directly over us.  There is still no sound.  At this point, I believe I am seeing an airplane of some sort.  It looks like an airplane, but it is odd.  I want to say it is an airplane, but I have an odd feeling that it i! s not.  It has a strange, round shape in some places.  And I c! an only make out one wing.  I see that it is silver, and the round part may be red.  No lights.  Not that I can tell.  Also, the speed and altitude at which the object is traveling not to mention the misty trail it leaves behind are perplexing to say the least.  We snap a few photos and later find the object in the photo to look quite different from what we believed to have seen.  After flying behind the trees for only a few seconds it seemed to disappear.  The other object off in the horizon is still there.  My co-workers go inside, and I stay outside still in awe.  The one begins to stretch just like the object before.  Again, this object stretches out vertically and splits making a cut / slice in the clouds off in the horizon.  I go inside, do my work for a few minutes, and come back outside.  I see one more that never gets past the shiny, teardrop, candle light stage.  It bobs like a candle light in the distance and moves a little to the left.  It instantly disappears after abou! t 30 seconds.  I have never seen anything like this in my life, but I have found other pictures on the internet of EXACTLY what we saw.

By the time we had walked about a hundred yards it was passing directly overhead.  It was silent.  It was circular shaped with about 7 lights evenly spaced around the perimeter.

There I had a very exceptional situation.  Actually with something who is known under the grey aliens in cases in literature. Before this specially night I did not knewn anything about this theme!   The experience have been at July, 14 th at 1:30 a.m. in my guestroom.  Short time after I went to bed the situation has happend. I wasn´t sleep for sure, the lamp in the room was switched off and it felt a little bit moonlight into the room.  The situation continued between 30 to 60 seconds I guess. I laid on my back, was wake, my eyes were closed and I thought about the time I had been in CA. Suddenly, in that moment I noticed something is wrong in this room.  I had a feeling somebody or more than one person came into the room, but I locked the door before I went to bed.  So I tried opening my eyes and in that moment I heard a very quiet sound like from an engine or something like that. Exacty in that moment I noticed I was unable opening my eyes or moving my body arbitrarily.  So that unknown person or what ever have been now in my guestroom, was able to have an effect on my neural functions, I will say specially on the motor activities. I still tried opening my eyes with all power I got, and however then I was able to open them. I saw somebody standing next to my bed was looking on the middle of my body. Maybe the heigh of that what I saw was about 150 to 170 cm. The figure was analogical like human being. I will say it wasn´t looking usually human being like me and you, it was really very different. It was standing on two legs upright like a human. The head was a great one and I couldn´t see any hairs. I saw into a face resembling a human, but also very different from all what we know. It wasn´t a usual human, but for simpleness I will call it human from now on. So the human had two eyes, but much more greater than our eyes are being and they glow yellow. Where we have got a nose there I saw a longish elevation, who was located from brow area to chin. Downwards it became bigger. On it I saw horizontal subdevisions. The whole face was so much strangeness I only able explaining what I mean exactly in my paintings, specially the new one. The ""nose"" strictly was not a breathing mask or something like that. The head and the face seemed white-blue. I saw the body and head was encased by a transparently blue-white aura or something like that. I only can suppose what this human weared on body. It seemed like a metallic suit like an one-piece. I am not sure if I saw ears. So this human looked at my body with head down. I don´t know exactly how many seconds passed by, but I appreciate between 10 or 20. After that time I wasn´t able opening my eyes continuing although I wanted to and I was weak. So they closed and I was thinking to the housekeeper and also nurse (for the grandmother living next to my door). The housekeeper, Cora, laid in the hall on the floor on a mattress, directly before my guestroom-door. Actually the grandmother was ill and needed Coras´ help again and again in that night, so Cora decided sleeping in hall, because her own room had been on the contrary end of the house. I wanted to cry, but I could not use my voice. So I hoped maybe Cora will remark something, but she did not... In this moment I thought how strange this situation is and I felt so much terrified I can not explain. I really needed all my power to go through this situation at all. Otherwise I noticed the human wasn´t doing anything bad to me, ""only"" was looking on my body and I was still alive. I know this human was still in my guestroom and also I heard the quiet noise. So I tried opening my eyes again and I was able to do it again. In that moment I saw this human changed position about 90 degrees and was not looking anymore to my body, rather was looking to the guestroom-door. It seemed that he had knewn what I was thinking, in particular I thought to Cora, laid exactly before this door. After some seconds I had no power anymore for opening my eyes and had to close them again. After that suddenly I didn´t hear the noise anymore and also I was able to move myself and open my ! eyes again like nothing have been happend before. So as soon as possible I switched on the lamp, wrote on a paper what has been going on and opend the door. I waked up Cora for asking her if she noticed anything, but she did not she said. My condition was the same like before and I was still ok. So I stood up and went into the garden before the house for looking if there is anything. But I can´t see anything strange, went back in the house fast. I coudn´t sleep in that night anymore. At 3 o´clock a.m. my stepbrother Lucho came home from work and I told him what happened. He was listening to me and told me an experience about something he saw two years ago. Actually Lucho was standing before the house, was looking into the sky and saw an UFO. He went into the house to his mother and told that to her. So the both went out again for looking and there was no more to see. So the mother told him he should stopp telling things like that. This he told me in that night. Then we thought about the way this human was coming into the guestroom, but we/I still don´t know. I will repeat: before this night I never have knewn about greys or bedroom visitors or something like that. Till now I attest this is a true event. ((name deleted)) P.S. Sorry for my bad english..",2011-01-31T00:00:00,38.57580181028241,-121.45009956553221

My brother and I were backpacking on our way to Pike’s Peak in Colorado.  The first night we were laying on the ground in sleeping bags looking at the stars.  We were a few miles WSW of Pike’s Peak, at about 11,100 feet.   My brother pointed up at something he saw first but I saw right away too.  It was a thin rectangle of white light pretty much directly overhead.  It grew, in about 1.5 to 2 seconds into a square of white light.  So, to be clear, it looked like a large sliding door that opened into this square white light.   About one second later two round lights came out and stopped.  They came out at the same time, sort of dropping out and then stopping slightly outside of the square opening, exactly in the center of the respective side they came out of.  They were separated by 90°.  That is, each one was centered on a side of the square, outside of the square’s edge by maybe 1/4 of the square’s width, and they were on two adjacent sides so, 90° apart.  After about a! one second hesitation, they took off at exactly the same time and were both going at a high speed instantaneously.  They both made large arcs going below the horizon, maintaining their 90° separation.  The large arc must mean they were very high up, (like outside of the atmosphere?). Otherwise they would have disappeared over the horizons in a relatively straight line. As far as speed, I’ve seen the space shuttle go overhead and it’s just a point of light and takes 45 minutes to pass overhead.  These two lights made their big arc and went below the horizons in about 1.5 seconds or slightly less. At about the same time that they disappeared, the square door slid closed again just in the way it had opened.  Before it opened and after it closed, the stars in that same area were visible (although we’re not 100% sure of that).  The size of the square was maybe the size of my thumbnail at arms length.  The fact that it was obviously high up and that big means it had to be huge.   The [fact] that the stars were visible before and after can only mean one of two things:  1. If a craft, it would have to be miles in size (cuz the “bay door” would certainly be just one part of it) and would have to have some light bending cloaking technology so it would look like nothing was there    2.  It was some kind of doorway without a ship being involved. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-01-31T00:00:00,,

The lights were not beams, they had no apparent source of origin. The lights were not bright discts reflecting in the nearby conddensation but instead appeared to be very far away.

The elevation I can only guess but over 10,000 feet. Then as I watched it, it started to descend in a straight line. It stopped at the top of the mountainous ridgeline.  This whole time it appears as one white light.  Then it began to I don’t know how else to put it, but it began to traverse the ridgeline following it topographically if that makes sense.  I was amazed. I have served in the US Forrest Service as a firefighter and I have seen mountains and ridgelines all up and down California, the only thing I have seen is a D-9 CATAPILLAR that can literally roll up and over a mountain.  And I know this wasn’t that, you can hear a CAT, this thing was silent. So anyway it was on the ridgeline and it was moving closer. I went inside my cabin and woke a camping buddy, I brought him out to the porch and asked him, ‘you see that?’ what is it man? He said, ‘I don’t know’. Then when it stopped on the ridgeline, in a direct straight line from where we were standing I got scared and so did my buddy, when it turned it presented two bright lights like a car. But there were no roads and no cars that I ever seen that could possibly be where this thing was. Then it started to descend the mountain side.  Smooth, slow, and silent.    My Buddy ran inside the cabin and got in bed. I had to see how far it would come so I waited outside and watched it.  Well, it came all the way down to the corner of the block which was around 30 feet from where I was standing. I couldn’t see a shape of a craft because the lights were so bright, then the two main lights split, like the Indian GOD with the many arms lights came out 3 on each side. So from two lights it split into six lights.  That really scared me so I went back into the cabin and I told my buddy, ‘hey bro that ((word deleted)) thing is out there, it’s coming.  So I held the door closed from the inside, like I barred it with my boot and shoulder. Looking out the window I saw it pass but the lights were so bright, when I tried to see the craft as it passed me all I could see was a black void.  Then it floated off into the trees executing a quick right then a left turn and it took off into the sky at a low angle and it was gone.

We all communicated telepethically.  They were friendly.  I knew this not just because they appeared friendly but i could communicate openly with their minds or at least the mind of the one I assume was the leader.  He was the one who communicated with me anyway.  I never did ! remember everything that happened that night.  I do recollect that part of my memory was erased.  I was made aware of this.  As well it was I believe 19 years ago and my memory isnt that great.  I do remember that i had the propulsion system explained to me in some detail.

It was a very foggy spring that year.  They showed me 2 fuel tanks that appeared to be white poly.  They were around 2 and a half gallons.  They told me how far they could go on one of these tanks of water, it was very impressive but i dont remember the distance.  They showed off a little bit with the blue and white vessel.  The maneuvers it did were quite impressive.  I was standing beside my truck while they did figure eights over my head.  I became conscious that I was sitting in the cab of my truck on the edge of my bunk.  ! I dont recall how I got there.  It was around 330.  I dont like to call it an abduction.

As I looked above the mountain, I recall first seeing a Platinum semi sphere the size of the ENTIRE MOUNTAIN, but it rose over an approximate 3 minute Period! At this time the Silent stationary OBJECT WAS AT LEAST 3X's the Size of the Full Moon! Alarmed by my inability to explain what I had already whitnessed; I then woke Jim Y. He and I observed this object for what seemed to be ten to fifteen minutes. The now complete Mercury/Quick-Silver Full Circle could be seen, in TOTAL SILENCE!   What I don't understand is why after speaking to Jim, to wake him: Why he or I spoke nothing about it the next morning?  WHY WE DID NOT WAKE MY BROTHER SLEEPING IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK, to Also view SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SIGHTING!    I know I felt like I had a dream, because it took nearly a year or two after this sighting to RECALL ANYTHING!  I almost felt like I had been given the Out-Patient Valium type of drug called Versedt!   I only RECALLED THIS EVENT WHEN AT OUR CABIN SOME YEAR OR SO LATER!  The first time I made what would be one of 3-4 sightings over a 2-year period.  I was putting out the Campfire about 2:45 in the morning alone.    I. Scofield RESVOIR August 11th or the weekend nearest?   II. Time 02:30-02:45   III. Three witnesses I called for from inside. The cabin is on NORTHSORE DRIVE, just passed Madsen Bay State park off St.HWY 296-13 miles from HWY 6 that runs SW TO Helper and Price, Utah. IV. All three-4 sightings were witnessed by: ((names deleted))...(older Brother to Daren E. But they are half bros. Their Sir names end in ""l"" and Differ by ((names deleted))...my last name after we were married in 1996. V. Description of the Almost Identical sightings:  Azimuth 115 degrees/ but facing due north looking almost 85 degrees in Elevation( I took Meterology & I had just place my RCA Direct tv dish in the first summer of it's release) I have also taken General Astronomy, as well as Dead Reconning/ Cartographical Navigation. Almost every sighting seemed to be on an exact time an Schedule: The observations would begin at 02:30/02:45 and 0:4:50ish with a duration of between 15-1hr...dunno if longer because I randomly would either go out in the middle of the night or early morning to find what looked like three stars, but brighter. They would almost appear straight-up in the North or Northwest direction. These objects would start in a straight-line, evenly spaced at at least 16-19 miles high, because sometimes, I could see the Atmospheric ""Sparkle""""Twinkle"" Effects. This on clear nights. The sighting would progress greatly in movement and bright-flashes. The ""Formation"" would then increase to about nine evenly spaced objects. Each evenly spaced, equal in size luminosity. They would then either rotate 45 Degrees to the left or Right, forming a Osciles Triangle instantaniously, with no perceived time lapse between each munuever. The addition of the six oringinally seemed to just turn on like a Distant white LED. The ojects would then shoot an ""ARGON"" Green LASER between them. Then it would discontinue in about 10-15 Seconds, then the nine would form a straight line Array. Repeat, then Rotate another 45 degrees withouth changing the Over-All location in the sky by more than the total Estimated Six inches in the Sky. But if one applied the change in angles in the Sky observed from the ground at 7,400 feet; One would deduce they were moving up to 6"" @ 19 miles or easily Two hundred miles per second, or other arrays were already in place and then were activated? Either way the speed would be 200 plus miles per non perceived time o! r moment! The other alternative is this ""Array"" that made triangles rt,isoc...Circles and then either a total ""Wink-Out or on one instace I did see on then leave West covering from about 85 degrees to 15 Degrees Behind/Below Horizon in about 3.3 Seconds( I counted one one thousand two one thousand ecetera) [ the array would be literally hundreds of miles in area?]   Other deductions or findings:   A. I believed I was watching Ronald Reagan's ""Star Wars, but since have been apprised that our Technology did NOT HAVE THESE ABILITIES IN THE EARLY 1990's!   B. I had no reason to look up / wake the first time at either location! No sounds or ANYTHING SEEMED MORE THAN SATELITTES THE SECOND TIME. This until I for some reason noticed Stars ""ABove the big dipper straight up moving, this after watching what I dismissed as a Man-made SATELITTES move!   C. I nor, any other of the Five apprx. Witnesses: Ever discussed, mentioned in casuall discussion This What should have been a Life altering experience for everyone!   D. No fear, dialog during sighting...no Drugs or Alcohol involved!   E. I nor anyone has reported this ""Complete"" Experience for ""Any Reason.""   F. I had a 1.5-2mm. Object removed near my left scapula, medial an inferior to C-7-t10 Spine, but not on the backbone...distal and medial to my Left shoulder blade!    This was Removed by ((name deleted)) DERMATOLOGIST FOR OVER 46 Years in about 1993 or prior to 1995!  ((address deleted))  in the ""Cottonwood or Millcreek"" areas!   I have had severe sleeps problems, fibromyalgia, Migraines and Back issues Post incident!   Moreover, I have a difficult time emotional dealing with anything pertaining to the Travis Walton Story!!!   I become terrified, even though I don't believe in abductions or the ""Grays Conspiracy"" garbage!!!  I want to rationalize this was all either the Military or waking Paralyzed Dreams witch I have seen/felt a Presence either Theology related or Extraterrestrial in Nature on five instances I can recall..all but TWO were prior to the removal of the ""Foreign Body"" from my Back!

This happening took place in 1996, in a small town called Cotati, which is located in Sonoma County, California. It is a small, very liberal and Utopian township that is very close to Sonoma State University, the university I graduated from. I had just finished playing a gig what was then called the Inn of the Beginning, and my friend Mark was giving me a ride home.  It was pretty late, at least 1am I'd say; very few cars on the road, no businesses open except a few bars beginning to close down. We got into Mark's Honda Civic and began to head down Main Street, toward the Highway 101 on ramp toward Santa Rosa.  I specifically remember that we were right by the gas station that is across the street from Backdoor Records (for those of you who might be familiar with Cotati).  I remember seeing just one car on the road, and it was pulling out from the gas station and onto the road, about 200 feet in front of us.  It was a big, old American car, something like a Chevy Nova, early 1970s model.  In other words, nothing special about the car, and I did happen to get a very good look at it. I have a fairly visual memory and can usually remember physical details of images I see very well.  Anyway, the relevance of the car is ju! st to show that it was the only car on the road and it didn't look like any kind of government vehicle. Of course, that means nothing right? hahaha   Onward with the story.  Not more than a few seconds later at best guess, everything seemed to just stop.  I saw an orb, perfectly circular in shape. I will now separate each of the details of what I saw, so that nothing gets lost: -  It appeared to be about 12-14 inches wide, or I guess had a circumference of about 20-30 inches or so. It was very similar in color and design to that of a giant soap bubble.  If you have ever messed around with one of those big giant soap bubble toys, you know what I mean.  It even had what looked like the oily pinkish color displays that a soap bubble typically has. [see the top for a picture of what I am thinking] -  Unlike a soap bubble though, this thing did not move in the air like blob, slowly morphing its shape as a result of the shifting wind and heat.  This thing was absolutely solidly round, perfectly round. It did not change shape at all. There did not appear to be anything inside of it, like some kind of motor, or anything else you can imagine. It was basically see through I think, but yet we were not looking through it.  I'll explain that in a minute. Here is what actually took place, once Mark and I saw the bubble. To lay out the basics of the event, it is important to say that Mark and I did not compare notes on what we saw until after we saw it. In other words, we did not say to one another ""are you seeing what I'm seeing?"" We didn't talk to each other until after the entire event was over. And here's how the event took place from my personal perspective, and what I later found out to be essentially the same experience had by Mark:  Just when I started to look at the bubble - or whatever the hell is was - and actually take notice of its characteristics on a more precise level, time seemed to stop. I know it sounds weird, but it was like I lost all sense of time, motion, location, etc. ALL I COULD DO WAS STARE AT THE IMAGE. That said, it was not like I felt as though I was being forced to stare at the image. Instead, it was like I had no desire to do anything but stare at the image, making no judgments or even taking the initiative to think to myself what it might be. As I stared intently at the image, it very slowly and what seemed to be deliberately, began to move up the hood of the car. It moved as straight as an arrow and even kept what appeared to be an exact distance away from the metal of the hood, hovering no more than 2 inches off the metal! At this point, I was still not making any judgments about the object, nor wondering about it or anything. All I did was watch it, very calmly, following its slow movement with my eyes more intently than I remember ever watching anything else in my life. The orb continued to move up the hood of the car, coming closer to the windshield. When it reached the top of the hood, where the windshield meets the metal, it simply changed course and moved up the windshield in exactly the same manner it moved up the hood. That is, it moved right up the middle of the windshield, literally bisecting its width, and still at about 1-2 inches above the glass. It moved at the same speed and trajectory over the glass as it did over the metal. Just as with the rest of the time the orb was in site, I simply watched intently with my eyes. Suddenly, the orb was gone, or at least it had gone up the window, past the view of our eyes. I remember looking out the back window to see if it was going to come down the window in the same way it came up the front window, but it was nowhere in site. Now, here's where it all gets a little freaky.  When I realized that the orb was no longer in site, I looked over at Mark and then to the road.  The car was simply cruising at the minimum speed, at whatever speed it moves when you put it in DRIVE and don't press the accelerator.  Mark's foot was off the pedal even.  There were still no cars on the road, and nothing around us had seemed to change. The car in front of us, the Nova or whatever it was, had gone. So obviously we were cruising long enough for that car to get on the freeway via the ramp that was now about 100 feet in front of us. I looked over at Mark and said something to the effect of, ""Did you see that thing?""   We began to compare notes.  Both of us saw exactly the same thing, moving in exactly the same way. Here's the crazy part:  BOTH OF US LOST TOTAL SENSE OF TIME. NEITHER OF US HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY MINUTES HAD GONE BY WHILE WE WATCHED THIS THING MOVE ALONG THE CAR. We looked at the clock, and we both estimated that at least four or five minutes, maybe as many as 9 minutes had passed.  Point is, we were totally unaware of time, place and movement while that thing was in our sights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Sunday, August 1, 2010 at 12:00 am while traveling West on 264th street, just outside of Brandon, South Dakota (approximately 4.4 miles) the front seat passenger noticed an orange light in the sky to the North.  To fully view the light we continued through the densely wooded area to an opening on top of a hill.   The front seat passenger and rear seat passenger tried to identify it as a star, however, it was visibly much larger than any of the other stars in the sky, including Venus and Jupiter.   Also, it was a different color than either of the planets and due to the size, appeared much closer.  As we rounded the road to the top of the hill, about a mile and a half away from sighting the first light, the rear and front seat passengers turned to face the object, which had now drifted to the Northeast.   Upon relocating the object, and getting above the tree line, they noticed another light to the East.  I, the driver, was also able to see the objects clearly. We were only about a half a mile from McHardy Road, which runs North and South; we decided to turn North onto it to get a better view.  While turning and advancing down the road the sky became more visible as the trees receded below us and about three more orange objects were clearly visible. The two passengers kept their eyes one the objects as we proceeded another half mile North on McHardy before pulling over and stopping the vehicle.  It was then 12:07 and we exited the car to watch the objects.   At this time, we decided to call the NUFORC hotline and report the sighting; also there now appeared to be seven orange orbs in the sky.  During this time, the objects seemed to drift or float toward the Northeast slightly, and nearly one by one they faded out.  It did not appear that they moved beyond our visible sight, just that they were fading and no longer present. It took approximately three minutes for the entire group of lights to completely fade (12:10am). About thirteen minutes passed and the lights failed to return so we decided to get back into the car and head East in the general direction of the lights.  We traveled into Manly, Minnesota, before deciding to call it a night and turn back.  (NOTE: although many of the streetlights in this area were similar in color, what we witnessed were very clearly in the sky and above the horizon, also they were moving)  The next day we phoned the National Weather Service and found that the wind direction was going South at three miles per hour that night, and not to the Northeast, the direction in which the objects were moving.

Several friends of mine living in an area in the general direction of the flash--in the Lakewood Country Club--reported having lost power at the time, several minutes later via facebook. The flash event lasted only a brief second, and neither I nor my companions heard any sort of noise in the seconds following the anomaly. I suspect that the flash was caused by a copper or thallium-containing iron meteorite, which would explain the green color of the flash, the lack of accompanying sound, and EMP which knocked out power.  I am an entering college student with an above-average scientific background.  I wrote this report to provide a coherent, detailed explanation of the event that occurred in anticipation that other reports would be made.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,33.79002328838174,-118.17310534232365

On November 7, 2010 at 4:40 a.m. I was awaken by dogs barking.  It’s been getting pretty cold, so our dogs have been sleeping in our porch or in the house.  I looked out our living room window, which is located at the front of our house facing southeast.  I immediately noticed a very bright and colorful light in the sky.  This colorful light changed colors from red, green and yellow.  It was a clear night and was very visible.  I grabbed a sweater and went outside to get a better look.  This was pretty exciting for me and I wanted to share this with my two daughters(20 & 18 yrs. old).  Both were fast asleep and didn’t wake up.  Still wanting to share this with someone, I began text messaging with my 22 yr. old son.  He works nights and of course was awake and suggested that I video record this sighting.  I recorded it on my blackberry and took a few shots of it.  As I began to process my experience, I actually started googling recent UFO sightings and even ! went on a star magazine website.  On this magazine’s website I found that a star named “Mira” was visible to the unaided eye as a red star.  So I figured this bright and colorful light was this star “Mira”. As the days passed, I curiously began paying more attention to the stars at night.  I’ve since seen this bright colorful light in the sky at least 6 times and so has my husband and 18 yr. old.  Last night(12/1/2010) we brought our dogs inside because of the cold temps.  We were all sleeping, when one of the dogs began barking and running down the hallway towards the front door.  I am a light sleeper and got up quickly to see what was going on.  This was at about 1:40 a.m.  By this time our other dog got up and followed me outside.  My small dog that woke me up, kept barking up towards the sky.  Sure enough the bright colorful light was there again.  I woke up my husband and we both went back outside to see the lights.  We watched for a few minutes, until we couldn’t stand the cold temp.  I am convinced this is not a star. 	Just this evening my husband and I both saw it in the northwestern sky at about 9:30 p.m. and then again in the southeastern sky at about 10:00 p.m.  I’m not an expert, but if I’m not mistaken stars don’t switch locations like that.  Our town has a small airport and an air force base.  But this looks nothing like airplane lights to me.  The couple of times that I’ve seen it, the colors are clearly red/green/yellow and it‘s stationary.  It doesn’t twinkle like a star, but blinks as it changes colors.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,29.59974615384615,-100.81566153846153

I immediately looked to the sky where she was looking, and saw the same thing she had.  Four “star like lights” Traveling East to west. THE SIGHTING I only knew to look to the sky by the look on my wife’s face. When I did, I saw four “star like lights” in a formation that resembled ascending stairs.  The lights kept a generally same formation the entire time I saw them, but each light, for lack of a better term, wobbled independently of each other. I base my certainty of these lights being UFO’s because of; - The speed at which they traveled. Taking less than 3 seconds to leave my line of sight behind my house, when I ran through the yard to continue to watch them travel, they were no longer visible to me. Note* It is an overcast night tonight. I do not know if they became too far to see, or if they changed direction, or other explanation is necessary. Their travel pattern. While their pattern remained “stairs-like,” stacked one atop the other with even spacing from each other, at approximately a 75 degrees pitch, each light seemed to carelessly wobble. Position of Traveling		Top: flight path Objects		Bottom: Horizon  My wife described their movement through the sky as Passeando, which in my understanding of Portuguese could mean walking, meandering, strolling, et cetera. I couldn’t have said it better, they moved at speeds that I could not imagine man-kind of capable of just yet. They made no noise, moved swiftly, yet as my eyes were upon them, it felt as if time slowed. Much like moments I felt as a high school athlete, when I was making a “big play” it almost felt as if I was perfectly focused and everything moved just as fast, but seemed slower.

First off, my apologies for not filling the report out earlier. I had attempted to stay up till the next night to find out if I could see anything that would disprove me. I was unable to do so because of the cloud cover. The pretense to the sighting was that my girlfriend and I wanted to have a cigarette after watching a show about the previous presidents. It was a cold night with hardly any cloud cover whatsoever so we decided to smoke in my truck to avoid the cold wind outside. There were no other aircraft of any kind in the sky. The sighting began as being any other plane or helicopter in the sky so it went unnoticed for at least 3-4 minutes until the light began to almost vibrate and move side to side(very slightly and not seen in video footage for it being the reason I have the footage to begin with). As we sat there watching this light we noticed that it began to get higher and higher in the sky all while dimming out and showing up higher. I ended up going in for the night just after the last video because I had work in a few hours after. To begin, please excuse the language that was being used. It was a long day and I was excited at the situation. The video footage that I have begins with the light off in the distance. The white circle that looks like a kind of disk is from my front windshield. The light however looks as though it blinks different colors but I did not witness that with my eyes. I did notice that when the light had dimmed  it gave off a bit if a red light. The third video shows the light flare up at around 1:51. The footage however is not really that great of quality although I am willing to risk my name to prove the footage has not been tampered with whatsoever. The resolution is 160x200 and I believe 15-20fps(shot on an Iphone 3g with downloaded application). The footage is very similar to the NAPERVILLE, ILLINOIS, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 11, 2010, AT 06:45 HRS sighting. The differences are that there was only one light and it dimmed out completely at some points and then reappeared higher in th! e sky which is very apparent in the video. I also have a photo of the exact viewpoint of where I was at but during the daytime. P.S.:  Under the check all that apply section I left the first one about being contacted by an investigator unchecked because I would like to be contacted only if the evidence supplied deems worthy of an investigation. In which case I hereby give you the permission to have an investigator contact me.  Also I would like to thank Peter Davenport for your consideration and your promptness.

I am wondering if anybody else saw what we saw??   The object was first spotted when a member of the group went outside to smoke a cigarette around 9:00 PM.   He called the rest of the group outside to look at this ""thing"" in the sky.  We stood looking at it for almost an hour and this is what we observed:  The object was round with blue, green, yellow, and red lights that rotated in a circle horizontally while the base stayed put. The object was very still but would eventually move every once in a while.  The colors were very distinct; christmas red, bright blue, ect. If a person would have blurred the image, it would have resembled a fire ball in a way.  When it moved, it APPEARED to be subtle movements from here on earth...although in reality, that craft was extremely high and had to be moving at an incredible rate. It would move waaay back and get very small and far for about ten minutes, then eventually come closer.  Eventually we watched the object slowly disappear into the atmosphere.  In comparison to a plane, the object was substantially higher than a plane would travel.  Not to mention it hovered for about an hour, only moving occasionally.  The object was about the size of a plane flying at max height, although given the fact that the the object was so much higher than a plane would travel, it was clear that it was greatly larger than a plane.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,,

It was flying toward us (west ward) it then zig-zaged then flew straight again, then zig- zagged again. It almost appeared to be a flame fired toy balloon but it was too bright (without much change in brightness) and with the speed and the sudden turns any flame probably would have been extinguished. It made no noise at all and in about 2 minutes it suddenly gained altitude faded to a red dot then vanished. I live under the flight path to LAX and this light flew across the flight path around or just below the altitude the jumbo jets fly. The clouds were moving slowly, there was very little wind and there were no aircraft seen in the area. Using google earth and measuring from the mountain it appeared to fly over it seemed to travel about 5.5 miles in about the 2 minutes we observed it.  I think it could have been what is known as an earthquake light. There were power lines under the center of it's path but it was very high in comparison to the lines.

It was very bright and appeared to have a hair like appendage extending from around its bottom, almost melting in appearance, but this could have been an optical illusion.  I was shocked with what I was seeing.  I screamed out for my wife and daughter to come out of the house and they both saw what I saw.   We watched it for a few more minutes and it drifted in a straight line west and blinked out.  I mean it just blinked out. I have seen military flares before, but this did not have any resemblance to them.   We live close to Nashville Airport and airplanes were flying out in the distance.   After it blinked out, my daughter and I started to get into the car to get her to school.  We were getting into the car and I saw the same type of light shoot up from the horizon, in a straight line, and go to the same exa! ct spot as the previous light and start hovering.   I have never been freaked out by anything, but this incident still haunts me to this day.  Some one could have been shooting off military flares, but flares do not hover or go in a straight line from east to west.   I also heard no report.  It was above the tree line, but I could not tell distance or altitude due to the darkness.  I have been struggling with myself whether to report this or not.  Hope this helps someone who may have seen something similar. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness indicates that the date of the sighting in February 2011 is approximate.

I said to myself, i wish i could see it again to be sure of what i saw and as i was thinking about that and looking at the cloud that the object had went into it poped out again.  I was able to view it for another 3-4 secounds before it went back into the cloud.   I was stunned.   It was so incredieble. It felt like it came back out just for me to view it again.

The oval looked so perfect, and it wasnt standing up, it was turned to the side.

On nights when the sky is clear we see them every night.  I have taken many video's and several people in the area are seeing them on a regular basis as well. My family had our first sighting two years ago and we noticed one or two of the objects very far up in the sky from time to time since.  The past two months they are coming on a regular basis.  They show up as soon as it is dark and remain until dawn when we actually watch them glide across the sky and leave. We have seen all shapes ans sizes.  There are round balls of different colors.  Some have red, white, green and blue lights while some are one solid color such as orange or white.  There are also triangle shaped objects that have three lights on the bottom and looking up at them from below the lights look like they form a happy face. There are red and white ones that fly above the tree tops and they flash like strobe lights.  These ones also stop in one spot for quite some time and sometimes turn their lights off.  We have also seen one of these objects eject a smaller object out of it as it glided across the sky.  The smaller object went down into the trees. The other night there was a large red light flashing in the trees behind our house. It looked like it was low enough that it might be landed. Many times when the lighted balls were above the tree tops there were many tiny little white lights in the trees below.  The little white lights were still and remained there for hours. It looked like someone had thrown little white christmas lights in the trees. I did contact some investigators and they are visiting my home on and off to keep up on what is happening here. I welcome anyone to come here and see these objects.  This is not a hoax.  I am not very comfortable at all having these things surrounding my home each night. I want them to leave.  I know they are there but i also want to make one point. I am not a bible thumper by no means but i do believe in God.  It does say in the bible that God will allow evil to do as it pleases in the world to try and trick us.  God wants to see who will turn their belief from him to something else and who will remain faithful to him.  I believe these objects are the works of evil and trying to trick us. Just think about how many people believe aliens created us now because of the frequent sightings. I am not asking you to take my word for it.  I am simply asking you to check into what i am saying.  Please don't put all of your faith and belief in these objects.  I know you are seeing them too or you would not be here reading my report right now.

He proceeded to tell me that his brother saw what I saw this morning. (3/12/11). and he can't find him.  He thought he may be over to my house telling me what he saw.  I drove over to my neighbor's house that morning to find out what was going on.  Only thing he knew was his brother was awaken my his dog and he let his dog outside that morning thing that he had to do his business.  His dog ran back back in and got under the bed.  His brother went outside and seen nothing but felt his hair stand up on his neck.   He went back in and came back out and look around and saw it. Interesting enough as he was telling me what his brother was telling me, I explained that my dog at 4:00 - 4:15 started barking wildly as though there was an intruder in the house.   I jumped out of the bed and found nothing.  I didn't go outside at the time.  I went back to bed.   Around 5:00 am, she woke me up  this time I went let her out to do her business.  This time I went out with her and looked around but I didn't see anything.   Later that day, I got a chance to speak to my neighbor's brother and he explained to me what he saw.  HE didn't describe the object only to say it was larger and it was coming from my direction and moving just above the tree tops with no sound.  It was pitch black outside but he was able to make out how larger this object was.  It was large. The size of a cloud and just above the tree top floating with no sound.   He said he froze and watched this object glide and turn the same time as it continued to move just above the tree tops heading west north.  Than it started to shimmer as if it was being bath in water and it disappeared.

My neigbor told me that his brother won't even talk on it and he said that which I do remember him telling me the same and that is if we tell other people and they come and ask him about it he will denied it.   My neighbor also told me that his brother is different ever since he saw this.  I explained to both my neighbor and his brother that what ever is going on in the Pigeon Hills it will be back.

The white light, somewhat elongated, grew larger and brighter and then became dimmer and smaller until it was a very small dull point of light in a short amount of time.  At the moment it reached that stage I saw a similar dull point of light to its left, about the distance apart as two fingers at arms length.  This point of light was also moving very slowly but towards me, not away from me as the other now dim dull light was doing, as I could judge this looking through the branches of the tree.  I quickly went inside to get my camera and was back outside in less than 30 seconds and I could not see anyth! ing left of the two objects. I have an 10"" telescope and have enjoyed studying the night sky for over 16 years.  I keep an open and critical mind about this phenomenon.  I have studied the worldwide phenomenon of Crop Circles for 5 years and have read much of Colin Andrews, Freddy Silva, Nancy Talbot and others and well as the photographs by Steve Alexander.  I mention this only to show my openness to what I think is a tangible form of communication by other intelligences than from this planet.  My conclusions come from the preponderance of data that point to a technology that is able to channel several forms of energy simultaneously to manipulate plants to create extraordinary geometric formations within a timespan of minutes and no more than a couple of hours. These findings lead me to believe there are intelligences visiting us and gently trying to communicate to us through the use of symbols found in the Crop Circles. I have made no assumptions nor conclusions about what I saw. I am just relating what I saw. Lastly, just moments after returning with my camera and not seeing anything left of these dull moving points of lights, a jet airline with its blinking lights made its way towards my direction, following the established corridor for both civilian airlines as well as military jets, planes and helicoptors in this sector of the sky.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,36.0769630261661,-79.81581387940841

When I first noticed them they were spread out evening to form an arch shape.  When I saw them in this formation they looked to be an oblong shape and either metallic/reflective.  They then quickly transitioned into a different formation... more of a comet tail, but now they looked more triangular.   Then then moved to a random pattern and sort of individual disappeared but before they disappeared it almost looked like they were flashing lights except it seemed to be more of a reflective light (like a mirror in the sun)... all within a second or two.  Then I looked over towards the south bound lanes of the interstate and they appeared in the random formation past that side of the highway and then disappeared again.  They literally disappeared in one spot and reappeared in another.

The aircraft resembled a blimp , however , it was totally illunated with an orange glow . The glow wasn't bright like the sun.  However , it was entirely orange ( like a sunset ) and this illumination stayed within the context of it's frame. It had no windows and no jet stream at anytime.

It! first appeared on the right hand side of the road and moved within an instant ( a matter of a second ) to the left hand side and continued to hover at about 10,000 feet about the ground.

I pulled over and observed this craft moving towards the orange skyline and vanish. The first thing I thought was "" Military "". But the more I dwell on it...it could've been something else.

Friday, October 29, 2010 Time: about 7pm Edmonds, WA  Perhaps you have some other reports of this and maybe know what I actually saw, but here is a brief description. I was out walking the dog after supper close to 7pm. When we started the walk around some of the condo clusters at Point Edwards in Edmonds I noticed a reddish light in the westerly direction over the Olympics in about the usual location for an inbound commercial flight. It looked a little odd because of the predominate reddish sort of glow and slightly larger than usual size and lack of apparent movement (which is not uncommon when you see a jet coming in from the west). I thought it was a little odd but figured it was just another airliner and continued the walk. About 5 minutes later when I rounded the easterly corner of the complex and turned back in a westerly and then southwesterly direction I was surprised to see 4-5 “glowing red spherical lights” coming from the south, maybe a mile south of the Edmonds breakwater. I thought they were probably helicopters at first, although unusually lit, as their motion resembled that of helicopters. There were white and red flashing lights in what seemed a spherical shape. The lights appeared less than a mile off the shoreline and maybe at an altitude of about a thousand feet. What really caught my attention was a total lack of noise. The lights seemed to float in a loose formation slowly north and then turned west, slowly gaining altitude. They were about the size of my thumbnail held at arms length when not far off the south end of the Edmonds breakwater. One of the lights that turned west before the others disappeared while I was watching. I went back to my condo for binoculars but the lights were gone when I got back outside. A car with a family in it came by while I was watching the lights and the driver stopped and asked me what the lights were but neither of us had a clue. The evening was clear, the sky dark, and the major stars easily visible.

To give you a little insight, there was an unspoken rule among families that when the kids are out playing, when someone has to go home, one or more of the kids walk the returning child halfway home, usually to a street intersection on the main road or between the home yards. On this particular night, we chose to go from my house up the road to the intersection with her street, thus allowing more time to be out before going home. Just before reaching the street intersection, we were both startled by bright lights scanning the woods to our right. To our immediate left were houses. As we stood and watched, the trees began to sway with leaves blowing around and enough wind to blow our hair and clothes. We continued to stand and watch and were shocked to see what appeared to be a very low flying helicopter with search lights, but it made no noise whatsoever. I have no distinct memory of the helicopter having lights on the body, other than the lights shining down. The helicopter was black or dark grey and hovering just over the tree tops, approximately 20 feet into the woods. The lights from the helicopter were scanning into the woods in a strategic pattern, going from left to right, right to left, as if searching a grid, area by area. We stood there watching for a few more minutes before making a quick agreement to run to our respective homes as fast as possible, inform our parents, and call each other to ensure we both made it home safe. I told my parents who offered the idea that possibly the WV State Police had sent a helicopter to search for an escaped inmate because just outside Beckley is a regional jail and a federal prison. I informed them again that this helicopter made no noise. This statement left us a bit perplexed and we decided that we would check the newspaper in the next few days to see if an inmate had, in fact, escaped and law enforcement was searching for him. In the following days there was no published news of such an event. Another idea that we discussed was that law enforcement or a military unit was doing training flights.  Again, the idea was somewhat dismissed as a silent helicopter was not something known at the time, at least to us.  The closest military installment is an hour away at Yeager Airport in Charleston which houses a division of the National Guard or Reserves.  I'm honestly not sure which.  There are no major military bases in the state. In the area of the woods where the helicopter was flying there is an older cemetery on the mountain, just up an old and steep road a few feet from where we were standing.  Beyond that, there is a portion of the woods that has been cleared to allow for power lines that run down the mountain leading to a small power station, just below Interstate 64/77.   Our location is in an established subdivision and over the mountain, something you can easily walk or take a local road, is a more rural area with homes. I have never witnessed anything similar since, though I do catch myself watching the sky still as an adult.  I am now 28, college educated, and perplexed by this experience.  My parents are both college graduates and they had no reasonable explanation at the time. The girl I was with was a year younger than I was at the time and part of an Army family that had relocated to the area several months before the event.  Her family was stationed here for a few years to staff the local recruiting office.  Her parents had no other logical explanation beyond what my family had devised.

Several witnesses claim to have seen a fireball crash just beyond a small strip of forest located at 43° 4'15.80""N, 85°52'55.99""W, near Coopersville,Mi   Unofficial reports claim the witnesses came in contact with intelligent colorful lights or orbs shortly after the impact.  These orbs seemed to mimic the witnesses’ movements and emit an overwhelming sense of fear or terror into those that got too close. Mechanical sounds, such as the hum from transformer or generator could be heard nearby but never be located.  A spotlight was seen overhead shining down as if searching for something.  The source of light seemed to come from a craft that was invisible to the eye and silent to the ear.  Yet its presence was evident due to the disturbance in the tree tops created by its exhaust or propulsion system. The following day two witnesses returned to further investigate and claimed to encounter the same overwhelming sense of fear but this time they were suddenly surrounded by hundreds of black birds filling the trees all around them.  Their attention was directed into the center of the forest about 20 yards away where the black birds’ seemed to be focused.  There they saw an Un-humanoid figure laying face up, being pecked at by these birds.  The body was described as being small and frail with an over sized head and black almond shaped eyes. Its color seemed to be a cross between peach, gray and purple.  The  witnesses wanted to get closer for a better look, however, the fear became too overwhelming and forced them to retreat far away, back to the house a 1/4 mile away.  They were unable to look back the entire hike back, they felt a presence that seemed to be following them. An hour later the two returned with several friends to the area expecting to, at the least find the remains of a deer or something.  But nothing was there. No deer, no birds, no alien body, nothing, not even the fear.  If you look about one hundred yards east of the forest, in the orchard, you see an impact crater/burn mark still visible.

I had also been in an accident earlier that day so I was nervous of what I saw. About 5 miles north of trout run which is north of Williamsport Pa. on Rt. 414 heading towards Troy Pa. I observed a round fire ball abort the size of a Cessna 182 at 3000 ft above me at traveling at the same speed a 182 would cruse at that altitude. There are several mountain peaks in that area and the altitude was guess taking in consideration the way it came from behind the first peak and the distance I was from that peak. I contacted Pa. stare police about the fire ball because I was concerned that an aircraft was what I say that may have been on fire. I observed this object for several minutes as it crossed from left to right, eventually passing the peaks on the right. It followed the trajectory that a personal aircraft would, yes it seemed odd that a pers! onal aircraft could travel that far without crashing but I needed a reason to call the state police without sounding like a nut (sorry).

Me and a friend were driving home during the early morning hours and bipedal , hairless, pale almost glowing lanky creature/ being of some sort lunged out of the woods at the car as we passed.  We were driving at 20 to 25 mph.  This being screamed for lack of better words at us.   When I fully looked at this creature my heart just stopped.  It did not look anything like a hollywood representation of what an alien might look like.  It was definitely not of this world.   We then sped off as fast as we could and did not look back.

On the warm evening in June of 1999, It was just getting dark, I lived above the Salteese flats, a drained lake bed, that is swampy till late summer.  My car window was down, I noticed on the far side of the lake bed, aprox: 1/4 to 1/2 mile away.  There was a set of very bright lights with smaller green lights behind moving back and forth on what I first thought was the road across the lake bed. I stopped to observe the erratic behavior.  After 20 seconds or so, I realized the object was below the road, and switching directions too quickly for it to be a car.  I wondered maybe a helicopter?, but there was no sound and I know that sound carries well across that marshy land.  I then realized that the object had turned 90 degrees and was then headed straight at my car, still no sound.  I know there is no path in that area for any vehicle to traverse without getting bogged down.  I also realized it was flying too high to be a car on the ground.  I put my car in gear and! decided to move down the road out of the way.  The object arrived on the road on my side of the road and again did a sharp 90 degree turn in my direction, I then became very alarmed so I accelerated my car to the point of unsafe speed.  Keeping my eyes on road and rear view mirror I saw the object was now following me at speeds 55 mph on winding  roads.  All I could see in the rear mirror was now two lights brighter than any halogen lights I've ever seen, blinding me in the mirror.  I was now terrified and kept thinking please god let me get home so I can tell my husband.  I hit the crest of the steep hill still doing 50 mph. At that point I was 90 seconds from my drive way.  But I do not remember pulling into the drive or entering the house, let alone telling my husband what had just occurred.  The next I recalled was getting up the next morning. I had been terrified but did not even recollect the event till over a week later.  No matter what has ever happened, I have always talked to my spouse.  All I wanted was to survive to tell my spouse, yet I did not remember.  Nor am I given to hysteria.

I t was an exceptionally clear evening with a view of the Milky Way stretching across the sky at about 11:00 P.M.-11:30 P.M.  I had just stepped outside onto a small deck of the cabin with a clear view of the lake and ridgeline and was looking towards the town of Grand Marais.  Suddenly, I felt as if someone was standing behind me and I turned around to see what was going on. I saw a large circular shape of concentrated white light, without a halo, larger than a full moon, about five to ten miles away above the ridgeline and not obstructed in any way.  My first thought was that it was a very large meteor but it was stationary without movement. My next thought was that it might be some kind of aircraft but I quickly dismissed that idea.  This initial observation of the object lasted about 8-10 minutes.  Then, within the white ligh! t, at about 2/3rds of the inside diameter, a bright red ring of light developed in a clockwise fashion. This internal red ring was maintained for several more minutes and then vanished.  Next, the overall white circular light contracted to where the red ring had appeared.  Then this object suddenly and at great speed ascended at about an 85 degree angle towards the north without a sound. I watched the ascent of the object to where it was about the size of a small star and watched it travel at high speed some distance and over the horizon, heading north over Canada.  Besides the physical visual experience, what also stood out about the encounter was the very strong sense of presence of the object.  I have never seen anything like this in my life before or since. I have no explanation of it and it was clearly not a natural phenomena. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-01-31T00:00:00,,

We came around a corner to a clearing where I could see out the right backseat passenger window a triangle craft in front of and above a small farmhouse. I could see spotlights emanating from the craft to the ground. The road curves to the right and we are now driving towards the house, which is still on my right. Next thing I remember is looking up/out the back window and seeing the craft above the car. Each of the corners of the craft was full of multiple changing colors of light. The next thing I remember is yelling to turn the car around which we did. My mother in law, wife and I followed and watched the craft leisurely ascend to the clouds at a 30 degree angle. I was the only one who remembers seeing the craft the entire time. My wife and mother in law were in the front seat talking from what I remember and I never made a sound during the event until the time when I yelled to turn the car around. Up until the time I yelled turn the car around it was evening and dark out.  When we were following/watching the craft ascend it was light out felt like 4pm. This is not the only event that has happened in my life.  As a boy I remember seeing a head looking in my window on several occasions. I remember seeing a glowing light following our car when we were driving back from Eugene, OR to North Bend, OR where I grew up.  The light eventually flew towards and over the car.

Because of this, I think I was around my pre-teen age. Anyway, I liked to look at the sky a lot, and these were just one of those days.  Something shiny caught my right eye. I focused my attention on it- it was a smooth silverish metallic object shaped like a dome- not exactly a saucer or disk- but a dome.  It was very far, but it was close enough for me to make out the shape.  I remembered seeing window-like texture on the side of the dome, but now I'm not sure I remember right.  It moved smoothly in a down to up-right curve, and continued to move farther to the right and away until I couldn't see past the window anymore.  I know this is not a false memory because at this time I told myself what I saw and tried to make excuses for what I saw such as perhaps the people were trying out new aircrafts.  Alas, I now know it's not possible. Also, I should note when I was little and around this age, I often heard a strange futuristic sound at night that reminds me of spaceship landing in the movies. This might be irrelevant, but I don't know what can explain that sound. I haven't heard the sound for a long time now- probably because I don't live at my parent's often anymore.

I live outside of town and am very secluded.  The nights are gorgeous since there is no light polution.   I sat outside for about half an hour and was able to track several satelites.  I had just finished tracking my last satelite, watching it disappear above me over my house.  I immediately dropped my eyes back down to the horizon, looking southeast.  There is a large hill in front of where I live and it is covered in small pine.   Suddenly above the treeline appeared what I first thought was a star.  It hadn't been there a minute before.  It shown intensely bright, and I could not figure out what star, at that intense a magnitude, would be coming up in that place at that time.  It was way brighter than anything else in the sky.  I continued to think it was a very! bright star when I suddenly realized it was moving very, very slowly.  Then I got excited and thought perhaps I was looking at the ISS.  I have no idea how high it was, and there was no noise connected to it.   I watched it for about a minute as it traveled about the length of my hand - if I were to extend my arm.  It suddenly stopped, unlike anything I have ever seen.  It hung motionless and grew even more intense in its brightness, and then began to slowly dim until it became just a pin point of light, and disappeared.

Being that I work with aircraft I noticed no red or green lights to distinguish port or starboard side of an aircraft.  I thought to myself it is just a few lights in the distance nothing to worry about. After seeing the lights I continued to drive my motorcycle towards Fallbrook. Up and to my right I spotted what I thought to be a deer.  The deer jumped the fence on the right side of the road and landed between me and the vehicle that was approxametly 20 feet in front of me. After landing in between myself and the vehicle in front of me it sprinted to the left side of the road almost being hit by a vehicle going south east towards Camp Pendleton then disappeared.  The animal that to me seabed to be a 4 legged animal that resembled a deer, but was shorter in the back legs than the front and more of a black color than a deer would be. After the animal or thing ran across road I noticed the lights where no longer on my right but where now on my left side. The closer I got towards the lights it became more obvious in shape to me. The shape best I can describe was oblong like a football, but more elongated.  I counted 5 white lights that where going down the length of the object and 2 more white lights.  One being towards the top of the object an the other towards the bottom of the object both going in slow steady circles around the object and disappearing when going to the other side. Continuing to drive I watched the object on my bike till I could no longer see it without having to turn around on my bike. I then tried looking in my mirrors to try and see the object.  I was not able to spot anything in my mirror so I turned and looked on my bike to see if the object was still there.  Having turned around I noticed the object had vanished. After seeing what I saw I continued to drive through base. After exiting the base I along with the car in front of me an behind me stopped at the red light.

Maybe a phenomenon like the recent one in Lu Shan, China, supposedly created by the city lights, and the atmosphere? So, when I returned to my ground level home, 30 miles north I looked into the clear sky,  I saw the same grids of energy beams and faint pinpoints of light that appeared to move rapidly at certain intersections where the suspended particles met.   The next day, at high noon, I went to an open field nearby, stood in the shade and voila! The sky was perfectly clear and blue, except for the thin veil of grey particles, suspended by waves of energy in a perfect grid pattern,rolling across the sky. Planes preparing to land at Fort Lauderdale airport appeared to be flying above the particle grid, so it could not have been more than a few thousand feet from the ground. These beams were visible to me for 3 nights and! 1 day and a freind who lives 5 miles west.  Last night, they became barely visible and today I see no particles or beams in the daytime sky.

My mother and I were driving East on SR 500, and we stopped at the light on Stapleton Avenue when we noticed several ""planes"" flying in very (very) close proximity to one another, which we both thought was odd. It was dusk, but there was still an inkling of light left in the sky.  I pointed out that they were very bright, and were traveling oddly slow, and I noticed a familiar formation I had seen in some UFO conspiracy videos. rying not to be immediately critical, we both concentrated on them for another moment when all of a sudden, another appeared as if a light had just been turned on in the sky. We were both so shocked by the way it appeared, we were screaming in the car. At the time, it was nearing the end of rush hour, but there was still a good amount of traffic. We looked around to see if anyone else had noticed, when the traffic light turned green. We drove home quickly and brought our friend out to see the lights in the sky. He agreed that, ""there was a lot of air traffic in such a small area of the sky."" We had never seen airplanes fly this closely together, unless they were in a USO show. As most of them very slowly faded south/southwest, one or two of them came almost directly overhead of us, just about one or two miles north. From there we could make out five bright lights on the bottom side of one of them, one in the front, and two sets of two behind that, in an ""A"" or ""V"" shape. We also all noticed it made little or no noise, although it was somewhat blustery that day, so we didn't think it was TOO strange, but just a little. Either way, we were all very shocked by what we saw, and we still can't explain anything we saw that day, besides saying they were definitely NOT airplanes. Also, curious to see if there were any reports, we found a news report from that same day, just hours before in Nixa, Missouri, saying they also saw something strange in the background of a report that had been given.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXlJM9dOE4.  Their explanation at the very end is not convincing though.  We are still baffled.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,45.65808015267176,-122.58490839694656

March 30th 2011.  I go to my car and get my cigarettes.  I light one of them and get up out of my car and turn around.  And there is a Black pyramid/triangle shape floating above the back end of my neighborhood over the Fire Department and in front of a Water Tower...   The best way to describe it would have to be like a perfect symmetrical pyramid and/or triangle.  Like if you cut off the top of the Great Pyramid of Giza... It was all black.  It made absolutely no noise.  It floated parallel with a major road in my town over the back end of neighborhood.  It was incredible…  There were 4 lights... there were 3 that were you know the normal white light on the 3 corners, 1 in each corner.  And in the center there was a red light..... Now the only difference is the first time I saw this same similar object with my friend; the red light wasn't blinking.  On, March, 30th 2011 the RED light was BLINKING...  Not sure if it means anything. (I saw a similar object on a separate occasion with a friend, a few years ago probably 2 but in the same county) I called 911.  I have no idea if they took me serious or actually followed it up.  But, I was in shock just for the fact it was so close to my home. Another example is if you look at the back of a One Dollar bill.  The eye in the pyramid-that is the closest thing I can think of, but the lights were on the bottom of it... but at the same time it was such a Dark Black that you could see the outline of it perfectly... and in my situation I had a humungous water tower as a backdrop and this thing just floated in front of it.. I stand by what I saw. And I also stand by the resume that my short life span holds... 4 years military (Active)... 1 year Iraq, 1 year Korea...  I’m now a Disabled Veteran.  Like I said I've seen many things from airplanes to helicopters to balloons and missiles.... and for the sake of the term UFO this was an Unidentified Flying Object... Whether or not it is Alien or Extra Terrestrial I don’t know.  I know what I saw and I know it was a Black pyramid/triangle floating very slowly over my neighborhood heading towards Route 50 in the state of Maryland.  I will tell anyone what I saw. I would have to estimate the size as pretty decent considering it bloated out a good portion of the water tower when it floated by. I would have to say the incident lasted for approximately 10-15 minutes. This sighting occurred in Easton, Maryland.  On March 30th, 2011 around 1:50 am Est. Like I said I called 911.  I connected to Talbot County dispatch. Thank You",2011-05-02T00:00:00,38.7967,-76.0489

I took digital photos as a third light seemed to come from behind the mountain and join the first two.

With binoculars I could see 3 balls of bluish lights joined by hazy ( light beams?)in a triangle.  I have one photo detailing the approach of the third light.  The craft spun and bobbed around for a moment, flarred brighter and dissapered.  I am one of the only residents on Chinook Pass this winter.  I have been watching these lights on a regular bassis for over a year now. Recently the sightings have followed the sighting of what I believe is a remote controlled craft of mam made origin.  From a distance these unmanned planes sound like a model ""hobby"" plane or chopper. As they get closer the sound changes to that of a large duel prop plane.  I have been located on several occassions in dense forest cover during day and late night outings. on more than one trip both the fast blue lights and the slow moving survalliance craft are in the sky at the same time. I have attemted to take photos of planes and stars to compare to the blue lights.  The stars and marked, lighted planes barely show up but the photo.

It entered my vision from the west.

Suspecting I was mistaken, I slowed my car to a stop on the otherwise empty road, watched it, and established to my surprise it was moving the way I thought it was.

I could only faintly make out a solid object at the base of the teardrop, as if it were leaving a tail behind it. I thought this was strange, since it wasn't really moving.  (And even later, when it did move, it did not move downard, as the position of the ""tail"" would have suggested.)  I made a note of it at that point but was in a hurry, so I had to stop watching. Around 9:00, after running some errands and returning to work again, I noticed the teardrop-shaped ""object"" again.  As I was driving towards it at the time, it was difficult to tell if and how quickly it was moving.  However, it seemed to be slowly drifting west.  It appeared larger (perhaps closer?) than before and slightly further north. I parked my car behind the building that I work in and came back around to the main road to get a better look, as there were trees, power lines and other buildings blocking my view.  The process of parking and walking around could not have taken more than 45 seconds. When I came back to the main road, though, the object was much smaller (farther away?) and much farther south in the sky.  At this point it was obviously drifting southwest steadily but not particularly quickly.  I attempted to record it on my phone but the sun was too bright for the object to show up. I went inside my place of work and described to my employees what I had seen. I was inside for about 5 minutes before walking back out to check if the object was still visible. It had disappeared from view.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,32.51571142857143,-92.62751999999999

It was the night before Halloween, three friends and I were walking in some fields around the high school track in our town. We were looking up at the stars at the time, and it was surprising that there were no stars in the bright, star-lit sky. The wind, out of nowhere, began picking up. We all witnessed 5 yellowish-orange lights (one in the very middle, ahead of all the others, two behind, and two more behind the other two, forming a ""V"" shape,) flying overhead, headed North, North-Eastern direction (probably about 300 feet above the ground). It made no noise, at all, and when it was approaching, the wind would pick up and would immediately stop when overhead. All of us were astonished, we did not believe our eyes; we decided keep watching the night sky. A couple minutes later, once the wind began to pick up (which was weird, because there was no wind at all during the day-time or through-out the whole day and no clouds,) this light over the track which is usually dimly lit and only comes on every minute or two was fully lit. We were searching for the UFO, and the wind began to come down and we saw 3 yellowish-orange lights headed in the same direction (300 feet above the ground?), this one looked like the other one but without the two lights on the very end. The wind picked up again and dyed down once it disappeared.  The light over the track then dimmed down. We were hearing distant screams, in a manly voice. Within a few seconds, we heard a ""metallic,""bang by some nearby bleachers. By then, we started walking on the track, since we got spooked.   Approximately 2 minutes later, some nearby coyotes started going wild, yelping for help it sounded like. The wind began to pick up, which was our ""sign,"" and we saw the 3 yellowish-orange lights again (probably 150 feet above the ground), and it did a curving motion above us, speeding up and tilted toward us. (It was hard to keep up with the UFO at the speed it was traveling at; it seemed like the lights turned a white-ish color once they were moving at a fast speed.) We all ran for the car, it was on a mission, we thought. The car, which is in good shape, a Ford Mustang, took approximately 3 times to start, which is very, very peculiar. The four of us went to a house, only 50 yards away. We exited the vehicle, and one of us called a friend and he witnessed the UFO too, once it came around the fourth time, headed slightly in a North-Western direction about 3 minutes after we arrived at the house.

I can’t give the exact date, but can give you an approximate date because it was during spring training baseball in Tucson.  There also was an airshow going on at nearby  Davis- Monthan Air Force Base.  The year was 2007. My husband, son and I were watching the game, but were distracted by the air show when I noticed idle in the sky between the parks we were at and the airshow was a disk.  I got my son and husband’s attention to see what I was seeing.  Both watched with me for several minutes.  I then turned to a neighbor to the left of me to take a look.  When I turned back to see the UFO it was not visible. I have to go back a second to tell you that I was thinking to myself, ""I see you."" It was not visible to me the rest of the game and so my attention was drawn back to the game.  A couple of hours later we walked back to our car out in the lot and began our drive back home.   We went on with the rest of our day and there was really no other conversation about what we’d seen. Sometime in the very early hours of the morning, I was awakened by a lime green light in my face.  I was aware that I had been sound asleep and now I was seeing something that made no sense to me.  It had writing along the edge of it.  It seemed to be suspended at head level with me.  I could not make out the symbols.  The light seemed to have formed the size and shape of a VCR.  I sat looked to the right of me where my husband was sleeping soundly to see where I was just to get my bearings.  The clock was where it was supposed to be, and then I looked to the foot of my bed toward the right where the t.v. sat with its light in the lower corner.  Both the clock and t.v. were red yet what I was seeing was lime fluorescent green. I then looked slightly to the left at the foot of my bed and saw that there were 3 small people standing there and one more standing a bit further to the right of the rest.  I have an executive height dresser which sat behind them so I could gauge the height of these little people.  Not one was a full head higher than my dresser. I felt a bit unnerved by this time and turned back toward my husband and wrapped my arms around him and went to sleep.   I didn’t know if they stayed or left and really wanted to feel safe. The next morning very early my son and I went out to the car, the morning dew was still on the window where I saw an unusual hand print of what I only can guess was a thumbprint of some sort and 3 fingers imprinted on the window behind the driver’s seat.  My son and I both looked at it and then looked toward the west where we were met with a very, very bright white light.  So bright it frightened me.  I put my arm around my son and led him back into the house.  He had seen it also. Since that time, we have had occasion to feel some very subtle sensations in our bodies.   I was unaware that my son had a visit from these little people, but he claimed to have had something that woke him too.  I never asked him what all he had experienced that night. Interestingly enough I called my daughter in the bay area to tell her what had happened.  She was in disbelief of course until I told her about the fluorescent green light when she said to me, “mom you aren’t going to believe this, but there was a green light in my room for just a fraction of a second”. I felt that I should say something as time will inevitably fade my memory of events. I suppose it sounds a bit corny to add that I feel we are looked in on from time to time as I believe this area to be somewhat of a hotbed of activity. We were still very new to this area and I always wondered if they were curious or keeping track of the amount of new population growth in this area, but I speculate.  I really have no idea why they were here, but I do know that they were able to keep watch of me at the game, follow me to my car, follow us home and know exactly where I sat in the car and furthermore knew I knew they were aware of me as much as I was aware of them. I don’t have anything else to add, but am unafraid of any repercussions.  I do not drink or take drugs and I’m not crazy.  The story you’ve read is my account of the events that occurred to the best of my recollection.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

I pointed it out to my stepfather, and his friend.  My stepfather believed it to be a fast-paced military chopper, or something. It was too fast for a chopper, for I live in a place where helicopters are common.  Plus there is no military base in the quaint town of Milan.  After going about 20 miles past the racetrack, the craft hovered and dimmed out. If I could guess the speed, I would say that it was clocking at 100, maybe 110 MPH. I heard nothing, due to the roar of the car engines that night. I’ll never forget it, and I’ve been thinking about it ever since then, and then I found this site.

While parked off of the road at the local highschool which I was still attending, a flash of light illuminated the entire sky in the direction of a local agricultural business across the street and it made the area seem like it was being viewed through nightvision goggles; unseen structures on the ground miles away became visible as if the sun were out. After the flash (which seemed to be an lime green)and originating from the field a glowing and undefined sphere of light rose into the sky.  When the sky was lit up the sphere was not visible.  After the area turned black again was when the sphere glew, became visible and floated upwards until it was about a mile high in the sky.  It shone and hovered in the same spot for about 30 seconds.  The sphere itself was initially a light yellowish color but it graudually changed to other orange and redish hues. After changing colors the light shone brighter and grew even larger in size for an instant and then vanished.  On the ground and no more than a quarter of a mile away when it first took off it seemed to be about the size of a softball but once in the sky and at least a mile away its light expaneded to what was the size of a basketball. The same object vanished instantly and then reappeared far off to the west over what would be near Watsonville (about 20 miles away) and then teleported again to the south near Salinas. (another 20 or so miles away)  There was never any trail of light.  After about another 30 seconds or so of this it came back to its original hovering spot, paused for a brief moment, and then raced towards the west again and upwards at a low angle.  Within 5 seconds it was no longer visible but unlike the other instances the final time it took off it did not teleport; it seemed as if it were taking its time to leave. It's cliche, but while watching the object in truely felt as if the three of us were also being observed.  It was a very surreal experience, the kind that you want to dismiss as imaginary almost immediately.  What made the ordeal undeniable was the fact that all three witnessess saw and explained seeing the exact same thing many months afterward.

While we were driving North on Clovis Ave, between Dakota and Ashlan Ave, we spotted these strange flying objects (at 19:37) moving east.  It took about 2 minutes for them to be right in front of our view from when we first spotted them. Eight to ten bright, and silent objects flying surprisingly fast, and rapidly flashing white lights (that changed colors to red, purple, blue, yellow, and green). They were in a 4-2-4 formation; 4 on top, 2 in the middle and 4 on the bottom.  We immediately pulled over in the parking lot of the Clovis Recreation Center.  We sat there for 7 minutes, staring in awe.  We failed to have any type of media equipment suitable for capturing the moments that were happening.  The objects then, 2 at a time, began to separate and flew faster than the rest (going towards the ea! st hills/mountains).  At that same time, we noticed an airplane flying in the sky.  We could quickly tell, due to the red and green slow flashing lights and the noise it made.  After, we drove towards the hills/mountains to try to catch up to them.  We were not fast enough, but we did see them disappear.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,36.86390063694268,-119.65213566878982

She could see the massive star field clearly out the side window and so could I, in Santa Monica there is too much city light and you only get to see a few stars. My wife and I had been talking casually for awhile about what activities were to come since we had a couple more days to enjoy. Then, she said ""Wait, what's that?"" I said ""What?"" ""In the sky, in front of us, as big as my hand, it was triangular, a flash of lights, in rows.""  I felt that maybe this was just some refection off of the windshield, maybe when i switched from low beams to high so I tried that but that wasn't it. Then she saw it again. This time there was fear in her voice as it was wavering in tone, and that got my attention, we have been married for ten years and I know her well. So I now was shifting my line of sight from the road ahead to the sky and back. And for the briefest moment, as if seeing traces of light from lamps that were just switching off, I saw it too. They seemed to be yellow in color, and in rows, dotting the triangular shape,  the shape seemed longer at one end. And then it was gone. Just after, I asked her to grab my TX-1 video camera, because if this thing comes back I want to be ready. And she too got her camera and was at the ready watching the night sky. But it did not come back. When we arrived at the house in Volcano, I asked her to draw something of what she had seen. I confirmed the shape too. Except it was with the front point facing down instead of up when I saw it. There was also a sort of criss-crossing frame between the lights that you could just make out. In the following days what we had seen kept popping up in our conversations. It was a very strange event and I don't think we will ever forget it.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,,

I originally thought it was a snowmobiler riding down this logging trail back in the tree line.  However, I was curious due to the fact that the terrain along that logging trail dropped slightly in elevation approx. 20-30 ft. over a distance of about  100 yds. or so.   The object traversed the 100 yd. distance in about 1-2 sec. max..  The bright object I saw flew straight and did not drop with elevation.   So, I jumped on a snowmobile and rode out there only to find not a single trace of anything. I walked around the area which was about 2 feet deep in snow.  No tracks of anything.  I could only think that what ever I saw fly down that logging trail, never touched the ground. I can only say in closing that if it was a snowmobiler I would have not been able to see its headlight due to the fact the logging trail actually runs away from my bosses property, not parallel or towards it.

I noticed right away, separate from the other star formations, what appeared to be a rapidly color-changing ball of light, distinctly different from the normal ""twinkling"" colors of most stars.  These were visible colors; not just vague pastel flashes like most stars.  The light was single, about 70-degrees above the horizon and exactly southwest of my location (I confirmed this with my iphone compass).  The light was larger and brighter than Venus (as a reference), and as mentioned, changed into separate and very distinct colors:  red, green, blue, white, yellowish.  No particular order to the color changes.  No sounds overheard.   I watched for several minutes and even tried to take a video with my phone.  However, the darkness surrounding me proved too great for the video, and the light did not show up, nor did anything else except a street lamp, on the video.

A sudden light caught my attention in a clear, black, sky. I observed what appeared to be a bright white circle in a perfectly straight downward motion.  I had been looking straight ahead,NNW direction,and it appeared that the light suddenly clicked on. Blackness was in my upper field of vision, then, there it was. Comparing it to a moving car, I would approximate the speed to be 20-25 miles per hour. No wavering; no curve; no speed variance; no light trail.    There were many stars overhead, but none visible in the field behind this dropping light.  . I say “dropping” rather than “falling” because it seemed to me that it was moving more slowly than an object that size would fall the distance that it did.  It also seems that, if it were an object that it was of a weight heavy enough that it would not drift. I caught sight of it as it was was approximately 45 degrees up from ground level. As I do not know the distance from me, I am unsure of its size, however, when extending my thumb, it would have just covered it.   It appeared to be dropping straight to the ground at a steady speed. Comparing the speed to a road vehicle, I would approximate the speed from my vantage point to be 20 miles per hour. One of the first things I had noticed as I stepped outside was how very quiet the neighborhood is tonight.  Not a sound could be heard from my deck and not a sound from the descending light.      I lost sight of it as my vision was blocked by a tree, still “solid” with leaves, so I could not see if it followed the straight descending path, but it seems that it would have had to make a very fast turn to avoid the ground.  There was neither sound of impact heard nor explosion of light observed.  Lack of either may have been due to distance, of course, but it just seemed like there should have been something…   As a former high school teacher, then as a hospital unit director,  I have become accustomed to looking up to see some very oddly interesting sights, many of which I learned to quickly dismiss.  There was something about this one, however, that got my attention.  And kept it. In the morning, I will check with others, hoping that someone else happened to be outside and looking up at that late hour.  I hope that I find someone, as an unwelcome addition to my wardrobe would be a needed T-shirt reading, “Of all the things that I have lost, I miss my mind the most.”  Thank you, Mr. Davenport, for your dedication to the valuable work that you do, and for this opportunity to share the odd sight that I observed.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,40.8624,-78.1734

As we were facing north, all three of us observed a line of 4 reddish-orange circular lights emerging slowly from behind the trees to the north. I saw what appeared to be a 5th reddish-orange light trailing the other four at a somewhat greater distance, but when the group of 4 emerged into our line of sight I no longer saw the 5th light. The 4 lights traveled as if they were attached by a string, that is, the distance between them did not vary at all as they moved. Perhaps this indicates that they were attached to a craft of some sort, but none was visible from where we stood.. The lights traveled very slowly, from right to left, across our line of sight in a westward direction. As they moved far to the left they dimmed and flickered out, one by one, until they all disappeared. I tried to take note of whether they passed behind a cloud; I don’t think that was the case. Relative to the diameter of a full moon, the length of the formation appeared to be about 6 times that diameter. The angle above the horizon was approximately 55-60 degrees as best I can determine. Each of these “orbs” was about 4 times larger than the brightest star I’ve ever seen. None of us heard any sound from this craft, if that’s what it was, but given the distance from us, one wouldn’t likely hear any sound. My neighbor dismissed this whole thing, saying they were “balloons”, but that doesn’t make sense. I’ve been thinking about this and decided it’s definitely out of the ordinary, so decided to report it. My daughter agrees.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,39.17450311744155,-84.48136299381886

The location was Northridge, CA. The night sky was pretty clear, the wind pretty calm, temperature was mild 60’s. I was in the backyard star watching which is pretty typical for my weekend evenings. Our backyard is on a south facing hill overlooking the San Fernando Valley, is quite dark for the Valley, and there are no homes behind us. From almost directly overhead a dark object caught my eye. As I focused it was a third round, or a rounded “boomerang” shape, of about seven or nine dark circles, I did not think to count them. It was pretty close overhead and moving slowly although it seemed to move past rather quickly. Its motion was very “smooth” and it was absolutely quiet. It moved from Northwest to Southeast with the center circle in front and the others tailing out left and right. It appeared and “disappeared” quickly. Not that it moved so far into the distance that I could no longer see it but that it just ! got so dark it sort of “disappeared” into the night sky. The entire time I actually saw it was maybe 10 – 15 seconds. My first thought was “what the hell is that?” But logically I assumed it must have been a string of large black balloons let loose on Halloween night, although there remained some small hint of my initial thought “what was that”. Then last night, 7 Nov, I Googled “why move to Florida” (nothing related to that night), and eight or nine results down I saw “A Florida parent and 18-year-old son report watching a large, fast-moving, boomerang-shaped object with no lights moved directly overhead on November 3”. I clicked on and read the article. I do not know what I saw that night, but the witness statements and description of what they saw could have been describing what I saw. Attached is a representation I made of what I saw that night. The entire object appeared to be just the circles which were a dark “grey”, or at least appeared to have no color or illuminat! ion that I could distinguish.

On the evening of the UFO sighting, my boyfriend and I had just gotten back from picking up a family friend from the airport  (We live an hour and a half away, this UFO was NOT a plane).  Our family friend had told us all the flights were delayed or canceled  because of the thunder storm and severe rain we were having.   While we were standing outside his house in the drive way he saw a really bright light. He said, ""Come here and look at this.""  I was standing where tree branches were blocking my view so I couldn’t see what he was pointing at.  When I stepped closer to where he was standing and looked into the night sky I saw a bright hovering disk (it had a disk like shape but the light surrounding it was rectangle).  It was very bright and looked far away, yet the whole craft was brilliantly lit. It emitted a yellow/golden light in color.  We both stood looking at the flying object until it flew straight into the clouds.  During the short amount of time we saw the UFO, it maintained the hovering position, not moving anywhere, for about 5 seconds.  Then went up a few feet in the air (from our perspective) and back down to the original position.   After this the UFO flew straight up into the clouds at a super fast speed.  It looked like it disappeared. There were no more lights emitting from the craft. This is my first encounter with anything to do with UFO’s or aliens. I can’t explain what I saw. I don't know of any kind of aircraft so bright, has the same shape, can maintain a hover thousands of feet in the air, go at a fast speed straight up and all this during a thunder storm.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,40.27123156626506,-111.62400433734939

Also, their engines make a loud noise overhead.  I was with my gran, who is very sceptical about such things, but she was frightened by this, and wanted to get away.

In my peripheral vision, I saw a left to right moving light (west to east). I thought immediately it was a satellite because there was an absence of sound.  I am always curious about moving objects in the night sky so when I was finished moving the squeegee down the mirror, I focused on the object.  Much to my surprise, it wasn’t one object; it was 3 spheres of light moving together in a triangle pattern. I studied the objects and atmospheric conditions carefully.  I estimate they were 1500-2000 feet high, moving at about 100-200MPH.  The night sky was cloudless with winds blowing from the NW at about 15-20MPH. I estimate these spheres of light to be approximately 75-100 ft in diameter.  Let me emphasis, these objects were not points of light that you might see from a specific light source, such as the strobe lights on an airplane.  These were spheres of muted white light, 75-100 ft in diameter each. After 6 seconds, I was preparing to take a video with my iphone.  At 7 seconds, the objects vanished in a way that looked similar to the way people disappeared when in the ""transporter"" on the TV series ""Star Trek,"" not instantly, but over a period of about a second or so. Let me just mention as background information: my father was a career Air Force NCO.  I grew up on Air Force Bases and around airplanes. I have observed airplanes both civilian and military all of my life (I am now 58 years old).  I have observed satellites since I was a kid.  I know what they look like and their predictable behavior.  This observation was unlike any in my past.  The soundless, formation flying objects were unlike any airplane(s) or satellites I have ever seen.  The fact that they were flying over one of the largest food warehouses on the east coast may just be coincidence, but maybe not. I am not a Cooke but when I shared my observations with others that night, I was treated by some like I was.  I have never reported anything like this before.  This observation has shaken me because I cannot explain it and I am reporting it in hopes that somehow the information can be beneficial.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,42.3868,-72.6065

As I watched there was one lead object followed by the others in which the followers had moved and changed places rapidly.  After about 10 seconds they just vanished.  I know that any type of local bird moving through the area cannot move that fast or fly at that height.  The formation was that of what appeared to be a v type but the objects were moving while flying in a straight line.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,47.898008,-97.164114

In the van was my wife and two of our children who also witnessed this object, and were very scared. My wife indicated looking at an object above her no bigger than a large trashcan and it was about 40 feet above the ground.  She stated the object was cylindrical in shape, orange and white in color and with a yellow glow. There was no wind at the time. She said as soon as she got out of the van to look at it, it immediately started to move away in a northern direction and upward.  Her whole initial interaction lasted about 2-3 minutes. I am now driving to where she is and as I am driving and looking in the sky, I now notice an odd lit object floating fairly high in the sky, north of me. I pulled over and began to video tape it. There were some high clouds, but no wind or rain. What I saw with my naked eye was an object the size of a tennis ball at arm’s length away. There was a reddish-yellow constant glow that also varied in brightness.  Through the video camera I was able to zoom in and see a completely different object. Now I see an object that was initially the shape and color that my wife described to me. It was hazy and had a radiant glow of orange. Then it suddenly changed shape and now I see a distinct triangular shape with multiple colors flashing in no specific pattern. The lights were yellow, blue, green, red, purple, orange and pink.  As the lights flashed in a triangular direction there was also another set of lights that were moving around the triangular ones in an elliptical direction, which! were mostly yellow and orange in color and had a more constant brightness.  The object continued to move upward and north westerly. Towards the end of the sighting, the shape of the object clustered together and became blurry.  However, you could still distinctly see the different colors flashing.   Then a ball of colors appeared to drop from the object and was visible for only a second. A total of three of the colored balls or globs of light fell or dropped from the main object. After the third one dropped, the object seemed to fade in brightness, flickered a couple times, then vanished possibly behind the clouds. I called and reported this to the 911 operator at 2231.  The operator documented the information and then called me back with the UFO report line, which I then called as well.

It appeared to move around the sky as if following my car. The light stayed in view the entire time. App on entering Rushville i went right, up Baldwin hill rd. passing Marcus Whitman high school. at this point i thought it was the water tower light. However as i neared a stop sign i was facing the light and could see several other lights much smaller moving from left to right passing the light on there decent, they appeared to have a reddish blinking lights.

It then made a 90 degree angle decent to my right. I exited my vehicle and listened. At first there was nothing then you could hear the silence replaced with the sound i can only describe as how a jet sounds flying over. Only it did not appear to blink in any pattern and the sound came only after the light had dimmed and turned to a moving red blinking object.

I'm not lieing and i wish i had a video camera. this event scared the hell out of me and made me very uneasy. the light was brighter then any air craft Ive ever seen and i can only describe it to the intensity of the full moon on a clear night.

But this 'star' was brighter than any one I had ever seen in my life and it was moving ever so slowly and it made me curious. There was absolutley no sound that I heard from this and even if it made sound, it probably would have been too far away fro me to hear it. I ran inside to get my camera to try to zoom in on it to get a better view. I went back outside and I first took a still photograph of the object.  On this picture it just looked like a very large, very bright star. On the next picture I zoomed in on it as far as my camera would go and the object looked almost like the moon. I then decided to get video of this thing.  I had the camera on normal at first and then I zoomed in on it. When I zoomed in on it I saw what looked like rings going all the way through this thing and the rings seemed to be flashing.I zoomed back out and then turned off the camera because I had to go into the bathroom and put on my slippers and coat as I did not expect to be so cold standing out there.  It was around 29 degrees.  I planned to come back out and finish recording it because I knew it would still be there because it was moving so slowly I knew it would not be out of sight anytime within the next 5 minutes or so. I did what I needed to and came back out with the camera running not quite a full 3 minutes later, and to my surprise the thing was gone. I walked around the side of the house to see if it was just beyond my view from the front and it was nowhere to be found. In that second video, as I walked around the side of the house, I saw the almost crescent shaped moon and I put the camera on it and zoomed in on that as well just to see if that moon had any flashing/radiating rings on it like that 'thing' did.  The moon did not.  That thing would have had to picked up a lot of speed very quickly to be completley out of my view within a 3 minute time frame. I know this was not quite 3 minutes because my camera has the time on it when the video is viewed from the TV. I reviewed these with my husband when he came home and neither of us can come to any conclusion as to what this can be.  We are clueless and have never seen anything like it before.

During a beach vacation last summer, my wife saw a red-ish light approx 60 degrees above the horizon out over the ocean.  I commented immediately that ""now you've seen it too"". This was in reference to my own observations a year earlier, co-witnessed by my son.  Soon after my comment, she said it was gone. I went for and retrieved binoculars which were no help.  Then, I remembered I''d brought a Night Owl night vision monocular device.  The device has an incorporated infra-red beam to highlight objects with. It would reflect the white ocean-foam of breaking waves about 150 ft away. After following the light, now only seen with the ""Owl"", for about 10 minutes, another red-ish light appeared above it and the two seemed to migrate into one another to form a single light. After another fives minutes I began to ""signal"" the object with the infra-red beam by flashing it on and off randomly, both fast and slow. Suddenly, the object light flashed extraordinarily bright. Not only do I believe that this was in response to my flashing the infra-red beam, I believe it was done to try and blind my night vision device from further operation. After another 10 or so minutes, the object(s) moved due North across Emeralds Isle towards the Bogue Field area. Bogue is a now-defunct military air field used for practice take-offs and landings by helo's, Harriers, and Osprey aircraft. Many of these were visible flying in the direction of New River MCAS, NC to the South of our location. In the previous year's vacation, 2009, these lights were seen while we stayed at a beach location several miles to the South of our current place of stay. At that time, several lights, or a couple of very, very fast ones were observed for a very short time. On this occasion, I was able to see them for a much longer time with the aid of the ""Owl"". Having grown up a Military dependent of a Marine Air Officer, I am very versed in the many types of aircraft current and past used by the Marines, Navy, and Air Force Commands. What I witnessed in July of 2010, and the year before was not any type of known aircraft. Not only was this object completely silent, it moved without effort across 35 mile and hour winds effortlessly.  At no time was any shape discernible, only the red-ish light which varied in intensity from very faint, to a brilliant electric arc-type of light that I could not look directly at with the night vision device. The wife and I agreed that the light when its brightest lit up an area approx 300 feet wide and about the same deep. Otherwise, about 150 feet in either direction on the sandy beach and about 150 feet out in the ocean from water's edge. When dimmed, the red-ish light and light at it's most brilliant were apparently from the same source. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.

It hovered in one area for a couple of seconds, then darted to the left, then the right horizontally.  Then it went straight up and then down after which it repeated the same pattern a couple more times in and out of this cloud.   I had not said anything to my son at this point because I wasn’t sure what I had seen.  After this display, my son says to me, ""Did you see that thing in the sky mom?  Stop the car."" I pulled over to the shoulder and took out my phone and started recording the objects motions.  After a couple of minutes it darted into the cloud, came back out then went back in and never returned.  We sat there for a couple of minutes waiting for it to reappear but it never did come back.  Once it disappeared my son noticed a fighter jet circling the same cloud we were looking at, as if it were looking for what we had seen in the cloud.

On the afternoon of August 6, 2010, I was on a lounge chair in my backyard on the north side of the swimming pool. It was 2:40 pm on a sunny day with a mostly blue sky dotted with a few puffy clouds.  I was facing east and was in the shade cast by the tall bamboo behind me.  Although there was no change in the light, I had a random thought that dark thunderclouds might be coming in from the west and looked up at the sky.  A few seconds later I saw a silver disk travelling from west to east, in a straight line over my pool almost directly overhead. At first glance I thought it was some kid's silver balloon that got loose but quickly realized it was no floppy, tinfoil balloon, but some kind of solid, firm-surfaced metal. I focused in on it so I could remember as much detail as possible. It was shaped like a disk but also had a squashed circle/egg type shape. The top and bottom were rounded and the sides were slightly rounded, like the shape of a Mento candy. There were no hard edges or seams, no puckers or variations of color or texture in the surface. It was totally smooth and reflective, the bottom of it turning darker as it passed over the green trees at the eastern end of the yard. I'm estimating that it was about 30 feet above the fully mature maple trees, so maybe 60 feet above ground. I got the impression that it might be 3 to 4 feet in diameter. Although it was breezy at the treetops, the disk moved in a straight line, with no side to side wavering or drifting from the wind, and no change in altitude. There! was absolutely no sound emitting from it. After the disk had been in my sight for about 5 seconds I had the presence of mind to call out, ""Look up!"" to my husband, who was doing some yard work about 20 feet behind me and to the right. Since he was to the right of the edge of the bamboo stand he had a clear view of the disk and looked up in time to see it just as it was going over the trees. His description of the disk corroborated mine. From the time I saw the disk to the time it travelled out of sight was about 8 to 10 seconds and I estimate that the distance it travelled in that time was about 50 to 60 feet. Using these estimates, the disk was travelling at about 3 to 5 miles per hour. Unfortunately there was no time to take a picture, even with my cell phone. I am recently retired but was a government employee for 33 years and my husband works for a major airline. Our eyesight is fine and neither of us requires eyeglasses or contacts for driving. Immediately following this sighting I felt satisfied to have finally seen something concrete and real because it left no doubt that these objects do exist. Then I started wondering whether the fact that they do exist was a good thing or not. Knowing that there is technology far advanced than that held by us here on Earth is a bit unsettling. From our own history we know what usually happens when a technologically advanced civilization meets a less advanced society. I can only hope that whoever is controlling these objects has a less aggressive nature than us humans.  I am not overly worried about it, though, because I feel that if they meant to do us harm, they would have by now.  Perhaps they are just documenting our own self-destruction, via the proliferation of nuclear weapons, p! ollution, greenhouse gases, over population, genocide, chemical farming, antibiotics, destruction of the rainforests, and over fishing?  Maybe we are their version of watching a demolition derby; dirty, ugly and violent, but oh so entertaining!  We told friends about the sighting but, of course, most of them just laughed it off and asked how much we had been drinking at the time (which, by the way, was not at all). We humans do laugh when we are nervous about something, and we don't want to hear about something that makes us uncomfortable. And the quickest way to shut someone up is to ridicule them. So our friends reactions are normal, but we know what we saw. I don't think our government could keep such technology a secret. Even if they could, if we had it, we wouldn't be fighting wars to get oil because we would have a better propulsion system already. So what we saw was an Object, that was Flying and is Unidentified...a UFO.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,42.5324,-70.9736

Just passed Temescal Canyon Rd exit, spotted what first appeared to be three lights in a delta formation heading directly towards me. Altitude ""estimated"" 3,000 above ground based on mountain range reference parallel to the interstate. This configuration appeared unconventional, so I immediately pulled over onto the shoulder about 1/2 mile south of Temescal Canyon Rd. I exited my vehicle and observed three pairs of lights, each pair blue and red, in a delta configuration move relatively fast and amazingly smooth almost directly overhead in a northwest/north direction. As it flew overhead the sets of lights appeared to be embedded in a flat surface shaped in a ""boomerang"" or ""v"" shape body. very pitch black colored. Each light was ring shaped, not solid oval. Each pair of lights were on each ""wing tip"" as well as the leading nose. The lights were not blinki! ng or strobing. There was no apparent navigation light system as expected in conventional aircraft. Lights remained on constantly. It took about 30 seconds for the lights to reach overhead from the moment I pulled over, and I observed the object for an additional 3-4 minutes as it eventually faded out of site. What was impressive was that it banked slightly to the left at times as a single solid object and it its massive size was made apparent because even as its lights waned in the distance, its size became smaller very slowly as it got farther away.  I could not verify any sound emitting from the craft as it was too noisy from cars on the interstate passing by.  A good way to describe how big it was when over my head is to raise your hands above your head and spread them apart about 3 feet. That was the span from wingtip to nose tip.  I was alone in my car, however the interstate was very busy with many cars heading southbound, and there was another car who had pulled over about 200 meters ahead of me at the same time I did. It appeared they were observing this object as well. They remained there as long as I did, and I attempted to approach them to ask them if they had observed the same object, but they left the scene as I approached them in my car.  At 7:55pm PDT I texted a friend with my cell phone about my sighting and then I continued on for home. I live approx 5 miles south of where my sighting was.  Although I had a video capable cell phone, I was not able to have enough time to get my composure and get a video of the object.

The craft craft was moving at about 1.5x my velocity(30 to 40mph) in terms of angle it was only gaining a couple of degrees on my sight as I moved north north west. What struck me as odd was when it banked over to the east it moves rather gracefully and again I got a good solid look at it to confirmed the lack of general aviation lights. It was also a good indication that if it was a private aircraft it would have been flying rather low, 2k feat at best. other wise it would have had to have a large wing span if was indeed at higher altitudes. given its observ! ed attributes and movement I was shocked at the lack of noise. and the paradox between observed movement and luminary characteristics.  Again it could have just been an air plane but I have seen so many over the years this one just didn't make sense. I play a lot of video games and some of them are 3d flying games and also 3d space type games so judging angular velocity is a skill I have, this object defied many of the general definitions I have for normal air craft. It didn't move in a way that caused alarm but the combination of the lights and lack of flashers and indicators along with its graceful back was cause for concern.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,41.3947,-73.3142

Well I’ve always maybe thought there could be something out there, but this experience has truly made me believe. On my way to work I was driving and noticing the particularly beautiful day and it was about 8:20 in the morning as  I crossed the bridge like I’ve done everyday for two years. Now in the area is what is called Ellington Field, which is a sort of airport for NASA and Military use.  I am used to seeing planes and hearing jets fly over. I tend to think of myself one who has my head in the clouds but as I was driving I noticed a particulary shiny flying object. I took a double look (thinking it was a cool looking plane) but it in fact was an all metal low and fast flying object. It was hard to see and I think the only reason I did was because the sun was to the right of me.The object was reflecting the sun light  but like a mirror as well camoflaging  itself with the sky at the same time.  It was flat but round like a disc but it had a small dome on! top and a slightly larger dome on the bottom. It was moving at a very fast speed, but not so fast that the speed Iwas going in my car could not keep up.  Now once I finally reached a red light on the busy morning road, wondering if anyone else was seeing what I was seeing, I fixed my eye on it. So after the light turned green, the speed of the object started to increase until instantly, as if it had known I had discovered it, it vanished like looking like a bright star in the day sky and then gone completely.  I didn’t suffer from any electric disturbances nor did really anyone else driving seem to notice, but I was for sure I had seen something out of the ordinary.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,29.777493696651344,-95.4512204483632

I would have initially estimated the lights at approximately 900 to 1200 feet above the ground. Initially I also believed the object was a plane moving directly toward me because it looked like it was sitting still.  Because I was driving directly toward the object I became more interested in it very quickly because I realized it was not far ahead of me and low to the ground and was obviously too large to be any type of helicopter.  After driving about ¼ mile at 20mph I stopped the truck, turned off my lights and engine and got out to look at the craft.  I heard no noise for about 10 seconds as I stood there looking at the craft trying to figure out what it was.  I would estimate the lights that appeared to span side to side to be about 200 feet apart and front to rear lights about 50 feet.  This light scheme from a distance ga! ve the impression of an airplane but looked very unnatural up close.  Although I could see the lights clearly I could not actually make out the shape of the craft and I believe to be mounted to the bottom vice the sides or forward facing. There was minimal cloud cover and the craft was very close to my position but I was still unable to tell its exact shape or identify it in any way. After looking at it for about 10 seconds or so I heard what sounded like a distant jet engine and then a few seconds later the craft started to move off at a 30 degree angle from where I was standing.  Suddenly the lights went off and I could no longer see or hear the craft although it could not have been more than ¼ mile from me when I lost it. There was nothing to obstruct my view. I then continued on to my destination which was just around the corner from where I was parked (in the middle of the road). I parked my truck and began to wait for my daughter whom I was there to pick up.  While I waited I watched the sky and noticed after about 10 minutes that there were several planes coming in from a distance that seemed to be circling which I also found very odd. Then I saw the object once again when lights suddenly came on and it immediately (not at any unimaginable speed) began to move toward the closest plane in the area.  I was able to watch it for a few more seconds until once again the lights went off and I was unable to see it again. Over the next 45 minutes or so I watched as what I would estimate to be about 20 separate planes flying low and basically circling the town.

I began to pre-trip inspect the trailer, when I got to the back door area I had to pee, it is a wooded, fairly remote location.As I was standing there I looked into the sky and thought about how clear and crisp the night sky was.  Movement drew my attention to the south east. I observed two  white lights, very high up, moving at incredible speed. I immediately  focused in on the first star I saw next to them to try an tell if I was really seeing them move or it was my eyes tricking me, and they were obviously moving very fast. I would say they were about the size and brightness of a very small star.  There was no noise at all, but with the sheer altitude they were at, I'm not sure if I would have expected to hear anything anyway.They were about two inches apart from each other (from my perspective on the ground),and traveled about seven inches( again ,my perspective)in a south westerly direction.  They came to a sudden stop.  Sat in place for a moment, then one light faded away, the other flashed brightly, then disappeared.The whole event lasted maybe five seconds.

This jet was very high - it was a clear, sunny day, (today, April 8th, 2011) and the object appeared to be angled to the right side, higher than the jet but cruising along at the same speed, same path of flight. We watched until the jet left our view.   This happened over a period of about 3 minutes.  The jet was flying over Spokane. Again, this was a large jet at cruising altitude. It was travelling east.  The witnesses include two adults, one teenager, 3 children.   We each speculated what it could be and it was not, and could not, have been part of the plane as it was not attached.  Given the height of the jet, the object had to be relatively close to have been noticed but it! was definitely discernable as a separate object.  There was no jet stream from the object like there was from the plane, and it had no propellant system that was visible.  We definitely had a clear view of the plane and object.

At exactly 9:18pm on November 4th, 2010 I was driving home from Albertson's in Casa Grande, AZ to Arizona City. I took Trekell Road to Interstate 8 towards Tucson. While I was on Interstate 8, just coming around Casa Grande Mountain I noticed this huge circular aircraft to my left. The aircraft seemed to be relatively close. I'm not a very good judge of distance but I can tell you it wasn't much higher in the air than the top of the mountain that was to my right. What caught my attention initially, were these square shaped whitish yellow lights in a row to my left... I rolled my window down and without window tint in the way I could see the silver circular craft sort of hovering to my left. The lights were sort of arranged the way you would see princess cut diamonds arranged on an anniversary band but not stuck together, spaces inbetween and the lights brightness allowed me to see the silver color on the craft only around the lights. I don't know if the underside or the top was the same honestly. It started to rotate clockwise, sort of slowly as if it were on an axis just beginning to spin. As it started to rotate it appeared to pixelate and just disappear entirely. When I say pixelate, it literally looked like your T.V. screen would look when your cable has a glitch and the picture moves in little squares. This is what this craft did, it appeared to disappear one little square at a time in a matter of maybe 1-2 seconds. I immediately looked at my clock radio in my car and that is how I know this happened at 9:18pm. I called my husband immediately to tell him about it, as this is not the first UFO we have seen in our area... However the other one we saw were triangular with 3 orange lights. This was something entirely different. If I had to guess on a size, I would say it was about the size of a small grocery store. There was no sound or vibration of any kind... It was very odd. It definitely gives a little more merit to the interdimensional theories of UFO's in my opinion.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,32.8795,-111.7574

At approximately 1:17 am the morning of November 2, I noticed through the window a green flashing light about 40 degrees above the eastern horizon that appeared to be slightly larger than the size of a large star.  I studied the light because the green color flashing alternating with red then white seemed odd to me.  The object did not move but appeared to stay suspended in the same location.  After 10 minutes of waiting for it to move in the sky or to better recognize this type of pulsing or flashing light as a celestial body, I got out my little Nikon 9 x 25 binoculars for a better look, and then the object became much more visible.  At this point I woke up my husband and he observed the following as well through the binoculars:  This object was flashing a brilliant blue, red, yellow, white sequence that changed or alternated  color about once per second, almost in time to my ticking mantel clock. I presumed the green I’d seen without binoculars was a blending of the yellow and blue in the atmosphere.  The brilliant colors of the flashing or pulsing light all originated from the center of the object, sometimes flashing brighter than other times.  The object seemed quite distant, as the atmospheric distortion between it and me on the ground made it difficult to focus at times.  But by holding as still as I could and resting my arms on the window, the object's shape and further details became apparent. The object appeared to be flat across the bottom, with “walls” that were roughly 1/4 the height of the overall width of the object. It seemed to rise higher in the middle from where the light pulsed.  On the ""walls"" of the object, there were 2 large round dark disks or circles on each side of the central disk through or over which flashed the pulsing lights.  In other words, there seemed to be 5 very large circular disks evenly spaced along the sides of the object, 2 on each side of the centrally located flashing light. The details, for all the distortion and difficulty with keeping the object in focus, were actually quite sharp and surprisingly clear.  At approximately 1:55am I stopped watching the object which still was in approximately the same location and went to bed.  I did not take a photograph. I’m an attorney with a Masters in Urban Planning and my husband is an orthodontist.  Neither of us has seen anything like this before.  I grew up in the country in Ohio and am somewhat familiar with the night sky this time of year, and have seen Sirius as bright as this.  By using binoculars, the object appeared to be an object that was not part of the normal night sky. I will confirm this ""sighting"" or debunk it tonight at 1:00 am Central time.  If the object was indeed Sirius, then it will reappear and have similar characteristics.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,,

I’m making this report because I have a real UFO picture (taken accidentally).  Let me briefly explain you the situation…    My uncle took a ride in a boat with his family (wife, son, daughter) on Nov. 15th of 2010.  They were having fun, enjoying and taking pictures as family, and then my uncle took this picture of the “isla” (or island in English) which is a place in the Tamesi River in Tampico, Mexico. Later on the afternoon, his daughter downloaded the pictures from the camera, and she was amazed when she zoomed the picture of the “isla”, and then they discovered that they took a picture (accidentally) of a real UFO over the Tamesi River. He went to my parent’s house with his family, and showed the picture still in the camera with its original registration name (P1020036) and he had a copy in his usb and he shared it with me.  In the picture appears the water, sky, flora, etc. and a distant UFO with a flying saucer shape over the sky.  It was a great weather and the picture of the “isla” and the UFO was very nice and clear!    Also, I would like to emphasize that Tampico has a legend. The people say that we have a UFO base, because when all natural disasters come directly to Tampico, for unknown reasons they vanish or change the direction of hurricanes, etc. and they say this due to the high frequency of UFO sighting. I already sent the image to MUFON Staff, I hope they upload it with this body text. Thank you!

Four or five on the left definetly, four or five on! the right that were harder to make out because of the difficult angle which really gives a better visual as to how close this craft really was to my position, and 1 afterburner in the lead on this craft which was heading south along the coastline.

These lights maintained a steady maroon/deep dull red glow that almost blended in with the nightscape.  I watched it travel at least 75 yds before it disappeared and during this event there was still no evidence of any type of lights.  I spent 4yrs on an aircraft carrier so I know personally that when an aircraft flys along a coast with no port or starboard lights, no running lights, and no sound whatsoever at such a low altitude, then it must be unidentified.

At 3:20 pm I purchased ice cream for my daughter at the Glen Echo Café and then after walking around, maybe for 10 minutes we sat at a park bench facing the main building area.  My son was with me as well. I looked up at the sky and saw something that appeared round remaining in the same spot.  It was high above the clouds.  I heard a helicopter near by and also saw a plane.  I looked again to see if it was a helicopter but realized that it was too high for me to hear any sound from it.  I remained seated with my kids but chatted with them taking my eyes off what I had seen. After a few minutes I thought I would take another look and sure enough it was in the same spot.  Not knowing what it was-it did look like an unusual speck-I grabbed my camera and took a picture of the sky where I saw it thinking I just might be able to magnify the picture and see it better later at home.  Three minutes later, I zoomed in and took another picture.  I also did a short video clip with a description of what we were looking at. My children did not see it at first but I brought it to their attention by directing them to look in an area in between and above two red turrets and then to follow up the sky to the last cloud.  They did locate it at that point.  I would have to say we were there for at least 10 minutes and it had remained in the same place. When I got home, I was convinced I got nothing but then when I pulled up the picture, I located the spot in the picture and with interest magnified it.  It turned out to be what looked like a metallic sphere reflecting the sun. I am sending a Google Earth picture of the area showing exactly where we were sitting.  I am also including the clearest snap shot with magnification.  On the original picture with the cloud, you cannot see the spot too easily but once you locate it and magnify it, you can view the sphere. The best way to find it is to look at the cloud, move your eyes to the part on the bottom that resembles the map of Italy.  From there look to the right and once you reach the far right side of the cloud, you will see a tiny dot-don’t ask me why I even noticed it on such a bright day.

I had just begun an evening of stargazing in rural southern Ohio and was planning to start with sightings of Venus, Saturn, and Mars, which were grouped quite close together just after sunset on 8-7-10.  I noticed the object in question while waiting for Venus to appear after sunset.  In terms of brightness it looked a lot like Venus, but it was way too high in the sky to be that planet, and its brightness was probably closer to that of Jupiter, which was not due to appear until much later in the evening.  I thought perhaps it was a very bright star but did not know what star it might be. To attempt to identify the object, I trained my 6-inch Dobsonian with low magnification on the object.  What I saw was a disc, but not a disc in the sense of a flying saucer type object seen edge-on.  Rather, it was perfectly round and about the size of Jupiter on high magnification.  It appeared to have some markings on it somewhat similar to the light and dark areas seen on Mars when that planet is relatively close to Earth.  It did not appear to be moving at all. As I observed the object, I noticed it had a much smaller object which appeared to be circling it, much as you might see the Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter.  But the circling was not horizontal like a natural satellite --- east-west or west-east --- but rather a vertical polar orbit.  As I watched, the smaller object moved from about the 7:00 o'clock position on the main object up to the very top 12:00 o'clock position.  What was even weirder was that the smaller object appeared to be attached to the main object by a line which was very thin but quite visible. All of this happened very quickly, in a matter of a few seconds, and after this brief observation I was mystified as to what the object might be.  I thought perhaps it might be some exotic satellite of which I was unaware.  I took my eye from the telescope so I could just look at it to see if it was moving across the sky in a straight line at a steady rate with a steady brightness the way satellites do.  But when I looked up it had vanished.  Satellites wink out when they enter the earth's shadow and are no longer illuminated by the sun.  But as far as I could tell this object was not moving at all.  Had it been moving I would have almost certainly noticed some movement of the main object when I was looking at it through the telescope, since magnification also magnifies the perceived motion of an object across the sky.  I have never seen anything like this and I am at a loss as to what this object might have been.  I was sober with my faculties intact when I observed it. {:>) If anyone has seen something similar or knows what it may have been I would be interested in some feedback.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,38.9713,-83.346

The object was a very bright orange-yellow and I at first thought it might have been an aircraft with its landing lights on.  Its magnitude was far brighter than Sirius.  It is difficult to gauge the size of the object but I would estimate it as subtending half the angle as does a light plane at very high altitude. From our vantage point, looking in a NNW direction, the object was at about 45 degrees from the horizon. We heard no sound, saw no trail and watched it trace an arc for about one minute before it dipped below the trees in the NE or NNE. It appeared to have maintained the same level of brightness throughout its trajectory, ruling out any ""landing lights"".   At the time I speculated that it could have been a space vehicle during re-entry.  The object seemed far to! o bright to have been reflecting sunlight and the time was 50 minutes past sunset. I called Selfridge ANG base and spoke with a colonel in the Air Museum but he could provide no information; they had no reports of a sighting. I checked the Space Shuttle schedule and ruled out that possibility.  I then contacted our local TV stations and had the same result.  I spoke with our TV weatherman, who seemed very interested but he also had no reports of any such phenomenon.  He checked on the wind direction for the time of the object's transit but the high altitude winds were in a direction almost opposite that which would account for a weather balloon as an explanation.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,42.49333837209302,-82.89567558139535

This was very last minute, and on Friday, December 10, 2010, I was told i would be driving to Placida, FL, with one of the other models from my agency, who was also booked for this job.  We were told we had to head out that same night because the shoot was o the 11th at 7 AM.  Therefore, we decided to head out around 9 pm.  After heading out from Miami, and being on the road for about an hour and half or two, we had a UFO sighting.  I was driving on I75 North (alligator alley), it was very dark and we were the only car on the road during that time.  There was nothing around us, and the sky was absolutely clear.  All of the sudden the other model, which is sitting on the passenger seat, asks, “What is that?”, pointing to something that was heading towards us.  I immediately answered without even paying much attention to it, “Oh it must be an airplane”, and she said “No, that is NOT an airplane”..   So we starred at it as if it was flying towards us.  We were going 70 MPH, and this all happened in a matter of seconds.   This object flew right above our car and it was about 200 to 300 feet high.  It was absolutely shocking, and unexplainable. It flew so close to our car that we were able to see the object very clearly. We can describe it as a capital letter I , and it had four bright LED white/blue lights. These lights were circular, and really bright, and they were in each corner of the I .  As we are starting as it, it passes us, and I (driver) decided to pull over and figure out exactly what it was. As I pull over and look back it had vanished.  No where to be seen.  No lights, no object, nothing! It literally took me less than a second to pull over.  We both looked around us and there was nothing in the sky. It was so dark that we would have been able to see anything, even from really far away.  We had mixed emotions, we had no idea what we had just seen, we were laughing for the next hour non stop, but it was mainly beca! use of h ow nervous we were. As we saw that the object disappeared, we decided to start driving again. We’ve done some reading online, and saw stories of people who have had the same experience just like us on the same road. Some moments i just think to myself, “did that really happen?”. It just seemed so unreal. But it DID happen. I wasn’t by myself, nor was the only one who saw it. We both saw the exact same thing. I do believe in UFO’s but the other girl had never believed in that. But after this experience, I can definitely say, we saw something out of this world. Specially because this “ship”/UFO made NO noise at all. If it would have been anything human, like an airplane or helicopter it would have made lots of noise, specially because of how close it was.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,,

ALA WAI HARBOR xxxx Ala Moana Blvd. Honolulu Hawaii  Sitting on the bed of my truck with my friend at his boat slip. Two other neighboring men were hanging out on their boat.  We all looked up and saw something falling vertically fast, but no flames or fire like a meteor.  Object had a com trail.  Object fell right behind one of the major hotel buildings on Ala Moana Blvd when it flashed twice about 100 ft above ground.  This flash seemed to be a double flash and very bright blue/white lit up the sky.  No sound of impact or crowd craziness occurred. We all looked at one another and asked if we all saw the same thing.  There were no sounds when the object flashed. The object was grey metallic like naval ships.  Must of been 20'w x 40'h x 40'l approx. in size.  I saw com trail was more vapor-like than smoke; almost like moisture or steam. It disappeared quick in 10 seconds. The flash was amazing.  Haven't seen colors of blue like that in lightning. The object had structure but not like an airplane falling downward.  It was more squared with a noticeable corner extending off to one side.  The travel distance downward was five times that of the height of the Hotel next to the Harbor. I know people may have sen it who were near the street but who looks directly upward that fast.  Three seconds from trail to flash and 5-10 seconds of vapor trail evaporating.  Cars below would have missed it since it was directly above.  Cars in traffic must have seen it flash. I think our position at the harbor was the best vantage point to see the object falling vertically.  It was hard not to notice something that big on a vertical fall. My initial response was a falling star burning up, but the grey shape of the object didn't fit in my mind as a non-burning falling star.  So I googled this site to write it all down and let it go.

After I parked the car I started to walk back to my shop. The walk is approximately 60 feet. It was a cool clear night, the stars were out with almost no clouds. As I walked back I saw how calm and clear it was. So I decided to stop and just admire how nice it was. There I stood for a good minute looking upward at the southern sky. Nothing obstructed my view, and I was looking in the same general direction the whole time. My eyes were about at a 45 degree angle with the horizon. As I said I was looking at the sky for a good minute and I am sure nothing but stars were there. Then suddenly in the calm and clear sky it appeared. Yes it just appeared, as if someone had flicked a light switch.  It was a very, very bright round sphere. It had a distinct edge to it.  It was a lime green color with a green lighted haze or fog pulsating and radiating all around it.  In relation to where I was standing I would have to say it was 400 feet forward.  The height was at least 250 to 350 feet up now judging from its position above the house below it.  To where I was the size was like a basket ball. Next to the stars it was much larger. It stayed there for at least 7 to 10 seconds, not moving an inch from where it appeared. Not getting any dimmer, or changing in any way.  When without any warning or change it quickly darted directly downward, leaving a straight bright lighted green haze trail behind it.  Within 10 seconds the lighted trail diminished completely, and nothing was there.

I noticed a spherical shaped object flying over the center of my vehicle. Other people noticed it as well. They hit their brakes to slow down and stare. It was similar to a meteor, yet there was no tail and it was larger than any meteor I had witnessed. The sphere was blue, strangely like the blue in the movie Tron.  It lingered over the 2nd car in front of me; and followed at the same speed for a couple of minutes. It bounced forward in the air, much like a stone being skipped. Then, it behaved like a balloon that had been blown up and set free; as it darted to the right quickly, and then to the left and up. Next, it shot down to the left of the freeway as if it was going crash hard. I watched as I passed where I believed  there would be an ultimate explosion, smoke, or signs of a helicopter or plane crash.There ! was nothing. It was gone  Even though it had erratic movements, I still wanted to believe that it was a known craft. It looked and behaved like nothing I have seen in reality.  Only on t.v. and in movies have I seen something move that far, that fast. I thought of the possibilities such as a search light, but there was no beam extending to the ground, and it was smaller.

The position of these dots would form the corners of a triangle with the two corners on the bottom.   I  proceeded to start yelling for anyone that could help verify, but no one responded at this time.  While yelling the  bottom right dot started to move toward the upper right dot while the left dot remainded stationary.   The two dots  them came close together then the whole formation seemed to head east, and that is when I finally ran inside and  summonded my friend Brent who came to see the end of the first event pluse the second event also. Brent and I together witnessed the lights disappear in the east in the formation specified...this ends the first  event. Following the first event, Brent and I discussed the options and possibilites of what we has just witnessed for a  little while before he decided to retire inside while I still watched the early morning sky.   After about 30 minutes  lights once again graced the eastern sky....i summoned Brent and he summoned Kathey who would be the third witness  to tonights events.   The second event consisted of about seven objects in the eastern sky positioned side by  side  each other, slightly above the horizen with 2 of the objects on the right being very close to each other. I believe  this was object number 3and4 from the right.   Once again the objects seemed to slowly disappear in the eastern sky  after several minutes.  This was witnessed by myself, brent, and kathy. I am finishing this statement now at 04:24aM on 12/12/2010.  I just came back from checking aagin with no sign of the objects in question.  Venus has risen in the eastern sky, but from where I spotted the objects they would have been to the left/north of venus.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,27.460967103347894,-82.52932940320234

I was sitting in my living room (13 years old) messing with my hand-held 3-channel CB Radio.  It went dead.  I looked for new batteries in the house but found none.  I turned the thing off and on several times.  It began to work again.  I thought it was weird but did not think much else about it. About 30 minutes later our neighbors showed up with a story.  They had just sent some friends on their way and were standing in their driveway when they saw a very slow moving object in the sky above the trees and houses and particularly noted that it hovered across our house.  It was flying low. It was shaped like a “cigar” as they told it and had lights around the circumference.  They walked around to the back of their house to track the craft as it moved but when they got there it was gone.  They did not see it speed off. It was just gone. I remember my dad asking them (another dad and his son) if they were sure it was not a “blimp” that they saw and they reported that it was definitely not a blimp.  I remember they debated about whether a blimp could leave so quickly.  The other father was hesitant but finally reported the event to the local radio station (WMBG) in Williamsburg, Virginia. I cannot say that the dead radio experience and the object seen were related but they did occur at the same time.  I guess it would be possible for something like that to interfere with the crystals in the radio.  But who knows?  It could have just been a coincidence, which would presume the radio went on the blink for a few minutes just as the neighbors spotted the UFO.  [I never had a similar experience with that radio before or after that night.  It was a pricey and quality item my father had purchase for me as a birthday present that year.]",2011-05-29T00:00:00,37.305810900473936,-76.73795308056873

Me and my friend were sitting on the beach outside a Reggae club we liked to go to, it was late at night.  I'm pretty sure it was around Delray Beach.  Either that or somewhere from Ft. Lauderdale to Delray Beach, which was where we hung out. We hadn't been drinking heavily.  We were looking out over the ocean and saw this strange light pretty far off in the sky.  We remarked on how unusual it looked and then we saw it zip around very fast at sharp angles, and come closer to us.   I know this will sound strange but it was as if it had tuned in to our thoughts.  I say this because it zipped pretty close to us and we got a real good look at it from underneath. It was shaped kind of like a cake, or maybe a Fedora style hat and where the head-hole would be there was a pearly light but kind of gassy and ethereal is the best way I can describe it.  I say gassy because it was like looking into dry ice at a concert.  We looked at it for a minute up close like that and were talking about how cool it was but not wanting to get excited and scare it away, and another guy, rather drunk, came up behind us and shouted hey what are you looking at, and it zipped away and out of sight.  THERE WAS NO SOUND. It happened so long ago, it's strange to try to recount.  It is hard to believe it was real.  But it was, I know what I saw.  Me and my friend lost touch a long time ago, but I did see a special on TV once about some UFO's seen in Florida by many people including law enforcement, like Sarasota or Jupiter Beach or something, and the pictures they showed that the people had taken, some of the pictures were of exactly what we saw.

I stumbled across this site in an effort to find out information about some very bright red lights that hovered over my car in 1979 in Thomasville, NC.   I was driving home and red lights engulfed my car, with no noise, no sighting of craft.  I remember being scared out of my mind and driving like a maniac to reach my home about 5 miles away.  Being only 16 at the time and unaware of the silent helicopters that have red lights that the military had, of course I thought it was an alien spaceship.  I was to scared and drivng about 100 miles an hour to ever look up.  Maybe the military personal were spying inside my car thinking what a hot chick...lol.   It is sorta funny now but now knowing some of the military craft info now...it explains the event to a certain degree.  The lights did leave my car and I never knew where they went, as of course I didn't look to see in fear I was going to have a wreck, just as the dudes operating the craft probally thought themselves and laid off of me.   It wasn't a month later that I was on a date and we both saw 3 triangle shapes with white glowing lights just sitting still in the sky in a circle pattern about 2 miles from where the red light stuff happened, same road acually.  I know that were at at stand still because I compared them to the stars in the sky to see which way they were moving.  I wanted to follow them. but they were not going anywhere.  We just drove off on our way to eat.   I haven't seen anything else in my life, not that I have been looking for it!  I have found myself here and there stare into the sky looking for something strange, but not enough I guess.   I couldn't of been the only person to experience this crap.  Now with the Stealth fighter unveiled, that expains that sighting also.   I went years thinking that I had experienced a true UFO sighting(s), I am relieved now that I know facts that explain them away.  Unless a creature actually comes up to me, I will not be scared of these sightings anymore.   Being in a military state we all must understand that certain crafts have to exist and be tested in secret.  I am not saying that aliens do not exist, but to go along with most scientists, to reach Earth would be a far reach!  I do understand people's fears about the unknown, I suffered myself, for years!!!   I have no idea why these crafts were in our area of NC...about 3 hours from the coast, but guessing it was just for a test run....huh?

I saw what appeared to be the seven colors of the spectrum emerge from nowhere and briefly move across the sky southwestward in a pattern that I can only liken to a chalkboard line maker moving across a chalkboard.  If you were in grade school in the 1970’s and 1980’s as I was you may remember your teacher placing chalk in several wire holders attached to a piece of wood she would use to make lines on a chalkboard.  Imagine the colors of the spectrum being drawn on a chalkboard and that is basically what I saw. The colored lines emerged from nowhere and briefly moved across the sky and then abruptly stopped.   From them shot a bright white light that moved across the sky in a southwestwardly direction.  The whole sighting took a couple of seconds at the most.

Because our Uncle  was aware of how a satellite would move in a path across.  I remember him articulating: a satellite would be a light that would move across the sky in a non-veering path.  But this light zig zagged and stopped.  Then it would move again and stop. Move again in what appeared to be an un-organized pattern.nothing like a satellite.

Our Uncle took the time to make sure each one of us was able to find it in the sky and we all watched it for at least 15minutes when it suddenly streaked across the sky and disappeared.

This is a sighting that happened when I was a young child in the early to mid 1960's.  I was very young at the time and all I really remember about it was watching it with my mother and many neighbors over a several night period in the summer.  My guess is sometime around 1965. I would have been 5 or 6 years old at the time.  I know it happened over several nights because the neighbors gathered on the front lawn and sat in lawn chairs waiting each night for the ""show"".  I didn't remember this sighting from my childhood until I had a dream about it a few years ago.  At first I just figured it was a dream but it kept bugging me and stayed on my mind.  I eventually spoke to my sister who is 5 years older than me to see if she remembered anything like this and she immediately remembered the sighting.  We compared our memories of it and they are pretty much the same. As for the sightings themselves, we watched them at night in the summer and it was dark so it had to be between 8 and 10PM each night.  Each night was clear with many stars in the sky.  I remember it was in the western sky and that several of the neighbors said it looked to be occurring over Ft. Devens near Ayer Massachusetts.  The sightings themselves were simply dots of light in the sky, similar in size to the stars except these were moving making dramatic turns and creating strange patterns in the sky.  From my prospective at the time, they were just putting on a show and in fact I remember someone saying it was quite a demonstration.  It seemed to be designed to get our attention. I also remember several people being very frightened by the display.  I'm not sure how many nights that this happened but it was several nights in a row as people came out of their houses expecting to see it each night.  I don't remember much about each night specifically, just that it happened over a several night period and everyone was amazed at the movements and wondered what kind of craft could move like that.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This happened during the summer in 1958.  I lived in the only two-story house on my block when I was 8 years old.  My double bedroom window faced the East.  I always had to go to bed at 8 PM.  As I was climbing the stairs I began to hear a faint humming sound.  As I arrived at the top of the stairs and turned left to my open bedroom door, I walked across my room to my opened windows, as the humming became easier to hear.  As I looked out my window, hovering over my neighbor’s house were three small flying saucers hovering.  They were around 5 feet in diameter in a formation of a triangle, one in front and the other two behind the first.  They were roughly 5 feet below my window seal and no more then 20 feet away.  Back in the 50’s we didn’t have shows that were about UFO’s much less thought about them at my age.  I froze in disbelieve.  For at least a minute I watch and listened.  All three were identical.  First being saucer shape with a 2-foot diameter dome no more th! en a foot high, the outer skin was like frosted glass, barley transparent.  Around the edge was a 6 inch blue ring, shaped like dominos side by side.  In the middle of the dome was a pendulum that went counter clock wise around and around. It was easy to see passing under the frosted glass shell and the blue rings.  All the time making the humming noise as it revolved.  I had to prove to myself that this was real. I turned around with my back to them, but still heard the humming sounds they were making.  I turned back facing them and watch in amusement for at least another minute.  I again turned my back to them. As soon as I did, a few seconds past and the humming sound stopped.  I turn back towards my window and they were gone. I don’t expect anyone to believe me.  My parents just laughed just as anyone else would have who has never witness such an unbelievable sight.  I even don’t expect whoever reads this to believe my story.  I never told a soul till a few years back to my wife of 22 years.  As I told her, I am probably just a few people on earth who ever saw a UFO up close, much less three.  Most sightings I read about are lights in the sky, not something as clear as looking at your TV set across the room. I would not mind being tested under hypnosis or any other test to make believers of what I witness when I was eight years old, but I doubt if even that would ever happen. Because of my sighting I have no doubt what so ever that there are others in our universe.  As I became older I figured the small spacecrafts were more of a surveillance craft sending images to the Mother ship.  Not occupied by small aliens.

He ran down the hallway and I followed asking him to please tell me what was wrong.  He initially said, ""I can't tell you and I'll never tell anyone"".    I kept at him and he suddenly grabbed me by the arm took me out the front door pointed up to the top of the tall hills on the back side of Luke Airforce base and said, ""That's whats wrong.""   He then ran back into the house.   I stood there focused on what appeared to be a glowing fireball on the very top of the mountain.  I watched it for a while then yelled to my husband that I was going to take the truck and go up there, as it looked like a crashed craft of some sort.  He became hysterical and said, no way.   I then saw jets being scrambled from Luke AFB and a few minutes later I could see headlights from vehicles climbing the mountain trying to get to the fireball.  The road back there is part of the Base, so I assumed they were Base security climbing the mountain.  They only got about half way up the mountain and either stopped or shut off their headlights.   I went back in the house and tried to call local news (perhaps channel 10?).  There was a busy signal, which I thought was odd for a news station.  I managed to calm my husband down enough to tell me exactly what had happened to him while he was on his way home from his meeting and he put his hands on his head and said, that he was on his way home and came to a stop because the man in front of him had stopped suddenly.   You have to understand this is out in a very sparse desert area where it is pitch black w/ no street lights.  He had his window down and then a ""huge"" object floated over his car and the man in front of him.  The man in front of him also had his head out of the window.   My husband said there was no sound at all, but it blacked out the stars above seeming like it took an eternity to pass directly over the two idling vehicles.  My husband said, he yelled at the man in front of him a! fter the object finally passed over and said, ""You saw that right?""  He said, the man said ""yes, but would never tell anyone that he did"".   My husband said, the huge object floated rising slowly and went to the top of the mountain just on the back side of the base and that's when he had run into the house and into the back bedroom, completely ridden w/ fear. So, I can only report the fireball that I witnessed that I thought looked like a crashed craft as it completely lit the top of the mountain. But the whole story needed to be told, as my husband has NEVER been the same.  It shook him to his very core and would refuse to talk about it as it brought back the intense fear. After a while the fireball on top of the mountain slowly began to fade, but remained glowing for about two hours.  I get angry at myself for not taking the truck up there to see for myself, but it's very rugged terrain to get up there even w/ a dirt road or a fire road on which to travel.   It has taken me this long to tell this eye witness account, but now it is told.  By the way, I went to the front of the Air Force Base (about 3 blocks away)  the next day and it was locked down tight.",2011-05-29T00:00:00,33.57603490701001,-112.19439241773964

It was still light out, probably around 6-7pm.  I heard a strange buzzing/whirring sound that started softly and became louder and I said to my brother “do you hear that?” He said “hear what?”   As the sound diminished. A few seconds later the sound came back much louder this time and I said “you can’t hear that?” He replied “now I do” and we looked at each other puzzled.  I got off the couch and went and put my ear to the speaker on the TV set to hear if it was coming from there.  It wasn’t.  It became apparent it was coming from behind where we were sitting from outside the window. I walked over to the window and to my surprise a saucer shaped object about 35 feet in diameter was hovering at tree top height over a field between two houses a few hundred feet outside of our window.  We both watched in amazement as this saucer shaped craft hovered in front of us.  There seemed to be sec! tions of it that were rotating, some clockwise some counterclockwise and at different speeds. It was shiny grey metallic and had what appeared to be rows of colored lights.  I was eleven at the time and the feeling of overwhelming excitement was hard to contain.  I had no negative feelings about it. In fact I found it to be a very positive experience.  We were not scared.  It felt like the most magical experience of my life.  Very positive. I ran to get my camera and my brother went to get my sister.  When we got back to the window half a minute later it was gone. We checked the local news paper when it came out the following Monday for other reports.  Many people reported it to the police as could be seen in the police blotter, and later in the week a story came out about all the families who had seen it from a nearby school field while playing baseball. Witnessing that at such an early age has had a huge impact on my ability to accept the concept that we are not at the apex of intelligence in the universe as many would like us to believe.

For 24 years I kept this to myself and for some reason I really want to report it now. - I try to be percise but this gets a little in depth, since I saw it twice. In 1987, while returning home, I spotted what I (now)believe to be an Event Horizon, approx 1ft in diameter, gliding next to the road approx 3 ft from the ground and 1ft from the road edge (Union st. 200yd east of N. highland Ave).  At first I believed the object was a smoke ring.  I was not on drugs or alcohol, but for some reason my thinking was and my reactions were slow, I had actually passed the object before the (for lack of a better term)  Wrongness of it registered.  There were no cars for it to have come from and it was not dissapating.  So I turned around and went back to look at it more closely.  I was about 2 ft from it when I realized it was no longer moving down the road, It had stopped moving and the circular formation of it was now directly facing me (I never saw it turn, it was facing me when I turned about).  It appeared to be a Haze, like vapor between glass panes.  I stared at it for about 30secs before I suddenly believed it was a reflection off my contacts.  I turned walked about 2 steps before I stopped myself.  I Have never seen a contact reflection and the object didnt move with my eyes.  So I turned and walked back to it.  It was still right where it had been.  I decided to touch it. I had just started to move my hand twards it, when I suddenly thought how uniportant it was, turned walked home. Sat in a chair turned on the TV and just watched my normal shows for about 15 minutes, when I suddenly stood and remembered what I had just seen.  I had no explaination for why I had suddenly forgotten the object walked away and continued on like I hadn't observed it.  I kinda believed I must have daydreamed it. But in June of 87 I saw it again. I was biking home from a friends house, when I came to the SE corner of Sunset Poind rd. and N.Belcher Dr.   When I saw it again.  It was the same size, the same distance off the ground, and the same distance from the road approx 20ft from the NW corner of the intersection.  I crossed N. Belcher and the Sunset Point Road.  I had no sooner hit the NW corner of the intersection ( determined to find out once and for all what this thing was). The next thing I knew I was fleeing up Sunset Point Road.  I was in full tilt running for my life mode, Run was all I could think of. Then I stopped.  The fear just went away.  I was on Peppermill dr and Sunset point road, and I just sat there stunned.  I did not go back.  I went home. I have never seen the object since that day. I do not know why after 24 years Im now reporting this.  Its been on my mind alot lately, which is strange since I barely spared it a thought for 20+ years.  I have no doubts about the accuracy of the events, just the dates are approximations.

It rose from the trees behind us. The object was about 50-100 feet long and stayed just above tree level. The object was silent but periodically made a low pitched sound (like a low growling noise).  It slowly floated from the trees and stopped in front us. The object hovered above Lake Washington for 10-15 minutes and drifted across the lake (east towards the city of Bellevue).  It looked like a blimp, but the core of the object looked fluid (like yellow orange and red lava).  There was a reddish black square that hung just below the object. The object was so close, that it produced an orange hue over all of us.  I also felt static electricity. The object slowly changed shape and orientation.  At one point, it looked as the object was tearing into the sky itself (its hard to explain). There were many witnesses at the park at that time; including a Metro bus driver on the #2 route.

Upon finishing my meal I was just looking up at the sky at the partial moon in the blue sky.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  When I saw a red dot.  As my eyes focused in, I noticed there was a mixture of dots.  Three appeared to be red, four white and one semi green. These dots seemed to be very high in the sky.  They moved around in different directions.  Passing between each other going in different directions and forming straight lines and triangles. Towards the end of the experience they all totally disappeared at the same time.  Then after some scouring of the sky 4 or 5 reappeared  northwest of the original location. There is no way this could have been balloons, satellites or planes. They held the same location besides moving around each other for more than 10 minutes. This is the first time we have ever seen anything like this.  Whatever we saw seemed to have control of some kind, to be moving backwards and forwards and up and down. There is no way this could be weather related. My Wife Googled to see how we could tell someone about experience, because we felt compelled to let someone, because it was really weird.   While Googling we stumbled on a site that had a video on April 8 in Arizona which looked very similar to what we saw.   But theirs was at night and ours was during the day.  And you could distinctively see the three different colors. White, Green and Red.   Even with the sun going down we have never seen anything that appeared to be that high with such color.

It was partially cloudy and that was mainly to the south.  It was a bright -5.6M flare and just as one of the websites predicted, it was there at the location that the website said it would be and there was nothing else that was to follow.  (Link for the flare being viewed:  http://www.heavens-above.com/flaredetails.asp?SatID=25106&lat=42.886&lng=-78.879&alt=183&loc=Buffalo&TZ=EST&Date=40643.018484537&Mirror=1)   Polaris was becoming more visible at the time and other brighter stars were more visible.  After the flare took place I noticed a fuzzy object about 10 degrees (to the NW) away from the star Capella, which was to the west.   This was a pink-like (almost orange) object that appeared like a bright star with fuzziness then just faded away.   It was actually brighter (about -3 magnitude) than Capella, which made it most noticeable.   Unlike the satellite that created the iridium flare, which was moving, this object was stationary.  Since spotting this object the entire viewing was about fifteen seconds.  I am uncertain how long it was there prior to viewing the flare.   I do not know if this was a weather balloon or something else.  Many of the satellites I have seen do not last too long in view and move across the sky, this object did not move and faded out of site. I did have my Olympus DSLR camera at the time to photograph the flare, but I was not prepared for that object.  There was a brief moment where the maxing moon had a minor halo around it due to light clouds and may have caused the fuzziness around the object.   Why it disappeared is another thing.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,43.0109,-78.9574

Headed southeast, I saw a triangular configuration of red lights on the horizon.  The triangle formed by the lights was equilateral, and its apex pointed east.  The red lights did not flash, and although it was difficult to discern from my altitude, were hovering stationary above the west side of Berkeley. The lights were about twice the size of Venus, a prominent star this time of year, which was located to the east of the lights.  Nearby commercial planes moved above and below the configuration, and were roughly the same size as the red lights, but were white, as planes usually appear.  Using my fingers to measure, I estimated the sides of the triangle to be about 1 to 1 ½ inches in length between each red light.  The triangular configuration remained stationary for about three minutes, and then started moving east towards the Berkeley Hills.   I cannot estimate their speed, but I was driving on Euclid St. at 25 – 30 mph through a residential area, and the configuration was moving in and out of my purview rather quickly. As I continued further south, the red triangular configuration moved directly east across the horizon, losing altitude and then dropping behind the trees of the Berkeley Hills, near campus.  I stopped at Euclid and Hearst St. in an attempt to see where they had gone, but they were no longer visible.

It was a very odd looking rocket-like object that I thought might have been a meteor because the trajectory appeared slightly downward.  I quickly lost sight of it due to heavy tree coverage.

As I looked closer, they looked ""funny"" somehow.  They appeared to be tumbling as a group and I realized they were moving fast, too fast.  There was no breeze or wind on the ground.  Later I realized they would have been traveling against the wind since they were headed directly for the Pacific ocean. I grabbed my camera (a Canon T2i with a Tamron 300mm lens), ran outside and looked over the roof of my house where I estimated the object would have have reached by then, but I could not see it anywhere.  I was shocked by this.  I could not believe something so clearly visible could have simply disappeared in a cloudless clear blue sky.  I carefully searched the entire sky area but had to conclude it was gone!!  I then looked back to the East where I had first seen the object from inside my house--– closer to the horizon.  There it was again, apparently in the same position and traveling at the same speed and slowly tumbling. I got 2 clear pictures of the object as it crossed the sky in about 3 minutes.  My first view had been at an angle of about a 45 degrees.  I finally lost sight of it when it became too small a point to see in the West.   Looking at a map later I saw that it would have traveled slightly to the north of Los Angeles International Airport and then continued out over the ocean. Using Photoshop I zoomed the images of the object out to 300% and then cut and pasted them into one image next to each other for comparison.  You can see that the object is rotating.  One picture shows the appearance in the sky and the other is a closeup.   You can notice the interesting colors on the surface.

Rainier appearing & disappearing silverish object/ jet activity At approximately 9:00 AM on November 3, 2010 I was sitting on my deck enjoying my morning  cigarette.  It was sunny with no clouds.  I was facing Mount Rainier and my home is north of it. I noticed a silvery white object to the east of Mount Rainier.  As it was sunny, with no clouds, I noticed that it was the only thing in the sky.  As I looked at it I noticed that it had a shape somewhat rectangular, though I could not see a clear outline.  It’s possible that it was oval. It was too far away to discern the outline. As I watched, it disappeared for 5 or so seconds and then reappeared a little lower in the sky.  I thought it might be some sort of flat mylar balloon that could not be seen from my vantage point if it turned with the wind. I saw it for another 5 or so seconds before it disappeared a second time.  I watched for another 15 seconds or so and did not see it again, however, I noted a plume from a jet which was traveling west to east at high speed  above and slightly south of Mt. Rainier on a path that looked as though it was headed toward the area of the object I saw. I am submitting this in hopes that it might verify any reports that others might make concerning the object.  I was too far away to see it clearly or provide any detailed descriptions. I don’t think I would have noticed it if there had been a single other cloud in the sky, but cloudless days are unusual in this area and it made it noticeable. I am retired, female, grandmother.

The sky was very clear and the temperature was about 26-30 degrees F.  There were stars shining all over the sky.   Then suddenly, some type of craft located just to my left jetted off in a westerly direction leaving what appeared to be was a rocket blast from a space shuttle, or some type of rocket.  Then, while I was standing there in total shock another one jetted off from the exact same spot headed in a northerly direction.  The trail of rocket exhaust or smoke or whatever it was, lasted for approximately 100-750 yards and just stopped.  That exhaust or smoke was absolutely bright white against the dark background of the sky.  I did not see any vehicle emitting that exhaust or smoke.  I could hear the rush of the exhaust/smoke. Other than that, the night was perfectly quiet. It all happened so close to the ground. I was really in shock and awed.  Frankly, I was so afraid that I could not take a step. I felt dazed. My opinion is that at least two UFO vehicles were hovering in the field at approximately 1,500-3,000 feet, and when I drove up near that dark field with my headlights on they decided to move on.  They were probably even closer to the ground than 1,500-3,000 feet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was in a vehicle with three people other than myself, and they were taking me home.  That was when we saw a very intense bright white flashing in the sky off to the distance about a mile from my house. We decided to go investigate, because we thought it could have been something going on at the regional airport, because it was in that general direction. However, we later learned that it was no where near the airport, which was still a good six or seven miles away from the scene. We got closer to the lights, and we were parked on top of a hill. Looking down from the hill we saw one very large craft that hovered very low. It was hovering right above a series of houses, and appeared to be almost touching them.  We couldn't tell where the flashing was coming from, because it didn't appear to be coming from the craft.  The craft was long and oval.  From our vantage point, we saw four rather large bright yellow lights, each being the size of a house.  We couldn't mak! e out the craft at first, because it appeared to blend in with the night sky.  However, after looking at it for a few seconds we could make out the outlines of the craft, which I compare to trying to make out the outlines of the darker part of the moon against the night sky when the moon is either a ""new moon"" or a ""crescent moon.""   I can estimate the size being close to that of a house, because of the craft's close proximity to several houses.  We wanted to get closer to the craft, so we continued driving. We drove past a wooded area, where the flashing seemed to be coming from.  It appeared as if the flashing was coming from forty to fifty feet within the woods.  We tried to get closer, but took some wrong turns and ended up driving away from the scene.  When we turned around to go back the lights had stopped flashing and the craft was no where to be seen.  We then somehow got out of place and ended up about three or four miles east of where we were.  The details following our si! ghting are still a bit foggy for me.

Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed what I thought was a very low flying ""small air plane, or helocopter).  It was very overcast that night and I could see the outline of the large round object through the clouds.   At a second glance, I clearly saw the object's outline (perfectly round and bright white glow). There was light traffic traveling in both directions. I was surprised that the object was flying relatively close to the ground (approx. 300 feet off of the ground; not much higher than the street lights or the tree tops).   The object emmited a solid, bright white light and moved silently in a northwest direction at what speed I cannot say, but was able to keep pace with it and for 30 secs. and keep it in my sight out of the driver's side window.  I called the object to the attention of my passenger, so that I could get a second opinion ! of exactly what the object in question was.  The passenger could not identify with any certainty what the object was either.  I was not playing the radio, given our close proximity we couldn't hear its sound.  That fact surprised us both.   Since I live close to O'hara airport, I am used to hearing and seeing aircraft flying over head. We continued to watch the object until it was no longer in view, as I continued to drive (away from it).   Please know, I'm pretty skeptical about these sorts of things.

As the object passed from right to left the colour dimmed and then disappeared.  Moments later a commercial aircraft on the normal flight path into Glasgow Airport (Scotland) passed overhead.  Given that the two literally crisscrossed each other, I’d be amazed if the flight crew of the aircraft didn’t see the orange light I saw as it would have been passing left to right from their point of view. I stopped my vehicle and spoke to another car driver parked outside a shop.  I asked if he could see the light I’d seen, and he confirmed he had. I returned to my car and drove about 300-yards to my home and I then stood outside my home and looked to see if I could spot the light again.  Minutes later a light appeared , again going in a south to north direction.  Once again the light passed to my left (northwards) the light dimmed then disappeared. I waited for about five minutes, searching the sky from horizon to horizon and suddenly I saw two orange lights, one following the other some distance apart but both going in the same direction high in the sky, south to north (right to left from my viewpoint), again as they reached the left of me (north) the lights faded then dimmed to nothing. This fading convinces me that the light was shining at the front of the object and I could see no light from the rear of any of them. These lights made no noise I was aware of and the weather conditions were clear in a bright sky with no wind. I have no idea what I saw but I’m convinced these were not these floating Chinese lanterns I’ve read about recently, nor were they any recognisable aircraft. Help!!

This UFO was videoed by my colleague at work, and witnessed by his wife and him. The witnesses are both in their 30s and college educated professionals. The sighting occurred on Monday night, December 13, 2010 at around 10 p.m. Bangkok time. Location: Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand near the Mahidol University campus from their Crystal Place complex 6th floor apartment.  He was smoking a cigarette on their 6th floor balcony when he first noticed a bright light in the sky, which turned into a bright line. He first thought it was a star, then a satellite, and then an airplane, because it was multicolored and was more than just a point source. However, it hung in one place in the sky, so he called to his wife to come out and bring his video camera, because he wanted to use the telephoto zoom on the camera to enhance the image and try to explain the mystery of what they were witnessing. He mounted the camera on a tripod and used the camera's telephoto lens to zoom in on it to get a higher magnification. That was when they both noticed it was dancing very rapidly in snake-like or worm-like movements, but in the same place in the sky. They were looking toward the southern sky.  They actually saw 3 of these dancing lights but filmed only one of them. The light you first see in the video is a light on the side of their apartment building, which provi! des some reference to the angle of elevation.  He estimated it was perhaps 10,000 feet above the aircraft passing underneath on approach to Bangkok (BKK) Suvarnabhumi Airport, so the altitude might have been around 15,000 feet. The choppiness you see in the video is definitely part of the phenomenon, because the speed of the video is normal, not sped up or slowed down.  This can be verified by the audio comments they both made, which are quite interesting to listen to.  To the naked eye the UFO appeared like a bright light or line in the sky; only under telephoto magnification, with the camera mounted firmly on a tripod, were the strange worm-like maneuverings observable on the camcorder's digital display.  When we watched it for the first time in the office, Wednesday December 15th, one of our colleagues commented that it looked like the UFO was spelling out writing in the sky. It is strange and inexplicable that there appears to be a quarter-second pause between each ""dance"", which does make it look like a form of signaling.  Camera information: HDD JVC model GZ-MG750 800k pixel with 1.8x magnification high definition 43mm telephoto lens. Camera was on a tripod, so the motion is NOT due to hand movement of the camera (except at one short point when he moves the camera). It was videoed at normal cameraspeed. I can vouch that this is an authentic, untouched video with absolutely NO added special effects. What you are seeing in the video is not a star, planet, satellite, airplane, balloon, or any other prosaic explanation. It's a definite unknown! Report submitted by Donald A.

So after it did a full turn it disappeared immediately.it didn't run or move towards.just strafe.

As i began heading towards it, I noticed that this craft was below the treeline.  As soon as my headlights hit it it began to rise very slowly and the searchlight went off.   I stopped to see what it would do and it began to slowly move left and right still hovering approx. 25 to 30 feet off of the ground.  As it moved closer to me i noticed that there were several lights on the craft some singular and three linear banks of lights.  What was odd was that the lights were not the kind seen on conventional aircraft.  The single lights were very brite white and 2 of the banks were a very brite amber color, and the last bank of lights were both white and yellow and only the yellow lights oscillated.   Also, I noticed that the craft stayed situated exactly the same way as it rose from behind the trees and never moved faster than 2 or 3 mph for as long as I saw it.   A few things about this sighting did not seem to make since.  First, it was wintertime at almost 2 am and the weather was not condusive to flight.  It was like 10 degrees below 0 and the wind was blowing that nite from 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 60.   I stepped out of my car as it crossed the hood of my car and there were visible means of propulsion or any wings or fuselage for the lights to be attached to no wings or anything other than the lights, it was perfectly silent!   I lost sight of this craft as it slowly went over the house i was stopped in front of.  It was then that I realized that the lights on the craft were configured to look like a helicopter, but it was indeed ""ABSOLUTELY NOT"" a helicopter.   I went around the development to re-aquire this craft and never saw it again.   I meant to say there was NO visible means of propulsion! ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is not indicated by witness.

My encounter was long before my AF career, but I feel it is time to share it.  In the summer of 1990, a friend of mine and I camped out in my backyard.  I lived in Sterling, Massachusetts, on a five acre horse farm bordered by woods, a river and, behind a row of pine trees, the neighbor's yard.   We set up camp in a fenced-in enclosure where we had a tree, a swing set and a sand box.  Our tent was set up about 200 feet behind our house, under the tree.  It was a small, blue two-person tent the shape of a dome.  Behind our campsite was the horse paddock and to our west was a garden where we had grown vegetables throughout the warmer months.        We stayed up into the hours of darkness playing cards and telling stories.  Around 10pm we heard a loud bang in the woods.  It sounded as if someone hit a tree with a heavy wooden bat.  A few moments later, again. BAM.  And again...BAM.  It continued on banging for 10 minutes or so. Consistent and precise.  It was unnatural.   We were fenced in, and gladly so.  We had no intention of venturing into the woods to find out the cause of this sound.  As my friend and I discussed it, we considered the horses in the barn, kicking the walls of their stalls... or perhaps a loose door, slamming shut in the wind.  None of these explanations fully answered the situation, but our agreement that it was nothing threatening was comforting.       After the banging seemed to have ceased, my friend and I continued playing cards, talked and relaxed.  Suddenly, the side of the tent facing the west (and I'm getting those familiar chills and hairs on end as I type this)... lit up as bright as day.  My friend and I were in awe. We both looked up... looked at one another and looked back.  We couldn't see through the tent material, but this light was imposing.  There was no sound.  It was if the light came from the sun itself.   It was around 11 pm at night. There was no flicker to the light, there were no rings from a lamp or flashlight.  It was as if the hours had shifted and the brightness of the afternoon came half a day too soon.  It lasted a long time.  The light stayed, unmoving, never waning.  It was there for as long as twenty minutes.  Then it was gone.  No sound.  No wind or rush of air as if something large were moving nearby.   Almost immediately, from behind us, something pushed against the tent.  It was low to the ground... and it was slow, but steadfast.  We both saw it simultaneously.  My friend turned white and looked sick.  My only instinct was to protect my friend.  When he turned the color he did, I couldn't see any other answer...  I attacked whatever it was that was coming for us.  I grabbed my step-father's heavy duty flash light (the kind with four D batteries and a metal frame) and I wailed on whatever it was that was there.  It was a sickening sound of metal against bone.        I expected a shriek... a growl... anything.  There was no reply.  Nothing.  After I hit it, we froze.  We waited, holding our breath.  I don't know what he was thinking, but after hitting something as hard as I did, I half-expected something to rip our tent apart and tear into us.  Or scream and run away in pain.  Nothing happened.   A minute passed.  For the first time on that night, I opened up the zippered door to the tent and I looked outside.  I looked around the side of the tent where the thing I had hit approached us from.  Nothing.  Nothing within or outside of the fence that surrounded us.  No dead squirrel.  No midnight rapist with a broken hand.   And then I zipped up the tent.  We waited.  I fell asleep.   The next morning my friend had wide eyes.  He was sitting up looking down at me.  He said, ""It came back.  While you were sleeping, the light came back.""  It's hard to explain, but even I had a hard time believing him.  Just mere hours after sharing this experience with him, and for some reason I just didn't want to believe it was true.  The thought of the light on me while laying there asleep and helpless shook me more than seeing it did.   And that's what happened to me.   The other night, I had an epiphany.  If these 3 events are related... the banging, the light and the ""hand"" reaching through the tent, why?  My conclusion is this: First, the sound was meant to draw us out with curiosity.  Second, the light was to get us to scatter like cockroaches under a kitchen light.  Finally, the most brazen was the physical contact... touch.  They were using techniques that focused on fear and curiosity to lure or scare us out of the tent.  And they were using each of our most accessible senses.   My friend's father was in the Navy and moved to Naples, Italy later that year.  I have contacted him once on Facebook and asked if he remembered the incident.  Unfortunately for me, he didn't remember the incident.  There is a small sliver of hope... he did say he doesn't remember this experience but that he has a fascination with the paranormal... perhaps a lingering notion of some past experience guides him.

I and many members of my family have witnessed unusual looking aircraft.  When I was 9 years old while we were moving from Wears Valley to Gatlinburg my mom and 2 of my sisters was traveling in one of our automobiles ahead of my dad and myself in the moving truck, when right above us crossing the mountain about 500 foot above all of us were 3 circular shaped aircraft with multi colored lighting.   Then when I was 12 years old me and my nephew and niece were running home from a friends house a couple streets down from the street we were living at the time as we had stayed out after curfew, approximately 5 minutes from house to house, when a triangle shaped aircraft appeared just above the tree line over road and multi light beams were hitting everywhere and time seemed to slow way down or stopped as I remember we were running but not gaining ground.  We arrived home later than we should have and we escaped puni! shment for telling what had happened and my parents told us not to mention what happened to anyone.   Years past as they do and I went to work in supervisory positions at the main airport here near the Secret City. One night while I was relieved from duty at around midnight and after completing authorized paperwork at around 12:45 am I proceeded home, I noticed what seemed to be construction going on the second set of RR tracts I had to cross nightly going home, as I approached what I thought was a crane holding up a lighted tubular object with spheres on both ends over the tracks was in fact a very unusual aircraft, I stopped to look at this aircraft and began to get out of my car when it turned  toward me and I looked  straight at the pilot of the tubular shaped aircraft with sphere's on both ends and the cockpit was lit up as I saw the pilot clear as day, as I was approximately 50 feet from aircraft, he was as human as you and I Caucasian in color. He wore a black uniform ! with a black military or swat team type cap on his head, I did not exit vehicle as the pilot was smiling at me and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and the voice inside me said I should not have seen this aircraft and to leave as fast as possible.   I drove off and on straight-aways hit 70 to 90 mph. I had to turn left at a stop sign and then had to cross adjoining RR tracts to get to the road I live on at the time. I came to the road where I had to slow to turn right and something told me to stop and look to my right left, the aircraft had followed me almost to my home and was hovering in the cow pasture  were I was planning to turn right next to my home. I could not move I had to stay there and observe this aircraft, it then started moving backwards and at a tremendous amount of speed crossed the pasture and shot almost vertical into the clouds and from where I was sitting to the end of the pasture were it shot up took about 2 seconds and traveled about a mile. I had always thought if I was in a position to investigate an unidentified! flying aircraft I would do so, but I tell you until you are faced with the decision I was faced with at that time and the feelings that came across me, you cannot say you could have exited the car and tried to make contact. I have held many prestigious positions of authority and I have seen Black Helicopters’ with no markings in our mountain areas from the secret base, I have walked beside wild bears here, but I had never felt what I felt that night. The aircraft seemed to use a magnetic source to travel as it made no sounds while in operation, also given its shape it would have to use magnetic sources of travel. I was born with an I.Q. of 186 and I investigate everything someone tells me or I hear on the television, I am skeptical of almost everyone and what they are telling me and I advise everyone reading to do the same and not just believe what everyone says, as what you will learn from investigating what you see or hear will make you a much more productive person in o! ur society, I have found through my investigations what could ! not be r eal in most cases has been, and what seemed so simple turned out to be something more integral in design.",2011-03-10T00:00:00,35.702364150943396,-83.98648396226416

My son told me to stop to see some objects in the sky.  We turned easterly onto hwy 130 and stopped apprx. ¼ mile form jct of hwy 101.  We stopped and got out of the car and saw an object with lights front and back.  After a few moments I realized it was three separate objects flying in tight formation. The objects were appproximately 5 to 10 feet in diameter and flying at about 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The lead object was a bright star color and appeared to be slightly larger than the two rear objects. The rear objects had an orange tint.  None of the objects made a sound. The objects came from the west off the ocean and traveled easterly over the Nestucca Bay and began to travel east up the Little Nestucca river.  As the objects became almost parallel with us, one of the rear objects did a 90 degree turn and headed south at a faster rate of speed than before. The other rear object also turned 90 degrees, but headed straight for us in a northly direction.  After traveling apprx. 1/8th of a mile and was directly above us it did another 90 degree turn and headed back westerly toward the ocean.  This object maintained a constant speed of 5 to 10 mph. The rear object that had headed south  was now apprx. 1 mile away.  Suddenly it mad a huge arc easterly, then across the path of the lead object, and then westerly, stopping  on a dime apprx. 5 feet behind the object that was traveling apprx 5 to 10 mph  heading back toward the ocean. The object that made the large arc traveled at least 2 miles in apprx 2 seconds.  In other words 3,600 to 4,000 mph. The two orange tinted objects continued to toward the ocean at apprx 5 to 10 mph. As they approached a thick fog band along the ocean, I turned my attention to the lead object which was still traveling easterly at apprx 5 to 10 mph.  As I was watching it, My son yelled that he saw a huge orange explosion in the fog bank. It lasted just a brief moment and had no sound. As we again turned our attention to the lead object, it started suddenly flashing very bright lights from underneath.  These bright flashed occurred apprx every 15 or 20 seconds.  It almost appeared as though it were taking photos of the ground. As the object continued easterly up the Little Nestucca river canyon (hwy 130), we decided to drive over to the coast at Pacific City to see if the fog bank had cleared for a view of the orange objects  which were now out over the ocean.  After apprx 15 minutes of driving, we realized that the fog bank was to thick for any visuals.  We then drove back to  hwy 130 and up the river to see if we could catch up with the lead object.  At apprx 6 miles up the river,  we encountered the object still flying at apprx 5 to 10 mph and flashing a bright light from underneath every 15 or 20 seconds.  We followed the object another mile, then stopped our pursuit.  One other note: Within a minute of when the two orange tinted objects entered the fog bank, we could hear 2, maybe 3 fighters jets flying very low and roaring up the coast line from the south.  We thought they might be chasing the orange objects.  There are no air force bases anywhere near this location and people who live in the area almost never here jet fighters flying around, especially at very low elevations. These objects appeared to be able to fly from 5 mph to 4,000 mph instantly and make 90 degree turns at will.  I  honestly do not believe humans have the capability to construct  these type of flying machines. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I have not taken the opportunity to report this to any official agency only because of local redicule.  But anyway, here is my story. It was in the late evening and my wife worked the grave yard shift so my son and myself went out to start and gas up her vehicle.  As we stepped out of our apartment doorway we just happened to look off to our upper left at the sametime.  What we saw was unbelieveable.  What ever it was, it was quite huge according to my recollection.  This thing was partially cloaked.  The only way I can describe is when you would watch the Romulan spaceship on Star Trek cloak itself.  You can see almost right thru it, but at the same time you kno something is there.  This thing flew at a high rate of speed going from SE to NW with absolutely no sound at all.  Nothing. In the movie, Aliens vs Predator. There is a seen that reminded my son(now age 23) of that time.  Its the seen where the Antarctic Team is looking down the tunnel in the ice and all of a sudden the Predator spacecraft flies over head with no sound at all.  The duration of that particular seen was about the same duration as my son and I! 's encounter. I could safely say that this UFO was approxiamately a football field or two long.  As to the width. We could'nt tell only because of the angle we were at.  I felt stunned after what we saw.  I sent my boy to bed and decided that I should stay up late in case of any occurances.  I'm full blooded native american.  I have seen things that would turn alot of other folks' heads completely around.  This is one of those things that I'll remember for the rest of my life.

I was noticing the speed the plane appeared to be traveling and the direction as well as the cloud the plane was approaching. From overhead, about the same altitude of the cloud was a ball of fire but no trails as it traveled, just a ball of fire about 4 times the size of the plane, traveling about 5-6 times the speed of the plane.  The ball appeared to be metallic and made no sound.  This ball entered into the cloud about 1 mile ahead of the plane and did not come out the other side.  The plane entered the same cloud and passed through as if nothing happened.  I was amazed at what I had seen because I’ve never seen anything like that but what was truly the greatest part of the experience was when I looked over my left shoulder someone else had been watching the same thing and was shocked also by what they had seen.

Based on the surrounding hills, it appeared they might have been somewhere between the towns of Peshastin, WA and Cashmere, WA although if they were higher up or large, they might have been closer to Wenatchee, WA. The sighting was through a large, southeast facing bathroom window.  Being an extremely clear night, it was easy to distinguish the two objects, not only because of their orangish color, but also because they were considerably larger than the surrounding stars. Because it was night, we couldn't estimate the altitude or size of the orbs.  However, the objects appeared to be about 10 miles to our southeast and maybe several thousand feet above the ground but these observations are purely guesses. At first, each object appeared to be stationary.  Perhaps a minute later, one of the objects began to travel slowly towards the north or northwest, which would put it on a course to possibly travel over our house.  As it progressed, it also became visibly larger than it was initially, which would probably be the case if it was, in fact, headed our way. Once the object started moving our way, the second orb seemed to do an about face and headed in a southeast direction  for a few seconds, then appeared as if it headed toward the ground as if it were falling out of the sky.  We lost sight of it once it went below the hills surrounding our home. The object heading in our direction moved from the southeast to a point more directly overhead, approximately 60-75 degrees above the eastern horizon.  After about a minute or so, it appeared to stop and seemed as if it was perhaps only a mile or two away and several thousand feet above the ground. Again, the distances are strictly speculation. Since the remaining object was now much higher in the sky and closer to our home, I went outside for a better view.  The object was still glowing orange and remained stationary.  Suddenly, the object began to pulsate with a brilliant, white light.  It reminded me of a strobe light and was difficult to look at directly.  After maybe 5 seconds, the white light then faded back to the orange glow and then repeated itself perhaps two more times, each time emitting the same strobe-like white light. After the last strobe light episode, the orange glow of the orb grew larger, and then returned to its original size after about 4-5 seconds.   It then paused for around 5-10 seconds before glowing larger, and then returning to its original size.  The orb repeated this around 4 or 5 times and then slowly, over the course of maybe 15 seconds, faded away until there was nothing left to observe. There was no sound associated with the sighting which lasted approximately 10 minutes.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,47.8139,-120.86039999999998

At first we believed we were viewing a weapon, possibly a nuclear warhead, or some form of dangerous device, however it did not show trajectory like a rocket.. instead it simply hovered in the air, not moving, nor emitting any sound. After staring at the object less than a minute, it rapidly accelerated to the west in a very unnatural manner, and faded from view in three very distinct phases.  The fading was not natural or progressive, instead sudden with 3 steps of brilliance, each lower than the last, leading us to believe that it was not a rocket burning up the remaining fuel in a gradual manner, a firework, or any natural or man made object fading from the night's sky.

I was located in Spokane Valley, WA and, I was looking directly above me when my sighting took place and the angle of elevation was 90 degrees.  I witnessed approximately 40 or more brightly lit objects/orbs of orange and reddish light in a formation/straight line above me moving east very quickly.  The objects themselves were in motion as they maintained the line formation, and they appeared to move in front of each other and around each other.  Formation then changed shape from a line to a V.  Objects appeared to be the same size as the stars and appeared to be at a high altitude based on my observations. A closed fist at arm’s length when the formation/cluster was directly above me covered about 1/10th of the formation.  The cluster of objects was very large across the sky.  No other witnesses were present at time of sighting, and objects made no noise whatsoever as they went overhead from west to east.  Objects then changed shape into a V formation, and then disappeared from view to the east after about ten seconds.  Speed of objects was very fast, covering the sky and off to the east in seconds.  Speed of the objects was constant the whole time.  It was almost hard to follow them because of the speed.  I have been an amateur meteorologist for about 15 years and I watch the sky daily and observe weather conditions and aircraft all the time from my residence.  I can say with much certainty that the objects I witnessed were not any known aircraft, stars or planets.  This was in the lower atmosphere and seemed very unusual to me.

The evening of Monday, August 9th, I was walking my dog along our regular route, which I have walked for many years. It was approx 10 PM.  I was walking southbound along a small creek.  It was a hot, humid night, clear dark sky, no moon that I could see. To my left, eastward, an object came into view over the treetops.  For a second, I thought it was a full, orange, harvest moon.  It was about the size of a large full moon in the sky and glowed orange. It took me a second to realize that the object was moving, travelling east to west.   I then thought it had to be a meteor. However, this object did not streak or fall, nor did it have a trail. I stood there gaping at it as it passed directly overhead; when it was directly above me the orange glow became an orange ""halo"" around what i could see was an object with rounded edges.  It appeared to be maybe 3500-4000 up; was completely silent, and travelled somewhat faster than an airplane,  While directly above, the object appeared about ""dime size"" in the sky. I watched the glowing fireball object as it continued west, until it was just a dot in the sky, and then i couldn't see it anymore.  The entire event was about 30-40 seconds in duration.  I was completely mind-boggled;  I literally could not believe my eyes.  I did snap a couple pics with my phone camera after it had passed overhead, but the object appears much smaller and further away than it actually was.  I'm not a photographer; didn't think to use the video camera feature, did not even think to zoom in. I called the local Airport Authority the following day and asked if this could have been a weather balloon, or if anyone else had reported seeing this weird glowing thing in the sky.  I was advised they had no reports; also that it would not have been a weather ballon. I'm completely at a loss as to what it could have been.  Googling since then, i have learned that these ""fireball"" sightings are common recently!  I can attest that the one i saw was not a ""ball"" as when it passed directly overtop of me I could see that it was most definitely not lit up or glowing from the bottom.

I looked at the object through 24x binocular and found out that I was not able to recognize – a circle with a smaller circle in the middle (like a hole in the middle of parachute) covered with small bright lights (from 20 to 40 lights) that were slowly moving, so the shape of object was instantly and slowly changing. It looked slow fluctuations or as jelly fish moves – I don’t insist that these moves were real – they may be explained by thermal airflows or small moves of binocular in hands.

The object stayed in same position for about 10 minutes,then moved west for a few minutes slowly, then just vanished. There were some clouds in sky last night but not near object at the time. It definitely was not an airplane or helicopter. Ive lived near airport my whole life and have seen thousands of planes before and this was way to bright and big to even come close to compare it to. The object pulsated a few times even brighter, it changed colors like a star twinkling in sky, I looked through my binoculars also and can distinctively see it changing all different colors, red, blue, green, yellow, but at the same time it always had a bright white light coming from it continually. I also took a s! hort video of it from my camera, it doesn't have a good zoom on it, but you can definitely see how bright it was in comparison to the street lights in video. I will transfer video when I  get home. I also checked the reports of ufo sightings and someone else posted about same object, but at different time. I was really excited to see that other people seen this also!! I hope more reports come in and.ill be ready with a better camera if it comes back.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,41.931,-88.009

On December 15, 2010 at approximately 9:20pm I was outside enjoying the cool evening and waiting for my oldest son to drive in from school. About ¼ mile from my house is a local high school.  The stadium lights were on since there was a soccer match being played.  I was looking south in the direction of the school when I noticed a fairly large light to my right about 1 mile away heading from west to east. It was on a track that would take it between my house and the school. At first I thought it was a plane but then I realized it was far too low. Then I thought it may have been a helicopter but as I continued to watch this light I noticed that there was no sound at all coming from the direction of the light. The light continued to move in an easterly direction at an amazingly slow speed. As it neared my location I could tell that it wasn’t just a single light. It was an enormous v shaped ! object with 3 almost blindingly bright lights on the under side of each “wing”. This object passed slowly between my location and the school at an altitude of less than 1000 feet. It continued moving east until it got just passed my location. As I was watching this object it simply vanished. Literally in the blink of an eye it was gone. The next morning as I was dropping my youngest son off at school I was stopped by the religion instructor who is a friend of mine. He excitedly began to tell me about the object he had seen the night before. His sighting lasted considerably longer than mine. He was driving back from a function when he saw this object. When he first saw the object it was moving very slowly in a southerly direction at less than 1000 feet. He watched the object for several minutes until it simply vanished. Within just a couple of seconds it reappeared at a distance my friend estimated to be at least 1 ½ miles away. My friend drove toward the object’s new locati! on and actually got to a point where he was nearly directly un! der this object. He confirmed that it had 3 lights under each wing and that it was an enormous v shaped craft. He also confirmed that it was completely silent. He continued to watch the object moving now in a westerly direction for another 30 seconds until the thing vanished again. That was the last time he saw it. My friend later learned that at least 10 kids who are students at the school also saw this thing.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,30.5335,-92.11511363636363

All of a sudden I heard what sounded like a low, deep hum of what I thought was a cessna sitting on a runway just running the engine. I kept watching to the north where it was coming from. After about 10-15 seconds, two bright white lights appeared over the top of the next building, and heading towards over my building heading south. It appeared to be at about 500 feet above. I watched it was my jaw dropped. I was not scared of it, and in fact felt really comfortable, and even peace.  As it slowly, but continuously floated overhead, I noticed that it was a triangle!  The front was like two ""headlights"". They were in the front of it, not below it. And as it was right above me, I noticed the back of the craft (triangle) had a light at that end also.  There were no lights underneath it.  The lights were reflecting the undercarriage where I noticed that it appeared to be a whitish-grey color.  I noticed some detail on it's belly like what looked like a long pipe running up one of the sides of the belly.  It didn't stop, or use any kind of spot lights. It just kept moving south until it moved completly over my building, and out of my sight. The total amount of time that passed from start to finish was about two minutes.  I looked at the clock as soon as I couldn't see it anymore, and it said 11:00pm California time.  After that, I couldn't get to sleep so I just laid in bed.   At about 12:15am, I heard that same exact sound again, and just laid there. I didn't know whether to get up and go look, or stay in bed where it was warm... I stayed in bed and now regret it.  I heard it for 15 minutes before it slowly got quieter, then complete silence.  I wish I had not made the decision to stay in bed.  What if this really was a UFO? That was a one-in-a-million chance. Nearby, there is Mountain View, CA where there used to be a NASA base. However, they do not test anything there. Up in the nearby Santa Cruz mountains, there is a secret military base where only God knows what goes on. There was nothing in the sky before the sighting, and nothing after.

I have been spending time in the vicinity of Lincoln City, Oregon, six miles inland along the Salmon River in late 2010.   Living near the coast or in major cities for many years I had not had the opportunity to view the stars in a long while.  However in this late October of 2010 the skies there were crystal clear though not as good as in the desert.  I decided to sky-watch specifically for satellites  but also to see how much college astronomy I could remember which, I'm sorry to say turned out to be mostly forgotten.   It was perhaps 10 PM in the third week of October.  It took a few minutes to sight the first moving object and I was surprised that there seemed to be so few considering how many now exist. As I was following one with my eyes it suddenly veered off at an odd angle and sped away!  Okay, I haven't kept up with the technology so I thought that maybe they do that now instead of being tied to a specific course.   At the same time I was trying to identify constellations and noted a formation of perhaps eight stars in the low Northeast.  I was curious about this as I had viewed this direction before when the sky was not as clear and these had not been visible though they were as bright as the brightest in the sky.  Strangely, they all had equal brilliance.  Not being too concerned I looked away to again search for satellites and then saw from the corner of my eye a flash from where I had sighted this unknown constellation.  I quickly looked back and didn't notice a change and thought it may have been a farm building's house light that I knew to be in that direction. I looked away again and AGAIN  I saw a definite flash from that direction and turned back.  Now I was certain that at least one of the bright starts was gone.  Before I could digest that and while looking directly at them ANOTHER of them ""flared"" to roughly ten times its brilliance, sort of like a Nova and just vanished.  Momentarily another flared and also disappeared.  Another five did this in succession, flared, then were gone. Naturally, I tried to rationalize this event thinking that maybe there were some kind of booster rockets on them.  I know that some satellites appear stationary but I have never seen any that were white in color (Most I have seen appeared a kind of red, I assume because they are reflecting the sun from their position so high above the planet).   Now the entire ""constellation"" of eight stars was gone!  I continued to scan the skies all around and again saw several more high altitude smaller red moving dots some of whom took off at different angles, including AWAY from earth and at high speed.  There were some red moving dots sighted that did not act in this way,as I had expected. This all took place in about twenty minutes when I gave up and returned inside perplexed.  The following days I asked others their opinion as to whether modern satellites could or would maneuver in this way.  No one I spoke to thought that possible especially the very bright white ones the size of major stars. Having seen aerial phenomenon a number of times in my life and not being a skeptic on the subject, I didn't give it much more thought.  I have had far better sightings one of which I reported in the past and two more that I need to chronicle for Peter and any investigators. One thing that I did notice when I looked at the recent sighting reports for on this site is that in the same week there are listed two or three similar reports made in the Pacific Northwest.",2011-05-29T00:00:00,45.0038,-123.8973

I swear on all my grandparent's graves at what I saw.  May god strike me down if I am lying. I was walking southward that evening down my steps in my backyard, didn't see anything odd, but felt compelled to look up.  Right when I looked up, above me, saw a huge, giant glowing rectangle above me very high up, perhaps stratosphere, no clouds.  Hard to say how huge but, I think it was very, very high up, seemingly as high as the stars, but I think stratosphere.  Massive, at my sight, from my perspective, at it that high up it was 3 or 4in long and 2in tall. Object was itself bright and glowing, not sending light out, but itself only, no reflective light, as if it were some energy light.  It was 3/4 left side fluorescent white, glowing and fluorecent blue 1/4 on right side, perfectly, vertically seperated by a line of both colors glowing as one.  Hard to explain.  It flashed brightly, and disappeared, then in a fraction of a second before I could think about what I was seeing, it reappeared to the left, or south, about 6feet from my perspective, but obvioulsy quite a far distance that far up. I yelled to a friend to come out and see, I wanted to tell him to grab the camera, but didn't want him to miss it. In the interim, it flashed again, and again, reappeared to the left of it's position as it was moving southward.  Just before my friend arrived at the outside door, it then flashed again, dissapeared and then a giant sphere of fluoresecent white light, brighter than the moon (which I could not see that night, tall redwoods around me), brighter and bigger than anything I have ever seen, other than the moon, in the night sky appeared almost like a super nova, glowed brightly and then shot off like a bullet to the west, over Big Basin State Park, flying above hwy 236.  The rectangle had gone, it seemed as if it became the sphere after it flashed the third time.   My friend missed the whole thing, a very short period of time elapsed, but much happened.

Dear Sir or Madam:   I own a salon in the Uptown District of Lake Havasu City, AZ.  On April 14, 2011, I was leaving work about 8 pm.  I had called my husband with my cell phone and had him on speaker so he could  ""walk"" me to my car.  It was already dark outside and my car is parked in the rear parking lot of my business. As I was walking south towards my car, I noticed that the school located across the street had its field lit up.  Directly above the glow of those lights above the field, there was a formation that looked at first like birds when they are in the V pattern.  As it got closer it grew brighter & brighter until I realized those weren’t birds, but lights in a very distinct V flying directly overhead, just slightly east of where I was standing.  I remember 2 rows of 4 lights (7 total).  I was shouting on the phone for my husband to run outside and go up onto our deck to try to see what I was seeing.  I remember there was no sound whatsoever.  I was shaking, as I could not believe my eyes.  The entire experience lasted approximately one minute from the time I saw it come into view, fly across & vanish. As it went further towards the north towards Vegas, it simply vanished one light at a time.  My husband was still on the phone with me and both he and my son were up on the deck looking for what I had just witnessed.  They saw nothing.  I have no idea if anyone else in Lake Havasu saw what I saw too. I was so shaken up by the event that I forgot to load my laundry hamper into the back of my car and drove off without it.  I immediately called my mother and told her about it on my way home.  I didn’t really know what to do or who to report it to until I did a little more investigating on the Internet today. I hope this information helps in some way.",2011-05-29T00:00:00,34.506735795454546,-114.29056420454545

It appeared to just be a white orb from the distance I was viewing from although could have had a more physical nature if seen from closer I presume. I watched the object for about 20 seconds then pointed it out to a friend I was driving with.  Who at first said he thought it was a plane. I said look again, does that look like a plane?  Is it moving?  What shape is it?   He proceeded to say what the hell is that thing? We both just stared at it for as long as we could while driving up this strait road but there were large pine type trees that obscured our view of the object for about 7 seconds.  Immediately after passing the point where it would be obscured, the object was gone.. vanished. I did not see it fly away or land or anything it was just gone.  From where this thing was and the clear nature of the sky there is no way if it was a plane or helicopter that it could of flown far enough that I could not see it.

One night i went out for a walk and as i was walking i noticed that  a street light which was usually the only light to be found for a ways, had a second light floating above it, a single sort of vertical oval shaped light, maybe 5-6 feet above it, unmoving, a bright but hazy white/orange light, after watching it for about a minute i continued with my walk and shortly turned around and walked home and took notice that the light was still there.  The next day in bright sunshine i walked down to the streetlight to check it out and there was nothing above the streetlight or in the vicinity that would create any kind of light. A few weeks later i went out for another late night walk ( as was my fashion)  as upon returning my eye was drawn to the open access point of the lake my house was on, i had barely  stepped near it when i saw very clearly 3 fairly large horizontal oval lights, 2 white, one orangish/red, spaced about 3 feet away from each other hovering above my lake just above the tree line, i stopped out of curiosity trying to listen for the sound of a plane  but heard only a very soft, very low whooshing-like pulsing, i tried to think of any and all possible explanations besides the one i am reporting now, but i didn't live near any towers, tall buildings, power stations or water towers, i heard no sound of planes or helicopters and the lights weren't moving, and they were very clearly just above my lake which has no means of supporting any kind of light. My immediate thought was "" go inside and get the camera"" but I was mesmerized by its strangeness and also a little afraid, and I worried that the lights might disappear by the time I came back to the spot. I watched the lights for about 5 minutes, and they never seemed to move, and as I watched the light farthest on the right which was white and the middle light which was orange/red changed, and now the far right was orange/red and the middle was white. I dont know why but i was suddenly frightened, thinking of all the silly movies id seen, and i felt like the lights were watching me as well, i grew rather anxious and decided to quickly walk home, as i was doing so i kept looking behind me back at the lights, at which point i realized they HAD been moving because they were now higher above the treetops then they had been before, they had just been moving too slowly for me to notice.  I reached home and firmly locked the door behind me and drew all the curtains to appease my own uneasiness. The next day I returned to the spot and saw no sign of the lights.

The exact date might be a bit different i forget what years i worked for the company i could find out when exactly what year it was but i was working as a bat specialist and traveling out to a job on the highway late at night, in mid-summer, in a truch with a hatchback with the guy i worked for ben when to the left of the vehicle while we were listening to some books on tape i saw a yellow orb, it was moving forward in a bowling motion like pendulem back and forth. I thought i was halucinating then checked my eyes and looked again and it was still there penduluming back and forth moving forward west like we were but slower, i said to ben ""look a ufo a ufo a yellow ball like thing in the sky look"" but he refused and was the one driving and i persisted ""look look their is a yellow orb in the sky moving back and forth moving forward"" but he refused to look he didn't really think much of my opinions. I never really thought to report it for what can they do and w! e out drove it  and it wasn't able to be seen, i forsure saw for quite a few minutes this yellow orb and have fathomed my own opinion on it. I was just watching a show on ufo's and thought a real report as to how this one was moving or whatever could help since they were going through reports. I can or could take a lie detector on seeing this thing mutiple ones actually and this was the only time while traveling or ever that i saw one, and i really saw it, under just the classification a yellow orb, it was to me looking like a orb like i fathomed a being being in it but it radiated light like it wasn't a craft. It was an orb of like energy, i fathomed that a being could be in it some how super powered and uses like an energy orb to protect it in space, or possibly a supernaturally powered being that is supernaturally activated. Like seriously the powers like flying beings experince in dreams your telling me none ever became supernaturally powered since the dinosaures. My pr! icipal is that to gain the superpowers you have in your dreams! like fl ying you have to be who you are in your dreams, the same ways not thinking about food or drinking since if we talk stricly good and evil it is evil to harm or kill an innocent being and we subconciously recognise that since plants are innocent beings especially seed that get eaten that is evil to eat a baby being. But in anycase you can tell i am making my way to the truly good line of life and not harming any of the innocent plants or animals, and i feel i may have been contacted with how slow it was going for a reason, who ever they are with how much death of innocent beings there is i have an idea we will be hearing from them, they may be really holy beings that don't eat anything at all and just take water and why they appear as orbs of light is they have gone fusion like the sun with the water in them some type of special fusion from being really holy, and who knows what type of being it could be , maybe one from a group a species that became immortalized and supernatur! ally powered enough to travel space flying and some stayed behind. ANyways as for profacies i feel the days are upon us and we will be hearing more from them, there will be leaders that stand up agist evil strickly like how the baby plant is an innocent baby and it is evil to kill it and stand up for all life and posiibly become supernaturally powered. oh i forgot i did have one other contact. i was at my house and one night i saw this white light jumping from tree to tree and heard abnormal sounds coming from the woods, there are woods off the back of my house at n6c 1x3 and it made a weird eching sound and it looked at one second like a white light body of this baby human that may be wild but looked like a ball baby sized of white light and it scared me it seemed very fast and the weird sound scared me and i can take a lie detector on either of these occurances, it dissapeared and i th saw the light reappear deeper in the woods, i was scared for i know its wrong to smoke ! and i thought it might be a being like made some of the shallo! w crater s on the moon that are wide for such shallowness from fushion meditation and i was smoking and i could heard the leaves move and then their was a creak from the fence like something was bhinde it , and it had been moving between treees in front of me, and that dissapearing move i thought it might have locked on to it's reappearpoint and was going to attack me for harming the one year old plants leaves when i should be holy for the planet then it made a sound and did the dissapppearing move and i heard another sound from behind the fence  and i pretty much ran in but as far as sky ufo's that yellow orb thing was the only time but this white light being or glowing being i saw a few times. i think it might be a holy protector of the planet i think that came to contact me to help my life. i saw it a few differernt days, it was white like lightening enery. I wasn't even thinking of that i had comppletely forgot, but i was thinking it some enlightened animal and it wasn't a sky uf! o but i am not lieing and i wrote this just like this you got the second on me remembering it's been like a year or more since then so i dunno how i forgot but i was thinking of just that sky ufo i had seen anyways if this helps you then good.

We camped that night in a remote, isloated area south of the crater (38-22.281N, 116-01.821W). The evening was brisk and uneventful, after a short recon hike and a light supper we retired. Around 0230 I felt an unnerving sensation that awakened me.  I felt this pass thru the camper, and myself, as if I were being scanned, accompanying this was a low pulsating sound, a hum that increased and decreased as it passed by and thru.,  As this was happening, I awoke my friend who experienced likewise this event.  Alarmed and cautious, we did not venture out, thinking it might return.  The next morning nothing appeared different, except we both became very irritated, and quit talking, we followed a set of way points to Highway 375, we stopped at Rachel, but were unable to enjoy  what is usually a fun stop.  It took several days for the gloom to lift.   After dicussing this event, we both feel as though a shift in our consciousness occurred. I'm sorry for the belated report, it seemed very surreal, but for this to have happened and for two people to suddenly be at odds, when they usually get along very well seems uncharacteristic at the very least.   Also please note the time frames are open I'm not sure how long this event took place--but I am sure it happened.

I was driving home through New Albany, a city I lived in and know well and was crossing a well travelled intersection one night. I had the windows to my Jeep down because my air conditioner needed to be charged.  I was sober and 19 years old.  I was going to university in the city and I went to see a relative.  I left her house by myself on a very cool night.  It was breezy and balmy so having the windows down felt good. It may have stormed.  I drove my Jeep through New Albany and ended up driving north on Silver St. at around 9:00pm that night and came to the intersection of Ekin Ave.  I came to a stop and found the two red flashing “STOP” lights working as usual that night except there were more this time.  More lights. I slowed down because I was so engaged with what was rows of lights that dove so low over that intersection, after this craft slid over my head, the small one story houses and their trees ended up hiding them.  It was semi quiet and LOW. Very low.! Nobody else was around and I drove on Ekin, following in my Jeep and the craft flew over a bank of trees southeast, in front of a home no less, when I assume it headed for the river.  I couldn’t drive as fast as I’d have liked but I tried to catch up and couldn’t.  I called 911 in two counties and asked if they had gotten any calls, they had nothing and told me to call the airport.  The airport hadn’t heard or seen anything but I know what I saw.  I think I even called the news station.  They took my story but didn’t care. I made a point to exhaust all avenues but no one else saw it.  The sky at the intersection that night was dark and it was breezy.  Pulling up to the STOP became something else entirely.  These lights were bulbs (?) of some sort and they lined the bottom side of the craft.  As the craft flew over the intersection of Silver St. and Ekin Ave. its underbelly was flat with three red orbs as lights or something else?  I pulled up and noticed the craft as I stopped and s! lowed to a halt as I looked at it cross over my head and down ! Ekin Ave nue.  That is when I began trying to follow it. It was probably headed to Ft. Knox.  When I say “craft?  I assume it was all attached. It was above me and moving but the lights seemed anchored somehow.  Positioned.  There were no aircraft in the sky and if there were they wouldn't be that low.  When I called the airport I told them it flew ""as the low as the treetops"" when they said they had heard nothing.  The airway into Louisville goes over the city.  This 40ft(?) craft was over New Albany, IN, headed southeast down the river.  Towards someplace else.

While on lunch break from a local computer school, I headed to a local park to eat and call my wife. It was a bright sunny day, about 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and about 12:20 PM. I stepped outside of my SUV and was getting ready to use my cell phone, when something shiny or flashing caught my eye up in the sky. When I looked up, I saw what looked like something metallic reflecting the light of the sun – or so I initially thought – so I assumed it must be an airplane. I waited a few seconds to see the shape of the airplane come though as moved across the sky, but that didn’t happen. As I looked at it, it appeared to just be a metallic, spherical shape, but what I thought was the reflection of the sun shinning off it’s surface, turned out to be a constant flashing light emanating from what appeared to be the center area of the object. The object was traveling in an eastward to westward direction, relatively in a parallel path along the San Bernardino Mountains, but a couple of miles away from them. It also appeared to be at a somewhat lower altitude than what I’ve seen commercial passenger airliners fly at, and probably more likely at an altitude similar to what I’ve seen the smaller Cessna type airplanes at.  It was above the background view of the mountains, which means it was silhouetted against a clear cloudless blue sky. I would also guess it was traveling at a speed similar to what I’ve seen airplanes fly at, so I would guess 200-400 mph, but it would be hard for me to guess more accurately. So as I realized that it did not look like an airplane, or that the shape didn’t “change” as it flew from the east to the west to reveal any other part of the vehicle, I started to think that perhaps it actually was an Unidentified flying object – at least I couldn’t say what it was. For the entire duration of the sighing, which maybe lasted 30 seconds as it flew out of distance in the west, the shape visible to me was only a bright silvery metallic spherical one.  But the most outstanding feature of it was – upon later reflection – the bright flashing light that emanated seemingly from the center of the craft. It was very bright, as to be seen very brightly, even in the middle of this clear sunny day at noon. It flashed maybe one to one and a half times a second approximately, and it was completely constant, as you would expect to see from the lights on an airplane for instance. In this case though, the flashing light was big and bright enough, that from my perspective, when it flashed, you could not see any of the craft through or behind the flashing light. If I were to guess, I’d say the object was maybe a mile away, and about 30-50 feet diameter, but it’s very hard to say, and I could be off by quite a bit. Also, I heard no noise coming from the object, but I was not close enough to hear anything unless it had been very loud. As the object was disappearing in the distance, maybe 5 miles away to the west over perhaps the neighboring town of Clairmont or perhaps already La Verne, I could still see the flashing very bright, even though the object itself was hardly even visible any more. As it disappeared completely, the flashing was still visible, though just faintly now, and then that too disappeared in the distance. The whole time the vehicle did not seem to slow down or accelerate, or deviate off of a perfectly straight course. What really put it in perspective, as to the fact that the object was in fact about that size, altitude, and shape, is that as it was disappearing out of sight, a passenger airliner was going from a south to north direction, presumably taking off from the neighboring Ontario International Airport. The airliner was a little higher up, but the shape was unmistakable as that of an airplane, even though it was farther and higher than the sphere had been when it had been closer to me. And there were no visible lights flashing from the airliner, even though I believe they keep their wing lights on, but in any case, no lights were visible in the bright sunny day, and no reflections at all were seen bouncing off of the airplane or anything like that. The shape was unmistakable as that of an airplane, from the time it first came into view, until it went out of sight in a northward direction. After about 2 minutes or 3, after both the spherical object, and the airliner went out of view, another airplane crossed over to the west, going from a more or less southeast direction to a northwest one. This airplane was traveling at what I assume is standard commercial jetliner elevation, since it seemed pretty high up, but again, the shape of it as being of an airplane, was unmistakable, and no light or reflections coming from it. It was only as I put all of those things together, that afterwards I was pretty convinced that I had seen something very unique and quite possibly a UFO.  And I mean “UFO” in the truest sense, because it was truly unidentifiable to me, and it was flying.  It could be some military craft, or yes, I guess what people typically call a “UFO” – a craft from other than our time / space / or dimension.   Whatever it was, it was absolutely not a conventional airplane, or helicopter, or whether balloon, or cloud, or falling satellite.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,34.1139813229572,-117.66207081712062

Approximately 7:55 pm I was driving on Natural Well Road in Williamsport, Md. A a semi-rural part of Washington County. I noticed two bright white lights a few hundred feet in the air over a cornfield. At first I thought the lights were headlights on a low flying airplane. They were spaced 50 feet or so apart. I also noticed a smaller red blinking light in between the two white lights that appeared to blink in different places, moving left and right. After watching it for a minute it never appeared to move. I then thought maybe it was lights on a tower but I drive by this field often and I never noticed a tower or lights. I drove by it very slow. It was approximately 300 yards from me. The road wraps around the field so I saw the lights from several angles. They never moved with the exception of the blinking red light. I got to the end of the road and the light weren't visible any more from where I was at. I decided to circle around and have another look. It! took me 5 or 6 minutes to get back around to where I saw the lights and I couldn't find them. After a minute of searching I saw them further away and faint in the distance. Probably 1000 yards or more away. I called my girlfriend and told her that I was chasing lights. I came to the end of Natural Well Road and I turned left onto Falling Waters Road. I drove for 20 seconds or so when I saw two bright lights just above the trees. shining through the tree limbs like headlights in the sky just in front of me. I was still on the phone explaining to my girlfriend what I was seeing. I was driving slow as the road curved around a country church to my left. I noticed two men standing outside of the church but they seemed to be oblivious to the lights above. Just above and behind the church I could see the two white light. I followed the road around. Behind the church was a line of trees that opened up into a small field- actually a large yard to a house nearby. Just beside the lin! e of trees is where I had a close encounter with something. To! the lef t of my car approximately 30 feet and at the top of the trees approximately 40 feet in the air I saw what appeared to be something hovering. Attached were 4 lights. One on each point of the object. There was also a red blinking light somewhere on the object. The object made no sound but it was floating and it actually tilted forward toward me allowing me to see it's diamond shape. It was dark so it was difficult to tell if there were four points or three, it may have been triangle shape but it had four white lights and a red blinking light. At one point I thought I saw a small purple light and a green light. The object seemed to tilt forward and then all the way on it's side. It moved like a feather floating on the wind. I was still on the phone with my girlfriend. When I realized what I was actually seeing I told her ""Oh my God. It's a triangle...it has four lights..it's a UFO babe!"" I told her that I was certain that I was witnessing a space craft. At that point I lost cel! l phone service with her.I was terrified! I continued to drive away very slowly while trying to redial her number. I got a busy signal so I tried again. I got her voicemail, then I tried again. Finally I reconnected the whole time I was too frightened to look out the window to see where the craft was. I drove for a minute or two longer and the road came to a dead end. I turned the car around fearing that I had to drive back from where I spotted the object. Slowly I drove back scanning the sky for lights. I drove right to where I had the encounter and there was nothing there. The lights were gone. I was shaking and still scared but I looked around for a few second and could find nothing of what I just saw.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,39.5791,-77.824

On Friday, November 5, 2010, I was walking my dog in a neighborhood park called ""Kanemoto"" in Longmont, Colorado. I let my dog loose to run around. It was just about 8:15 pm. I had noted earlier that it was a particularly clear night, and paused in the park to observe the sky. I was looking at a bright light in the southern sky, trying to determine what planet it was. Suddenly, five points of light in a v-formation appeared to my left, which was to the south-east. I was surprised because I had been observing the area for some time, and there was no incremental appearance of these lights.  Suddenly, they were just there. There was one light leading, with two on either side, making a ""v"".  As it passed over the stars, I could interpolate certain features. Like I said, it was v-shaped, with the wings angled so that the inside length of the ""v"" were slightly longer than the outside.  The lights were quite dim, which was unusual.  Planes usual advertise their presence. The running lights, if that’s what they were, looked dim, but quite distinct.  The entire time I was watching this object, I tried to find some sort of reason for it, but nothing quite fit. As it passed over, there was no noise whatsoever.  I waited for the sounds of a jet-wake, but there was none. There was also a ""smoothness"" and certainty to the motion that I had never seen before.  It passed from the southeast to the northwest, going from over my position to the trees and hori! zon in a matter of about 10 seconds. I judged the craft to be a little larger than a fighter jet, cruising at about 1,000-2000 ft.  At that height, the craft had to be moving very swiftly.  If it was larger and higher, it was moving at incredible speeds.  There were no alterations in altitude.  My first thought was that it was a glider with unusual lighting, but its shape, rapidity, and lack of deviation, made me dismiss that theory. Note:  At the trajectory that I saw this object, it should have flown slightly to the southwest of the Air Control center in Longmont.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,40.1703733197556,-105.08544969450101

I called my husband who was sleeping and when he came to the object has moved slightly to the right.  The lights are still getting stronger,   And my husband was in the garage to get the binoculars the object as it moved upward.  Not hear any sound, but it moved with the lightness that I love. It seemed a pity flying.   When my husband came with the binoculars I saw something that was not here on earth.  Nothing I've ever seen with my eyes. I was about 4 to 6 miles away from my window and loudly.  Had a disc format and the lights were only on the bottom of it.  Unfortunately began to blow and the clouds hid the object.

As I was walking west maybe half a mile from my home, I noticed two lights maneuvering around in the sky in the west.  They seemed to be over the city of Lehi and near the Oquirrh Mountains.  I stood and watched them for a minute or two.  They're maneuvers were so odd.  One would circle the other, they would drop and climb large distances at surprising speed.  After a few moments I decided to carry on watching them at a park just down the street, where a hill would provide a more unobstructed view.  I ran down the street and up the hill and continued to watch.  More odd movements. At a few points, they went from what seemed thousands of feet in the sky, and dropped below the tree line where I couldn't see them, and came back minutes later.  After they climbed back into the sky, they would stay pretty still for! a while and then begin to move around again.  I know there is a military base nearby, Camp Williams, but I have lived in the area my whole life and never seen anything like this.  I suppose it could have been some sort of training operation, but the movement those lights made were very strange to me.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,,

It had the form of a triangle, we could see it for aprx. one minutes and then it disappeard.  It was lighting strong, if it would not move, we could say it is a star. There was no sound.

I live in the north east of Glasgow Lanarkshire Scotland.  On the 8th.of August 2010 I looked out of my window and saw in the sky, a light, travelling in a SE. to NW. direction.  I went outside and looked up at the light, it was red to orange in colour and in a figure of eight configuration with the two balls of the eight off set.  I watched this light and when it was almost directly overhead it slowed, stopped, then faded into two little white dots, and disappeared.  I realised that what looked like a single figure of eight shaped light was actually two separate round red lights. On the 14th.of Aug, my wife and I saw a red ball of light come over the Campsie Fells (which are 10 miles distant to the north) and fly towards us in a N. to S. direction.  When at a distance of approximately one quarter of a mile to our left it slowed, stopped, then disappeared.  About 30 seconds later another red light appeared over the Campsie Fells and travelled towards us, it slowed then stopped at exactly the same spot as did the first. This went on at very regular intervals for some time, red lights travelling towards us, stopping and then disappearing. Although I didn't time them, the lights took about one and a half minutes to travel the 10miles from the Campsie Fells. Later that night I looked over towards the Kilsyth Hills which are really a continuation of the Campsie fells and saw a red light, then another come over these hills and disappear at some distance from us. There is no way these lights could be Chinese lanterns.  They travelled at speed in the same trajectory, stopped, then disappeared in exactly the same place. On the 17th.of August we saw two more red lights travelling in a NW. to SE. direction then disappear.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,,

I thought nothing of it, but then it started moving weird.. kinda in a squiggle shape..  BUT it wasnt slow, it was fast, like how a bug moves, only it was REALLY BIG... and it wasnt far enough away to be a plane.. it looked like it was right across the field over by that one kids house that rode my bus...  It was freaky. I slowed down and stopped and watched it.. it was flashing very weirdly.. Like it wasnt flashing more like.. pulsating..  anyway it slowed down and started going slow towards hillsdale.. and it got dimmer.. and dimmer.. and dimmer.. then it disappeared.. then it did 1 more bright flash then vanished completely. I got home and told my brother... then about 5 mins later my dad came home and HE says he saw something too. BIZARRE!  He said he saw something near Coldwater though, that looked like a comet, that had a sparkly tail, but it kept blinking on for awhile then off.. then back on. We went out looking for about an hour, but didnt see anything additional. This is significant because neither of us really ever talk about UFOs, much less see one, and since we both saw something weird at the same time, it was really bizarre.",2011-01-05T00:00:00,41.9486,-84.767

I previously reported the other sighting on March, 19th, 2011. Below is my latest sighting. I walked outside my home to take out the trash around 9:45 PM (CST).  I was walking down the driveway and looking up at the night sky again around 9:45/50.  As I went back up toward the garage I noticed the sound of several passing commercial jets traveling from east to west just south of my location.  As I looked up at the louder of the two passing jets, a bright light came into my field of view from behind my head. (I was looking up facing east-southeast, looking off and up to my right.)   At first I thought it was another jet with some really bright landing lights on, but there was no sound and no blinking or flashing lights.  The light appeared round, about the size and brightness of Venus as my previous sighting, but this time it did NOT slowly pulsate.  Instead, it gradually faded completely out, leaving only a tiny dark red sphere (about 1/10 the size of the original bright bluish-white light with an even smaller dark green light beyond the red light.  It was as if the rear b! right light source went out and you could briefly see the middle much smaller dark red light with the equally small dark green light at what would be the front or end of the object.  Now, I am calling these “lights”, but the tiny red and green spheres have more of a reflected metallic look to them.  They did not flash or blink.  This view of this object was quickly obscured by some of the very tall pine trees on my property and I lost sight of the tiny red and green light spheres after only a few seconds.  It appeared that all these “lights” were part of one single object which would have been either round, discoid, or cylindrical in shape.  Also, the size of the tiny red and green lights was about the same size as a passing satellite. Again, there was no sound, so I suspect it was at a very great altitude. Could this be something we have in orbit? Do you know if there are any NEW conventional aircraft lights that would behave in this manner? Also, this object was moving very fast, so my view was not very long. The speed was similar to my last sighting in March. There was no exhaust, flame, or contrail visible. I am also sending you a drawing of this object. It looks like we are starting to see these objects more frequently over the greater Houston/Tomball/Hockley, Texas area. Keep looking up!

At the same I also noticed no sound no jet engines no propeller no helicopter blades just silence, you could hear the crickets it was that quiet.

It was in full flame while it was falling.  Once it hit the ground, it was glowing with embers.  I drove over it because everything happened so quickly.

July, August, and September were very dry months so I was watering the grass.  As I sat there, an AF passenger Jet flew  by heading  towards Wright Patterson AFB.  The Jet was painted pure white so I assume it was an AF air ambulance.  It was at about 3000 feet altitude heading slowly towards the base.  I watched it for a long time until it became a small spot as it neared the base.  My eyes and sight then returned back to the spot where I first saw the AF Jet.  Then I noticed a circular disk hovering above the path and displaced somewhat to the south from the path the AF Jet followed towards WPAFB.  Perhaps at an altitude of 5000 feet and 1000 feet to the south.  This disk was only about 40 feet wide but it was thick and the edges were very rounded.  It appeared to be metallic and aluminum-like.  There was a disk-like hump in the middle of and on top of the thick bottom disk.  And this disk had very w! ell rounded edges also.  This whole structure was pitched down at an angle of sixty degrees as if it had been viewing the AF Jet that flew by.   Now here is the kicker about this craft.  I could not see the rear portion of this craft because it seemed to be hidden by the sky.  This craft seemed to coming through a hole in the sky and I could not see the rear of this craft.  As I watched it I said to myself “ this is interesting.”  Then after awhile, it appeared that the craft moved back into the hole in the sky.  I could not see it anymore.  I then watched this position in the sky for a long time but the craft did not reappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-03-10T00:00:00,,

Which is south and i'm facing east where the sun rises from.  I see this really big bright metallic elongated disc looking thing.  I had to turn away because the reflection of the sun on this thing hurt my eyes.  I look back with my hand trying to shade my eyes from the reflection and see this thing still there only for like a second before it just disappears. It made no noise at all the whole time.  So I finish my cigarette and see two air planes get kind of close to each other.  One small plane heading south and one larger commercial air liner heading east. The eastward plane seemed to fly into some invisible haze.  The sky was blue with no clouds in the area. The plain was still somewhat visible and I could hear the both planes like I normally do.

It had different colored lights on it and was very obviously not a star. The object had very bright blue lights on it.  It began as a stationary object. It moved in a few different directions(dart to the left or right then halt, move in zigzags).  Every once in a while, it seemed like it was pulsating light, almost like a heart beat.  Then, still seeing that object, we notice a smaller, much more dim light appear and they started heading towards each other!  They looked like they were going to collide.  But, when they ""collided,"" the Blue One came to a complete stop.  No slowing down, just an immediate stop.  And the small one was gone, we never saw it again.   Throughout the night we encountered a couple of ""stars"" that would take a U Turn and seem to disappear into the universe. 2 AM:  By this time, we were seeing at least 3 large ones, like the blue one that had been moving all night. The 3 big ones formed a perfect triangle, at a distance from each other.  There was a blue, an orange, and a white.  Every once in a while they would do the same thing with the colliding star from different directions.  We also noticed there was a large amount of airplanes in the area. We would see at least 3 in the sky at a time flying close to the objects.  The planes came from all different directions and the number of them increased as the number of moving UFOs was rising.  A plane seemed to get really close to the top white object, and very quickly it shot a very short distance toward the plane and you could see a “tail” on it almost, it looked like it was threatening the plane.  We could see sometimes other things moving and appearing/disappearing.  Things we also saw included helicopter-like objects.  They looked like a helicopter, maybe.  There was 3 spotted at this t! ime.  Eventually, the blue and orange objects were out of sight completely.  At that point, about 1 AM, everything stopped moving. Or at least it looked like it to us.

It was sitting there hovering like a helicopter but with no propellers of any sort, just a few yards off of the 14 freeway, maybe about 100 feet in the air. It had the brightest lights on each triangle corner (like white spot lights).    When we got closer to it we could see underneath had a triangular cavity that had lights running all along the sides of the cavity. We took the next off ramp to turn around and get a better look at it but when we got back on the freeway the object in the sky was gone.  If it had been any type of plane or helicopter we would still have been able to see it in motion as it was leaving the area.  The speed in which this thing disappeared was not any type of technology that is of this earth, that’s for sure.  There was no sound that we heard coming from this object nor was the dirt on the ground below being disturbed in any way.

I did not see lights lining an underneath cavity this time around.  We were parked while the triangle shaped object moved closer to us.  Just as it reached the point of being right in front of us, it changed direction in a split second.  No airplane or helicopter can change direction like that without having to swoop around first so we knew this was not an ordinary earthly object.  Just after changing direction it shot off at what I would say was light speed and disappeared into thin air.

On the evening of Wednesday, April 13th, 2011, at several minutes after 7pm, I left a friend’s home in Taylor, near the crossing of Telegraph Rd. and Van Born St.  It did not take me long to get back to the highway from her house, after only a very short trip on main roads, a quick gas fill-up at the pump using my card, and then a lengthy stop at a red light, which I suspect puts the sighting at around 7:10 to 7:20 when it began, and lasted for approximately 20-25 minutes in full, though it was not completely visible for me that entire time. I drive a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire, and my sketches include features from my perspective while sitting in my vehicle.  I was driving alone with a cell phone which was packed away in a bag in my passenger seat, and because my dashboard clock does not work, I was unsure of the exact time.  I have no camera phone or other recording device, so I had to document and sketch it from memory.  To my knowledge, there were no other witnesses, although other people were driving on the same road and able to see the same thing, though none seemed to notice. On eastbound I-94 in metro Detroit, near the Southfield Highway intersection, while the interstate is significantly above ground level enough to see the object hovering near the horizon, I caught sight of what I first believed was a banner of some sort, like those trailing behind airplanes (aerial advertising).   Then I realized that this object’s relative position to me and lack of motion meant that there was no plane tugging a banner along, and I surely couldn’t spot a plane of any form near the object.  As I continued to drive, I had to fight with looking over or past other obstacles to my vision while still driving at high speeds during traffic; I did well with this, and there was luckily no danger involved during this period of time.  As I think back on it, I only wish I would have had the foresight to pull off the interstate to a main road where the object was still visible, and to watch it as long as I could.  However, I never came to the conclusion that I was the only eyewitness to this object, and surely I would see some news of it when I arrived home.  If I had the chance again, I would watch it until it left my sight on its own. As I got better and better glances at the object, I continued to move along the highway, making my way for I-75, my ultimate route back home.  At one point, I was angled so that it was visible in my passenger-side window in my direct view, with no obstacles, and showing me clearly that it was not attached to anything, and it was unlike anything I had previously seen or ever heard about here on Earth.  Though I was clearly astonished at the sight of it, I was intent on getting back home, and though I was continuously debunking my own skeptical ideas of what Earthly craft this could be, I was instinctively sure that someone somewhere was getting press coverage of this event at that very moment, and I should get home and watch the news on TV and the net.  Later, when I arrived home, I learned there was no news, no sightings on the TV or internet, and wished I would have taken action then. Because I have seen tethered balloons used as advertising, I even thought maybe it could be something like that, but the better glances I got, the more and more skeptical of my own skepticism I became. Having the object in my sights at several points on I-94, I wasn’t quite sure of where it was, or how far away it was, and therefore – how large the object might have been.  It was very difficult to discern its exact size and location, and only after looking at a Google Map of the area was I able to determine approximately where it could have been located.  Based on those figures, I would guess the craft could have been anywhere from 300 feet to a mile or more in width, and about one-quarter that in height.  If I had ever seen a rectangular blimp (an object that could hover for extended periods of time, such as this object did), I would believe this could be a blimp, but the whole concept of a rectangular aerial craft defies the use of aerodynamics used in the craft’s design in order to adequately fly the thing around during an event – this object was clearly rectangular or perhaps even more of a parallelogram, but it had relatively angular and obvious corners, with two pair! s of parallel sides.  When I first spotted the object, I could have sworn it was angled diagonally, making me think it was a banner being pulled by an airplane, though it could have been the curvature of my windshield, since I was looking between the windshield and the passenger-side window, leaning back and forward, ducking my head down and then trying to peer over – all because it was positioned somewhat behind the car frame bar between those two windows, giving me a pretty precise angle of my first sighting of it, as well as future angles. After I merged on to northbound I-75, I could see the object still in my rear-view and side mirrors, though my curving driving motion made it difficult to keep in my sight at all times.  Then, while on a straight path on the interstate, I got a very clear sighting of it in my rear-view mirror, as well as my side mirror, both separately for several seconds, enough to pinpoint a general location relative to my own position.  I have included drawings of these perspectives in my report, showing the object as it was situated in my view in both mirrors. It was still rather bright daylight outside, with the low sun nearly set, and making the colors of the sky begin to be more vibrant, giving off rosy pink tones and yellow hued light on most things reflecting it.  There were no stars visible yet, and the sky was not really dark enough for them in any location.  There were few clouds, and the ones present were very far away and thin, not having much mass or density.  No other objects appeared as solid and obvious as this one.  I could see no Earthly craft, such as planes, helicopters, or jets.  When I first glimpsed the object it was positioned in a location where it was made somewhat darker, appearing as a muted magenta or deep reddish mauve, and by the time it was positioned clearly in my window it had brightened because of the sun’s light, falling on it and the rest of the horizon. In my side window is where I caught the best glimpse of the object, and is the view I remembered when making my color renditions.  I mostly remember how the light reflected off it: it was solid, a different color than the sky, and reflected the colors of the sunset and sky, though not as if it were “shiny” so much as it was solid and had mass that caught the unique sky colors.  It did not seem to have any writings, markings, or other significant or relevant identifiers, and it not produce light, phenomena, or effects such as that.  I cannot be sure if it was silent or audible, since I was driving in a car. In full, the sites where/when the object was visible were around the Southfield Highway/I-94 intersection, for several miles, and then it was no longer visible because of the elevation of the highway for a large portion of the remaining distance to I-75.  However, it began to be visible again as I could overlook the city of Detroit from the ramp between I-94 E and I-75 N.  By the time I was heading north on I-75, it was visible in my mirrors.  I have attached a map that I got using Google Maps and adding in where I was located when I spotted the object.  Though I placed myself after Southfield Highway on my trip when I first spotted it, when I took another trip on the same route to be sure of my sighting locations, I realized that it may have been before I passed this intersection that I remember being one of my landmarks.  After driving on I-75 for some distance, I was considering getting off the highway and parking somewhere I might be able to view the object, but by that ! time I had a difficult time trying to see it, and figured it best to simply make it home and watch the news.  That was about 1-2 miles before the Davison Freeway (M-8, I believe), ending my active sighting.  I never stayed to see what the craft did, where it went, etc.  I now wish I would have parked to stay and watch it as adamantly as I did while driving on the road. The object did not seem to move, or moved incredibly slowly as if hovering, and though I could not be sure of its absolute motion or stillness due to my own driving motion, I can easily say that it did not change locations much based on the angles at which I could view it – it must have been hovering or moving incredibly slowly for an extended period of time, and no airplane could have done what it did.  As shown in one of my sketches, I broke down to myself why it could not be an airplane (with a banner or without), a simple helicopter, a military helicopter, or simple blimp, and was left with no options to my knowledge.  After extensive discussion with others as to what I could have been witnessing, the discussions have only proven to show me more ways in which the object that I witnessed was operating and was constructed unlike anything known to myself or the general public.  If it’s man-made, it isn’t publicly accessible. A friend of mine suggested that perhaps it was a Harrier jet (sp?) because they are capable of flying in one relative position for a short period, however another friend of mine who was in the US army in Iraq for three years said that that kind of jet would never hang out in one position for as long as I described, and would use a lot of fuel just to do that, while also making a loud noise that I would have heard even over my vehicle’s engine.  Lastly, though a jet is angular, this object did not have enough angles to make it a jet – only four angles, and they were simple corners.  Another friend supported my blimp theory by saying that that evening was the first night of the Red Wings play-offs, and could have been a blimp used to record the area from an aerial view. I waited to write this report in order to do some decent sketches and digital renditions of what I witnessed.  Having finished them but still seeing no coverage of the object on local media, I was about to give up my urges to report it and move on to other issues in life.  Then I saw this article (http://www.examiner.com/ufo-in-national/rectangle-ufo-appeared-a-liquid-state-over-texas?fb_comment=32512566) which described an object spotted in Texas that sounded as if it appeared similar to what I saw here in my own state.  After realizing that this thing may have made a re-appearance elsewhere, I knew I had to reveal my sighting to the world the right way.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,42.368854674403615,-83.11026847195357

On the afternoon of 11/06/10 at approximately 4:30 PM, I was driving on a gravel road outside of Marceline, MO near the Old Reservoir. As I made the crest of a hill, I suddenly saw white lights that looked like the size of a light bulb cross the road going from west to east at what looked to be no higher than 5-10 feet off of the ground.  Now, they were probably about ½ mile away, so they may have been more the size of a basketball. They were going in a perfect straight line, one right after the other. I thought I was seeing a reflection of something, so I removed my glasses, and I could still see them. They just kept coming one right after the other, and I kept anticipating for this to stop, but it never did for what seemed like a long amount of time, but was realistically only 10-15 seconds. They moved very swiftly and in a perfect rhythmic pattern or tempo. Like I said,  one right after the other. They went into the trees or what you might call a forest area off to the east, and I didn’t see them anymore.  It happened so fast and they just came out of nowhere, so unexpectedly, that I have no idea as to what these were. I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I hope I never do. I drove on down to where they crossed and there were some horses in a field not far away,  that were all huddled together, like they were spooked.  This was in the broad daylight with the sun out, a real nice day. I can’t explain it, and I even called the Sheriffs department later that evening to ask if anyone had reported seeing anything strange around the old reservoir, but no one had.  I didn’t give my name, as I thought they may think I was crazy!  I can’t get this out of my head, and I replay it every day in my mind. If you can tell me what I saw, that would be great..",2010-11-21T00:00:00,39.6539,-92.9157

It was 7:00 pm on the 4th of January and I has just gone up to the bed-room window and looked out and seen this very big oval shaped object that was moving very, very slow and on the very right side and on the very left side of it had a big brite light that stayed on and all the way on top and the bottom was these different colored lights that were blinking, (some red, blue, green and maybe some yellow colors) and it had passed right over my building, (the one that I'm living in) so it has passed through the middle of down town Topeka, Ks. and it was moving due-west from me, so after that finally had gone out of sight another UFO had just went over me again but this UFO was alot different, it had either one very-big brite light on it or it might have been a-few lights together but it would blink very, very slow but it's like it would come on for about one second and stay off for about 3 seconds and it was moving about five-times as fast than the first one was! moving at and their was no other lights on it so it could'nt of had any wings on it and both of the UFO's was making NO-NOISE at all and was traveling the very same path that the first one was traveling, so the first UFO was moving at a speed of about 20 to 30 MPH,, but it's weird because no planes ever travel this path before, going through the down-town area and both of the UFO's were at or right below the cloud-deck hight but it was a very clear night at that time and the reason I remember all of this so good is because I wrote the sightings down and drew them both while it was fresh in my mind and I've been living here in the same place for five years now and through the years of traveling around to different statea, (climbing trees for a living) and that I've lived near a-few different air-force bases in my life and also I have always been a star-gazzer, even when I was a young-boy so I've seen just about any and all different planes and their lights too so that's all! of the truth, as God is my witness. I know their are alot of ""Kids"" that make-up lies about this stuff but I'd never say or do anything like that because it's wrong and it makes people to NOT believe when people like myself tell of what we have seen and I have seen other UFO's in my life-time and I've ""Never-Ever"" reported them before but sence this happened right here in town and forbes air-force base is about 5 to 7 miles to my south and also I think that these UFO's might be their air-ships but I look at it and say why would they fly their air-ships right by us, so anyway that's about it,, thanks for listening and God Bless ya'll… ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports of this alleged sighting were submitted to our Center.

I immediately looked at where he was pointing and saw what I originally thought was a very large meteor at about a 45 degree angle from where I stood outside on my side yard.  It was glowing immensely with white light and had a rather long tail composed of what my friends I thought looked like bits and pieces of flaming glitter. It was lightly bumpy, form what I could see, and had a white/yellow light radiating around it.   We all stormed outside and gazed up, marveling the spectacular glow. It was west in direction, traveling in a downward motion, much like a meteor.  The size was very large, about 1/5 of the moon (compared to how we see it in the sky).  The sphere traveled down for a good 20-25 seconds then broke into three equal pieces of glowing ball.  It continued to fall for 2-3 more seconds then abruptly stopped in mid air and hovered.  It just hovered there in the sky then began to rotate in a circle formation for a good 10-15 seconds.  The rotating was like the planets rotating around the sun, without the sun.  It hovered for about 25-30 seconds.  I then ran into my house to grab my cell phone to see if I may catch it on my camera then ran outside and began to film.

It did not disintegrate or break apart; it vanished, like a magician in movies.

My chair faces the house front windows—drapes were open—and I noticed a fireball falling in the night sky.  I have windows running floor to ceiling in the front of my house.   I jumped up to run out the front door to get a better look—and yelled for my 14 year old daughter and her two friends to come out and look with me.    All 4 of us witnessed what appeared to be a fireball meteor falling from overhead due west. We all saw the object as it was about 45 degree angle from the horizon.  My house faces due west –and faces Lake Elsinore.    My house sets on a hillside about 2300 ft elevation.   The night sky was very clear and you could see the stars.   Earlier in the evening I noticed the moon was a small crescent sliver—but had already dropped below the horizon at the time of this sighting.   As the 4 of us continued to observe the falling object—I mentioned to the girls that it may be a meteor or a falling satellite—it appeared to falling directly over Lake elsinore—and falling straight down.  I first caught view of the object as it appeared to be about 45 degrees angle.  As the object continued falling—at about 30 degrees—the object split into 3 pieces.  I expected it to then fizzle out—but the three pieces then stopped in mid air—at about 25 degrees angle and hovered.   The pieces did not exhibit the fireball appearance –they were each a bright white light  and seemed to move indepe! ndent of each other—but all three setting on the same level—but lightly moving up and down relative to each other.   They them began a slow movement to the left—or a south direction.  As they continued to move towards the left  I lost sight of them behind a large tree in the yard across the street.  As I moved to the other side of my drive way to get a view from the other side of the tree—they had vanished.    The original fireball size appeared to be about 1/4th the size of the moon—if it were setting in that part of the sky ( the moon had already dropped below the horizon).  The three separate pieces looked to be a size if you were to break the original fireball into three pieces.  As the three pieces set hovering—they appeared to be in size –all three together—left to right—about the width of the moon.    The time duration of the event was probably about 45  seconds from when I first saw the object to when it split into three pieces—and then another 30 seconds watching t! he three pieces hovering, moving to the left, then vanishing. ! About 75 seconds in all.   My first reaction on seeing the fireball was that it was a large meteor or a falling satellite as there appeared to be quite a bit of debris coming off of the object and training behind it.  But—when it split into three pieces that hovered for a period of time—I became curious as to what it really was.   My daughter was able to get about 10 seconds of video of the object  on her EVO phone.  Her friend got 4 still photos on her cell phone.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,33.6238,-117.2569

It was white light like a bunch of stars linked together to form a line about an inch wide from my perspective.  And it tilted down to the right a bit. I was thinking how it couldn’t be a plane or anything like that because those are usually one dot and slowly moving.  This was like if an edge of a coin were lit up in a line and it wasn’t really moving. Then it slowly tilted with purpose (again this was strange to me because if it were a man made prop or something far away the effort to so even would be quite difficult) like when you weigh something with those doctor scales and you get the lead weight right it kind of has this slow settling into place as it gets its balance.  Like that. It tilted in that ‘gaining balance’ way for another 20 degrees tilting down on the right side. Suddenly it looked like it was moving forward away from me for a moment and then I got this sense of a burst of incredible speed because the lights became smaller so quick they practically winked out they were gone so fast. I was not tired. I was not drunk.  I have never made such a claim before.  I saw my first UFO.  I have no idea what it was alien, military, or otherwise but Unidentified Flying Object.

I watched as it started gaining, then dropping altitude, and what appeared to be broad spotlight(s) coming from the center, and sweeping.  It then dropped altitude, and out of curiosity, I grabbed my ultra bright white LED light, and used the strobe function, pointed directly at the object.  The object itself started flashing, first slowly, then rapidly, then slowly again.  I then switched it to fixed beam, and started slow sweeping motions, left, then right, then up and down.  It followed the track of my light almost perfectly.  I then turned my light off, and watched the object start making circles, then figure eights, and then stopping.  It repeated these movements four or five times before I turned my light on again, and pointed it directly at the object.  I repeated the sweeping motions left to right, up and down, ! and again it followed the light.  I then QUICKLY moved the beam to the left, and it followed.  Moved the beam to the right, it followed again.  I then replicated it's movements (circles and figure eights) and it followed the beam.  It was at that time I had observed a yellowish-white light coming from the bottom of the object, in a vertical axis towards the ground.  It quickly gained altitude, and stopped.

I also noticed what appeared to be a military aircraft in the vicinity that was completely blacked out except for the one rear flashing red light as it was coming from the north.  It appeared to be making a large circle around the object (I am not sure on the radius, I saw it make a shift to the south east, and then didn't see it again).",2011-01-05T00:00:00,36.3165,-86.9229

Most of the objects he did not witness, at the time the photos were taken, but rather later, as he inspected the photos.  NUFORC has looked at all of the photos, and although we cannot identify all of the anomalous objects captured photographically, but most of the objects we believe are birds.  In most of those cases, we are even able to determine the type of bird involved, and its position in flight.  We believe that none of the photos is of a genuine UFO.

It was dark and dry with overcast skies.  As I was making my way I saw four very bright white lights symmetrically placed on a craft that I thought was an aircraft. Those lights were pointed south parallel to 75.  Each outboard light was approximately 100 feet from the centerline of the craft and each inboard light was approximately 40 ft from the centerline of the craft. The white lights were brighter and more white than white lights I have seen on aircraft.  However, the brightness of these lights did not bother my eyes.  As I watched this craft I kept on saying to myself  “this is a big aircraft.”   As I got closer to 675 I realized this craft  did not seem to be moving.  Then I said to myself, “ this must be the lights at the Dayton Mall.”   Then I started into my turn onto 675. I rolled down my driver’s window as I was now moving in front of whatever this was.   As I looked at this thing I realized it was not part of the Dayton Mall lighting because it was sitting over a very dark and empty field.  This object whatever it was, was not illuminating the space below its lights, but its lights were pointed dead ahead and whatever this object was it sat about three hundred feet above the ground.  I said to myself “ what is that?”  Then all of a sudden the object started moving ahead and to its left. Wow what is that?  Then I realized it was heading towards 675.  Then I realized it was going to cross 675.  Then I realized it was going to cross 675 right in front of me. Now I watched this craft through my side window and then through my front window.  It was going about 60 mph at about 300 feet above the ground.  As it crossed in front of me I said “Oh my God it is a ring.”   But the rear of this craft was bathed in soft red light and I saw a three-disk type solid structure.  The larger disk was on the bo! ttom.  The middle disk was a smaller diameter than the bottom d! isk and the top disk was an even smaller diameter than the middle disk.   But I could not see where the soft red light was coming from. However, as I watched it fly by I saw a very strange pattern of light on the rear right-side rings of this craft.  This pattern of light covered only a relatively small area.  The pattern of light was a series of black pulses of light or something blanking out the red illumination of this craft.  It was very strange.  There were about 6 black pulses in a row.  Each pulse was about 2 feet square.  They were not constant in time. There seemed to be a fast repetition rate.  I then lost sight of the craft out of my passenger side window. This was a rush hour.  So I could not safely pursue this craft.  And I could not safely pull off of 675 without causing an accident Now what was this craft?   I have no idea. It was not an airliner.  There were no wings.  It made no noise. No it was not a blimp.  The craft was very thin.  There were many cars on 675 and 75.  When this craft crossed 675 (west-bound first and then east bound next) it had to have been seen by many people.  It was so big and slow and right above the heavy traffic.  But I have not seen any reports on the sighting of this craft at all.  Now I must say I could not see any structure of this craft when I was in front of it or when it was flying towards me other than its bright lights.  However, only when it was passing in front of me did I see its 3-disk type structure.  From the side view, this craft was big.  The front-view of this craft was very wide because of the distances of the bright white lights from the centerline of this craft.  However, I saw no fuselage as I looked at it from the front. This craft made no noise.",2011-03-10T00:00:00,39.6182,-84.2488

It appeared in plain sight, its skin and contours sleek.  The object was to our east, alternately moving through the sky from north to south and hovering.  We remarked to each other that this was nothing like the planes we often see in our neighborhood, which is on the local international airport flightpath. It also did not look like a weather balloon or anything like a balloon.  The weather was clear and there were few if any clouds and no obstructions to our field of view.  The object was moving at less than 1000 feet over the horizon, and its widest, its size was probably about 10-15 feet. I happened to have a camera in my vehicle, I reached ! to grab it so I could take pictures, we both turned away for a moment, but the object had disappeared as we turned to look at it again. The object's altitude was high enough that if it had been a conventional plane, we would have still seen it moving, either descending or ascending over the horizon, as any other plane that flew to or away from the airport. Moments later, looking out to the sky in the southwest, still in our general vicinity, we observed what appeared to be a delta shaped, bottom side of a flying aircraft, maybe a military fighter jet. The color of the bottom side of the craft was dark or perhaps black and the craft was moving fast at about the same altitude, moving from east to west and appeared to be banking sharply away to the south, in the direction of the international airport.

First I would like to apologize for my English, cos I am not from USA or other English speaking country but I will try my best to explain everything as detail as possible.  Ok I will start from there that I am a young guy who likes sports, dont drink, dont smoke nothing, only healthy life, I am saying this, cos I was not hallucinating or something!!!  I am very interested in UFOs since I was little, now I am 27 and I am obsessed with the subject. When I am at home after work I am watching all kind of documentaries about it, everything there is on Discovery, History channels and so on. So one night when I finished watching a docu about ufos, I said to myself - ok thats it, I am tired of only watching about it and about all those fake ufo clips on youtube so I decided to look for myself. It was June very warm weather I looked outside from my window I am living in a 9 story! building and I am on the highest floor, when i looked up I saw that the sky was absolutely clear, so many stars and I said to myself omg I got to go on the roof and start watching the sky every single night, Inside myself I knew I would see something, cos up there high I can see the whole sky more clearly and without the distraction of the street lights. So when everybody was sleeping I got there I took even a blanket to lie down and look at the sky till the morning that was my plan.  It was Friday  I stayed for like an hour and I saw a meteor fly by it was so beautiful and at that moment I thought to myself wow when this meteor can enter the planet Earth so easy everything can and I stayed like half an hour more and got back to my apartment. That was my first try, I was very happy thou that I saw something moving not only the stars but that was only the beginning. On the next evening was the actual sighting, so the same story I get there around 1:00 am and laid down on the ! blanket and actually I was prepared to see another meteor I wa! s convin ced that there are ufos but didnt expect to see what I saw, its crazy! So around 2:00 am I saw this time a bigger meteor to fly by and it was destroyed by the atmosphere into peaces very high in the sky, it was beautiful, so I got on my feet and start watching it and after 30 sec I saw the meteor the sighting began! So I was staying on my feet and still watching up high cos wanted to see more meteors maybe but what I saw I couldnt believe my eyes! So the meteor was burned out and 30 sec after I saw him I was still looking up and saw a light cant tell the exact color red or violet was falling from very high in the sky down to the roof in a spiral fashion it was unbelievable like a dance and I thought to myself wow a peace of the meteor is falling down yay I am a lucky one, I saw a meteor very high in the sky and its gonna fall a 6 meters in front of me wow what are the chances but thats what I thought cos I didnd expect something else! So this light was falling down in a spir! al fashion from very high very slowly and when it was around 6 meters in front of me so close and the same height as me so in front my eyes I just step back one step cos I was like wow its gonna fall on the roof but when it was on my height falling in a spiral fashion it just start to fly straight in front of me but not straight I mean left right up down it was like dancing and then I was like ooo my God that is not a meteor, it flies! I was very scared, what the hell is that I didnt have time cos I look to my left guess what another light falling down this time like a ""falling leaf"" fashion left right, left right and when was in front of my eyes height it flew in the direction of the other ufo and it was absolutely silent no noise at all only flying and it look like it defies gravity up down left right so smooth it was like magical I was like watching those fantasy movies watching magical lights flying by me no sound no nothing I immediately call them fairies cos they were! so beautiful no sound at all, so after the second one I turne! d to my right a 3rd light falling and flying in the direction of the first one. And when I look at them how they are flying it looked to me that they were intelligent, cos they were flying so like they were looking for something left right up down and like scanning the surface. So I was there all alone on the block of flat at 2:30 am and those lights were like dancing and wanting to show me their presence I dont know but I was scared and started to fall back and when I was going back a 4th light flew over my shoulder and I was like omg I am out of here on the way back I was looking in every direction, cos I didnt know from where they will appear I was scared I coudnt hear a thing only with my eyes I was like turning my head in every possible direction and when I got to the door to exit the roof a 5th one flew over my head omg I am out and I ran the stairs down to my flat, I was all shaken! This is absolutely unbelievable! I stayed at my apartment like 15 min and was looking up from ! the window and saying to myself omg some lights (or fairies like I call them immediately) are flying up there and I am staying here I have to go back not everybody is seeing this I have to be crazy not to go there this is unbelievable! So my curiosity was bigger than I was scared and i got back there. When I arrived I was looking at every possible direction cos I knew I coldnt hear them only seeing them. It was 3:00 am and I waited till 3:30 and I was trying to convince myself that I was hallucinating and to go back to my apartment, cos actually i was scared :D and I said to myself ok last look up to the sky till my neck hurts and I am out and when I looked up immediately it just flew over my head about a 2 meters above it, it flew so smooth I can describe it like when you make an airplane from paper and throw it, it flies so smooth and make a smooth turn to my left and just disappeared I even saw it very clearly, cos was above my head and I could see it in more detail it l! ooked something like a rc mini airplane I can even describe it! , it loo ked like 2 dots connected with a minus sign something like that  *-*  and had a haze around it, but there was no mist or something it was absolutely clear night, but when it flew it had some green glow around it, it was like going through the space and I can even make another comparison, when there is a mist and the lights of the car is on, around the lights there is some kind of glow cos of the mist this is what it looked like but was a clear night, it was unbelievable, and I was like ""There it is ooo my God!"" (I was talking with voice to myself all the time, cos this was something that cant be explained) and I got out of there and that was my story. It went 7-8 months from that sighting and I cant go back there cos its cold its winter now. I cant wait to get warm to go there again, but this time I am very scared cos I know what to expect, don’t saying that this was something scary but those lights were something out of this world and when the human brain sees something tha! t cant be explained, it is scary. That day I didnt expect anything to happen but now I know and i am 100% convinced that they will return, cos they know I am looking for them and I am even convinced that they are even flying every single day and night but we cant see them, cos they are invisible and only if they want to show their presence they will light their light and glow, cos when I saw the last light and when made a turn to the left it just disappeared, so they can be flying without we even know it. I hope someone has a similar experience and tell me what that is. Thank you in advance! Bye guys! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They moved slowly like airplanes do, but because of the apparent altitude, it was probably moving pretty swiftly.The speed was very regular, I never saw it speed up or slow down, just move in a straight, slow line accross the sky.

All of a sudden I heard an increasing in volume thunderous roar, approaching from the north-west.  This made me look up. It sounded like military jet with the pilots really pushing the pedal to the metal.  I did not see the jets, but it sounded like the ones I saw flying over Andrews Airforce base in Maryland.  Commercial jets do not sound anything like that and fly much higher.  (I see a lot of them, since I live about 15 minutes away from Dulles International Airport).  These jets seemed to be flying pretty low and I have never seen or heard them flying over at this time of night - never.  I looked up to see what is making all that noise, but did not see the jets. However, panning the skies from west to south, I saw what looked like a very bright large star, crossing the sky from west to south in the south-western quadrant of the sky. It had the same bluish-white tint to it that the stars do. The line of sight was at about 30 degrees angle to the ground. I could not judge the distance and did not see any shape that might have been associated with the object, but it crossed the sky in under 10 seconds and disappeared behind the trees I have to the south of my house. The strangest thing about the object was that it was blinking in a very peculiar manner. Commercial jets have red and green light, blinking continuously without interruption. This thing was bluish-white, would blink 3 times within approximately 1 second, then would stop blinking all together for a second, then blink 3 times within approximately 1 second again, then stop blinking for a second, etc., during the whole 10 seconds or so it took it to cross the visible to me sout! h west quadrant of the sky. These was no noise at all coming from the UFO directing - the roar I heard was rapidly approaching from the north - west. As I said before, the UFO disappeared behind the trees in about 10 seconds, but I kept hearing the roar for another 5 minutes or so. Sounded like the jets kept flying around. Then everything went silent. Half an hour later the roar came back, but I was already in bed and did not run outside to see what was going on. It would not do any good anyhow, since the speed with which the object moves - it would have been gone by the time I got out. After I got up and came to work, had to tell someone what I saw. I told the story to a security guard that I am friendly with and he said that he lives right near Andrews Airforce Base and he heard they scrambled jets several times last night, which, according to him, they never do at night. He thought someone might have flown into Washington DC no-fly zone or something. This confirms my suspicions that the roar I heard was military jets. The object could not have been a satellite. I have seen those and they do not blink, do not fly at 30 degrees angle above the horizon and do not get chased by the military jets because the jets cannot fly that high. Subsequently I found out that there were two other reports filed by people from the same area filed with the MUFON CMS pretty much describing the same thing I saw.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,38.87033365758755,-77.18092101167315

At approximately 2100 hours I went outside and looked west into a clear evening sky.  Visibility was excellent.  There was a ¾ moon overhead.   I was looking WSW and saw, approaching from the west, two sets of lights which I assumed were transiting aircraft as this area is a busy air traffic corridor.  Flight separation between the two was approximately 2000 ft.  I quickly discerned that the lead, faster moving object was NOT a normal aircraft.  It appeared to be a slow moving meteor.  There was a bright light emanating from the nose and a whitish orange fan-shaped ""tail"" coming from the aft of the craft.  The movement was steady to slightly accelerating.  I figured the craft was at 2-4 thousand feet AGL. This strange craft overtook the other set of lights which was, by all appearances, a small general aviation craft such as a Cessna 172.  I say that by the pattern of the anti-smash lights and the familiar drone of the engine and also the approach path as it appeared inbound to the local airport. I continued to observe the ""slow meteor"" as it approached and noticed the fan-shaped tail took on an orange to greenish hue.  If my guess to altitude is correct I’d estimate ths corona-like tail was 2-3 hundred yards in length.  The fan shape of the tail was oriented vertically and the width of this plume was narrow.  The color was something like mixing a sodium vapor lamp and the color of copper being burned.  There was no pulsing or flashing. After 10 seconds of watching, and as it approached it seemed to accelerate and begin ascending.  Then the nose and tail lights extinguished.  I SAW the object at CPA (I was facing due South at its closest point of approach).  It was no more than a mile to the south of where I stood.  It was small, dark and obloid, or, football shaped.   Suddenly it emitted a brief puff of hazy orange light and accelerated to an incredible speed while slowly ascending.  It was out of eye-sight within a quarter second after that. It made no sound.  This was unsettling to me as I would have expected to hear it as this mountain pass area traps and funnels noise quite readily. The total sighting lasted 20-30 seconds.  I have to assume that the general aviation pilot saw what I saw and I’m writing this in hopes of corroborating stories.   If it WAS a meteor I’d like to report an ascending meteor. A little background on myself:  I was a Naval Aircrewman for 21 years.  I flew in several airframes and have thousands of flight hours of experience.  I’ve seen many strange things while flying and my share of meteors.  I am not taken to having flights of fancy.  I was fatigued but sober and otherwise in a calm state of mind.

When I walked outside I was facing NE and I noticed a very bright object coming out of the NW and heading SE, it was fairly low in the sky and I immediately thought it was the ISS.  I grabbed my binoculars and yes after viewing the object I knew from past experience that it was the ISS. It was then I turned to face W and I looked straight up.  Immediately, I noticed another bright object then another, then another.  These objects were glowing blue in color through my binoculars.  They were initially coming from the South and heading North, I followed them maybe 20 degrees in the sky and they all, in formation changed course and headed in an Easterly direction. These objects made no sound and were spaced in a diagonal line, far enough apart that I could only see two at a time in the field of view of my binoculars.  I kept shifting from binocular view to naked eye view to make sure that I was actually seeing three objects.  I continued to watch them as they eventually went out of site. Oddly enough I retrained my view back directly overhead and once again, I saw another object.  This one was also coming from the south and heading north.  This object was also blue and gaging by my view through the binoculars it seemed to be the same but at a higher altitude.  Just as I began to think that this one was a satellite, it began to change its course to follow the three that had just passed overhead. I checked the satellite charts online and the only satellite confirmed at that time was the ISS. These sightings have been occurring on a fairly regular basis here.  The only difference is that I usually see the orange orbs.  I am going to check with the local press to see if there are any other reports to follow.",2011-05-02T00:00:00,34.506735795454546,-114.29056420454545

At first I thought it was an airplane light since the air traffic around here is pretty steady.  I quickly realized this was no plane; the light was extraordinarily bright, never flickered and seemed to be rapidly approaching me.  It was coming eastbound very quickly and it was very low.  I began to run towards it across the parking lot to try to make out what it was but the light was so bright that’s all I could see.

It was only about a football field away from me to my left and it was flying over the train yard located across from valley blvd.  I then noticed a helicopter flying westbound (I believe it was an Industry Sheriff helicopter) and the object quickly shrank back into a ball shape.  It was as if the object was playing chicken with the helicopter, I almost thought they were going to collide or that the object would attack because it was so low. As the helicopter and object passed each other, the object flew over the helicopter and was probably less than 30 meters above it from my estimation, the object threw out a red almost force field like crescent moon shaped illumination towards its front end.  It completely lit the sky up around it and in doing so it revealed itself. It seemed like a ball of mercury, it was silverish and perfectly round.  The light shown for a few seconds and quickly faded into nothing although I could still see the circular object, as if it were driving with the lights out and there seemed to be very small electrical charges going off in front of it and I literally watched it fade into nothing.

Initially I thought it was a shooting star BUT the size and slow speed did not support this. The coloration was yellow-orange and it had a fireball like tail as it moved. An additional note of an interesting observation: the object(s) looked blurred around its edges as it came down, which seemed very odd. I almost thought I was watching a plane that had exploded in air fall to earth.   When the fireball-like object reached about a 23 degree angle it began to split into three balls of yellow-orange light, still connected at the top with the fire-like tail.  Then, once completely separated, the fire-like tails diminished and the balls of light stopped moving downward – just hovering at about a 20 degree angle or so, each ball moving around, separate from each other yet staying at the same level in the sky.  This is when I! knew it was not a flaming plane. The three balls of light remained visible and moving around for 3-4 minutes. The balls of light seemed to dim so my thought was that they were moving away, hence getting smaller/dimming. This whole process was only about 5 minutes in total.

It was much larger than anything else in the sky. At first I thought it was the Northstar, but it seemed way too large.  Then it started slowly moving. It went up and then to the right.  Then it started slowly moving to the left.  It was moving so slowly that it seemed to be hovering.  It had extremely bright light beams coming out from it in all direcetions.  The beams were very distinct and very long, especially the three that were on top.  All of the light was white, but every few minutes the top beams would begin to glow a greenish color and red lights would appear on the right side.  The center of the object from which the light beams were eminating had a arch shape.  I called my mother on the telephone and had her go look at it (she lives about 3 miles from my home).  She ! could see the same thing.  We watched this object hover for approximately 2.5 hours.  During this time it was moving very slowly to the left and rising.  After the sun came up and all of the stars had vanished, it was still there and just as bright.

It was completely silent.  My husband even said at one point “Is that an angel?” over and over again. Because it was nothing we had ever seen and we had perfect view of it!

It was a very dark and moonless night.  I was scanning the treeline with my binoculars while my friend observed with his eyes.  Through my binoculars I noticed a cluster of several hexagonal yellow lights. This was not a constellation, or any star formation.  It immediately stunned me because I am very familiar with the area as I go there all the time, it is one of the best places to see the sky clearly close to Morgantown.  I got my friend's attention and observed it with my naked eye. It was a large, quarter size at arm's length, cluster of hexagonal lights blinking on and off.   We could not tell for sure if this was several objects hovering together, or lights on a larger craft, but it did appear that it was a singular craft as we were both able, through binoculars, to see smaller objects flying around the craft.  Both of us felt frightened by what we saw.   We observed the object for about 25 minutes. It never moved suddenly or swiftly but it did appear to be getting smaller and! farther away as the sighting went on.   Eventually, we left as it was getting late.  The object was still observable when we headed home. I do want to remain totally anonymous, as I never report the objects we witness in that area, but I decided to submit this account because it was an especially startling sighting and unlike anything I or my friend had seen before.

I'm not sure what it was but I do know it was round because of the distance it appeared to be black.  The building I work in has three elevators, I was in the middle one.  The elevators have glass all around when I look out I could see the Secaucus area, the turnpike, further down open space with a view of the road and other cities.  It took place at exactly 2:15pm. Unfortunately, I didn't have my cell phone on me to take a picture of what I was seeing.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,40.77795,-74.06385454545455

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the plane lights wavering behind the tree's as the aircraft approached. I had assumed that it was a plane anyways.  I sat at the glass door for a moment, watching the lights approach as I usually did- out of habit more than anything. As the seconds passed, I noticed that the aircraft seemed to be rising forward into the air at an accelerating velocity- one that seemed almost unusually fast.  I continued to watch in curiosity.  In less than a second, the aircraft made a 390 degree turn, a full circle and then off to the right. There was no way it could be a plane, so I ran outside to see it better. As it flew above the tree-line, I noticed that the lights didn't look anything like the ones on a plane and the shape of the vehicle was extremely unusual.  The lights were not sharp and pronounced, but instead were hazy and burned like fire, scattered about the bottom and sides of the UFO. They were pale yellow to bluish-green in color and seemed to be linked by thinner lines of light. The UFO itself was not a sleek thin design like I might have imagined it to be.  The main body appeared dark grey and semi-metallic (it reminded me of silicon) and pyramidal, but had abstract shaped parts attached to the main body, creating a shape that is nearly indiscernible to describe from such a short observation period. It continued off to the right for a moment before all of the lights on the aircraft immediately shut off.  I could still see the body due to light pollution and a faint glow that seemed to radiate from the UFO, preventing it from becoming completely hidden.  It changed course in a matter of milliseconds and accelerated again in a sharp upward direction before it was out of eyesight. I watched for a little longer and saw something that made me almost laugh in awe.  What I could see to be as several military fighter jets came into my sight only moments later, uniformly chasing in the same direction I had seen the unidentified aircraft travel before disappearing.  They, I noticed, travelled at a speed and in a manner that I had expected human constructed planes to fly.  And they were far behind.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,42.6363,-70.9404

The lake being about a 1/2 mile from my home. I noticed a bright white light coming from the South, starting from what appeared to be about 15 miles away.  There are still very few leaves on the trees, so I was able to track this as it went from South to North at a very high rate of speed following the bluff along the coast of the lake. Keeping in mind that there is constant air traffic over Lake Michigan, I am aware of what commercial, military and Coast Guard craft are capable of, not to mention where most of the flight paths over the lake are near my home. Unless this was a very close traveling comet, an explanation of a shooting star or a satellite would be ridiculous. The object was piercing white, traveling at a high rate of speed from the south. It seemed to be approximately 10 miles of the shoreline at an altitude of about a mile, maybe less. It grew much larger in size as I was now seeing it pass me and start to veer to the North/East. A trail of light followed, but as a smear of the speed of the object. Initially the color was a white so bright that it seemed fluorescent. Upon passing, the front and lower front of the comet like object turned a deeper shade of electric blue, while the mid bottom and start of the tail became a fierce orange. At this time I noticed that the front of this was not rounded but had a slope of about 45 degrees. During the duration of this passing, the size of the object grew much wider, taller and longer. This was not from perspective either. It was as if the object grew while it was moving and then disappeared on a different course. Possibly even an elliptical course, brushing the shore. I can easily rule this out as being a shooting star, satellite or even a commercial aircraft due to the enormous size. If this was a comet, it was ridiculously close to earth. I cannot put an estimate on the size due to the fact that the light intensity and even density of the object is that of which I have never seen before. If I had to guess...  4-5 times larger than a 747. The entire showing lasted maybe as long as 7 seconds, but like glancing at the sun, the image was imbedded in the sky and in my eyelids for at least 30 seconds. I have seen aircraft, shooting stars, meteor showers, Northern Lights and even comets in the night sky. I have never seen anything in my life of this color, intensity and size. Pretty cool.

I was going to my truck to get my jacket and looked west up in the sky (something I'm always doing I think in this case though I was looking up to see what the weather was like)  It was clear skies for the most part. My gf's street is has a lot of trees on it so the spot i looked up was really one of the few openings I could see from where my truck was parked.  I could see planes flying off in the distance, but something different caught my attention. There was a bright Orange object in the sky.  I would say a little larger and a little brighter than what a planet looks like in the sky only this was Orange in color.  It seemed pretty far away, i would say at least a few miles.  That's what stuck out initially. I told my gf to look at it (she is very skeptical about this type of stuff) while I grabbed my jacket quick.  She even made some comments that it didn't look like a plane or anything (you could see another plane north west of it with marker lights and everything). I stood there for another minute and watched it move.  The orange object made kind of a clockwise circular movement and then at the 6oclock position it started to move in a straight line and then stopped.  We now began to walk west towards Cambie St hoping to get a better vantage point. I was even tripping a few times on the sidewalk as I was glued to the sky. Once we got a better view I stopped because it started to get dimmer.   My view was framed to the left by! a large tree, the bottom by a house, and to the right was a smaller tree.   The orange object was located i would say about a 45o angle of elevation.  As it was fading (slowly) it wasn't moving it only flickered a few times.  I paid attention to the fact that it wasn't moving over anything on the horizon.   And then just like that it was gone.  And I went on with my night.

In the summer of 1977 as I walked back towards my home from the park in our neighborhood, in a small housing development, I noticed a very large but quiet UFO hovering over the tree tops.  The object captivated me.  I could not take my eyes off it.   Instead of going home, I followed the UFO as it moved slowly across the tree tops in the wooded area that surrounded the development.  I followed the UFO, for approximately 15 minutes, to Quince Orchard Road, and it continued straight into the woods across the road.  (At the time that area was all wooded).  I could not follow it any further. The UFO looked oval/dome shaped.  It was very large.  It was dark colored like gray/black.  It had windows along the top dome section.   Not all windows where lit, but there was some light coming from some of the windows. It traveled very slowly, because as I followed it, it stayed ahead of me but I didn’t lose sight of it until it went into another wooded area where there was no road. I wanted to see if I could continue to follow this thing, so I caught a ride with a car that came along just after losing sight of the UFO- the fellow that stopped to give me a ride said he saw something.  I jumped in and told him I had seen it too, that I had been following it from Quince Orchard development.   He drove a little further to the little shopping center at the end of Quince Orchard Rd. but it was gone. I don’t know who that fellow was or if he ever reported the sighting.  But I never said anything to anyone about it until I had been married for awhile.  I told my husband and my four children.

At the time I was 16, my friend 17, my sister 15 and my mother, 37.  We were on a desolate road called Read St. Read Street ran through old farm land with  a few industrial complexes along the way.  There were also big power lines in the vicinity.  We were driving by an old farm when we noticed what looked like 2 headlights coming out of the sky.  The lights were coming down towards an old field lighting up a dilapidated barn.  The lights were so bright that we couldn’t make out the shape of the object so we assumed it was a small plane or helicopter making an emergency landing in the field.  My mother slowed down just in case we needed to lend a hand as there were no other cars around (which wasn’t unusual).  Suddenly,  the object stopped descending and became level.  It was then that we saw the actual shape and size of this object.  It was slowly moving towards us.  The object was silver, an immense disk with a big reddish bulging light on the bottom and little white lights around its widest section.  It hovered. At this point, I started yelling at my mother telling her to drive away.  I was pushing her seat from behind (I was in the back seat) and telling her ""go, go, go!!""  She stayed put and to this day, she can't explain why she didn’t drive away.  The craft made no sound at all despite being no more than 80ft above us.  (my mother smoked so she had her window cracked)  It stopped and hovered above us just ahead of our car where we could all see it.  When my mother finally started to drive (slowly) the craft mimicked our movements forward.  Then in one swish, it moved to the left side of the car, and hovered over a small stand of trees which it illuminated.  It stayed there for about 15 seconds then whisked away over the trees and out of sight. We were all very shaken and upset and after dropping my girlfriend off, we went home and my mother immediately called the police.  The local police station literally answered the phone ""UFO Hotline"" in a joking manner (Attleboro was a small town back then!)  My mom reluctantly told the officer about our sighting and he indicated that there had been many calls that night and that an officer was sent to check things out.   The next day, there was a tiny blurb in our local paper about the area of Read Street losing power over night.  It went on to say that the outage was due to a squirrel eating through a rotted power box. My mother, sister and I still talk about that night but overall, I've been reluctant to share my experience with others simply because of the stigma that comes along with such an admission.  I don’t know what we encountered that night but to this day, I've never seen anything like it nor have I seen any technology that comes close to what we saw that December night.

U.F.O Sighting My Story:  I would like to preface my experience by stating emphatically, “this is the absolute truth, I have no interest in mocking this subject or those whom may have had similar experiences. When I was 17 my cousin and I were interested in armature astronomy.  Our parents had purchased each of us new telescopes for Christmas that year.  We use to memorize all the constellations and view the night sky together occasionally.  That summer our families were vacationing at my parents’ cottage on Beaver Island MI.  We had supposed that the latitude of the island, being farther north than our regular homes, would allow us to see the aurora.  The night in question she and I went down to Donegal bay to view the aurora.  The beach faced west toward a smaller uninhabited island called High Island.  We were told that the best way to see the aurora from the island was to look northwest between 10:30 and 2:00.  We set up our telescopes on a small dune – grass mound about 40 yards from the shore, slightly elevated, and close to the car.  We did in fact see the aurora that night; it was a shimmering folded mass of light in the very upper atmosphere.  It was not to be confused ! with what happened after about an hour of our beach sky watching. High Island is roughly 3-4 miles from where we were sitting on the hood of my parents' old station wagon.  While watching the sky and chatting with my cousin, I saw what looked like a fire on High Island.  It was definitely at the level of the water, and it silently erupted into a long line of fire red light.  In fact I was alarmed, I could not tell if it was on the island itself or over the water (the light was coming from High Island bay at the north east end of High Island).  Initially I thought perhaps either the island was burning, or one of the passing ships had an accident and was in flames.  The light started as a small point like a bon fire on the shore and rapidly grew into a long line of connected orbs like a great burning dragon.  I think the ambiguity I saw was because of the distance, the truth of what it was became evident shortly.  I was so alarmed at this point I tried to use the old style cell phone we had in the car to call the sheriff and report a fire! on High Island.  However, when I tried to use the phone there was oddly no signal.  Later that night, when we returned to the cottage, we called the Charlevoix fire dept., and tried to report what we saw but were dismissed. After perhaps five minutes the string of light started to raise itself above the water level in the distance.  It was a very quiet night and I heard no sound from this U.F.O.  Then it very gracefully started getting closer to our position on the beach, and we started getting very scared.  It came slowly toward us, and as it ventured closer we could see that it was a machine.  The water was flat and calm, it was a dark night and the only light came from the craft.  It was definitely a machine.  Its proportions were symmetrical, and its hull was black.  Image, if you will, standing on a large beach on a quite night and seeing this machine quietly coming over the water directly toward you slowly.  It was frightening for me; in fact I can remember crouching next to the car while gazing up at it as it passed directly overhead.  It was moving slowly, perhaps 15 -20 miles an hour.  It was perhaps 150 feet above us, not far above the trees as it passed south east over Beaver Island! .  When it was directly overhead I could hear a faint humming, and felt a strange tingling, maybe the craft maybe my nerves?  These figures are estimates.  I believe it was fairly large perhaps 50 yards across its lower aspect.  It was a perfect equilateral triangle, and I mean each of the three sides was approximately 50 yards across.  The red lights were in fact three reddish - purple spheres each placed at the points of the triangle.  The center of this appeared somewhat domed, not like the typical U.F.O curvature though.  It was shaped as if someone made a very gradual domed pancake like structure in the Y axis and an equilateral triangle in the x axis.  I wish I could have had a better look at it, but it was pitch black and the lighted structures within it obscured more detail in that setting.  The sound it made was only audible when it was directly overhead, and it was a very faint, rhythmic, low frequency humming.  I have never heard anything quite like it and have d! ifficulty comparing it to anything.  It was vaguely like the s! ound you hear when you drop something very heavy on well compacted soil.  From the moment we saw it start moving in our direction to the moment it passed over the trees on the bluffs behind the bay it moved slowly and very steadily.  Its course did not vary one millimeter, it flew straight and true.  I was absolutely amazed that it flew overhead.  I believe whoever was in control of that craft was aware of our presence. Immediately after it had passed my cousin and I were wired, scared and exited we drove back to the cottage to report the events to our families.  We explained what had happened and the reaction was obvious disbelief.  My mother kept trying to convince me I had seen an air plane or something like that.  The fact is I grew up around airplanes, my grandfather, and father are both private pilots.  In fact to get to Beaver Island we would fly over the lake in one of their planes.  I was flying in airplanes since I was an infant.  I use to help my grandfather Windex every square inch of his airplane at my uncle’s airport.  I can say with absolute certainty that this was not an airplane.  This vehicle was not held aloft by aerodynamic means, nor was it propelled by forcing air or any other matter in a vectored manner.  It was a craft half the size of a football field that moved so quietly you could hear a pin drop standing 150 feet below it. I know people believe my story is absurd.  In fact, whenever I mention this to my cousin she gets nervous and suppresses the memory.  I believe she is afraid of this event.  I think it was more traumatic for her than I.  I know in my heart that these beings were aware of our presence, and if they wished us any ill will I would not be alive right now.  There was no one else on the bay that night except us, and we could have disappeared without a trace if that was their intention.  Whoever they were I know they are kind and intelligent.  They are aware enough of our human culture to recognize two youths alone on the beach with telescopes trying to understand the universe in our own small way.  It is my belief that they wanted to show us some kindness, and inspire us by flying by.  They gave me just enough proof to believe in the possibilities.  They could have chosen 359 other degrees to fly along, but for some reason they flew along the one that led over our heads. No pun in! tended. In conclusion, I would like to thank you for this forum to report my experience.  It changed my life, and I always wanted to share this with someone who would be receptive to the possibility.  I wish I could give you my details, but understand your concerns for privacy.  I know I have no proof to offer you, but on further reflection you may wish to investigate the Beaver Island Moon Rocks.  They are a group of stones carved in some language that predates the Native American’s, who had no written language anyway, and glow at night.  They are on Beaver Island and are said to be involved in several plane crashes.  Apparently the tribes that found them used the rocks for rituals such as the birth, death, marriage stones etc….  Beaver Island has many strange historical characteristics, it may be related. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-05-12T00:00:00,,

At first I thought it was a massive gas flare that we often see at the elk hills oil and gas facility. I had realized that this object was too high to be a natural gas flare. The large round orange object appeared to be hovering above the southwest corner of the elk hills oilfield near the elk hills power generation facility.  After sitting still for 10-15 seconds, the object began to gain altitude moving south east while it gained altitude. As it gained altitude the orange light got extremely brighter. At this point I noticed some vehicle pulling over to view the object. As we passed Elk Hills road the object was directly over us still climbing. The objects bright orange then faded to light orange then to a light blue. The object then disappeared. The object did not fade out, it disappeared in an instance. At the time the object disappeared we had pulled over on midway road and were looking east to see the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs. (Pacific).

It was totally silent. I ran across the yard and told my mom to ""come quick I see a UFO"". Before she could get out side the object changed direction from coming directly to me and started moving toward the west over the ocean. As it moved it began to diminish in intensity and started to move faster. My mom and I began to try to explain what it could possibly be but it was clear it fit no identifiable explanation. As it continued to move westward it began to blink out then it would flare up again. It did this 3 or 4 times then just didn't come back.

I did not report it at the time, but wrote down my observations and kept them in my personal records.  This is what I wrote at the time.  All of a sudden I'm hit with this urge to go outside and look for the Araki-Alcock Comet.  No sooner do I locate the Big Dipper, where the comet is supposed to appear, than I see something quite different and quite inexplicable. Soaring silently across the night sky is what appears to be a single object, or perhaps three objects moving in tandem. It moves due north at a very rapid speed without making a sound. I wait for a time to see if there are any sounds of jet engines.  There are none.  All is silent. What I actually saw were three faint points of light suggesting a triangular structure.  The lights are grayish, like no aircraft lighting I have seen before, and they are steady - not pulsing. All three lights move at the same rate of speed.  One is in front and two are directly behind, horizontal to one another.  The three together suggest the ""therefore"" symbol used in philosophy. The eerie thing is their rapid steady speed and their total silence.  And their dimness. Also - if the object was moving at the same altitude as an ascending jet (from Sea-Tac Airport) it would have to be enormous. (Two days later, I wrote the following)  I still can recall the incident vividly, and in retrospect I can see that my description of it was somewhat jumbled in my attempt to get it down quickly.  I feel I should add, or rather stress, the following points:  Whatever I saw gave the impression of being a single triangular object. It was a clear and starry night, at least two or three hours after sunset.  When the object came into my field of vision, I was standing in a short driveway that passes directly in front of my front porch.  I was facing north. It was the object's motion that initially caught my eye, for it made not a sound.  It was almost directly overhead, traveling at a steady high speed from south to north.  I watched it until it disappeared behind the branches of a large cedar tree in the front yard of my neighbor's house.  The object was visible to me for a total of no more than five seconds. My initial impression on seeing the object was that it was a single, solid triangular-shaped craft.  Only later, after examining the possibilities, did I also realize it could have been three separate objects moving in perfect unison, with each separate object representing the three points of the triangle. I still believe it was most likely a single, triangle-shaped object of a rather impressive size. After the object disappeared from my view, I waited for a time, listening for the sound of a jet engine or engines.  It never came.  There was nothing but silence. For the next two or three minutes, I went out and watched the same area of sky where I had seen the object. It never reappeared. (I am a journalist and news reporter - in other words, a trained observer.  I did not report this incident at the time it happened because the Internet was not available and also because I thought it would jeopardize my career, which was just starting at that time.)

They did not blink.  At the speed of a regular plane it went to the middle of the lake, stopped and hovered for what seemed like a few minutes.  It raised itself up and down, and then took off at an incredibly high rate of speed.  It disappeared in a second or two. We talked about it, trying to decide what it was.  My husband is well read on aircraft, and couldn’t match it to any he knew.  Years later we thought it might have been a Stealth bomber on a test run, but the light configuration, manoeuvrability and speed did not match.  Also, what we saw was much larger. I have never forgotten the incident, and it remains clear in my mind to this day.  I still wonder what it was.",2011-05-12T00:00:00,53.52298881322957,-113.5039614461738

Ive been seeing these ufos for over a year now so when i saw it i knew to run to my car and get my camera(that i carry with me all the time now).   On the way to the car i spot another brighter white star below i to the right.  So im looking back and fourth between my daughter(8yrs old) and the two white orbs, when out of thin air a third red orb appears to the right of the white orbs.  They are approaching my location from the east at about the speed of a small plane, at this point im running to my car for camera.  When i get my camera they are just about overhead, the first orb i spotted is quite faint and looks like a small star at a high altitude. The other two however, to my amazement, have changed thier shape.  They appear like two small crescent moons, one bright white the other bright red, and they are slowly spinning.  The spinning motion is not constant, the spinning is fast at times then! slow at other times, going one way then the other.  Both the red and white ""moons"" are spining but independently, at this point even my daughter is kinda freaking out.  The other star like one was still slightly off to the left of the two spinning ""moons"" but kinda just floated along with them from the east to the west.  So now these things are above me and i actually can see them in my cameras view finder.  I do get 8 pictures of the two spinning moon like objects and accidently get a 2sec video. When i got the pics home and inspected them closer i was excited, although the pics don't do the sighting justice some of the detail when zoomed in i could not see with the naked eye.  After seeing the detail ive concluded that they were not only spining they were changing shape. In the pictures you will see the two spining/changing ones, but the third starlike one was there above to the left out of view.  The sighting ended with the object flying over the homes/trees that i was standi! ng next to and out of sight. The only thing i would like to ad! d was as im on the sidewalk next to my daughter,taking pictures and both of us looking up, about a dozen kids with parents also leaving the school walked by me. Almost as amazing as the ufos flying above my head was that NOT ONE person asked me what we were taking pictures of or even bothered to look up to see what i was looking at for almost 5 min. This truly disturbed me, i wanted to scream look up, but it just felt awkward so i didn't. In retrospect i wish i would have tho. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the objects are clusters of balloons.

I happened to listen to Jeff's show tonite  and  so i finally  decided to tell my story here . This  happened  in the summer of either 1973 or '74. As i was driving towards the outskirts of the city in a souteastern direction and suddenly i saw a large sphere/fireball-like object rising above the rooftops in the distance . i was almost panikstrucken and so pulled into the next sidestreet, halted the car as fast as i could, while keeping my eyes on the object . it slowly ascended straight up . As far as size, all i can say is  it was the size of the moon! only brighter.  And distance, i assume it was more then a mile away, maybe several miles. So to my judgement  it must have been the size of a house, possibly larger . i remember leaning to with my back to the car, eyes riveted to that thing for almost one hour, till it shrunk the size of the stars. At that altitude it  appeared shifting in all directions, but i assume that was due to the atmosphere, or my eyes being tired concentrating on it. this is what i saw, and to this day i havent found an explenation. . I also  would like  to mention that  i dont believe in UFO's , at least in the 90++% of the materiel thats being reported .. but what i saw that evening was big and it was real.(at lest to me it was)  Jeff was urging his audience to report things, so here is my story . and it is NOT a hoax!!! lol  Oh! almost forgot..    the next day i took my friend Rudy and his gf to the site and we wondered for hours thru bushes, tall grasses and  along the Mures riverbank, but didn't see anything unusual . I have to say at times i kinda felt a bit embarrassed  .. :-)  this isen't easy to tell people, so therefor i mostly kept it to myself. regards, ((initials deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was in the back yard of our home in Rogersville, Tennessee, with my father, an ex-Marine Corps fighter pilot Captain and dive bomber who served 4 1/2 years in WWII in the Pacific theatre, surviving the Battle of Midway.  Dad had become an attorney after the War and still was always curious about, and knew alot about the stars and constellations.  He was helping me get used to focusing the telescope and learning about some of the major stars and biggest consellations. At approximately 9:30 pm or so, as my father was peering through the telescope searching for Cygnus, he suddenly snapped away from the telescope and stood straight up rigid.  He was nornmally a very reserved, almost stoic man of unflappable nature, but he scared me when he raised his voice and started pointing at the sky, telling me to ""Look!*** Look!***   What in the world is that??!!""    He was wearing his old set of ""Stellar"" binoculars around his neck and raised them hurriedly to get a closer visual on what I could plainly see with my naked eye was an intense red point of light that moved across the entire sky in a zip-flash, stopped momentarily, zip-flashed away in a another straight line direction to a different point on the opposite end of the sky, remain there a moment and then zipped off straight to yet another opposing several points in the sky.  It finally left the last position we saw it stop at for a second and then zipped off and vanished.  The light was relatively tiny, but shown as brightly in that star-filled Christmas night as a red laser pointer on a black chalkboard in an unlit classroom. In modern-techno hindsight, the pattern the light followed would suggest it was intentionally, purposefully and confidently moving with deliberation to predetermined and precise points in the sky while mapping and recording waypoints in what one could reasonably assume was some form of GPS system. My father had never shown me animated and unrestrained excitement/concern over an event like that before, as he did that Christmas night.  In fact, he was so impressed with what we had seen that he felt the duty as a former Marine Pilot to pick up the phone and call directly to the Pentagon in Washington, DC that Christmas night to report, describe, time and date the event.  I remember he had to go through several different people until he got to someone who would take the information, and I know this personally because I sat right beside him and overheard him as he spoke to whoever was on the other line, whose voice(s) I could also faintly hear through the receiver.   Again, I remember it so vividly also because it was the first time in my life I ever had heard my father identify himself as ""former Marine Corps Captain******* with the *****Unit, Naval Fleet**** Pacific Command"" and proceeded to give them his specific official military number he still repeated from memory.  That! fact alone impressed me as much as anything.  Likewise, when he hung up, Dad said he was glad he called, but had been told that apparently a number of other people had been calling and reporting the same thing, although he had been assured by the Pentagon Official that if they ever determined what it was, that ""they would certainly inform him {Captain****]of their findings.""   That call or following letter was never made or sent, as one would now expect. I've always wondered throughout my life if a FOIA request would ever produce official records of that memorable sighting and subsequent phone call to the Pentagon by my now long-dead Marine Corps dive bomber Dad (along with all the other callers, too.)  The realist in me says that if those records even existed, it would take a literal Act of Congress to get them produced and released, if even then.

Michigan Street and Porto Alegre I’m a college student in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was around 6:26 P.M. on 11/7/2010 when I was standing on the sidewalk of W. Michigan Street that lead back to campus apartment housing at IUPUI (my college).  We usually have a lot of airplanes and helicopters around here, and at first I thought it was an airplane until I realized that it was flying way too low, but then I realized that it must have been a helicopter. I couldn’t have been more wrong I realized, as I looked up and saw a circular object flying right up above me, moving straight in the direction I was facing. It was huge, and if a full moon were out, I would have to say that from my perspective, I would have to say that maybe 15-17 full moons would be equal to the size of it. I’d like to give a better comparison, but I was in a state of shock. I did spend what felt like a long time gazing at it, although in actuality, only about 2 minutes had passed. The sky was clear, but being in the city, it appears as pitch black because of the city lights. It was either flying really low, or it was extremely huge.  I feel stupid for not thinking about getting a picture, but I was in total shock, as I don’t really believe in UFOs, or at least didn’t until now, and even now I’m still skeptical. I did, however, try my best to draw a picture afterwards, even though I’m not good at drawing. The UFO had red lights on it. If I remember correctly, I’d say about 3 of 4 of them, and I believe that red light was coming from the center as well. Since I was looking up at it, all I could see was what it looked like directly underneath. It looked like the stereotypical UFO, or flying saucer, in most aspects. Besides being a perfect circle, it looked like what a mushroom looks like from underneath, whereas you can see the edges of what might be a domed top from below, and striations leading towards the center. Most of the red lights were towards th! e exterior, with the exception of the center (where the stem of a mushroom would be). Here was where more red light emitted. Two things struck me as odd that distinguished this when compared to the stereotypical portrayal. For one thing, the front of the ship had a silver section, which reminded me of a bird shape since the shape had three corners. Secondly, I think that there may have been a protrusion at the base of it, which logically made me think that maybe somebody was playing a prank and it was actually some type of blimp because of how it glided forward, but it seemed much too big to logically call it this. There was no logical explanation for what happened. I went back to the apartment building and called my grandpa to tell him what I saw because I felt like I needed to tell someone that wouldn’t make fun of me. I made this call at 6:34P.M., and stepped through the back door of the apartment complex. I was partway into the conversation when I saw the object again flying over the apartment building, even though I thought it had already passed. At this point a passerby was walking down the sidewalk and saw me looking in shock up at the sky. He then saw the object too and said that it “sure is a wide airplane”. (He didn’t see it until it was going off into the distance.) I said that “was definitely no airplane.” This second encounter lasted until 6:37P.M., so it was three minutes long. This second encounter took place on Porto Alegre Street, and again the object continued moving in the same direction until it got past the river, where it ascended up and disappeared into the sky. A girl walking a ways behind me during the first incident didn’t bother looking up because she thought it was a helicopter and was busy texting, and was shocked when I told her what I saw. I was kind of angry that she hadn’t looked up and I was the only one that saw this the first time, but I extremely glad that someone else saw it the second time to prove that I wasn’t the only person that saw it. By the way, the IUPUI campus apartments are near the Ronald McDonald House, which is not far from the hospital. This area is extremely easy to find on Google Maps, however, for some reason it doesn’t show Porto Alegre, but the street that the UFO went across to get to the river is White River Pkwy E.

I received a phone call advising me to rush outside and look to the south.  As soon as I got outside, I heard jet engines and saw an odd sight. We are ten miles from Whiteman AFB, and jets, including the B-2, often fly over at all times of day. What I saw didn’t resemble anything seen before. The first thing I noticed was three small jets with two blinking white strobes (one on each wing). In front of two of the jets and next to the other, I saw multiple solid lights, like stars, moving along with the jets. As I focused on this object, I noticed that it made a square or rectangle shape, and it was a solid object, blocking out the stars as it passed in front of them. All four craft moved from west to east, directly towards Whiteman AFB. It appeared that the jets were escorting this object, and may have been for quite some time. As all the objects got within about six miles of Whiteman AFB, the fighter jets in the back broke away and flew south, slowly, but sti! ll monitoring the object. The third jet turned off the strobes and looked as if it merged with the object. It started out to the left, but went above it, then came back down right on top of it.  After that, the third jet was never seen again. It looked like it landed on the object as if it was a flying aircraft carrier or something.  As the object continued to pass closer to Whiteman AFB, it got a little lower and began to stretch out from a square shape, to more of a rectangle shape. The object then went behind the trees and was no longer seen.  The other witnesses I was speaking to on the phone said that it continued to Whiteman AFB, where it disappeared. The other two fighter jets continued to circle the area, and more showed up. At one point, there were at least ten fighter jets in the air between Whiteman AFB, and Warrensburg. After watching the fighter jets circle a 15 mile radius around Whiteman AFB, I noticed a solid yellow light towards the east, moving north to south at a pretty high rate of speed.  The light instantly vanished and at that time I saw what I thought was a shooting star go right to where the yellow light vanished.  As I thought about it more, it seemed strange because the “shooting star” that I saw was more of a green beam of light, which didn’t resemble the typical shooting star.  I talked with the other witnesses to the event, and they saw a similar event happen with the “shooting star,” but at the north end of Whiteman, instead of the south. Later on I went outside and noticed another beam of green light go through the sky at the same angle as the previous one.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,38.7862,-93.7239

Date of Sighting:  08 Nov 2010  Approx Time of Sighting:  5:45 PM  Location:  South of Alachua Florida  Weather conditions:  Clear no clouds in the sky  Driving on County Road 235 southbound (2 passangers, 1 driver)  My wife was driving us to Newberry, FL, on County Road 235.  There has been a time change here, so it gets a little darker than usual, (no stars were visible only the moon) as it was still light out and I could see a crescent moon was shining.  I spotted what I thought to be an airplane and followed it I thought it was a little odd as it kept the same shape like a plane, I saw a red bright light flash once for 3 seconds (I thought it might be the sun reflecting off the structure) as it proceeded to pass from right to left on a similar path with the car and it was in appeared to be in-front of the car.  It took about 4 minutes for this to occur.  It was directly in front of the car by 500-600 feet at about 300 feet high.  You could make out a plane shape, but it seemed a little odd as the front of the plane looked like an arrow head. The was no smoke trails or anything and the object seemed to be high up but for the size of the plane shape it seemed odd that it looked so large.  I am familiar with aerial aircraft. The next thing I notice is an object at a 45 degree angle from us.  The original plane object is gone.  The new object was right of the moon and appeared to be hovering or hardly moving. (to the right of the car about 200 feet out and 300 feet up hovering)  It was not a plane shape but an X shape object.  By all account I would think it was a plane until It lite up along the bottom like a burner on a stove, It looked like a giant fire donut the same size as the object underneath ;and about half as thick as the object itself.  It looked to be like an X shape.  It was not some reflection from the sun as it was too bright, like a bright pinkish/red glow of a torch. It hurt your eyes to look at the flame part.  My daughter was in the back seat looking at it as I pointed it out that something strange was in the sky.  We watched it (3-4 seconds) as it powered up with a clean burning flame on the bottom then a tree blocked our view and 2 secs later it was gone.  (The bottom lit up, 4 trees blocked our view, and looked and it was gone.)  No planes could be seen in the sky or surrounding area I had a view of 50 degrees or so. I know this sounds odd, but I got the feeling what I was looking at was not there.  The image of the x shape craft looked dark and shimmery, but the fire burner shape flame underneath was the clear part of the craft.   I know what flares look like in the sky, I know what helicopters look like, and I know what jets and planes look like.  This was something that could hover and shoot a clean flame underneath.  It seemed to be like powered up.  It was like seeing a fluorescent sign.  It was really bright.  I dont' see how anyone could of missed it. I tried to disprove or explain what I saw. About 5 miles in the same direction as the object we later saw a tower (in Newberry) with a red light flashing it was about 75 feet tall.  This could not be seen from our vantage point of what we were seeing.  About 8 minutes later when we parked at ""BackYard BBQ"" (where we were eating) we noticed a high flying jet arrived in the area, really high up that left 2 trails.  It was flying south. If the ufo was higher in the sky I might of been able to write it off as a satellite or something but it was only like 300 feet off the ground and not far from our car.  My daughter saw this thing as well. Maybe we have aircraft that has a giant circular engine along the bottom  It was like the same length as the object itself no lights could be seen on the object, just the clean flame along the bottom.  Then 2 seconds later it is gone from the entire sky view. no clouds nothing but the moon. Along the road, after you pass a rock plant, there is no businesses or lights and the road follows along the side of rail road tracks. I am reporting this in the event someone else sees the same thing in the area.  I tried to give as much detail as I could.",2010-11-21T00:00:00,29.811923636363638,-82.48849636363636

I was released from the San Jose hospital on December 9th in the afternoon and it was a very nice sunny day with no clouds in the sky and shortly after arriving to my home I was resting in a chair in my back yard facing to the South at around 4pm when all of the sudden I noticed two oval shaped objects come into my vision from deep in the Western sky.  They were traveling together and within very close proximity of each other just as two side by side blue angel jets do when they fly in tandem formation during air shows. After they had caught my eyes attention, I focused directly on them for approximately 7 seconds as they went from the far right hand side of the Western sky all the way to the left of the Eastern sky.  I tried to get my friend’s attention who was standing to my left and facing me to turn around and look at the two fast flying ufo’s.   As he had turned to face them, they were already two thirds the way across the sky which caused me to get up out of my chair and walk forward passing by my friend to catch the last glimpse of them as they went over the far Eastern hills. The two ufo’s were traveling at approximately 4,000 feet above the ground and were about 3 miles or so out away from my home and seemed to be traveling at a speed of at least 1,000 plus miles per hour as it appeared from the distance that they had covered in such a quick time. The way I figured their speed at about 1,000 plus miles an hour is because I lived near the San Jose airport which is about 2 miles North West of the home that I was living in at the time and I use to watch the incoming and out going planes flying overhead all of the time in the sky at about the same distance that I had watched the two oval shaped ufo’s flying and they don’t cover anywhere near the distance of skyline in such a short period of time that the two ufo’s did in that day of December!   Everything that I have mentioned in this statement is 100% true and as accurate as I can remember.

The UFO then appeared to shoot straight up at great speed, and then out of sight.  The substance has been sent to a plant pathologist in Overton for evaluation. Athens Review,  May 26, 2011    ""Space aliens in Athens?""  Trying to explain a UFO sighting ain’t easy.   Art Lawler    The Athens Review The Athens Daily Review Thu May 26, 2011, 07:48 PM CDT  ATHENS  The staff here at the Daily Planet ... uh ...  Review, was working the day watch out on council meetings Wednesday morning when the phone rang. Editor xxxxxxxx picked up the receiver, and heard the voice of one xxxxxxxxxxxx. The editor began taking notes, as he learned of four unidentified-flying objects that the man believed had landed briefly just west of Athens Housing, located in front of the Loop 7 underpass on the east side, off U.S. Highway 175. ""Yes sir, we'll check that out,"" the editor promised the caller. It was Thursday that the editor ordered this reporter to get to the bottom of this story. ""Call this guy, and see what the heck's going on.  And if you go out there, don't get distracted, and stop at those phone booths that always hold you up,"" he said. I told the editor that we don’t have that many phone booths anymore. ""Hello,  the man carrying the voice of Mr. xxxxxxxxx said. ""Heard you spotted a UFO, sir.  We're calling to the get the facts,"" the reporter said. ""This is really embarrassing,"" xxxxxxx said.  ""We started not to say anything about this to anybody.""  ""Why's that, Sir?""   ""Everybody will think we're crazy,"" he said. ""Naw, naw,"" the reporter said, reassuringly.  ""Now sir, we need to get to the bottom of this.  Were the eyes of the aliens green, and were they bald-headed and wrinkled?  If you could just give us a quick description, Sir. ""We didn't see any faces.""   ""I see.""   ""We saw four lights.""   ""Who's we?""  The man nervously explained that ((female name deleted)),  the owner of ((deleted)) Housing, and he were sitting on the front porch of the office smoking cigarettes when it happened late Tuesday night. ""They (the UFOs) appeared to be about 10 to 15 feet in diameter.""   ""That's a guesstimate, I suppose?   ""Yes, but they looked like they were the same size as the four circles on the ground on the other side of the lot.""  ""Circles?  What kind of circles, Sir?""   The man explained that it appeared four UFOs could have stopped there under the power lines. ""We're not crazy, Sir. Really.  I don't believe in UFOs, and I've never had anything like this happen to me before.""   ""Did you say it was cigarettes you were smoking?""   "" Yes Sir. Why?""   ""No reason. Just curious. So, what's your evidence, Mr. xxxxxxx?""   He explained the line that made the circle felt like a soft, powdery substance, something like graphite.  He said it did no damage to the bermuda grass beneath it. Under further questioning, Ms. xxxxx and Mr. xxxxxxx explained they hadn't seen the circles on Tuesday night.  What they did see, both of them individually, was four lights at close range.  They too were 10 to 15 feet in diameter. They were said to have flown around the side of the lot, making a left turn, then stopping just above another power line, where they are described as having stared at the two humans for about 15 seconds. Either that, or it was suggested they could have been drawing more energy from the power line they were a few feet above. ""I promise you, we're not crazy,"" said Ms. xxxxx.   ""It looked like they were sitting on top of the power line, and that we scared them off.""   How did the UFO leave ma'am?   ""After they saw us, they formed a perfect diamond, and then went straight up in the air very fast and disappeared.""   Attempts were made to photograph the dark circles, but they're hard to see in a photograph.  But they are there. Mr. xxxxxxx scooped up some of the powdery substance, and poured it into a Land O Lakes All Natural Whipped Butter container, so people could see it better.  No one at the Review wanted to touch it. The reporter assured the couple he wouldn't make them look crazy.   He, in fact, saw the same circle, felt the substance, and can verify it was there. As for the lights, they're on their own about that.  Suggestions like a car turning around with its four lights on bright, was dismissed. More proof was needed to identify the substance.  Henderson County Extension Agent xxxx xxxxxx, was called to the site to look and sniff and diagnose. He said he thinks it's a fungus, but he sent samples of the circle dust to a plant pathologist in Overton, and expects to get results back in two or three days. Pressed as to how a fungus could make perfectly-round circles, xxxxxx reminded the reporter that the fungus is alive. And apparently it has the sense to make perfect, geometric circles.  ""It's very common,"" xxxxxx said. The county extension agent didn't dismiss the two sightings by the two citizens, because he had read an article recently in the Longview paper. ""There was a sighting just about like this one recently in Longview,"" he said, ""They saw lights, and they found marks on the ground.""   But xxxxxx was adamant that he was not making any evaluation of any alleged lights, and what they were all about. ""I'm just talking about stuff within my bailiwick,"" he said.  ""I'm just commenting on the lights.""   ""I promise you we are not crazy,"" Ms. xxxxx said, again. ""Yes ma'am,"" the reporter said.  ""You definitely saw something, and with what happened in Longview recently, maybe somebody else can explain what has been happening in the East Texas sky recently.""  One thing seemed certain late Thursday evening. xxxxxx will get to the bottom of this thing.

The fireball seemed to only be illuminated for approximately two to three seconds before it flared out. It was bright orange in color and seemed to be fairly close to the ground.  Being that it was only visible for only a couple of seconds, it was hard to gauge size and distance; however, I would have to approximate that it was larger than a basketball and around 1000 yards up.",2011-01-31T00:00:00,35.0751,-83.2101

We criscrossed the USA playing music, groovin' with the groupies and partaking of the various indigenous plant life. We were in Arizona playing at a local club just outside of Phoenix, can't recall the name of the place, but it was a stone cold groove that night!   After the gig around 2 or 3 AM we were hanging out in the van having some 'sandwiches' when one of the guys noticed a bright light in the distance.  We all thought it was the cops cause it was so bright, like a search light. Being ever suspicious of the 'man' back then, we stowed our 'sandwiches' and waited.  Well it didn't take long before we realized it was not a cop car search light.  But something we could not explain. At first I thought maybe it was the 'sandwiches' but I wasn't the only one that saw this thing.  Some of us started giggling uncontrollably, I wet myself, and our sound guy fainted.

I can't talk about what all they did, I think I blocked it out to keep my sanity.  However I had the a sour stomach for a couple of weeks afterwards, difficulty urinating.  Kind of a cruel preview of how things are for me at age 60. I don't remember being returned to the van, but we all woke up in the van naked, which in itself was quite traumatic.  Several hours had passed, but none of us could clearly recall what happened. None of use ever talked about what happened that night, it was too weird and strange, even for the 60's, and that is saying something. I know this all sounds crazy, but it REALLY DID happen.

I apologize for some of the story I cannot remember for whatever reason I don’t know.  The things I cannot remember are the exact date and time this event happened and how many lights there were.  My mind is also kinda fogged as to what colors of lights were involved.  I always wondered if just being in the presence of this UFO had something to do with my memory being fogged because I generally have a clear memory of events in my life.  What I can say is that I know it was the mid 1990's and it was late I would guess midnight.  Though it may seem hard to believe but I was a smoker at the age of 12 on up and my parents were very upset about that but I did it anyhow because I was kind of a ""get what I want"" child.  They did not support my habit but ! I just kinda did what I wanted regardless of consequences. Anyhow, they wouldn't allow it in the house and I took it outside on the small deck.  I lit a cigarette and began smoking and just listening to the night sounds of crickets and frogs everywhere.  Then suddenly I saw a raccoon running from a hedgerow across the road and towards a barn.  When it got into the night shadows of the barn I lost sight of it and that’s when these huge lights appeared suspended and perfectly still with no movement to them just above the rooftop of this barn.  And just as it appeared I instantly noticed that every night sound I was hearing before came to an erie dead silence.  It was a very chilling moment and I was so scared I could not move and I could not yell or scream.  I tried moving and yelling but it was like my mind was sending my body the signals and my body was not complying to what I wanted to do.  The cigarette I had just lit burned all the way to the filter and died out.  The li! ghts were there for about 15 very long minutes it seemed.  And! during this 15 minutes I had plenty of time to determine that it was not fitting any description of anything man made that I knew of.  I could not hear any noise coming from an engine of any type, if it had an engine that is.  I thought, if it were a helicopter that I would be seeing some movement in the lights even if it were hovering and it too would have an engine.  I thought, what on earth could make all the crickets and all the frogs come to a dead silence.  I thought of the raccoon and maybe it had some part in this things appearance but what would a raccoon have to do with lights in the sky, didn't make sense.  The lights on this thing were so blinding that I literally could not see what was casting them.  I saw no shape or silhouette behind them because it was a brightness I have never seen before.  I know there were white lights for sure and there was another color light.  I wanna say the other color was red but I cant be sure of that because this is where my memory is par! tly fogged.  And so I stared at it wondering whats to come next and after about 15 minutes it just vanished into nothing and the night sounds of nature came slowly until it was as if nothing ever happened.  Sadly enough I don’t have any evidence of this because I didn't own a cell phone with a camera on it like I have now days because that technology didn't yet exist in people's everyday life then.  I didn't have any other type of camera either because I had no reason to ever carry one.  Even if I had a camera, I highly doubt I would have photographic evidence of this because I simply could not move my body while it was happening and that’s all I got, thank you.

I can't remember exactly what time it was, but it must have been after 10pm because it was very dark. It was the summer, I think, because it was warm. We had the windows down and the car was running. We were listening to the radio. At this landing, there is a man-made pond that the boat storage that kind of buffers it. There is a street light that is the only one back near this storage place. At this time, there were no houses around the storage unit. We both saw the bushes around the pond moving, and we both got really scared. Then, this object shot up out of the water/bushes. It wasnt very big,maybe the size of my car. It made no noise at all. I remember asking him what it was. It had lights on it, red and white. It moved over the car, and a white light beam came from under it. It slowed over my car. Then it sped of and disappeared behind the trees. We! both agreed we should leave. The next day I called him to ask if he remembered what we saw. He confirmed everything I remembered from the previous night. I still don't know what to make of that experience. I know it happened.

I never thought to report this incident as I always assumed that what I saw back in 1996 was just some type of top secret Department of Defense aircraft. But now all these years later I wonder if what I actually saw on that day was man-made or possibly alien.  I had come back from our little rural grocery store after spending the day at the lake with my children and a neighbor child. I was driving down the country two lane road in my little Toyota car and was about a block before my property when I noticed a strange object hovering almost tree level above my neighbor’s mobile home which sat on 5 wooded acres of land. The tops of the trees were moving violently like they do in a strong wind storm. I was baffled over what it could be and immediately stopped the car in the middle of the road. I was about 200 feet away and looking up at it through my windowshield. It was large, completely black and triangular in appearance. It hovered completely still over the property, but I detected a strange humming noise coming from its direction. It appeared very flat on the bottom from the angle I was looking at it. I was then stunned to see a huge intense white/light blue beam turn on suddenly pointing directly down on the neighbors home. I can! not give an exact width of this beam because of my distance, but it may have been anywhere between 10 to 20 feet wide. Even with the trees the craft was very visible. It hovered over the neighbors home for about a minute.  The four children in the car with me were; my 3 year old son in the front passenger seat, along with my 5 year old daughter, 13 year old daughter and 13 year old neighbor girl in the back seats. They wanted to know why I had stopped the car and I pointed at the craft excitedly. They got very excited when they saw it and rolled down the car windows. At this point the craft turned off the beam and slowly turned, like on pivot, until one of the points of the triangle was facing in our direction. At this time it smoothly flew toward us and stopped directly over the car hovering just above the tree line. The kids were hanging out the window very excited asking me what it was. I didn’t know what to tell them and told them to stay in the car and not open the doors. I did not feel any heat or wind from the craft as it hovered above my car, but the tree tops swung wildly.  It was so glossy and black underneath almost like a mirror, but nothing reflected back at it, not the car or trees or road below it. I saw no propellers, engines or helicopter like blades on the craft. The bottom was very smooth and shiny, like glass. The humming noise coming from it, as it hovered above our car, was the lowest note I have ever heard in my life and I am a musician. It felt like it was penetrating every part of my body with its low hum. I felt like my teeth were vibrating inside my head. The hum was very powerful and it caused vibrations, it felt like I was inside a huge amplifier. All the junk that I had on the dashboard, sunglasses, snacks, little toys for the kids etc. started to bounce around from the vibration that the hum was creating.  The craft hovered above us for a couple minutes then it simply pivoted with one of the points of the triangle pointing down the side street , then proceeded in the direction that the triangular point was now facing and then slowly started to pick up speed. When it flew away it moved like it was under water. It is hard to describe this movement, but it went up and down three times in a graceful smooth wavelike motion as it was flying away, kind of like the motion of a large sea creature underwater. The tree tops swayed violently as it passed over them. When it got to the end of the block, it suddenly picked up great speed skirting just above the tree line and was gone.  At this point I was really excited and a little shocked too at what I had just witnessed, so I drove quickly home which only took about half a minute. My husband was there with some friends rewiring our house and we excitedly told everybody what we had just seen and asked if they had seen the strange craft too. They thought we were joking and no one believed us. I insisted that what I saw was real. Just for my credibility, I do not drink alcohol or a use drugs, so was not hallucinating. I could not make any of the people present at my house believe what I had just seen and was very surprised that none of them had seen the craft either, although they were all inside working at the time. My husband thought I had put the kids up to ‘a little joke’ on Dad about UFO’s.  Fast forward to the very next morning, my husband had gone down to the small town store early around 7am. He came back from the store and woke me up as I was still asleep all excited and saying, “Honey, I saw it too! I completely believe you now!” Apparently, he had just gone down to the store and had to use the payphone, we did not have a cell phone at this time. In the middle of his phone call he heard this very loud sound with a low hum. He noticed that the phone booth, one of those old ones with glass side windows was vibrating. He looked around for the culprit of this annoying noise, because he could not hear the person who he was talking to. He was going to tell this inconsiderate person to please turn off their vehicle so he could complete his phone call. But, there were no other vehicles in the parking lot except his truck which was turned off. That is when he looked up and saw that exact same black, shiny triangular craft hovering above him and the store. He stated ! that he believes it was at least 50 feet from point to point, and possibly as much as 70 feet. He was so shocked to see it, but believes it was longer than the width of our house which is 48 feet. He is a general contractor so is pretty good at judging distances, but of course he joked later that even with his tape measure it would have been inadequate to measure the craft as he was shaking so badly from the shock of seeing it. He saw no engines, propellers or blades either and could not figure out how it could just hover like that completely still. It stayed above him and the store for a minute and then pivoted on its triangular point and flew off over the bay.  Both of these incidents happened in broad daylight. For years we believed they were just top secret aircraft from nearby McChord Air Force Base, now we are not so sure, as no one we know has ever seen anything like this before. Anyway that is my story of the day I meet the strange mysterious black, shiny craft. Oh and by the way, it was absolutely beautiful like obsidian.

Upon entering the cloud, the others went inside the school to go back to work.  I of course had to stay, never taking my eyes off of the cloud.

On August 12, 2010, my sister (a 20-year-old 3rd year university student), her boyfriend (a 22-year-old security guard), and I (a 26-year-old elementary school teacher with a master's degree) planned to watch the meteor showers at my house in Berlin Township, MI.  At about 10:30, we all laid on the deck and were enjoying the clear skies, stars, and a few meteors. Shortly after 11, my sister’s boyfriend pointed out a very bright glow (appeared golf ball sized) to the east.  We all sat up to look, at first thinking it was a meteor.  The light appeared to be getting closer.   After 30 seconds or so, we knew it wasn’t a meteor because we could see the light was coming from some type of aircraft.  It appeared to be a headlight, the beam went out into the night sky like a flashlight.  It was NOT a spotlight—it did not shine down.   The craft continued to move forward, it was moving west.  On one side of the craft was a small blue light and on the other side a small red light, similar to airplanes.   As the craft moved overhead we could see it was triangular shaped and was close, not so close where we’d be alarmed but closer than airplanes normally fly.  We watched as the craft very quietly moved west , dipped and glided toward the north, dipped down and up a few more times, and was finally out of view. We were all stunned at what we saw and returned to the deck to continue watching for meteors.  Less than 5 minutes later from the same point in the sky, the bright yellow circular glow appeared again.  We witnessed the same thing again with the same (if not very similar) flight pattern.  This time we all heard what we describe as a ""whirring"" noise.   After this one was out of view we began to walk from the front yard to the back yard again when we immediately saw another one of the exact same appearance.  This led us to believe there were minimally 2 separate crafts since our 2nd sighting had vanished only seconds earlier. My sister’s boyfriend left at 11:40 p.m..  My sister and I drove south down Dixie Highway for about 5 minutes in an attempt to find better views.  As we turned around and headed back, we had our 4th sighting. My sister’s boyfriend called shortly after midnight (8/13/10) to say he was outside of his home in Trenton, MI, and was witnessing the same yellow glow.  However, this time the glow hovered at a farther distance for several minutes.  It did not move overhead to reveal the triangular shaped aircraft, but instead simply hovered. My sister and I stayed outside until approximately 2:00 a.m. (8/13/10) and saw a few more meteors but did not have another sighting of the aircraft.  We emailed our local channel 4 news to see if anyone else reported a sighting or if there was an possibility of some type of military practice.   We haven’t heard anything back and have not found any other reports online.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,,

My boyfriend and I had stepped out of my room onto my balcony around midnight in hopes of glimpsing the Perseid meteor shower when my attention was drawn to what I thought was a very bright, multi-colored star that was blinking wildly.  Though I thought this was unusual, we dismissed it and looked elsewhere in the sky for signs of the meteors.   When I returned my attention to the star, I found that it had moved Westward and toward the horizon significantly.   We then watched its motions for several minutes, noting first to ourselves and then aloud that the object was swinging strangely from side to side.  This seemed curious especially due to its apparent distance from us.  If the presumed object seemed to us the size of a very bright star and it was performing such wide swinging motions and there was only a slight breeze that night, I assumed this might not be a conventional aircraft or an object being manipulated by air currents. Thinking the rapid movements of our eyes may have caused this pattern of movement, I scanned the sky for a star and attempted to produce the same affects but could not.  The motion seemed to be real and not a product of autokinesis. We procured my Meade ETX-70AT Telescope upon my boyfriend's suggestion.  Magnification did not clarify any apparent shape of the object.  At times it is obscured by clouds.  Before it became obscured below the treeline, we observed it erratically blinking red, white, blue, and green.  No observed trail, surrounding haze, beams, spikes, glow or what have you.  No observed heat or odor. Did not contact the police, ufo center, press, military, or nearby airports though we observed commercial aircraft concurrently.

A buddy and I were heading home from grabbing a bite to eat when we stopped at a traffic light and saw three lights moving in one direction. My friend asked if I noticed that the far left light was behaving oddly; it wasn’t flashing, but it would seemingly disappear from view at random intervals. I thought it looked like a plane, at first, but the light positions and behavior didn’t correspond with those of typical navigation lights.  Right before the light turned green, the object seemed to stop.  I was close enough to the ground to use terrestrial objects as a reference for its position.  We then began travelling towards the object on a two lane highway, leading out to the rural part of town (I gather from the way it approached that this was where it was originally, before moving towards us).  The closer we got to it, the more we realized that it had stopped moving and was hovering over a field. It was frozen in place.  The radio was at a very minimal volume and we both had our windows down.  We were more than close enough to hear a jet turbine, prop chatter, etc. At our closest point I would imagine it was roughly 125 yards out in the field. The craft was triangular in shape, but somewhat thin from a side view.  It had three lights, one on each corner of the triangle shape, and a spotlight on the front (or in the direction was moving, rather), which was casting a fading cone shape, straight ahead.  For a brief period, I also noticed a faint blue light emanating from underneath the vessel. We pulled over in a turning lane just beyond our point of perp endicularity.  As we stopped, the car behind us pulled over in the same turning lane, just ahead of us. My friend got out of the car to catch a better look, but my view was perfect from inside the car.  Shortly after stopping, the craft began floating across the road we were travelling, not quite a quarter mile behind us.  It was directly above the street; I would wager it was about 150-200 feet above the ground.  It was travelling very slow and was heading behind the shopping center we had just left. We pulled up next to the other car and asked the driver if he saw what j! ust happened. He said he just got off the phone with his girlfriend, telling her about the hovering object.  He claimed he was a seasoned pilot and began commenting on the object's triangular shape and strange hovering.  He explained how the particular craft looked and behaved unlike anything he had ever seen. Side note:  This is a tough position to be in.  I used to mock those that reported UFOs, but now, I am one of them.  My friend and I, plus the other man in the car behind us, saw something that was simply unfathomable.  This was no faded smudge from a distance or a lightning fast stream of light; this was up close and personal.",2010-08-24T00:00:00,36.837301342710994,-76.06194814578005

Although it has been 11 years, I always felt I should report this.  My head would not allow me to admit that this was anything other than a government experiment.    I had rented a car out of Palm Springs, Ca., to drive too San Francisco and fly back to Mass.  I was about a half hour out of Palm Springs, northwest on RT 10. @ approx. 9am.  I was on a long stretch through the desert that seemed never ending.  A ""very distant"" mountain range off to my left.  It was so far away, it looked small.  But I knew it was hundreds of miles away.  There was a car in front of me about 1 mile ahead. I happened to notice, all of a sudden, something in the air almost above me.  I leaned forward too look out, and up, and off to the right side of my car.  About 200-300 feet in the air was a perfect triangle shaped object just hovering there!  I said, what ((is that)), and slammed on my brakes.   I also noticed a car about a mile ahead had pulled over.  (The only other vehicle in sight)   I opened my door and got out to see this.  It was a triangle about the size of a small plane!  It was a dull black color like I have never seen before.  No windows, no lights, no rivets to support it’s construction (very smooth), no sound, no movement.  It was thicker in the middle, but didn’t look big enough for a person to be in it!   Now, this is the part that has been unsettling for me.  Next to the object was a capsule hovering next to it maybe a few feet away from the craft.  (Not Connected)   Looked like a Tylenol Capsule two tone colors and about 3 feet long!   Half was gray and the other half was purple of sort.  Keep in mind these colors were very dull with no shine to them.   The craft rotated about 90 degrees, as did the unattached capsule.   Then it shot off toward the mountain range at a speed that was unbelievable.  It went up and over the mountain range and was gone!   The mountain range was ""far"" away.   It took about 2 seconds from the time it shot off, until it was out of sight.   The unattached capsule stayed with it.  No Noise,  No air stream,  Nothing!    I got in my car and drove on.  I turned up the music and told myself it was a government thing, and tried to forget.   Over the years I have read about UFO sightings, waiting for one to describe what I had seen.   A lot of triangular shaped crafts, but ""never anything about a capsule"" somehow held close unattached, maybe by magnetic science.   The speed and lack of noise was unbelievable!   All this happened in about 40 seconds!",2011-06-12T00:00:00,33.80016511627907,-116.53537286821705

It was about twice the size of Venus (as it appears during this time of year).   At first I thought maybe it was an abnormally bright light on top of a radio tower or that it was Venus but since it was larger, brighter and had a steady glow, I started to think maybe it was a plane or helicopter falling from the sky...  It looked like a ball of fire and it moved at a slow, steady speed downwards toward the horizon (I stopped my car for a moment to make sure it was actually moving).   Then it gradually started to move diagonally towards the north, then almost completely parallel to the horizon and then down until I could no longer see it because of trees on the horizon. While I have no idea how large it was or how far away it was, it was about 40 degrees from the eastern horizon when we first saw it.  It also had a steady glow, didn't twinkle or fade out or anything.  Just stayed a constant brightness comparable to Venus's but white with a slightly orange outline and an almost burning appearance (which might not make it a steady glow... but it didn't flicker or anything.  It just seemed to ""boil"" slightly as a ball engulfed in flames would). I considered the idea that it could be something someone had shot into the air, like some sort of firework that came falling to the ground but it appeared to be very far away and thus would be quite large (I'm not sure if you can really measure the distance of something with no idea what the object is... or how large it is... so this guess is based on the fact that the trees in the horizon were probably a mile away or so).",2010-08-24T00:00:00,39.0052,-95.5572

I was up late watching the Perceids meteor shower with my main view towards the North East.  It was a beautiful, clear night with no moon.  Jupiter was hanging high over head and slightly to the south at this hour.  There were several nice meteors, two brilliant ones of note, but the rest were just tiny little streaks.  I was getting a little bit bored with looking at the same section of sky so I looked back over towards the South.  I could see Jupiter shining through the fabric of the sunshade but off to the side of the shade and directly overhead, I noticed a bright, smaller, pale, bluish, white light.  I was confused since I knew it wasn't another planet and I hadn't remembered seeing a star that was that bright.  As pondered this anomaly, it just slowly faded out.  While my eyes adjusted tracking around it's position, I then got this bizarre motion sensation which really bugged me out since I was sitting stationary.  I realized then that it wasn't me that! was moving, it was a tiny light that my eye had fixed upon, it was no brighter than the background stars, and it was moving slowly towards the South.   That's when I noticed it wasn't alone.  There were two distinct, small points of light moving perfectly in unison together with one ahead of the other at a slight angle from my perspective, there was a decent gap between the two, about an inch and a half to two inches if you measured between two fingers of an outstretched hand.   A jet flying at a high altitude with it's standard running lights flashing also happened to fly overhead a moment later, but towards the East at a completely perpendicular angle to the lights.  I don't think the jet's appearance was related, as I could tell it (the jet) was much, much closer that the lights.  What ever I was seeing had to be at an extremely high altitude, possibly in orbit or possibly in outer space.  I honestly don't know what I saw tonight but it just gave me the chills.  I thought, maybe it was two objects at first, but then I wondered, what! if it w as just one, extremely long object that was dimly illuminated at either end?  I've seen a few weird things in my life, but nothing like this.   Please don't think I'm crazy, I'm usually pretty skeptical about these things, but to actually see it with my own eyes...

Took everyone home, and by the time everyone was home, it had cleared up again, so I decided to drive back up the mountain to see the peak by myself.

It was a VERY brigh pure white light flashing so brightly it could be seen through the treeline, very low.  I waited for it to pass from behind the trees, and it raised in altitude and changed from a single white light brighter than any star in the sky to a row of 2-3 ! orange lights in a line, which seemed to pulsate or move left to right.   What scared me was the maneuverability.  This thing was flying ""S"" shaped patterns up and down over the treeline, estimated max altitude 2000 ft., apparent size as big as a pinky fingernail width at arms length.  It started flying in the same direction as the road I drove up to get to the lookout, and I got scared, so I instantly popped my trunk, folded my chair and threw it in as fast as aI could and hit the ""unlock"" button on my car.  As soon as the car unlocked, all the car lights went on, and I thought ""SH*T""!  I looked up, and the three orange lights became one much brighter orange light, almost looked like it was shining something at me, like it saw me.   I instantly hopped in my car, cranked it and tried to run in a panic... the car cranked very very slowly for a few seconds, and the lights dimmed before it started up and I drove away. I was scared because I had to drive in the direction of the thing to get out of there so I floored it very fast, narrowly missing a deer. Looked up, and at one second could see the thing through my winshield, which scared me even more. I didn;t feel safe until the road went under the dense tree canopy. There was no noise at all, and no contrails.  All I can say is, never again by myself.

I pulled my Cellphone Camera out that was seeing to get a little light in background so it would show up on camera and luckilty it was past the the brightest star in the sky.  As I was unzooming my camera from the setting I had it on when the cellphone camera was in my hands I was using a Sony Ericsson C905a Cellphone Camera.  As I was filming it went past I said Here comes a Fast one.  Than I said It's coming faster this time. Than I said as I was unzooming I said Right Past this Star. Than I said It's going right past this star Right now. Than I said shouting there it is I got it on Camera.  Than said I got it. Than I said I got you on Camera boy.  Than I said hows it going dude. Than I said Yeah. Than I said in a studdering voice it got to be a UFO.  Than I said this is not than shockingly said ohhh a Meatorite just fell down that i wish I wou! ld of got that on camera. After that the camera shuts off after 47 seconds. I caught 27 seconds on film. The 20 seconds was me getting the camera out of zoom and waiting for it to come towards a better light source that big star in the sky. There was a some what alot of shacking in the camera footage while filming. The object was half the size of the star. The Star was 85 percent brighter than the object that was moving fast. The footage was taped at 4:52 AM. Footage is hard to see it but i have good contact lenses and can see good clearly. The Bad News is when I try to send this footage named MOV00025 to my email like I do with all my videos it says when I try to send the Cellphone is reading (Cannot add Video. Message will be to Large.) File Size is only 1.4MB and that should be able to send from my Cellphone to my Email.  The video is stored in my Phone Memory as MP4 just like all my other camera footage. Why is this too large when at 5 Am I am filming another one or the ! same one that is 2.7 MB and that one will send but not worth s! ending. Why is 1.4MB to large to send and 2.7MB is ok to send from Camera phone that don't make sense I think what I was filming sent me a Virus?  I have a AVS Editor I wanted to use to edit the cellphone camera footage file so I can gett a better view on my Windows XP Computer. The transfer file area does not work with the USB 2.0 plug my Cellphone came with the software for transfer says for windows XP says can't be added to this computer when uploaded the software my cellphone came with. Sending to Video DJ on Cellphone don't work  Either. Next try to send it to a memory Card once I order one if that will work.

Last week, my boyfriend and I were on an Alaskan cruise. We are both in our mid-20s, college graduates, work regular jobs, have NO experience with UFOS or aliens.   While travelling back to port at Seattle from Victoria, BC, we happened to notice a meteor shower during the late evening of August 12th.  We ended up watching this meteor shower for several hours.  The meteors were amazing, ranging in many sizes and colors.  Around 1:40am (now Friday the 13th), my boyfriend noticed something unusual in the sky.   He saw two uniform spheres of light appear in the sky, move in a figure 8 motion, and then disappear.  He quickly tried to explain this to me in his bewildered state, but within a few seconds these two lights appeared in the sky again and we both saw them.  The spheres were always equidistant apart, as if they were attached by some invisible pole, and danced around each other very quickly and sharply.   The lights moved in a zig zag pattern, back and forth for abo! ut 5 seconds before flying a straight path over the ship and we could no longer see them from our balcony.  The lights were a little larger in comparison to the stars and seemed to appear from mid air in the sky.   We sat in shock for a very long time, trying to come up with a logical explanation, and hoping to see them again. These lights were absolutely not meteors, they moved in several different directions and left no light tail, and they were solid white lights, no blinking or shimmering.  We also thought that possible the military was trying some new type of aircraft, maybe a new invisible plane and all we could see were the two lights on it?   But there was no sound, and with the speed these lights were traveling I’d expect a very loud rocket sound.   So my theory is now that these lights were either one or two UFOs, maybe aliens use meteor showers to hide their arrivals?   I would definitely love to know if there is a logical explanation, I don’t think I will ever stop wondering what we saw and it may just drive me crazy!   This was seen while we were in the Strait of Juan Fuca/Clallam Bay near Port Angeles. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter,    Thank you for getting back to me so quickly!  I will definitely have my boyfriend prepare his own independent statement.  Its just absolutely unbelievable, I never expected to see a UFO in my entire life.  Half of me still thinks there is no way I could have seen a UFO and there has to be some explanation, but the other half knows that there is nothing on Earth I know of that moves like that, and there is no way we both could have imagined seeing the exact same thing.  To be honest, I feel a little crazy.  I've always believed in other life, its bogus to think that we are the only living planet in an unimaginably vast galaxy,  I guess I just never expected to see for myself.  Either way, it was a once in a lifetime experience and I would definitely welcome another! I will have my boyfriend, Eyad, submit his report though the web form.  Thank you again for contacting me!

The Miracle of the Sun (Portuguese: O Milagre do Sol) was an event witnessed by 30,000 to 100,000 people on 13 October 1917 in the Cova da Iria fields near Fátima, Portugal.  Those in attendance had assembled to observe what the Portuguese secular newspapers had been ridiculing for months as the absurd claim of three shepherd children that a miracle was going to occur at high-noon in the Cova da Iria on 13 October 1917. According to many witness statements, after a downfall of rain, the dark clouds broke and the sun appeared as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky.  It was said to be significantly duller than normal, and to cast multicolored lights across the landscape, the shadows on the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds.  The sun was then reported to have careened towards the earth in a zigzag pattern, frightening some of those present who thought it meant the end of the world.   Witnesses reported that their previously wet clothes became ""suddenly and completely dry, as well as the wet and muddy ground that had been previously soaked because of the rain that had been falling.  Engineers that have studied the case reckoned that an incredible amount of energy would have been necessary to dry up those pools of water that had formed on the field in a few minutes as it was reported by witnesses."" Estimates of the number of witnesses range from 30,000 to 40,000 by Avelino de Almeida, writing for the Portuguese newspaper O Século, to 100,000, estimated by Dr. Joseph Garrett, professor of natural sciences at the University of Coimbra, both of whom were present that day. The event was attributed by believers to Our Lady of Fátima, an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary to three young shepherd children in 1917, as having been predicted by the three children on 13 July, 19 August, and 13 September 1917.  The children reported that the Lady had promised them that she would on 13 October reveal her identity to them and provide a miracle ""so that all may believe.""  According to these reports, the event lasted approximately ten minutes.   The three children also reported seeing a panorama of visions, including those of Jesus, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people.  Doubts from skeptics have been raised about the uniqueness and causes of the event.",2011-03-23T00:00:00,,

This happened during the summer in 1958 in Ft. Worth, TX.  I can’t remember the exact date since this happen almost 53 years ago, but I will never forget the moment I saw a UFO up close and in such explicit detail.  The colors and the moving parts of the spacecrafts. I lived in the only two-story house on my block when I was 8 years old.  My double bedroom window faced the East. I always had to go to bed at 8 PM.  As I was climbing the stairs I began to hear a faint humming sound.  As I arrived at the top of the stairs and turned left to my open bedroom door, I walked across my room to my opened windows, as the humming became easier to hear.  As I looked out my window, hovering over my neighbor’s house were three small flying saucers hovering.  They were not just hovering in a stable state, but were tiltering slightly as they were in their suspended state.  They were around 5 feet in diameter in a formation of a triangle, one in front and the other two behind the first.  They were roughly 5 feet below my window seal and no more then 20 feet away. Back in the 50’s we didn’t have shows that were about UFO’s much less thought about them at my age.  I froze in disbelieve.  For at least a minute I watch and listened.  All three were identical. First being saucer shape with a 2-foot diameter dome no more then a foot high, the outer skin was like frosted glass, barley transparent with a soft light within.  Around the edge was a 6-inch blue ring resembling dominos side by side.  In the middle of the dome was a pendulum that went counter clock wise around and around.  It was easy to see passing under the frosted glass shell and the blue ring, which encircled the outer edge of the top of the spacecraft..  As the pendulum past under the blue ring of adjoining blocks, each block darkened as I watch it pass going slowly counter-clockwise around and around.  All the time making the humming noise as it revolved.   saw no movement of life inside except the moving part of the pendulum. I had to prove to myself that this was real.  I turned around with my back to them, but still heard the humming sounds they were making.  I turned back facing them and watch in amusement for at least another minute.  I again turned my back to them.  As soon as I did, a few seconds past and the humming sound stopped. I turn back towards my window and they were gone. I don’t expect anyone to believe me.  My parents just laughed just as anyone else would have who has never witness such an unbelievable sight.  I even don’t expect whoever reads this to believe my story.  I never told a soul till a few years back to my wife of 22 years.  As I told her, I am probably just a few people on earth who ever saw a UFO up close, much less three.  Most sightings I read about are lights in the sky, not something as clear as looking at your TV set across the room. I would not mind being tested under hypnosis or any other test to make believers of what I witness when I was eight years old, but I doubt if even that would ever happen. Because of my sighting I have no doubt what so ever that there are others in our universe.  As I became older I figured the small spacecrafts were more of a surveillance craft sending images back to the Mother ship.  Not occupied by small aliens.

Most of my earnings went towards my tuition for UNBSJ, the University of New Brunswick in Saint John, where I was enrolled in the Business Administration program.  I worked at the box office with cashier, ((name deleted by source)), an older lady who had been involved in Girl Guides for many years.  She always brought a cucumber sandwich for her mid-evening snack later on, when things got slow.  But this was my night off, and I was headed down to visit the gang at the cafeteria. It was a warm night, and no sooner did I show up on the scene that someone suggested I go and fetch some Dairy Queen treats with ((name #2 deleted by source)), one of the confectionery cashiers. We took everyone’s order, and walked out back to her white 1968 Plymouth station wagon. As she drove toward the upper exit, I noticed a bright light in the sky.  It was headed in a southerly direction, but I couldn’t tell how high it was.  I didn’t think it had enough altitude to be a satellite.  Perhaps it’s a plane with the lights on, I wondered.   Suddenly, it made a sharp turn to the east, and I asked ((name deleted)) if she had seen that. Of course, she hadn’t, she was driving.  I shrugged it off, and we made small talk the rest of our mission.  With cool treats, we returned to the Drive-In. A good western was playing that night, ""The Magnificent Seven,"" starring Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen.  But as we drove across the field of speakers and patrons, we noticed that the interior lights of many cars were on.  People were standing outside, looking into the night sky. ******* parked her car behind the cafeteria, where we found all the staff (including the manager, **** *****). They were also looking up. The only person not with the group was ****’s wife, *****, who had to stay inside with the money. As soon as I got out of the car, a friend of mine who was parked in a nearby row came running up to me. ""You missed it!"" he blurted. He explained that a strange light had appeared, right over the drive-in. It was making all kinds of weird maneuvers and changing colors, yellow-blue-green-red. I could feel his excitement, and wished I had seen it too. (And then I remembered the bright light I had seen in *******’s car as we were on our way to the DQ.)  ""Well, where is it now?"" I asked him. He pointed to the east, across the Saint John River. I found it right away, and sure enough it was changing colors and jig-jagging from left to right until it finally petered out of sight. He continued, ""It will be on the radio and in the newspaper for sure maybe on TV!  It was a flying saucer, sure as shootin!""  Well, if it was a UFO, I missed it.  I stomped my foot in disgust.  The ruckus over, we headed inside to eat the Dilly bars and banana splits before they completely melted.  Intermission was about twenty minutes away, and hot dogs and popcorn had to be prepared for the rush between movies.  The second was ""The Time Travelers,"" a 1964 Sci-Fi. Suddenly, there was a loud roaring noise that shook the pots and pans hanging on the wall.  We ran outside just in time to see three jets, likely F-106’s, flying in formation.  It looked like they barely cleared the screen, they were so low.  And they were headed in the same exact direction as that mysterious light, to the east. Well, that was all I needed. I knew they were scrambled after a radar blip, maybe from Loring Air Force Base in eastern Maine?  And that radar blip was a genuine, honest-to-goodness, flying saucer! Wow! Talk about an exciting night!  The next day, I searched the paper for news of the sighting.  Nothing.  I listened to the radio, and watched the television.  Nothing.  Days turned into weeks, and weeks became months.  So what was all that about?  There is no way that three jets are going to zoom around so close to the ground in pitch-black night unless they were chasing something.  And it wasn’t just one or two people that saw it.  There had to be forty or fifty people at the drive-in that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2011-03-23T00:00:00,,
