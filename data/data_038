The upsidedown V lights were coming from each craft and they were one aligned above the other to the right and they did not move. They were just hanging in the sky and looked to be about 100 feet up to the V tip and 100 feet down -  they stayed in the same place and had NO exhaust coming from the craft other than the lighted upsidedown V's .

I'm not sure of the exact time of night but it must have been at least after 9:00pm because my mom told me to take out the garbage . I was always forgetting to do this and this time was no exception.  I walked out of the back door grabbed both cans and walked around the corner of the house. I had taken maybe 6 steps when the thought to look up occured to me. I mention this because it seemed kind of odd to me afterward that I had this thought. I looked directly up(12:00) and saw bright, white, oval or elipse shaped light . The light had diagonal bands or lines that were in a zig-zag pattern across the short diameter of the elipse . The lines were on the apparent bottom and were darker in color than the rest of it. The light was moving due north at slow steady speed. I was facing south . It was kind of a blustery night with strong winds and a very low cloud ceiling . The clouds were moving in a southerly direction at a really good clip . Racing across the sky if you will . At first I thought it was a spotlight shing on the bottom of the clouds but the light was shining down THRU the clouds and I could see wisps of cloud partially obscuring the light . The light was so intense though that I could see  right thru them . There was NO sound at all. As near as I could tell the object/light was just above the cloud layer which seemed to be somewhat less than a 1000 ft. Thats a really uneduacated guess but the best I can give. I was really stunned by this sight and stood there watching it until it went out of sight and for a good while after. What really got me was the fact  of having seen it DIRECTLY over me .I mean if you had dropped a plumb line from it I WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT THERE and that precise second is  when I looked up. A  half a second later and I woulnt have seen it at all because it would have been out of my field of vision. The odds of that happening the way it did seemed to be important to me in some way at the time. When I went back in the house my mom asked what had taken so long and I was surprised at her question and I told her nothing! I dont know why I didnt tell her but  I did tell my brother who was very unimpressed . I remember staying up all night thinking about it over and over .

It's shape was saucer like but it also flared out on each side like curved protrusions.  I was absolutly flabberghasted...couldn't beleive my eyes.

I am dismayed but have not forgotten a single detail.  At about 5:30 AM on 12/06/1976, as was ususal I was heading West on Sterling Rd. in Davie, Florida, to drop my children 4 and 1 1/2 years old at a daycare center. I was enrolled in BCC and my wife worked at ((name deleted)) restaurant on ((deleted)) Rd.  As I was passing a bicyclyst I noticed in the Northwest sky a fireball falling.  After a minute I pulled my car over and shut it off to say prayers as I thought it was a plane crashing.  I sat for several minutes after the fireball disappeared behind trees several miles away but I saw no flash, nor did I hear an explosion.  Within two more minutes I and my wife observed a huge dull, grayish metalic looking object that was heading slowly toward us and southeast. The object was immense, did not emit any noise, smoke or any exhaust that would be noticable from thermal fluctuations of the air around it.  The object now appeared to be oblong or cigar shaped, more than 250 feet long and more than 30 feet high.  There seemed to be some sort of whitish light atop and a light at each end, front and rear but not white.  As it approached our vehicle my wife's upper body leaned out the window to look up at it.  I observed it from the windshield inside. We kept asking what the he** it was and when I looked at her I noticed her back and the entire interior of the car was illuminated. I then noticed my 4 year old daughter leaning on the back window looking up. I then looked at my interior light and saw it was not lit.  I immediately looked out my side window and it was still pitch black outside the car.  I then looked up as best I could to get a fix on the structure as it was now less than 50 feet from us. The surface was not metal at all.  It had a sandy texture similar to that of shark skin.  I could not locate any seams or a single area that would suggest any conventional assembly that I am or have ever been aware of.  The object became stationary for an undetermined period of time and we just stared at it for minutes.  From the corner of my left eye I could see a small child-like figure run rapidly across the front of my headlights.  It was about to climb over the metal road barrier but hesitated and turned toward me.  I had immediately tried to get a glimpse of any articles that I might be able to identify but it had nothing.  No shoes, belt, tools, weapons or any other devices.  My first thought was to jump out and grabit and throw it in the trunk because no one would believe me if I didn't.  A voice of sorts told me not to move or I would be harmed.  I tried to lift my arm and was horrified that it looked as if it was cut off where the light ended inside the car. I looked at the figure again and thought that it was so small and having no weapons I could take it in a few seconds.  The voice or whatever it was described the stretch cloth suit it was wearing carried 40,000 volts of piezoelectrical current.  This is a term I had never heard of and I knew I could not have imagined the thought.  The figure then hopped over the fence and went into a horse breeding ranch at about 140th st.  My last memory of the incident was when I was looking behind me in my car and seeing a somewhat different shaped object about 1 mile south of me moving slowly at first but then as I watched it the object seemed to accelearte so fast it just vaporized. It was also after sunrise and without a word to my wife or a word from her to me I started my car, drove to the daycare center, dropped off the children and did not say a word to the people. I learned later that we were at the scene for more than 40 minutes. I never saw the bicyclist pass us. A also lost my eyesight for almost 2 days after the incident.  After years of horrible dreams and nightmares I learned that the subjects who occupy the craft are from a parralel universe. Their craft are not built but actually grown by reconstructing the atomic anatomy of what we call a ""Diamond"" where the conditions exist for such. The suit (for lack of a better term) that the small figure was covere with is also a mineral which is genetically altered. I also learned that, just as a diamond, the outer shell adapts to the temperature changes the instant the craft becomes stablilized in whatever atmospheric temperature it is suspended in.  One issue that has stuck in my mind for years is the fact that whatever the voice was that conveyed the images to me also mentioned repeatedly; m"" You can be violent."" I   am not sure if it applied to me or the people of this planet as a whole. However, the occupants of the craft I saw are neither friendly nor inclined to become violent. They have almost no emotional state at all, yet they are certainly aware of ours.  As for the interior of the craft; there was not a single sharp angle anywhere I could see and again, nothing to provide any evidence that the object was assembled. It looked more like something hollowed out areas of a huge iceberg with a torch. The area which was used to control it's speed and motion was a long, flat, glass-like surfce no more than 2 inches thick and less than 2 ft. wide but rather long. I also could not locate any source of light despite the entire interior ares I went being fully luminated.",2005-06-20T00:00:00,26.0629,-80.2331

They were perhaps 45 degrees apart from my position. The aircraft did have a beacon.   The object was moving slowly compare the to aircraft.  I wanted to observe it as it crossed the path between me and the Moon, but sense it was moving to slowly, I decided to wait untill it crossed the Moon.  I thought that perhaps I could see it's siloate against the Moon.   So, I resumed my observation of the aircraft.  And competely forgot about the object.  When I remembered, I looked in the direction of where it would be given it's speed.  But, I didn't find it.  So, I searched the sky.  Nothing.   So, I decided to observe the Moon.  It was larger this time of the year and I could see a lot of detail.  But, as I was watching the exact center began to brighten. I realized then that it was the object I was observing earlier.  It was not only coming in my direction, but coming at an angle toward me.   As it approached, the one light, became two.(like a car coming toward you) There was no sound coming from it, even when I first sited it, though I could clearly hear the aircraft.  I then became excited and ran to the rear of my house to the back door to call my siblings out to see it.

On old Hwy 64 a half mile from the intersection of old and new 64.   We returned to the front of the house.  By that time it was clearing the three pine trees.  One of which was maybe 50 ft tall. The base is about 4ft in diameter.  It was maybe 60ft above that tree.  It came to a stop above the front yard.  It was hard to see,  It almost blended perfectly with the night sky, though it had lights on each side, the lights didn't illuminate the craft.  If it wasn't for stary background of the sky, I wouldn't know it shape.  And the full moon didn't help.   My decision to call my family out, was a poor one.  They began to scream at it.   And soon, lights started to come on in the neighboring houses.   At that time the object rotated west, and began to slowly move away picking up speed.  I followed on the road which parolelled it's path.  I followed to the limits of our street lights, too scared to go beyond.  There is farm land across the road in front of my house. Which allowed me to observe without obstructions. The craft looked to be about 30-35ft in diameter.   I was at the time intersted in science and technology.  And read and viewed many books on aircraft. And read a few books on astronomy.  There are two other events, I'll list them later.  My cousin had a close encounter of the third kind. A few times, it has affected his life negitively. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2005-06-20T00:00:00,35.8335,-76.1961

It was huge, hovered in a tilted position, at this point i could see windows all around the craft like portholes, i am sure something was looking out.At the bottom of the craft i noticed a kind of eluminous blue light, like an electric blue colour but softer. I looked to all the people crossing the bridge. It was as though some of the people were frozen. The ones that were frozen were the ones who were pointing up to the craft in amazement. The others appeared not to see the craft at all. These people continued on but appeared slow, it was almost as though time was standing still, like a photo. Suddenly it just vanished. Just shot off and was so fast that it was like magic. I was in shock i looked at my boyfriend and said ""Did you see that"". He asked me what, he had not seen it, which was amazing as he was the closest to the object. I then looked at my friend and said ""Did you see that?"" She looked terrified and said ""Yes"". I told her i was glad she had seen it too as if i told people that i had seen a flying saucer they would think i had  gone mad. But the fact that we had both seen it made me feel more comfortable.

At the time I resided at a house on Deauville Close, Yorkeys Knob, (near Cairns), Queensland, Australia.  I remember I was in primary school, but I can't remember the exact date of the event, I'm pretty sure it happened in 1980, but I'm not sure of the day/month.  It was in the evening, my family was having dinner, I was late & they were calling me for dinner.  I was looking out my bedroom window, I liked to look at the stars at night, the blocks next door were vacant bushland and I had a good view of the stars.  We lived on the beachfront, there were some dunes covered in scrub between our house and the beach.  I remember this event so clearly, it haunts me, at the time I was mesmerised by it.  I called out to my family - ""mum, dad, come look, there's a UFO!""  They didn't come, they were eating, and laughed at me from the other room.  To this day my family still sometimes recall my ""story"" and still make fun of me.  If only they had seen what I saw that night.  The UFO did not look like any picture of a UFO that I've seen - it was a different shape altogether.  It rose from over the low bushland near the sea, I first saw it when it was about 10 or 20 metres above the ground, I watched it come in from the East/sea, and it moved along a straight path westward, slowly rising.  It seemed to fly so amazingly low, near my house it seemed to fly above the block next door (that I was looking toward from my bedroom window), my bedroom was on ground floor, and the UFO seemed only about twice the height of the black wattle tree next door - probably only 20 to 40 metres up in the air - I couldn't beleive how close it was.  Somehow it then continued it's path westward, gliding more towards the south west gently, getting higher and higher, it rose over the tall trees of the swamp at the southern end of the cul-de-sac, and I could no longer see it over the horizon of trees/swamp.  It glided along a smooth straight path the whole time, and it moved so slowly.  I don't know exactly how fast it moved, it seemed like the pace of someone pedalling along on a bike, maybe 2 minutes?  It seemed forever, but I think that was because of the mind bending experience.  As for the UFO's appearance - it was NOT a saucer.  There were no little green men.  I did not seen any aliens at all.  But it had a soft glow around it.  The outer seemed greyish, but my eyes were focused in it's front face - you could see into the front of it, but all I could see was a light pale soft yellow colour, there was no detail.  It was cylindrical in shape - the same sort of shape as a rectangle, but with rounded edges, and not very deep.  It was smooth all over, rounded at the corners, and I could only see into the front, I don't remember seeing into the back (it was a long time ago).  The shape was sort of like this (it was rectangular, like a long/thin/wide cylinder, kind of a cigar shape from the side, but rectangular if looked at from the top or bottom): Side view: --------- |         | ---------  Front view: ----- (     ) -----  Underside or top view: --------- |         | |         | ---------  That's the best sort of scale I can get using typed characters!  Remember it was smooth in shape and edges were round, not sharp.  But the front view did have notably rounded sides, like the '()' characters.  To this day I know I saw it, but I doubt myself all the time and it has messed with my self confidence as a result, I was double check things that I do now as a result.  But I know what I saw was a UFO.  It also made NO sound, which was spooky as it was so close to the ground and my house, it made no noise at all.

It was so long ago.  I wanted to report it after seeing that others have reported seeing UFO's in the same area. In the summer of 1980, I came out of the grocery store with the bag boy and noticed something in the sky.  It was approaching sunset and I could see an bright shining object in the sky.  I knew it was not a star because it moved. I asked the bag boy what the object was and he was clueless as well.  I drove home looking at the object, not wanting to lose track of it.  I went home and asked my father, who worked as a nuclear physicist at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories what the object was. I figured he would know since he has put satellites up in space.  He told me it was a weather ballon or a slow moving plane and went back to work in his den.  About 45 minutes later, I advised my father that the object was still in the sky and that it was beginning to move around.  My father turned white as a ghost and came running out to see the object. We lived on farm land in a newly developed houses.  Our backyard view was a large field and Altamont Pass (mountains) with Mount Diablo in the distance. So we had a great view of what we saw. Anyhow, my entire family came outside to watch the object in the sky and then the neighbors on both sides of our home came outside to see as well.  This was around 8:00 p.m. in the evening.  The objects danced around in the sky and darted here and there.  I ran into the house to get my father's binoculars.  The object was triangular (almost like the letter ""A"") shape with lights on all three points.  A few hours later the objects flew in the direction of Mount Diablo (Mount of the Devil, as the Indians called it.. a coincidence?  I don't think so) and disappeared behind it or on it? That night on channel 7 (newscene S.F.) a reporter named Van Amburg presented a story about an object in the sky.  It was a short uneventful segment about what people reported seeing, however, nothing was ever mentioned about it again on the news. However, every night... I mean, every night around 1 or 2 in the morning I would wake up not knowing why.  I would look out my window and it was there.  It was like it knew I was there watching it.  I watched it for a while and then it would fly away over Mount Diablo.  This happened every night.  I told my mother on occasion, but no one ever thought it was that important. I don't remember if it ever stopped or if I just forgot about it as I turned 18 years old and moved out. To hear others talk about this area freaked me out and I had to share my story.  I don't know what that object was but let me put it this way.  Even though I believe in God, I didn't believe that ghosts appeared in the daytime.... till I moved to Hawaii.  I didn't believe in UFO's until the summer of 1980, but now I do. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",2005-06-20T00:00:00,37.705,-121.45771535947712

While closing the trunk and facing the east, with a very clear ski and the sun more closely to my back, I caught a glimps of a reflection to the east over the house.  At first, what I didn't think anything was unusal but at the same time it was out of position.  The meaning here is my home is in the landing and takeout path for Tulsa Int. Airport.  In forty years, I have seen nearly every kind of airplane there is.  Plus my dad work on all kinds of airplanes for 30 years included the Boeing 747.  What caught my eye at first was the thing in the sky was a half mile east of the line up point for the runway. It was also way to high. I would say, 5,000 feet maybe more. My first thougth was, this plane was going to have to take a crash dive to the left in order to land.  Also what seem odd was it was going slightly slower than normal landing speeds.  There were also no landing lights of any kind.  Then I realized something was wrong...  This thing didn't have a set of wings, tail, rudders, engines. If it was going to land, the landing gears would have been down by then. There were none of them either...   Then I just stared in amazement... This thing did not have any identifing marks that a normal airplane had. With no tail, no brand name.  It had no windows. The very front was black as well as the very end of it.  There was a black type of band in the middle. The remainder was polished type aluminum.  It was a cylinder in shape. For size, it was, I would say, longer than a 747 fusalog... maybe 30 feet or more. In other words, it was long.  Then I started to think for a second... the wind, very slight, was coming from the south maybe 2 to 3mph.  Not a big deal but planes that would be taking off would be going from north to south.  With this monster a half mile to the east at 5,000 feet, it would have been right in the path of any planes taking off and heading east.  This thing continued on a stright north direction.  Did not turn or change speeds.  I could definitly see after a 10 second look that it had no wings or familiar airplane features.  I didn't hear a sound. Even a 747 at a half mile distance is something I would have heard and I have a hearing problem. After staring at it so long, it was almost memorizing to look at.  Then I lost track of it because of the distance it traveled.  If you contact me do so by email is best.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

I was looking up in the sky at a balloon that had gotten loose from someone.  (The parade had not started yet and there were at least 200 people in the parking lot preparing for the parade etc. which goes down route 5)  At the time it was overcast.   From the woods behind the shopping center there emerged three black orbs. At first I thought they were balloons.They were like liquid metallic quivering spheres and black as the night sky. They were floating or flying as if controlled.  They stayed together but weren't attached.  At one point they hovered together in one area for maybe 30 seconds then accelerated across the sky to the east so fast I'd say faster then a jet.,2005-05-24T00:00:00,42.2238,-72.6409

I got up and went to the bathroom. We have 3 large windows that look over lots of acreage and are on the county line in Delaware Ohio. The house next door was under construction and the night was clear blue and it was spring.  I looked out to enjoy the view when a large light came across the field from the north heading south ,several stories off the ground over Hillsmiller Road that runs East & West. It was in a straight line going so quickly over the grassy field ( it zipped) to the new building. The light seemed ""curious"" zipped right,l eft and up and down and also hovered. ""looking or investigating"" the house.  I was not scared but when I drew closer to the window the light zipped up and stright over the new build and south into the woods hovered and zip it was gone.  My husband and I are both medical professionals, I did not wake him but I knew I saw something that changed my entire belief abt UFO's.  I saw no other reports that next day but later that week my husband caught reports of sightings elsewhere in the US. I will mail a map of the sighting and county map that shows our road etc...  I looked on the net for info on reporting right after the sighting and the few web sites I pulled up were so odd I gave up trying to find a place to report this to, our local airport thought I was nuts.  Then my husband thought I should watch the Jennings report and I saw who to legitimately report the sighting to.  To draw the object is to draw the headlight of a huge motorcycle light but with no light beam, just a (1) round large ball of light 1 acre away it looked the size of 2-3 feet across. 2 stories high off the ground, to low to be an aircraft.  no sound with this light, no beam, or mechanical movement, it moved like light its self, but with ""a purpose""  What is the chance the light will revisit?

Have had many sightings since that date. Have recorded all kinds of overflights by MANY different shaped ships including photos. This observation occured just past 10:00pm last Thursday night.  As a sensitive I have always been able to 'feel' the approach of these anti-grav ships quite some distance from my house. This has always allowed me plenty of time to get my camera. But this time I did not have my cam available because its  a 35mm Cannon which is in the shop for calibration and cleaning. So no picks of this one.  But here's the sighting info.  I felt the approach of the ""anti-grav"" engines OR the presence of a non earthly occupant coming my way. I readied myself on my front second floor deck and sure enough.....the ship appeared from out of a clear dark sky entering our dimension or space above the mountain north of my house. My first observation was of the ship, which was approaching my direction slowly just above the hilltop, but far far below the regular airliners altitude. I would guess at approx. 9,000 ft. I said aloud:""Greetings!"" and at that moment the sphere turned a deep orange glow and proceeded towards my direction then as it was almost over my house it turned to a south-east heading still remaining orange. It passed over the June Mountain Ski Lift chalet...then on behind the mountain. Gone from sight.  Approx. 12 mins later 5 F-18's most likely from Fallon Air Base came in over my area fast and furious. They had afterburners running which made a deeper than usual jet engine roar, the sound of which fills our small canyon with a very loud sound. These guys were really moving rightin the same direction of the orange sphere. They were 12 mins behind this sphere which tells me the AirForce is getting their look-down sat radar working pretty tight nowadays. I have also noticed 2-3 Airborne Command Centers moving thru this area very slowly like looking for something. These airborne c.cntrs. were in the area alot about 2 weeks ago. Now they are gone.  I have many recorded sightings from over the years, and additionally sighting and confrontations with these ships and beings from during my earlier years growing up in Europe where I was educated till 20 yrs of age. These include on the ground observations of blue globes in the forest in Fountainbleu, FR in 1954, saucers over Lake Geneva in 1964 next to our school, over the vineyards, near Lausanne. And many many more.............  Thank You",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

Around 11:30 pm on July 15, 2005 I heard strange noises in the house.  I was watching watching T.V. at the time. My husband was out of town and I was alone in the house. At first I thought the cats were in the house and were playing and running around.  But then I looked outside and they were on the porch sleeping.  Then I heard loud thumping sounds coming from my bedroom overhead, like someone was walking in heavy boots and making noise on purpose.  A few seconds later, I heard the side patio door open and close twice. I turned off the T.V. and went to investigate and when I did I noticed a low-level mechanical humming sound that seemed to have no source. The side door was locked from the inside, so no one could have opened it, yet I clearly heard the door open. I decided to double check the doors and go to bed and listen to Coast to Coast AM to hear Peter Davenport.   While lying in bed I looked up at the skylight and noticed that it was completely black outside.  There was no rain that night, and even with clouds you can always see some light from the street light across the street.  I remember thinking that was odd.  I was listening intently as Peter came on and was talking about the recent sighting in Idaho on July 8.  I remember looking at the clock at approximately 12:45 AM. I don't remember going to sleep, but the next thing I knew the radio was on very loud and the clock said 1:30 PM, and I had missed hearing the witnesses talk about their experience. I don't have an explanation as to how the radio got so loud. I turned the radio off, then looked up and saw that the skylight was not black anymore, and had the familiar bluish glow from the streetlight again. The low humming sound was also gone. I have no idea what happened.  I believe that I had a missing time experience, and that something or someone did not want me to hear the radio, but also wanted to get my attention. They did. Was this an abduction or a visitation? I may need to be hypnotized to find out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sequence of events was from right to left. That was it at the time; they seemed to be dissipating so I drove on. A few days later I downloaded the picture and found when I blew up the 1st two pictures it appears to be fire in the sky with a diamond shape object (the first one to appear) in the cloud to the right and the smaller object (last object) disappearing to the left. The last two shots when blown-up look like smoke rings where in the shots just seconds before appeared fire.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,30.10207910447761,-93.85383582089553

I thought at first it must be a plane but could see no blinking lights or light of any kind, then of course nothing where a fuselage would be, and what would be wings weren't swept back and were squared off and not tapered like wings. There was no sound. It was only visible because of the city light vaguely illuminating it's underside.

By the time he saw the thing it had moved about a third of the way across the piece of sky that we could see.  I was starting to notice all kinds of unusual detail on the thing, like rods protruding and lines underneath. And there was really something strange about the way it was moving. And another REALLY odd thing was... I seemed to be able to hear the thoughts in my friends head. It seemed that once he noticed the strange motion, that it seemed to move a liitle and then stop, move and stop, like it was swaying, but not side to side but up and down, I thought I heard him think to himself ""Is it a Bird?"" Then I said out loud to his unvoiced question ""No, it's not a bird""  We stood there transfixed, watching as it moved out of view behind a building. I ran to the end of the alley to try and spot it again but there was a bright street light in my eyes. My friend stood there transfixed, he said more because of me reading his mind than what we had seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Ofcourse i wasn't, but the physical feeling of a struggle to raise up off the couch was definitely present. As i could only sit i couldnt stand still have no clue as to why. i noticed the woods behind my house was completely illuminated as if there were flood lights on or a landing light on a helicopter as if it was searching. I know for a fact it wasn't any rotory aircraft. I also recall as if i was very cold and started to develop goosebumps in a big way. Eventually i was able to force myself to stand up. Only took me about 5 or 6 minutes to push myself up and walk over to the double french doors which lead to our sun patio. as i stood by the window the light faded with a slight flicker then was gone. Now im not quite sure how much time has past since this first inccident to the 2nd but, it wasnt too long after. I had made myself go to sleep in my beedroom.

They were observed for several nights, since our evacuation from Hurricane Katrina till we arrived home after about 5 months in a hotel. It was a nice hotel with an excellent view of the Gulf from the 6th floor, with a balcony. We have video footage of these objects which seemed to stay just out far enough not to be detected by the naked eye very well. Sometimes they would be in a ""formation"" of some sort, a ""W"". At one point as we were all looking  at them from the balcony, one ""craft"" lit up, lights seemingly going around the vessel. That was the point that we knew it was something extraordinary. It was also where we could make out the metallic, grey look to the surface. Like two upside down plates, the lights emitted from the upper middle section of the phenomenea. A deep red or green light emitted from the mid-bottom. They hoovered mostly, sometimes moving, sometimes slowly from our vantage wiew, but had to be incredibly fast compared to seeing an aircraft passing by. I wondered why the Air Force weren't noticing this, since Tyndal Air Force base is located nearby.

At that approximate distance the shape was about the size of an elongated vitamin held at arms length. I thought it unusual enough to run all out for the binoculars.   By the time I got out on deck there was nothing there.  I began to scan the area where I had first seen the object and then down back and forth on the water in line with the spit itself.  The only thing I picked up was what appeared to be an orange/red ball just floating on or near the spit part that is underwater - just very shallow.  My first thought was someone lost a buoy but after observing this object for about 10 - 20 seconds, it rose up at a rapid steep angle heading toward Victoria.  I thought then that it might be a balloon with the wind blowing it around.   When the object had been rising for about 5 seconds it looked like it reshaped itself back into the original dark vertical shape and picked up speed.   As I watched it heading away, from the time it rose up off the water as a sphere, transformed into the dark vertical shape, until I could no longer see it was no more than 30 - 45 seconds.   A very unusual event to say the least and influenced by no more than two cups of coffee.

This was about 7:30 PM. The Orb had been following our vehicle in what appeared to be a straight course to the far left of me but also moving towards us.  I had a strange feeling it was watching us and following us back home.  As we turned some corners and finally getting home I didn't see the light anymore so I thought it was probably just a plane with bright lights, but I decided to go outside and look up at the sky anyway because I had a feeling that it wasn't a plane.  At about 8:00 PM I saw that the Orb had reached the starlit sky where I was standing. It must have followed our vehicle all the way back. What happened during the next three hours are things I don't think can ever be explained. It moved very slow, without any sound at all. Imagine a hang-glider gliding over the sky without a sound, all was quiet. By this time however, the object had drastically dimmed to an eery dark glow and I saw what looked like a perfect black triangle. I could make out the entire outline as if the lights of the moon and stars were reflecting off of it.  The Triangle was very detailed. In fact it looked similar to that recent Triangle UFO posted on this website from Auston, TX. But there were some big differences with the one I saw. There was a red front light on the tip of the Triangle, and two red stationary lights on the two back tips. None of the lights moved or changed. The lights were dim, like those laser-pen lights, and lit up the image of the Triangle. There were no planes around when this was happening.  My backyard was small, and darkened, it was situated in an apartment complex. I stayed there to watch as I didn't want to go out into the open sidewalk. The movement was very strange, it would drift further away, turn around and then go the other way, as if it was rotating in a long, slow circular pattern. It went on like this for about two hours. Sometimes it would fade off in one direction only to appear at another place in the sky.  At one point the Triangle's red tip shot out a faded yellow light beam through the sky. The beam had no movement and reached a far distance. Then the beam would vanish. I decided to walk around the apartments a bit and it seemed like the object would turn its course and follow my direction.  The last hour, the third hour around 11:00 PM, it was in the middle of the sky and did the strangest thing, it shot out a small white orb from the side. The orb slowly went a ways then changing its course flew back inside the Triangle. I had no idea what it was doing but that is what happened! The orb looked like one of the stars but it had no sparkling effect like a star does. Eventually the Triangle drifted off through the sky I don't know where it went from there, but I could no longer see it. Whatever that thing was, I know for sure that it was no plane...",2006-02-14T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

Tonight I had walked into my back yard before retiring and looked at the rising moon, which was approximately 40 degrees above the horizon.  To the NNE, I could see what I thought was an aircraft headed south at approximately the same relative altitude as the rising moon from my ground perspective.  The bright white light which appeared to be the same intensity as a small aircraft's and about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length, also appeared to have red light in a halo effect around the white light but at a greatly reduced size and barely discernable from the white light.  I estimated the ""aircraft"" to be approximately ½ mile away from me based on numerous other aircraft sightings over the years of airplanes flying overhead en route to our local airport.  I watched the ""aircraft"" for approximately (1) minute and realized that it's lateral speed was slowing and it was now turning further west towards my location which could account for the illusion of it slowing down.  Although it still had the red halo effect, I realized that it was not an aircraft rotating beacon or navigation light.  I then called to my wife and twenty year old son to come outside and we watched for (1) minute more as the object began to slowly weave left to right and began to drop in altitude. The white light dimmed slightly and then it suddenly dropped what appeared to be (3) red fragments much like flares dropped by jet fighter aircraft.  The object zig-zagged left to right and still continued to drop in altitude headed south.  It emitted (3-4)red fragments and appeared to turn due east.  Its size continued to reduce which led me to believe it was moving away from me.  It was also appeared to reduce in size every time it emitted the fragments.  It finally disappeared altogether which left my family and I, awe struck.  I have been a patrol sergeant with a local law enforcement agency for almost twenty years and have observed several missile launches from Vandenberg AFB which is approximately (200) miles SE of me.  The launches leave a visible smoke trail from my town and sometimes I can see the booster separations and engine burns, if the sky is clear.  I have also observed dozens of space junk re-entries, satellites including Iridium flares, and orbiting spacecraft, but I have never seen an object perform as this one did tonight.  It went from controlled navigation to weaving like a drunk driver and then straighten itself back out in seconds.  I have seen jet aircraft drop flare counter measures before and they have a systematic ejection, controlled decent and separation.  These fragments did not.  I have a Navel Air Station approximately (30) miles west of me and FA-18 Hornets fly overhead day and night.  They are flying over to the China Lake and Nellis AFB test ranges, so I'm accustomed to the sounds they make, the navigation lights they have and the speeds they transit our airspace at.  This object had no sound and from the estimated distance and the fact that it was after 2300 hours, it was quiet.  There was no sound, no explosion, no smoke and unlike anything I had ever experienced before in real life.  We believe it was a UFO.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,36.356650127226466,-119.34793664122137

I was heading home on the highway from work on Tuesday 11/22/05 from my job 40 miles outside of town. This stretch of highway is about 10-15 miles north of Butte, MT. At approx. 2:20pm-2:30pm as I was climbing the winding pass up through Elk Park canyon I spotted 2 triangle shaped craft in the sky between 2 mountains. I was filled with a sensation of panic as soon as I spotted them because I knew what I was seeing was neither ordinary, nor something that I had seen before. Because I have no idea of the actual size of the craft, it is difficult to guage their altitude but they did appear to be flying higher than the mountains, and one craft appeared to be flying slightly higher than the other. The sun was bright that day and from the reflection of sunlight off of the craft they appeared to be chrome, they were very bright. At first glance the craft appeared to be stationary but after a few seconds of observation it looked like they were moving slowly towards the southwest. They also appeared to be moving much slower than any aircraft I have ever seen. It was a very cold day, yet the craft left no contrails as they moved. As I continued up the highway, my view of the craft was obscured as the road wound around a mountain side. I thought for sure I would have a clearer view of them another 1/2 mile or so up the road where the highway comes out of the canyon and opens up into plains, but when I got there they were gone. I thoroughly searched the sky for them and could not see them. They appeared to be moving southwest, and there were mountains a few miles south that I suppose they probably moved behind. There were other motorists on the highway that day but I'm not sure if anyone else saw them. Judging from their position in the sky I would guess the craft would also have been visible from another highway further south than the one I was on.(Homestake Pass, the highway from Butte MT to Whitehall MT) I did not observe any other aircraft in the sky at the time. I did not notify the police or any other authorities, but I felt that what I saw was so unusual that I should notify someone.By the way I am a ((deleted)) worker for the State of Montana, Department of ((deleted)).",2005-12-16T00:00:00,,

This sighting was in NE Seattle, at the corner of 14th Ave. E and NE 120th (above the Pinehurst Park).  The next day, I spoke to another person who had witnessed (what she described to be) a similar object in the sky to the west of Magnuson Park in Seattle (towards where my wife saw it). 10-15 minutes later, another witness saw (what appeared to be) a military/security helicopter rushing towards the direction of this sighting, despite the fact that we did not report it.

I was driving North on the northway 87. It was about 7:30 PM or so when I was around exit 29-31(cannot specifically remember). I came to a spot where there was clear view of the large mountains in the area and something caught my attention. There was a group of dim lights in the formation of a line at about a 45-75 degree angle. At first I thought it might have been lights from chair lift poles set up on a mountain ski resort. But after some more glances (mind I was driving 65 on the highway) I saw that the lights were far to high to be on a mountain. It was difficult to see the mountains as they were dimly outlined by the sky as the sun was well below the horizon and the sky was turning darker shades of blue. I am positive it was not on a mountain because the lights were far too high. After driving out of viewing range of the mountains and the view disapeared behind roadside pines I was unable to see the lights any longer. I waited impatiently to see if the lights would still be there once I closed some distant on the highway but I didnt see them again. As I approached the plattsburgh area I did notice what seemed to me to be an unusual amount of airplanes out that night as dozens crisscrossed the sky at altitudes so high they only appeared as white dots with their blinking wing lights. As far as describing the UFOs, they seemed to be nothing but dim white lights around in a fairly straight line at 45-75 degrees or so approximately. As far as how many lights there were I would have to say anywhere between as little as 25 to as many as 50. I wasnt able to count because I only saw them briefly and had to focus on the road. I thought I remember seeing slightly orange  lights mixed in with the white maybe at the end of the line, but Im not certain.",2006-03-11T00:00:00,,

Hello.  I SWEAR on my life and in the name of God that what I have typed below is true, and it did happen to me, my mother, and my brother.  I figured it must have been in the fall of 1977 or the spring of 1978, as I was in 3rd grade, and there were no leaves on the trees, and was warm out.  My mother was driving down Route 9 in Natick, 9pm-ish at night, and we saw what looked like a round shaped stationary flashing of Christmas lights hovering about 1000 feet above a Car Wash about a mile down the highway.....   My brother who is 3 years older than me was also with us in the car (my mom was driving the 1970 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser Station Wagon).  I was in the back seat, my brother and mother were in the front seat.  WELL, me being 8 to 9 years old at the time, I knew that this was no hot air balloon, nor a blimp, nor a giant kits with lights.  There is not a night that goes by without me thinking of that night.  IT was the SIZE OF A LARGE HOUSE !!!!!!!!!   As my mom continued down Rt. 9 near the car wash, It dropped out of the sky unlike any aircraft could ever do.......and there were the most colorful lights/beams rotating everywhere flashing from this round house sized thing......... lights all over it (I don't recall seeing any beams).............it made NO noise.......it hovered over our car, then it was following us........also, every dog could be heard howling and barking in the neighborhood.........it's almost impossible to describe.............and it was hovering right over the car with us in it.....it was at the tree tops, following us...   as mom was driving, she lost sight of it, and so did my brother......and I was in the back seat, terrified...looking all over the place for it as it couldn't just dissapear like that.......and then I looked up through the tinted moon-roof window of the car (the 1970 Oldsmobile Station Wagon) and I yelled ""it is right on top of us!!!  and it's getting lower!!  It's following us!!!""   It was right over the car, and then the lights on this thing started going even more crazy....once again, it was the size of a LARGE house, and round with all colors of lights - mostly on the outside what I can only make sense was the rime of the UFO.   Underneath the UFO it was solid, as even though it made no noise, I could hear it hovering over us, as sounds were bouncing off of it.....   The only way I can explain that I knew it was solid, is to close your eyes, then have someone walk by you.... you can hear a solid mass blocking sound.  Does that make any sense??    Every dog in hearing distance could be heard braking like crazy in the neighborhood my mom was driving (behind the car wash in Natick, Massachusetts).  I never knew so many people owned dogs.....   People were coming out of their houses, and I remember so clearly a woman coming out of her house, looking up above our car, and her screaming for her kids to get back in the house at the top of her lungs.....door slammed, and her outside lights turned off.  THis lady was obviously terrified.   As my mom drove around the neighborhood, and this giant silent lit up christmas tree appeared to get even lower below the trees.  My mom knew a lady who she did typing work for in the neighborhood, and my mom pulled the car into her tiny driveway....  we got out of the car (I don't remember seeing my brother get out of the car or not, but I do remember my mom with me against the car.)  .........and when Mom stopped the car in someone's drive way (whom she knew and did typing work for), the house sized sphere with rotating lights on the outside rim of it, and some lights flashing underneath it was something I could not make sense of..... being ony 8 or 9 years old, the only thing I could associate it with was flashing christmas lights in ALL colors...BUT, the lights were not apearing to flash/blink on and off......it was as if the lights were all joined together, making it look like the giant house sized silent object that was hovering or spinning over our car......but the lights I believe is what made it look like it was spinning as that is the only rational explanation I know. I swear on my grave, and on my life, that the house sized object looked like it lowered below the trees, almost in an arms reach.   My mom then told me to climb up on top of the car and see if I could touch it.  I climbed up onto the hood, then with one foot on the windshield of the car, I reached up my arm (I don't remember which arm), but I reached my arm up to see if I could touch it.  For that moment we had no fear of it, and the terror was gone.  I was unable to touch it, and it was higher above the car than we thought it looked like. My mom, still to the day feels so guilty as she will sometimes say to me these days ""Why on earth did I ever tell you to see if you could touch it....Gahlleee""   ""We didn't know if it was good or bad""  she still says today. So, now that we are in this lady's driveway, parked.......My mom ran up to the lady's front door knocking like crazy....and when she came to the door my mom said to her ""You have to come out here !!   You have a UFO in your front yard !!!""   So the lady walked out to her front steps and looked right at it, and calmy said ""hmmmm....  oh yes""..........    Then she calmly proceeded to ask my mother how she was.  I was stunned with this lady's reaction.  My mom (still to the day) says that the woman was in a trance when she came out of her house, making very light of the GIANT ROUND house sized light show that was drifting off into her back yard, and into the woods of Natick where it faded behind the trees in the forest. Then, I realized what I just did.  I was on my mom's car trying to touch this huge thing !!   I got off the car, my mom made some light conversation with the lady, and we got the heck out of there, back home to Wayland.  That was when the real terror started to set in of what happened.  We got home, my mom reached for the phone and said ""Who do I call!!!  I can't call the police!!!""..... so my mom called my sister who was newly married in Marlboro, MASS.     I was terrified for months when it got dark.  There is NOT one night that goes by that I don't look to the sky, waiting for it to show itself to me again.  The whole UFO incident from start to finish lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.  I have recently discussed our experience with my mom, and she said that she will drive the same exact route with me in the day time, and I'm going to film it with my digital camera as Mom tells the story - remember that my Mom was the driver, and her being the only adult in the car, she noticed other things that my brother & I didn't.  Now, you can understand why I think of this thing every night...always looking into the sky at night, almost waiting as if the giant lit-up round freek show thing is going to come back some day or night.   My brother still doesn't like talking about it to anyone else besides me or Mom...  What ever it was, it sure it wasn't there to greet us as friends, or to let us know that it would not harm us......or to bring peace.....but there was only that brief moment of fascination when I climbed up onto the car to see if I could touch it.....  I was absolutely terrified when I went to bed that night, and was for many nights after that waiting for it to appear in the back yard and come back for us in Wayland - the next town over.  Remember that I was 8 or 9 years old.......  It just ticks me off as I will always wonder what the whole point of this giant airship hovering over us in the car was for....   ya know?   Ok, so we saw this huge floating round UFO with colorful lights.  What did it want?  What, did it want to put on a show for us??  What was the point it wanted to make??  These a questions that have bugged me for the last 30 years, and I am finally coming out with my experience..   No, we weren't abducted, none of that stuff...... no physical contact.  Maybe if it were evil, I shouldn't want to know what it wanted, and why it was there that night, floating down to our car.   I remember being so mad at school when telling my friends the next day of what happened.......then they would tell me that it was probably a hot air balloon..or a blimp.....that I shouldn't lie................that was when I stopped talking about it...  Well, I have seen a blimp, I have seen hot air balloons in all shapes and sizes, and this was NO BLIMP or HOT AIR BALLOON.  I understand I am not allowed to reveal my identity or contact info in this forum, and if I were allowed to, I would take my chance and give out my name and email to see if there are others out there that experienced what we did back in the late 1970's in Natick, MA.......as we have NEVER reported this UFO before, and this forum is the very first time this UFO that we experienced is being shared to the world.  I just want to talk to someone else that saw what we did that night.  Nailing down the exact date is difficult, but I do remember I was in 3rd grade, born in 1969, so it had to be 1978 or so......  I do remember that there were little or no leaves on the trees, and it was warm outside....and very dark.  Agian, I swear on my life in the name of God that what I have typed above is true, and it did happen to me, my mother, and my brother.  Follow-ups, PLEASE....   Thank You.  - D.",2005-11-03T00:00:00,42.2873,-71.3524

We drove to the end of the road and turned off our lights.  The craft came directly at us and stopped over the top of a high power electrical lines.  There was NO noise.  The trees adjacent to the lines were bent over.   The craft was about 50-70 feet wide, all different colored lights rotating around the middle.  It appeared to be using the power lines for energy.  We were approximatly 200 yards away.   The craft hovered for 1-2 minutes and then some spot lights at the bottom of the craft rotated and shined on us.  It then took of at a very high rate of speed on a diagonal.   We jumped on I-196 East and followed for about ten minutes, at this point it was just a light traveling very fast.   The weird thing about this is that me and my two friends never remembered this until two weeks later!!  I thought it was a dream until I talked to my friends and it all came back to us.

PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS, SUBMITTED ON NOVEMBER 05, 2008)) I submitted this report back in 2005.   I have been reviewing my report from that time.  There are a couple of things that are incorrect.  The sighting was South of Lake Michigan Drive and West of Covell Road.    A few more things I would like to point out.  The craft may have been 3 to 4 times the size that I stated (200-300 ft.)  As we were driving up Cenntenial Drive (steep incline) the lights caught my eye.  It was about 20-30 miles away, it was coming at us at a very high rate of speed.  It had multiple lights rotating around the middle of the saucer.  As in other reports that I read, the middle of the craft did not come to a point, it had was a verticle surface (5-10 feet or more)  The strangest thing was that as soon as the spot lights under the object focused on us (my friend who was driving killed the lights and coasted to the end of the road, so I felt it did not know we were there) it rose and speed off at an unbelievable rate of speed (thousands of miles an hour or more)  I was in the passenger seat and never took my eyes off of it.  It traveled 30 miles in two or three seconds.  We jumped on 196 East and followed it for about ten minutes.  It looked like a moving star off in the distance. The strangest thing of all is that after we headed back home, none of us spoke about it to each other or anyone that night (family members, etc.).  It wasn't until weeks later that we were all hanging out together, and I mentioned it as a dream.  Instantly both of my friends who were with me had the wierdest looks on thier faces.  I could tell they were freaked out.  We had one or two other friends present at this time.  They thought we were joking.  Each of us took turns telling exactly the same thing that happened.

They were flying what i figured to be about as low as a passenger jet readying for landing, for i also figured they were at least just as big.  i watched them carefully, not taking my eyes off of them. they made no sound.  even with the street traffic, i can hear aircraft that fly that low. the sky was patched with clouds.  The sky where i saw the craft was cloudless and dark and starred with the night.  the objects were as dark as the dark sky, with wings near the angle of flying wings. there were at least eight white lights on the backs of the wings, like one would see on the wings of a passenger jet.  there were no headlights, no blinking wing lights, no tail lights, blinking or otherwise and no body lights. There was no body per say and no tail.  It was just a wing, kind of a long triangular shape, but with a dip in the back middle. They were side by side, wing tips nearly overlapping. One of the ""wings"" was slightly in front of the other.  As they were both moving across the sky, the one behind moved just slightly in front of the one that was in front before.  Also, the angle of the ""wings"" was a bit different for each craft. They flew slowly north and disappeared into the clouds.  I saw them for about a long 15 seconds.  I reported it to the Oregon chapter of Mufon, I think it was a few years ago.  They came back with a link or links to aircraft pics for me to look at, to see if it looked like any of them.  The flying wing was the closest; however, the wing angle was different. They said that either stealth or the flying wing (don?t remember which they said.  Cant find the report in my puter stuff) wasn't known of by the public in 1981/82. I told them that I knew of the flying wing at least by then, if not before. I had sent them links to the aircraft that looked most like in part, as well as links to flying wing sites and pics. Never heard back from them since.

The importance of this experience to me is more about the mental message that was imparted to me than the actual physical sighting.,Boardman,OH,1982-07-10T22:00:00,light,3-4 minutes,"Occurred : 7/10/1982 22:00  (Entered as : 07/10/1982 22:00) Reported: 10/20/2005 4:19:48 PM 16:19 Posted: 11/3/2005 Location: Boardman, OH Shape: Light Duration:3-4 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47116.html,"The importance of this experience to me is more about the mental message that was imparted to me than the actual physical sighting. This happened at an old strip mine we used to camp at back in the 80's.  I was there with a guy named ((name deleted--male)) and his girlfriend ((name deleted--female)).  Unfortunately, I can't remember their last names and don't know if I could even find them these days as I live in Missouri now.  Anyway we had laid out a blanket and were laying side-by-side stargazing when I saw what looked like a normal satellite tracking in a straight line from east to west across the sky.  I pointed it out to the others and everyone acknowledged that they saw it too.   When it got directly above us it suddenly did a fast, tight loop, seemingly around a bright star exactly above us.  At that moment all three of us received a very strong mental impression that I can only describe as a telepathic message directly from this object.  I know this was real because we compared our experiences and all three of us felt the same thing and received the same ""information"".  Then the light continued in a straight line until it went over the horizon. Now the important thing about this experience is the ""message"" or ""impression"" we all received from the object which I will describe the best I can. This object was a group of beings that were aware of us watching them and they timed their loop maneuver somehow so it would seem to us that they had looped around a star.  Of course this star was millions of miles away so these beings had some way of seeing themselves through our eyes or maybe calculating everything perfectly, distance and angle and such.  They did the loop just to amaze us in a playful, humorous way.  We all had the impression that these beings were beneficial and had a sense of humor.  At the same time, the beings imparted to us a very strong impression that they were watching over all of us on this planet and not to worry, they weren't going to let anything really bad happen like us destroying ourselves or something.  We were hit with a very nice sense of calm and well-being.  This feeling was very profound and life-changing for me; I can't speak for my companions after all these years but at the time they were just as deeply affected as I was. The loop this ""craft"" made was so fast and perfect as to be impossible for even the fastest airplane to do.  We all had the same impression that the ""craft"" was more of a ball of energy then an actual physical ship, the energy ball was a conglomeration of at least several beings traveling in a group.   I've had the opinion since this experience that the ""visitors"" are capable of existing as pure energy and have no need of an actual craft.  This is why I don't put a lot of faith in most sightings I hear about that describe metallic craft and the like.  I also really don't have a lot of faith in the ""abduction"" phenomena that is widely reported, I don't see the need these beings would have to actually physically abduct people since they are so far advanced they probably know everything they need to know about us just by sensing it somehow. I have only told a few prople about this in passing over the years and I really don't care who believes me.  But what happened was real and I don't know why they chose to contact us in this way or to impart this information to us, maybe they were just having some fun.  I hope this is something you can use. Note: I am not a mental patient nor have I ever had any type of mental or phychological episodes whatsoever.  I'm a down-to-earth guy who owns a small farm and is 49 years old at this time.

I remember thinking to myself that there was no tower here so what is that?  I started to drive by but for some reason my curiosity got the better of me and I stopped my vehicle and backed up.  There was no other traffic on the road at that time so I got out to have a better look.  As I stared at the lights I became aware of faint round windows arranged in between the lights.  If my memory serves me well I believe there were two lights above and two below with the windows, more like port holes, running horizontally.  To my amazement I noticed that the portholes were indicating a round surface as they went from round to elliptical at the edges.  I still had no clue as to what I was looking at until it very quietly drifted away over the tree tops. This oblect was no more than 75 feet from the ground and directly over a small home.  I seem to recall a soft humming sound and nothing else.  It wasn't a helecopter, no noise, no rotors beating the air, nothing conventional that would explain what I was looking at.  It just floated away in total silence.   I would estimate that the diameter of the craft was about 30-40 feet.  It was so dark in color that despite being less than 200 feet away I could not see its form.  It could have been a sphere for all I know.  I honestly could not see a shape to this thing at all.  All of this happened in the early 80's and I never forgot it.  All my life I wanted to see a UFO and when I got the chance to I had no clue as to what I was looking at until it was gone.

The ligh , which was maybe four or five feet above me made no noise as I rolled down my window to see if it was a plane or helicopter.  All i could see was a brilliant white light flying around my car like it was checking me out. What shocked me next was how fast it went down the freeway and stopped in the blink of an eye.  It had traveled about one mile.  I was in such of the speed, that I checked the odometer on the distance it traveled.  I pulled over to the side of freeway about 25 yards away from it, thinking I had better not drive underneath it.  This light was about telephone pole high above the freeway and was motionless and dead silent.

I got out of bed to investigate because I also noticed that it didn't move at all.  It was quite high, higher than any helicopter.  Take note - we live a few miles away from Sikorsky Aircraft so I know helicopters; we see them all the time, along with jet aircraft which land and take off at Tweed and Bridgeport Airports.  The next thought that crossed my mind was that it may be a satelite or even the space station.  But the object was stationary at all times and remained nearby another star, which I was using as a reference for distance.  I woke up my wife (who was none too pleased) and after discounting all the previously mentioned possibilities, she agreed that it was something we have never seen before.  We both went outside and with my binoculars, tried to get a closer view of the object.  Even then, it was still too far away to discern any particular shape, but we could clearly see it changing colors.  Also of interest is that for the two hours that we continuously observed this object it remained stationery and within the same cluster of stars, moving along with the group as the earth rotated.  We saw this in the South Eastern sky without a single cloud around.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,41.213053513513515,-73.12902108108108

We were attending my son’s 7th grade football game at Northview High School in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The sky was overcast with a ceiling of 7500’. I noticed a small Cessna-type plane in the sky that was towing an advertising banner. I would estimate that the plane was flying at an altitude of about 1500’ to 2000’. While trying to decipher the message on the banner, I noticed an additional object in the sky above the plane. It was considerably higher than the plane and appeared to be smaller than the plane, even when the greater altitude was taken into consideration. After watching the object for a while I thought I could discern a chevron shape with a reddish cast. I pointed it out to my wife and my fourteen year-old daughter. They both immediately saw it. The object seemed to “pace” the plane, mimicking the plane’s path, though much higher in the sky. We watched the object for several minutes. At one point I looked away for a couple of seconds and when I looked back the object had disappeared.  After the game I asked my daughter what she had seen and she said that it looked like a huge red hawk.  Several  possible explanations come to mind. It could have been a paraglider, but if it was, it was flying at an altitude far higher than I have ever seen before. I thought that it might be some type of kite or balloon device used to support the tail end of the advertising banner. But the pacing behavior didn’t coincide with the movements one would expect from a “trailer”. Besides, when the plane flew directly over our heads later, at a lower altitude after the object had disappeared, there was no evidence that the banner had any attachments. It might have been an eagle or a hawk, but it seemed too big as well as being the wrong color. Whatever it was, it was unusual.

Were they were man-made or terrestrial? There were 3 circular objects high in the sky on Sept. 24th 2005. The objects gave the appearance of planets far away, not stars.  They were too close and not as brilliant white or aqua color as stars.  In fact they were light yellow to my eyes while to my wife's eyes they were red.  When I first noticed them I was sitting at my computer working on some music.  My computer desk faces a window out the back of my home.  All of a sudden out the corner of my eye (left) I noticed this bright light.  It just appeared out of nowhere!?  So I looked at it for a few seconds trying to make out what it was....actually, waiting for it to move.  Nothing!   So I ignored it a few more seconds then took another peek.  THENNNNN, I called to my wife to come take a look at this and to bring me my field glasses.  My curiosity and imagination got the best of me at that point.  I wanted my field glasses because have good magnification.  I can actually see the surface of the Moon pretty good on a clear night with these field glasses (binoculars :->).  Oddly, these objects weren't THAT far away where I shouldn't be able to get a clear image come in but my field glasses could NOT focus clearly????  To me that's TOOOOO strange?   Why?   All I could focus enough to see was that the objects were circular; there were 3 of them all-together, and each had a very light-yellowish appearance to it.   I could also see clearly how they were positioned in the sky. They were positioned about southwest of my eyesight while I was facing west.  The larger circle was centered between two smaller ones both about 1/2 its size.  What was more interesting was that the larger object seem to emit a very, very faint white (or yellowish) beam of light that stretch upwards and downwards while the two smaller objects emitted lights pointing at 45 degree angles up and down from their left and right sides.  Meaning, the beams of light formed a V on its side ("">"" and ""<"").  I wasn't going to spend my whole evening watching this thing but I have to admit my curiosity got the best of me.  I kept peering out the window every 5 mins or so.  At points I would actually watch for almost 5 mins straight! It was compelling!  There seemed to be no explaination of what it was or why it was suddenly there.  I was actually waiting for some government surveillance planes to surround it. There's my answer! LOL!  What I did see were at least 2 planes (ours, doubtlessly) pass by in the same 'spectrum grid' (if I may).  I say 'spectrum grid' because the sky is HUGE and we all know how the eyes can play tricks on you while trying to tell how far apart 2 objects are.  What might look like a few feet away could actually be miles!   Anyhow, the lights weren't stabalized.  It took them about an hour to move out of my sight, northwest.  Watching it move across the sky was no different than watching the moon or sun rise and fall.  If these objects were UFO's then my suspicions is that they weren't in our atmosphere at all!  In fact, I'm thinking the 'controller' of these lights were probably in outer space using some laser beam, or something.  That's not fiction!  It could actually be true.  I say that because I've read so many stories where people have referred to UFO's as 'dancing lights' in the sky.  Well, I can make that happen too!  Give me a LASER BEAM! LOL!  Seriously, If we can do that 'dance' here on Earth with laser beams and project them FARRRRR AWAY then why wouldn't an extraterestrial!  Well, enough on opinions.  Fact is, the lights didn't dance but did raise a curiosity in me because they weren't normal to the eye.  I hope that wasn't too detailed. :)  Thx!

The phone rang-- it was my wife, calling from work. As I often do while on the phone, I stepped outside as we talked. There was still a good amount of light from the sun, which had set behind Glassford Hill (my back yard faces west, directly toward the hill). I immediately saw the orange ball and knew what it was. I have seen perhaps 10 of these in the 3.5 years I’ve lived at this house. With most of my sightings, the objects have been moving in a roughly south to north path, but a few –including one dramatic sighting- have moved in a north-south direction. This time it was moving south to north.  This time the object was quite close, and very distinct, directly in front of me and clear. It was, again, a very bright orange glowing ball. There appeared to be something above it that the glow was reflecting on. As with another close sighting, when my wife and I both had a good amount of time to view one of these objects, I had the impression that the glow was on the underside of a larger object. This time, perhaps because there was more ambient light in the sky, this thing above the glow was more apparent. I almost got the impression that it might be a balloon with some sort of flare burning under it. (Is there any known weather balloon or anything that fits that description?) It appeared to be quite close (although it is admittedly difficult to judge distances on lights in the dark sky) it was completely silent.  I was quite excited and told my wife what was happening. When she put me on hold (oddly, to tell a customer at her work that I was watching a UFO), I started yelling out loudly that there was a UFO in the sky, hoping that one of the neighbors would look up. I’m sure I sounded like a nut, but I was hoping that some other people would see what I was seeing (I don’t know if anyone heard or looked up and saw it).  It was moving fairly quickly, and since the air was very still, it seems unlikely that this was a balloon or anything else floating in the wind. I ran inside and grabbed my camera. The object was still quite close but I was having a hard time getting the camera to focus on it in the dim light. I watched it for a little while longer and decided to try to take a picture again. This time it focused and I got the attached snapshot (see email). It was quite far away by now and appeared as just a small dot in the sky. In the picture the object looks blurred because, presumably, the shudder speed was long. The combination of the movement of the object and my hand shaking is what caused the object the be shaped that way (I am assuming this because it was round to my eye).  Also attached to the email is a PhotoShop sketch of what I saw, as the photo is so poor and doesn’t really illustrate my sighting.  I have another report from 12-28-2004 that I can send you, along with a similar photo, if you would like. Let me know.

One night however on a walk to my grandmother's house I saw what I am still to this day sure of. A semi-large brigt white object setting dead still somewhere lower than an airplane path would be.  No it wasn't Venus . I was sure of it's place in the atmosphere. What really sat me down was what was going on around it. 5 to 6 seperate red sigular lights where darting around away and some even merged with the white object. They did so in an unorganized manner . It was too high for a light show, and besides it is a small town, and there wouldn't be one anyway.

For the longest time I didn't tell anyone but my husband, partly because I didn't know who to tell and partly because I was afraid of how it would sound.  I am 53 yrs old now and have no psychological disorders, nor have I ever suffered from such a disorder. I have also never seen anything like this again.  Around 5:30 p.m. one evening I turned onto route 78 traveling south towords our home in a little town, Laura, Illinois.  There were no other cars on the road when I saw it, and I was in a farming area which was open fields only.  I am sure that many other people saw the object also that night, because it must have been seen by the cars passing on the nearby expressway.  I was 10 miles from home at the point I first noticed it, and near the intersection of Illinois route 78, and U.S. route 150.  The sky was dark, and just as I turned south onto route 78 I saw a large, redish-organge cigar shaped light traveling what I estimated to be upwards of 500 miles per hour.  The light was traveling due west and it took only moments for the craft to travel completely accross the sky and out of my sight.  The object was at least 10 times the size of a commercial airplane but made no sound whatsoever, and was flying at about the height of a 20 story building.  As soon as I saw it, I drove as fast as my car would travel twords home, believing that my world was coming to an end because the only thing that I had seen that looked something like this was a picture of a guided missle.  When I arrived home I thought my husband would be meeting me at the door since something like this would surely have been on the news.  After it became clear that this was not the case, we waited for the evening news to hear what I saw, but apparantly no one else had reported it either.  I have never heard anything about what I saw in the sky that night.  I'm glad that I've finally gotten this out in the open, and thank you for listening.

We counted seven (7) circular white lights on the underside.  The triangle craft was moving at a high rate of speed, surrounded by a white haze.  The lights on the underside were NOT flashing or pulsating.  The craft was darker than the night sky.  It appeared to be heading from east to southwest from the ocean, i.e. from Fort Lauderdale area towards the Everglades.  The altitude appeared to be no more than one mile.  What impressed us both was the speed, shape, lights, haze, and silence of this craft.  It was observed from our rear yard at night.  ((END TEXT OF WRITTEN REPORT))  ((ADDENDUM FROM LETTER, WRITTEN BY WITNESS))  ..Prior to contacting you, I watched the Peter Jennings Special on television and your Reporting Center was shown.  My reason for calling was to learn if others had observed the craft similar to the one my wife and I observed in 1989.  I have agreed to submit the sighting forms, as you suggested, and I would appreciate a telephone response as promised.  After all these years, I really desire an answer as to the question of were we the only persons to observe this type of unidentified craft.  One evening in 1989 (month not remembered), my wife and I were sitting in our open back yard patio hoping to observe the fire trail of a launching at Cape Kennedy, which could be visible unobstructed, as we reside on a lake.  For reasons unknown, we did not see the flame tail and were returning to the house.  Suddenly, my wife became very excited and pointed towards the Eastern sky.  Approaching us east to west from the ocean/Fort Lauderdale area, was a strange flying vehicle.  It was moving very quickly at a low altitude and turning southwest directly towards our home.  We both observed a very large triangle, or arrowhead shaped craft, surrounded by a haze at approximately 3/4, or a mile, altitude.  As it passed above us, it made no sound.  It was completely silent.  Clearly visible were circular white lights, seven in number, on the underside, beginning at the nose, and evenly spaced towards the rear.  It disappeared from view, going towards the Everglades.  I build model aircraft as a hobby, and this vehicle was not shaped like anything I have ever seen, including the stealth F-117, or the B2 Bomber.  My wife and I mentioned this incident to several of our friends and neighbors immediately; however, they expressed no interest.  We did not contact any official agency for obvious reasons.  I hope that this information will be useful.  Please keep our identities confidential, as my former work in Law enforcement raised certain hostilities.  I would appreciate a short collect telephone response.  I now have great interest in determining whether my wife and I were the only persons that observed this triangle type of UFO.  Thank you in advance. ((END CORRESPONDENCE))  ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the source of this report on several occasions, and he appears to us to be an exceptionally qualified observer.

I am trying to find articles in the newspapers to get the date it was definately covered in the papers {i can find nothing online). The Civil Air Patrol searched the mountain and found nothing. I distincly remember this being late October or early to mid November. there were two witnesses to this event. myself (at the time i was in my earl 20's and going to school I am now 33 years old and work for a high tech company in the GIS field). My Mother ( a retired school teacher)  saw the last half of the objects sighting, their manuevers and their sudden speeding off. I had also been on the phone with my brother who was away at college and i was describing to him what i was seeing. We both agreed that no planes could ever pull off the manuevers these did in such a tight formation and then suddenly shoot off like they did.. This sighting happened for well over 10 minutes. I reported this to MUFON some years ago in NH but never got a response back. I am suprized nobody else had seen this or if they did they never reported it?  All these years  I have wondered this. I have no reason to make this up and what i saw is what i saw and i just want to find out what the hell this was and why it happened a week after the report of a crash on MT Kearsarge. Hopefully someone else will read this and will say ""I saw it too"". I wish i had been able to photgraph these lights. But i can also draw what i saw quite clearly. Its something you don't forget. on to what we saw:  It was around 7:15pm on a clear calm fall evening. I had gone outside to look around at the sky since it was so clear and it was not too cold. After about 10 minutes outside  I started to notice something through the leafless trees as I faced South. There was a bank of red lights that suddenly shifted to green and then they went out. I thought that was rather strange. It seemed to me to possibly be the edge of a huge black featureless object but i cannot be certain because i did not get a full clear view. The main objects appeared directly south of me across a field . I would say they must have been about a mile away. Size based on distance they were about the size of a dime. [by this time it was around 7:30pm where i opened the backdoor and called my mother to come see this careful to keep observing] There were two formations of yellowish lights (almost like incandecent lightbulbs). each formation was in a rough upside down scewed L shape they moved at the same speed slowly together holding their formation. There were 12  total objects with 6  in each formation. At first i thought they were two solid objects until they pulled their manuevers.  I heard no sound whatsoever. Then several of them did some incredible manuevers shifting their position in the formation. That part really freaked me out.  they then shot off  at an incredible speed.[this sequence lasted roughly 1 minute] My Mother only saw the few moments when they did some anomalistic motion and then shot off at high rate of speed (near blink of an eye speed).  I was a little shaken with what i saw and it still sorta gives me the creeps today. I travel I-89 frequently at night  and see lots of strange stuff.

Also, being a HUMUNGOUS skeptic about the situation- in all honesty, it looked like the largest, luminous, ominous kite I've ever seen;  If the thing was a kite, it must have been flying outside of the entire venue- I would have been able to see some kind of string to support a large craft like the one in question, or a quick reflection streak of light that would have caught my eye; nothing though. I can't remember if it was windy in the first place...  It hovered very slowly as we almost forgot about the music and speculated, questioned, feared, and awed at what the hell this glowing green hovering object's purpose, orgin, and location were. Everyone else in our proximity were really intoxicated and were useless to get to pay attention... I take everything with a grain of salt. My friend swears that it was a UFO; I am personally indifferent. it really does make sense for the ""aliens"" to study a population spike like a huge music festival, given that there are aliens with green ellipse-shaped craft that moves like a kite.  Honestly, it was truly un-conventional, unidentified, flying, and a tangible object. I can only pray to have my entire reality questioned like this again.  Unbelieveable.

If I sat directly strait it was 75 degrees to the right when we first saw it.  We hopped out of the car and watched it fly away shocked by what we were witnessing.  We watched it move past the field and over the tree line.  We jumped back into the car to see if we could chase it, but we couldent find it again.  What we were looking at is extremly hard to describe.  It had lights that moved rythmicly over the back.  The object could be best described as liquid light.  The light was red and Waved into the center (the center of the back, not the center of the object).   The BACK of the object was cigar shaped (not to say that it was a cigar shaped object) but the object itself was barely visible.

About a month ago my friend and I went for a evening walk on the Coyote Dam at Lake Mendocino CA. It was around 8:30pm daylight savings time and the sun was just setting behind the mountains on the opposite side of the valley. As we were walking I looked over at the sunset area where the sky was still glowing a soft pink and saw a brilliant illuminated pink object. At first I thought it was a lone stray cloud that was glowing from the sunset. Upon watching the object I realized that the brilliant color of the glow seemed to come from a super reflective surface that was much brighter than any cloud glow Ive ever seen before. Not to mention there were not any clouds in the sky at the time.  I pointed the object out to my friend and we began to watch it. She was as amazed as I was. We talked about it for some time while watching it and debating what on earth it could have been. It was moving very slightly; so slow that you couldnt really notice it at all. At one point it began to move faster, but still very slow... and MUCH slower than any of the planes that fly over the valley. As the sunset got darker the object stayed bright glowing pink. It was sort of a diamond/cylinder shape. It was quite a distance away from us. As we continued to watch the object we noticed it had a red and white light that would randomly blink on the surface of it - not at the same time... each light would go off differently at different times with no obvious pattern. The object moved closer to us in a south/east direction and then began to move away in the direction it had come. It got smaller and smaller and then immediately vanished as if it hadent been there at all.  It was not a dramatic display but it was unlike any airplanes or craft we have seen before. Not to mention the fact that it was flying in such a strange and slow flight pattern. No one else walking on the dam seemed to notice it or watch it the way we were.

I live south of Nampa, Idaho -- a community near the recent July 2005 sightings of bright lights over fields in Meridian. I have an educated guess (?) as to what those folks saw, because I saw a similar thing in the fields around my house at about 10 p.m. on July 15.  At about 10 p.m., I went to the sliding glass door of the master bedroom to let my dog out onto the patio. The back of my house, patio, and long backyard face west. I heard a plane flying low overhead, which is not unusual because I am between the Nampa Municipal airport and the Owyhee Mtns to the south/southwest; lots of folks like to take small planes from that airport and sightsee. I thought maybe it was someone returning late from a trip into the Owyhees; at this point, it's mostly dark, with just a hint of pinkish sunset left to the northwest of us, toward Nampa and Caldwell. (Idaho daylight and sunsets are long in the summer.)  I was surprised to see a plane just RIGHT THERE, heading south along Track Road, arced in a sharp curve and obviously making a U-turn back toward the north (back toward Deer Flat Rd). When the plane was facing me head-on (the plane was now facing east, toward Meridian/Boise), I saw that across the front of the plane there were 3 round, bright white lights, along with a very small colored light on each wing tip. (I believe one was green and one was red, although on subsequent passes/turns, I also saw blue wing-tip lights -- guess FAA regulations dictate which lights have to shine depending on what motion you are performing?)  As the daughter of a retired pilot/cropduster, I realized it was a cropdusting plane. (Although I admit I did not realize you could operate them after dark -- thought it was a safety hazard.) I watched as the pilot crossed Deer Flat Rd -- the pilot then popped on a bank of REALLY bright white (almost pale yellowish) lights on the underside of the plane. When I say really bright, I mean bright enough that I could see not only the tops of the onion plants he was spraying in that dark field, but the mist of the chemical coming out of the spray jets.  I watched for several minutes as he swooped low to the ground and arced and turned and popped his various sets of lights on and off while he dusted the field -- quite a skilled pilot in a nimble plane.  I was amused to think that it reminded me of some scenes in Close Encounters with the craft zooming down the road and thought, ""Well, if you weren't close enough to hear the engine, you'd think it was a UFO!""  Then I got to thinking about the Meridian reports I'd read earlier that week... At that point, I grabbed a notebook and tried to sketch out the lights in order to compare it to the report I'd read on the NUFORC site. After a couple minutes, I thought about getting the camera, but by the time I'd located it, realized I needed the flash, went back in and located the flash, then went back out to the patio, the plane had changed fields and was spraying fields west of Track Road toward Powerline (where it dead-ends at Star Pass Ridge). That was a somewhat eerie sight, seeing those lights pop on and off from behind one of the rare stands of trees in the area.  When I came back to the NUFORC site today, I see that the Meridian reports are front-and-center and that the folks are going to be on the Coast-to-Coast AM show soon. Now, I obviously can't swear for certain that this is what those folks saw in Meridian around the first of the month, but there are lots of fields and agricultural operations in the western edge of Meridian/eastern edge of Nampa (the garage farms haven't taken over all of it, yet!), and it IS cropdusting season (apparently even at night). And if they had burning eyes, it could be from the poison the plane was spraying on the crops. Plus, one witness' drawing DID describe the object as having a ""plane"" shape.  So that's just my information to offer as a possible explanation of what might be an IFO instead of a UFO. Please note, if relevant, that I am a MUFON member.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,43.56891901408451,-116.56197605633803

I grabbed my binoculars and got a closer look. I can see the three objects quite clearly and I can see the stars in between so I know it wasn't a solid object. They were moving at exactly the same speed. As I was watching them the one in the front dimmed out and then the two behind did also. Shortly after that about 3 mins another two of these showed up traveling the same direction. I grabbed my binoculars and as soon as I locked on them, they dimmed out.

This observations happened when I was about 9 or 10 years old (give or take), and I'm now 23, so the details are fuzzy - but the memory is not!   I was out with my dad at one of his friends house, located up in ""the knobs"" outside of New Albany/Clarksville, Indiana. Those from this area will know what I mean. The Knobs are very hilly geographical features that overlook the Louisville metropolitan area... they are where the glaciers stopped advancing in the last ice age..... so basically we were up on these hills (rural area) with a great view of the flat, sprawling metropolis below (could see for miles).  Anyway, I remember becoming bored and going out to sit on the picnic table and enjoy the view... just to see what I could see from the vantage point. Only, when I went out, something caught my eye... it looked like an airplane or something at first. But I knew it wasn't a plane when it started behaving very strange.  The object appeared to be just a bright, defined speck of light, that was contantly changing colors very rapidy. The entire object changed colors at once, so that it was one one color at one moment, and another the next. Mind you, this just describes the color of the light. The object was too small (and too far away) to determine a shape. I would estimate it to have been about 2-5 miles out, and about 1,000 to 3,000 feet in altitude. All I remember was looking ""out"" at it, rather than ""up"" at it.  What was bizarre about the object was how it moved... it would basically just zig-zag back and forth at pretty good speeds. Sometimes it would go slow, sometimes fast, but always in a back and forth, up and down, to and fro motion.  I remember calling my dad and his friend outside to see it, and they at first seemed annoyed at my insistence, but once they saw it, they changed their tune. Too bad, it disappeared right after they caught a glimpse of it. It literally looked like it simply just ""shut-off""... it didn't fly away or anything like that.  Of note, what persuaded me to submit my memory was my reading another entry on this site. It was such a close description, and they mentioned wanting to know about others who have had a similar experience. That post was made on 3/21/2003, by an Evansville couple.

With our 8 power glasses we could see black material dividing the panels and a black border framing the entire set of 16 panels, This border appeared to be about the thickness of 1/4 the width of a panel. The colors were green, blue, yellow and red and did not flash or change color. Our camp site location was on the north side of the river a few miles above the entry of the Diamond Fork tributary entering the Klickitat, and, where the river turns due West for a short way. The shape sank slowly out of sight with no side motion and was gone at 6:30 pm. Sunset was 6:50 pm in the Seattle area that day.

I was driving out of the town of Zebulon, North Carolina... toward Wendell, North Carolina along Highway 97. I was taking my daughter (12 at the time) home from school. As I drove down a long hill, I noticed something large in the sky, blocking the sky over much of the road in front of me. I mentioned it to my daughter who, needless to say totally freaked out and begged me not to stop. I didn't stop, but I did drive extremely slowly in order to get a better look at it and try to remember exactly how it looked from underneath. I did for about two minutes or more. It looked very much like the 3D picture I am inclosing. The 3D picture I am inclosing was hard to do and the lighting is not quite right, but it is as close as I can get to what I saw that evening bringing my daughter home from school. Although the picture shows square edges, I have yet to learn how to make rounded corners in the program I used.  The large ship flew silently. It flew at a constant (almost sickning) speed of maybe 15 mph or less. The outside of the ship (or rather the bottom which is all we saw because of the size of it) was black, but not shiny. Dull black is what we saw. The ship was bigger than anything I had ever heard of, maybe being 6 football fields or larger. It was so large, neither one of us could tell if it was round or square or what... although I watched it intently, I believe it was of a rectangle shape, for we could see two of the sides, but not the other two. I looked to the right and to the left into the tops of the trees to see just how big the thing was, but could not see an end to it in either direction. It flew just above the tree tops, at least it looked very very close to us.  As it flew over my car (with my daughter now screaming histerically) I noticed that while one side of this huge ship was just beginning to hover over the car, the other side that was seeable was still about a quarter mile down the street. The bottom of the craft had something 'molded' into the bottom like huge rooms with rounded off corners sticking out of the bottom. There were round tubes that went from one 'room' to another. I only got a look at the part of the ship that came over the road. I drove even slower, hoping that someone would come down the road so I could stop them and tell them to ""Look! There is a ship!"" I saw no lights what so ever and the bottom of the ship was extremely visible to the naked eye.  I wouldn't ever call it a UFO. This was a ship. It was bigger than anything I or my daughter has ever seen, and it flew right over my car and over the town of Zebulon, North Carolina. This is not the only time things have been seen here.  I emplore the public to please report anything seen of this magnitude in or around Zebulon, North Carolia or anywhere else for that matter. Someone besides us had to have seen this huge ship or even got a glimpse of a ship that has huge molded 'rooms' on the bottom!

I wanted my wife to see them but was fixated on watching and figured she would not have time to get outside before they were gone. My watching time was a couple of minutes or so and I immediately knew I was seeing something not natural/normal. I was watching six or more bright orange lights in a V formation (like a boomerang) moving slowly at a low altitude. There was no sound. The minute it had passed I went in the house and told Mother and wife what I had just seen. I wondered if others had also witnessed the happening. The next morning it was big news and was seen by  hundreds from towns starting  in northern Arizona.....through Phoenix and on down to Tucson. I called the Arizona Republic and told the reporter what I had seen and assured her I was not into UFO happenings and was hopeful of an explanation.

I leaned forward in my seat and all 3 of us witnessed lights in the sky. It was a row of lights about five across. They appeared to be very close, the windows were down and we heard no sound. I did not have much time to consider what they were before this happened: each light, one at a time in order went out, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and in the same timing/rythm all five came on together, stayed for a beat longer and then all five blanked out at the same time. We saw no more, heard nothing, the lights did not fly away or appear to have moved about. They just went out. In Casa Grande, on this road in particular, there is nothing to obstruct the view of the sky. No streetlights, no tall trees, and no hills or mountains. It is flat. I refueled helicopters at Fort Hood, Texas and it did not appear to be anything that I have seen before. Furthermore there would have to be five helicopters together generating lots of noise and hovering very, very close togther or a LARGE helo with five landing lights. This did happen at the same time that the Phoenix lights appeared. I am certain that this was a part of that occurence.

I had forgotten about the footage and just recently came across some ufo pictures that were remarkably the same as the one shot by my dad so i thought i should inform someone. My parents had gone back home to Pakistan to visit and my dad would video tape everyday to bring back images of our home and everyday life for us to see and one evening before they were about to leave for shopping, my dad saw a very bright object in the sky. Knowing about my facination with UFO's he thought it would be something interesting for me to see so he turned on his video camera and started shooting the object in the sky. The object is very bright and has the same distinct shape as the Bonsall, Derbyshire - 2000 ufo http://www.freewebs.com/nurmufo/bonsall.html. The interesting thing that i noticed on the footage my dad shot is that on close observation, one can see an object or two leave the bright orb and later come back into it. Also the ufo changes its colour from white to blueish and then electric red and you can hear my dad say on camera that the object is increasing in size and then contracting back to its original form which gives the illusion of camera zooming in and out, when it is not. The footage has many reference points, but is not more then 2 or 3 minutes as my mom forced my dad to get in the car cause she was getting late for shopping. My dad informed me that the object was there for quite some time before he started shooting it and also after he stopped. The footage was shot in a housing complex and i belive many people would have seen it but UFO's are not common place in Pakistani culture and usually ignored or dismissed as stars.  Please get back to me if you would be interested in the footage. Cheers",2005-04-16T00:00:00,,

I was a passenger on an Air France flight from Amsterdam to Dulles Airport. I was sitting in the very last row, right hand side, window seat. We had entered USA airspace, and according to the monitors mounted in the passenger section we were between 11000-12000 feet altitude, descending towards DC. I was looking down, taking in the view (I've loved the window seat since a child). There were broken clouds below, perhaps 8000-10000 feet in altitude. I could see water and patches of land between the clouds. Suddenly, below the airplane, appeared a white disk. I was looking right down on it. It was travelling perpendicular to our direction of flight. It was clearly between the plane and the clouds. I would estimate that it was less than 500 feet below my vantage point. It was chalky white and had the appearance of an Alka-seltzer tablet. There were no markings that I could see, but I did notice two dark lines that came in from its outer edge to about a quarter of the way towards its center. The central portion was raised. It was moving very fast and did not appear interested in our plane. It's difficult to say how large it was, but as I've flown hundreds of times and have seen many other aircraft while in the air, I'd have to say that it was no more than fifty feet in diameter, and perhaps less. It was unlike anything I've ever seen before. Quite remarkable. No wings, exhaust, windows, markings, or lights. Since my flight was heading SW I'd have to say that it was heading SE, towards open water",2005-04-16T00:00:00,,

I looked out my windshield to the left and saw a big fireball. You could see the flames it was red in color. It had to have been huge and it was moving faster than an airplane but it did not shoot across the sky like a shooting star. It was a bit alarming to see a fireball coming across the sky like that. We watched it for about 5 minutes when it disappeared for about 15 seconds and then reappeared again. This is when we noticed two other fireballs. They were going in a triangle shape going east in the sky. Just about 5 miles from the Sallisaw exit the first one disappeared. The fire seemed to disappear from the front and then from the back and then nothing. The second fireball did the same as the first. The third fireball we watched when we pulled off the first Sallisaw exit. We watched until we turned onto the street and the trees got in our way.

It definitely had glimmering lights that were flashing and the lights colors were red, yellow, purple, blue, orange, green, pink, and white. At the beginning of the sighting, it was still outside and no stars were visible. I determined for certain that it was not a satellite, a meteor, a blimp, a comet, etc. Because they move and this object was stationary for about 25 minutes. I thought it may be the star sirius cause I know a little about astronomy and it is the brightest star in our constellations. But when I went outside to investigate further, I saw more signs that this was silver colored. Then the most amazing thing happened. I witnessed the object very quickly move to the northwest and then several seconds later returned exactly to where it was prior.  Then a couple of minutes elapsed and it suddenly moved very quickly further from my view in a frontwards motion.  It was no longer visible, which means it cannot be a star. I moved back further about twenty-five feet and up a slight hill in my backyard. I could see the object again. I think that the object was beeing operated by intelligent forces because of the way it moved so fast and deliberately. After a couple of more minutes the object retreated a distance into the north and I could no longer see it.

The farm is at a rather high elevation and we had a clear line of sight for several miles to the Southwest across US Highway 60.

It flew to the Southwest to almost exactly where the birds had come from and began hovering not more than 75 to 100 feet above the field on my Uncle's farm.  The craft continued to hover for several minutes and I watched it the entire time.  There were no marking at all and all of the front bubble glass appeared to be tinted very dark.  I was unable to see anyone inside and it was close enough that I should have been able to see the pilot clearly.  If anyone else has had any type of contact with a black chopper like this, I would like to know who these people are and if the birds and the chopper are related incidents or just coincidence.

My mom and I were coming home from town at approximately 7:35~7:45 pm central time. It was a cloudy night. On our way home we both saw these two lights hovering in the sky right beside each other that were of a amber color (like that of a pole light). Neither one of us said anything for about 2 minutes because we thought that they were perhaps some sort of airplane. Then after noticing that they were not moving at all, I asked her what they were and she told me that she had been watching them and that she was wondering that same thing.  We pulled over to see if they were in moving and we came to find out that they were sitting completely still. We decided to move slightly closer to them just so we could get some sort of a perspective of where they might be hovering over and as we were driving we passed by two trees and once we passed those trees, we looked for the lights and they were gone. We decide to turn around and go back up the hill thinking that for some odd reason maybe we just couldn't see them from the angle that we were at. So we went back up the hill and we still saw nothing. We drive past where we saw them the first time and when we almost get to our home, we saw them again. So, we drove closer to them yet again just on a different road this time. We parked the car and watched them for about 3~5 minutes then, as my mom was looking for the binoculars, I saw the first one fade out. I told my mother and she looked up and with the binoculars, she watched the second one fade away. They did not reapear so we decided to go on home. We got home and were inside for about 5 minutes and then went back outside to look for them once more. We got outside on our backpourch and through the trees we saw 5 of them, all in a line just like the 2 earlier. We go out to the end of our driveway and they were still there. We watched them for about 5 minutes yet again and then we both watched them slowly fade away. There were two others sightings.

Grad from Purdue flight program here and these were NOT airplanes.  Many people witnessed. I would like to confirm a report in Lafayette that somebody else made for this date.  I even called it into the cops and they were receiving calls as well from others.  I was driving in my car on US Hwy 52 between West Lafayette and Lafayette.  To the Northeast, I saw one bright orange light moving through the air... too fast for an airplane and no strobes so I was instantly interested.  Then I saw a second one light up right behind it followed by a 3rd, 4th, and 5th.  They ascended and the light went out, but I could see the dark craft circling around and light up again when it came to the bottom part of the circle.  They did this for about 3 cycles and disappeared.  I am a graduate from Purdue University from the flight program, so I know what planes look like.  THIS WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT FROM THIS WORLD... unless it was some secret government aircraft, but the military operations area is NOT near either city and the bases around here are not known for producing abnormal activity.  I am absolutely convinced it was some kind of alien craft and have reported it to the student newspaper and the local newspaper and am still waiting for a response.  I will write letters to the editors to try to get others to report this.  I told all of my friends about this and most did not believe me.  One who didn't believe me was at work Sunday when a co-worker brought up how she saw UFOs around 10PM on the same night and he was stunned.  I am convinced there were MANY who saw this.  The woman who told him about her sighting said she saw all of the lights merge together and disappear.  The other witnesses listed were in the car behind me and pointing toward the UFO's.  Please watch the local papers! ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) Supplemental report:  I talked with the Tippecanoe County Police tonight and the officer stated that they have confirmation that the military was dropping flares last night.  The objects I saw were to the Northeast, which is in the direction of the Military Operations Area (MOA) for Grissom AFB.  I do not believe they have fast, highly maneuverable aircraft station at that base.  The officer also stated that it was unusual that the AFB did not announce any flares or military operations to the FAA.  The area of the sighting would be in control of Chicago Center, which the officer said did not see anything on radar.  The officer stated that the flight controller in chicago was really mad because he saw nothing on their radar and was not notified.  I believe I estimated that the objects were around 5 or 6 thousand feet.  From my flight experience, I know center will not see objects below about 6,000 feet.  The officer assured me that the AFB had the aircraft on radar and it was their planes.  The bottom line is that nobody knew of any military operations beforehand, which makes the event more interesting.  The other problem with the flare excuse is that the lights did not last long.  Also, I would estimate the lights were only lit for 5 seconds at a time and I believe flares should last longer.  The biggest problem with the flare excuse is that all of the lights started at the exact same point in the sky.  The only way the flares could start at the same point is if the airplane is flying directly toward or away from me.  If that was the case, the flares should not have had such lateral movement.   The lights were also at a constant speed and did not descend much or slow down as you would expect.  Assuming the aircraft stayed in the MOA, the speed of the lights should have been much slower.   In my professional opinion as a graduate of the Purdue flight program, the lights originated from an aircraft beyond the capabilities of modern fighter jets that the public is made aware of.  Due to the silence and disappearance of the craft (which I could see when the lights turned off during the circling maneuver), I tend to think it may be extraterrestrial, but then again, I didn't see it enter orbit.  I told all of my friends about what I saw and none of them witnessed the event, however one of my friends who dismissed my claim was at work when a co-worker started talking about UFOs that she saw.  She stated that at the end, the orangish lights all came together and then disappeared.  I will be trying to get more info ASAP.

I continued to watch it from my car but as it passed my car, I decided to turn my car around and find a nearby parking lot to park at so that I could get out of my car and continue to observe this object. It was a little cloudy but only a little. This object didn't seem to be going very fast, though. What was strange to me besides the triangular shape is that it seemed to have a slight wobble to it as it flew towards my car. Also, while other planes and helicopters in the air had lights on, this craft did not have lights. It almost looked as though it was hiding in the clouds because it seemed to stay in the clouds as it moved and would occasionally come out of the clouds.

As I continued walking I noticed that these four lights were moving a bit too erratically to be ordinary advertising lights. Throughout the night I kept going outside to find that these ""dancing lights"" had changed positions in the sky many times. Sometimes they were hovering right at tree level and other times they were way up overhead. At one point a low flying aircraft flew overhead and the lights disappeared briefly only to reappear down the roan and below the horizon.  As I gazed at them, I almost became mesmerized by the patterns they were making and my eyes were drawn to the meeting point when they would all suddenly dart or dive together. They appeared to change color slightly to light green, pink and blue.  I have absolutely no doubt that this was not a normal occurence. I ran in and got my room mate to come out to witness and she agreed that these lights were not from an airport or advertising display.

The sound was too different.  I went outside to see what had caused the noise, and I heard a new sound start.  A very loud, large rumbling noise made me look up.   The sound just started, it did not start low and get louder, the sound just started, very loud, and seemed to stay at the same level.  A very large, oblong object, seemed to be solid, no wavering around the edges like a cloud or smoke. Shape stayed constant. The sky was full of stars, and that is the only way I could determine the shape of the object.   Their was no light coming from the object, and none of the outside light reflected off the object.  I tried to get a picture, but the object was so dark, all of the pictures turned out black.  It seemed to be just a little ways above the hill tops, but with the object so dark, an exact height can't be determined.   I can estimate the length to be about 270 feet, approximate based on the width of the hills in front and in back of my house.  Width of the object, is a little harder, it seemed to be about 1/3 width of the object as compared to the length.   It was moving very slowly, and I watched for about 3 minutes.

In 1985 we went to county Kerry Ireland on a holiday we stayed in a place called Glenbeigh.  Their were three familys, myself and two of my freinds all lovers of beach fishing. I will explain that my two friends both in their forties were sensible, ordinary family men, not into making up stories.  we usually went fishing together, but on this night we were going to meet on the beach at different times, one of my freinds Bob was the first to leave, a bit later the second friend John left  we were all going to meet on the beach,a beach usually  pitch black at night. I was the last go to the beach. I drove on to the beach hoping to find Bob and John but I was unable to find them, so I left to go back to my caravan on the way back up the beach I came across Bobs car high up on a sand dune  but Bob was no where to be seen.When I got back I found Bob at the caravan site looking pale and shaking,He said he was fishing on the beach when he saw a light out on the water, said at that point he was not really concerned, as he was fishing he noticed the light getting closer to the beach but up from him, This light which he described as like a light from a helicopter travelling just above the water but no sound,the light eventually came closer to him, again it was out from him, but within casting distance.He said he was not too concerned, had not got a clue what it was but carried on fishing anyway.He said he started to get scared when as he tried to cast his line out, it the fishing line kept dropping at his feet, his line would consist of one  large hook and a lead weight. He tried casting several times but with the same result, feeling a bit nervous at this point he started to panic when the light started to come towards him, he jumped in his car and drove away as fast as he could, thats how he ended up in the sand dunes, when my other friend john returned a short time later he relayed a similar story. They were fishing seperataly as they could not find each other in the dark. Does this mean it was a UFO I dont know, but whatever energy was coming from the light source was repelling lead weights. Not wanting to look foolish they made discreet enquirys with the locals asking such questions as ,has anyone ever noticed anything strange on the beach late at night. But apart from telling them that their was a lot of spanish Galleons wrecked on the cliffs, and people sometimes say they can hear the screams of the dying. But that of course is just local folklore.It has facinated me to this day and I am so disappointed I missed out on that experience, of course I would have been just os scared as my friends were. I was just curious to know has anything similar ever happened to anyone else? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",2005-11-03T00:00:00,,

In the biography of DeForrest Kelley, who played Dr. Leonard McCoy on the original Star Trek series called ""From Sawdust To Stardust"" by Terry Lee Rioux from Pocket Books on page #87, is a report of a UFO.   Here is the report as quoted from the book:   ""Many years later, Kelly confessed that they saw an unidentified flying object while driving across country.  He said he was riding in the back of the car;  they were entering Alabama when they saw it.  'This object came by at a tremendous rate of speed at a very low altitude...around 700 or 800 feet...it looked to be about 65 feet in length.  It was a long, cigar-shaped object with green and blue flames coming out of its side.'  There was a soft sound like a missile, it had a red taillight flashing, and it had no wings.   Once in Montgomery, the trio (DeForrest Kelley, his wife Carolyn, and Superman actor George Reeves) found a newspaper that carried stories of the sightings.  Even when Kelley told the story decades later, he did not mention Reeves by name.  He quietly guarded the old friendship, and, besides, some things were just too fantastic to believe.""

Well anyway, I was like 7 or 8 years of age, with my sisters and mother all watching tv after a late dinner.  My father was at work and my older brother was sleeping in the basement.  All of a sudden I remember my house being violently vibrated, not like a earthquake vibrate, more like a fast high pitched vibrate.  Like a loud bumble bee.  My mother goes outside with me in arms to check it out.  We both look up to see a steady hovering circlular plane about a 20 feet from the top of my house.  We just stared at it for about 3 minutes and it slowly moves down my street going over all my neigbors houses.  Very dark black base with three ports of blue red and green.  The colors are faded from my memory.  Anyway, my mother calls up 911 to report it, the operator said she doesnt know whats going on.  She says to my mom the switch board over at the control center is lit up with callers from the same area.  We get a call back from the operator to let us know that response they got from air traffic control was that it was a military test.  Obviously this is bull, or maybe not, a few neigbors call my house to ask about the loud noise, and some call ask about seeing a large object above my house.  I was so young when this happened but it is all pretty clear to me. I mostly remember seeing the fear in my mom's face making me nervous.   When the object was out there, she had tried to video record it but her batteries were dead.  Sounds a bit clishea (spelling) ((cliché)) but she remembered charging it to full the day before.   The wierd thing about this story is also that, when I asked all my sisters, neigbors, and mother about the details of what they saw.  They all say a different thing.  That's what baffles me.  My mother said it was triangular, I say it was circular, two of sister say long oval, neigbor says sphere.  One sister recalls hearing no vibration just seeing a silent object in the sky.  Another sister recalls vibration.  I recall it too.  Mother says red, green, and blue portals, siter says pitch black, other sister says one big port in the center.  I feel that what happened that night was alot more than I can remember.   I suffered from chronic day and night terrors ever since it happened.  No alien dreams or anything, just the feeling of pure fear.

After my mom and I saw the UFO, I put it out of my mind for a while, I guess I was thinking we had just imagined it.   Anyways, the subject came up with a good friend a little while ago.  I confessed to having seen what I thought was a UFO, and thinking she would laugh at me.  However, she instead confessed her UFO experience that happened also many years ago in California. This got me thinking about it again, I brought it up with my mom to see if she remembered it and to see if it was really imagined.  My mom also remembers it vividly and also still wonders about it.  Reading other stories on this site, it doesn't sound so spectatular, but for me it was an amazing thing that makes me believe that I don't yet understand everything about our world and other worlds.  So...what happened is that I was living with my family on a ranch near Pryor, MT, on the Crow Indian Reservation.  The Pryor Mountains are rumored to be a scared ((sic--sacred??)) place and the Crows have many stories of bizarre occurances there, including UFO sitings.  Still, didn't think we'd ever see one.   Where we were living is very remote.  We did actually have one neighbor about a 1/2 mile away, other than that, there was no one for apx. 6 miles.  The house sat is a coulee between two ridges, with the Pryor mountains to the South of us.   We were driving down the hill toward the house with a clear view across the valley to the other ridge.  There, floating above the other ridge across from us was a very bright, large light, like a huge spotlight.  It just floated there for apx. 20-30 minutes.  We sat and watched it for awhile, then went down to the house, came back out and it was still there.  When we next checked on it, it was gone.

However, on the stated hour I witnessed something that I couldn´t immediately explain.  It was dark outside and the stars were shining.  Planet Mars  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is in the western sky, at present.  PD))  was visible near the western horizon  I was walking with my dog when I noticed an ordinary looking satellite (a spot of light) high in the Southwestern sky. It was visible just out of the right side of what astronomers of Northern hemisphere would call the Pegasi Square and it was almost as bright as the stars of the Square. The satellite was moving slowly towards southeast and also gradually fading away as satellites usually seem to do.  Well, before the satellite was completely out of sight I noticed something strange: the satellite was closely (less than 2 degrees behind) followed by another, very faint satellite.  They were visible together for about 15 seconds before fading away and they were moving into exactly same direction maintaining the visible <2 degree distance. The objects behaved just like ordinary satellites. I´ve heard of NOSS satellites and I know that they usually travel in a row or in a triangle, but I´ve never actually witnessed them.  This could be my first witness, but I´ve always thought that the visible distance of these satellites would be greater (more like 15 degrees or so). About 8 minues after the satellites had disappeared I noticed an extremely bright satellite just above the Ursa Major heading north. It was brighter than Mars when I noticed it. Then it faded a little but brightened again for some seconds before fading out of sight. This again was nothing out of the ordinary. It was probably one of Iridium satellites that usually appear like that. I´m much more interested in finding out what the first sighting was. ((NUFORC Note:  We received a similar report on September 28, of two satellites in ""tandem"" flight, but we do not know which satellites they are.  The fact that the two objects quickly faded from the observers' sight, as they flew to the east, is suggestive of satellites, as they fly into the Earth's shadow.  To the best of our knowledge, what are thought to be the U. S. Navy's ""NOSS"" satellites always appear as a ""triplet"" of satellites.  PD))",2005-10-11T00:00:00,,

I was able to get a shot of the jet trail just when the craft moved after taking a right turn again sharply at 90 degrees. then it did the same movement and curved left and down and dispeared. 30 seconds later it performed the same procedure.  I have one eyewitness that also saw the event while driving to work in the same direction. weather was clear skies.  the area that the craft moved may have been in the edwards airforce base area. where they test aircraft. but this must be a very advanced vehicle.,2005-10-11T00:00:00,35.34399793103448,-119.04089261083743

I'm filing this because of a History Channel program that referred me to this site, and I stumbled upon a sighting listed here that confirmed one I've been wondering about for almost forty years.  Camper park near Homestead, FL AFB.  Saw something with red lights along the side and a white light in front rise from trees a half mile away.  Rose slowly, then moved horizontally out over the water for about ten minutes at a slow pace.  When it came over land, it moved extremely fast, then slowed down again over water.   It kept up this circular pattern the whole time.  It was visible for over an hour. Made a jet engine whine, but very faint. There was a gravel road built up out of the water (the way they do down there) and the ship seemed to cross it a mile away.  My dad drove us down to look.  We found an Air Force car and a uniformed man who refused to acknowledge the thing we were pointing at.  He said there were just 'some boys out here drinking beer', and he wouldn't let us go any farther.  The craft was clearly visible, but he wouldn't even look over his shoulder.  We drove back to camp, and my boyfriend took a walkie-talkie with him and walked back down the road to see if he could get closer on foot.  The craft crossed over the road above him when I was talking to him on the radio.  The radio cut out, and he came running back in a panic.  The radio worked again as soon as the craft moved on. Eventually, the craft dropped down, out of sight, like a balloon landing.  It was no balloon.  When we asked the campground manager the next day, he shrugged it off. ""We see a lot of things around here. Nobody pays any attention anymore."" ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

A chevron shaped object about 100 yards across was silently floating westward from the beachside (we were on the west side of the intracoastal). It was at an altitude of approx. 1000 ft. and came from over the ocean and passed about 100 ft. over the Aliki condos on ormond beachside heading straight for the mainland.  It was only moving about 10-15 mph.  I pulled over at a riverfront park in which was in direct line of its travel. By this time it was over the river still heading west. My wife and youngest son were to frightened to get out of the car. Myself and my oldest son (about 15 at the time) got out and watched as it moved directly over us and continued west until out of sight. There was no sound at all. There were 3 orangyred lights, 1 on each wingtip and 1 at the nose. My father is a pilot and i grew up around airplanes and we see them flying up and down the coast all the time and this was NO airplane or anything of this world. It was the strangest thing ive ever seen and we will never forget.

I exited her house through the garage. My motorcycle was sitting in the driveway and I was approaching it to get on it and start it up. It was then I noticed a strange object in the sky. At first I mainly saw lights. Her house sat on the top of a hill. The object was not any more than a few hundred feet off of the ground. the area of the ground it was hovering over was down hill from me. It slowly moved closer to my location making no noise. I could then make out the shape. It was a saucer shaped object that was taller in the middle. classic flying saucer shape. Now, in the middle of the disk area on the side there where lights of a few different colors: red white green yellow and a brownish red. The colors seemed to alternate as it hovered there. I remember just standing there frozen staring at this thing. when it started to turn at an angle almost perpindicular to the ground but not quite perfectly perpendicular. as it moved to this angle there was a crude mechanical sound coming from it. it sounded alot like an espresso machine when it is pumping water through the coffee. once it was at the terminal point of its turn it was once again silent. then, no kidding, it emitted a beam of yellowish light onto the ground. at this point it was probably 50 feet in front of me. then the light stopped and the mechanical sound started again. As the sound was going it returned to a parallel position in respect to the ground. It hovered there for a little less than a minute then suddenley there was a sound that sounded like a bottle rocket when it takes off as it shot straight up into the air. It went upward so quickly that I only saw it for a split second. It left so quickly that I bareley saw it. so I looked around and noticed that about 15 feet away the neighbor, an older woman about my girlfriend's mom's age, was working in her garden and she was still staring in the direction of the very strange and very scary sight. She looked at me and said, ""that was probably a helicopter"". I looked away from her, than just said, ""yeah"". I got on my motorcycle, started it, and rode home. yep, most people think I'm crazy when I tell them about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

At the same time the color changed from the yellow/orange to a silvery metallic color. The Triangle appeared and disappeared a number of times. This was if you were looking directly at a perfect triangle. It did not rotate, bank or otherwise indicate any motion laterally, vertically or otherwise. Just a perfect triangle where the sun had been. When it reappeared however the triangle was inverted, with the tip, or point at the bottom. This disappearance and reappearance happened approximately 2 or 3 times. Then as suddenly as it had appeared, it was gone and the Sun was back as though nothing had happened. There was no disturbance or change to the emitted light in the sky. There was no sound associated with this occurance.

The freakiest part of this sighting is that when it was dark, they flashed like airplanes. the lights were very convincingly flashing as a normal small plane would...YET i saw them in the day, fairly closely. close enough to know they definitly were not airplanes.   i made sure i wasn't wrong about the location of the jail compared to the airport, the jail is directly north of the jail and my window was facing directly east.  i asked everyone that had a room facing east and no one was looking out of the window...i guess most people sleep or read. my celmate wouldn't look when i told him, he was scared i guess. anyway there were 2 or 3 more and then it stopped. i woke up right at sunrise the next morning and saw one more of them, fly the same pattern, in even more detail.

I was loading my work truck with tools with my dad.  I happened to look up at the sky and saw a commercial airliner.  I kept watching it because it was so clear I could make out the colors on the jet.   Then I noticed a small shiny orblike thing flying right under the tail of the jet.  The shiny orb was very small compared to the jet.  I called my dad over to show him and to make sure I was seeing it right.  He was amazed by this also.   About 5 seconds later it moved from under the tail of the jet to side of the jet; still beside the tail.  Then it moved back under the tail; and to the other side of the tail; out of sight for a couple seconds; and then back under the tail.   The craft moved unlike any type of jet I've ever seen.  It was very fast and precise.  I told some people about the sighting but most say it was probably a fighter jet refueling.  I really don't think this because of the size comparison to the airliner and the precision of the craft.   Then it dropped further under the tail than usual and sped off from under the jet at an incredible speed.  Me and my father agree what I saw was not a refueling jet.  I followed ufology pretty much all my life; and I take it quite serious; none of this is exagerated.  I'm thinking it could be linked to the ""foo-fighter"" sightings made by many pilots.  My dad has also has had many incredible sightings in the past.  I will have him report his soon. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The mountain was the same one that caught fire that  year, the second time I know of it caught fire.   I thought what could go that fast and fly like that?  Nothing but a ufo, then a minute later another one came from exactly the same way as the first one did and went the same place and the back of the mountain light up so I am sure they  landed there.  That iis all I have seen,  Utah state University emitts a strange very thin looking beam that bends, I wonder if that could attract them?  Latter that summer I saw some strange lights on the front side of that mountain  It was as though they were looking for something.  The lights, a blue, red and white, with a white beam beaming down looking for something. The lights and I can't remenber what their shape was but I do know that they were close together moving around the mountain.  Nothing I have ever seen could move around a mountain so fast and so slow as that.  It would go straight up and over, then down, I went and got my friend to witness what I saw and he just said whoa, I dont know what the is.  Neither do I but something they want is or was there in the North Logan Mountain.  If anyone is interested in the exact place I saw things I will be happy to point it out.  I wanted to go up there but never seemed to get the time, and still wondering what they wanted, as I am sure it was a ufo. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

There was a total fire ban at the time due to the high risk of wildfires, so it was absolutely dark.  Around 2:30 in the morning we were sitting around our picnic table in the dark, when suddenly we noticed a strange light in the southwestern sky that hadn't been there moments before. The light was white, and at first it was about as bright as the brightest stars in the sky.  However, as we watched the light grew brighter and brighter, although it appeared relatively stationary over one point of the valley, quite high in the sky. Eventually the light was brighter than any star or planet could be. I don't think it was a helicopter, because we would have heard a helicopter in the still night, but this light made no noise.  As we continued to watch the light, it would move up and down and side to side in the air, but not very much.  It also grew brighter and dimmer at intervals.  As we watched, the intense bright light faded again, and eventually vanished completely.  The sky in that area was dark again.  Moments later the light reappeared in the same spot, and soon it was shining brightly again. The way the light waxed and waned reminded me of watching a lighthouse from a distance, where the light gets brighter, then fades away, then reappears.  We continued watching the light for about 45 minutes. In this time the light gradually moved away from us in a southwesterly direction.  We noticed that in addition to moving up and down and side to side, the light would appear to change shape, sometimes seeming to be two connected points of light, sometimes one large round point of light, sometimes a square shaped light.  The light would also seem to change colour - it was dominantly white, but sometimes seemed orange or green in colour.  The object was still in the sky when we went to bed, but it did not return the next night.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,51.1834,-114.4687

It must have been about 100 ft away, and I noticed what I thought was the front. I saw no lights on it, the only reason I could see it at all was because of the glow of Phoenix in the background 40 miles away. after exactly 16 min and watching it pretty closely it made a sudden move farther from my course and a rappid increase in speed and a slight climb and it was gone.

The booster rockets are NOT what I seen, this thing was not any ways near the shuttle, where I seen this thing , was at 6 Gun Shopping Center . I was in my car , waiting on my wife to come out when i spotted this thing going over and it made absolutly no sound and there was nothing sticking out on it and no wings or rudder or stabalizer also it was staying at the same altitude in a level flight patern and it went right overhead . It looked like a big sewer pipe with rounded caps on each end  and it moved slowly from West to East and it was probaly in a line about 50 miles west of the shuttle. It looked like a Propane tank and it was painted a Barn red color and it was about 20 Ft. in diameter and about 40 or 50 Ft. long . Afterwards , just as the thing was going out of sight over the trees, my wife came out and i tryed to get her to see the thing but it was too far away , but then the shuttle was going up in an arc toward the east and I didn't see the boosters drop off because it was too far away from my location in the old six gun plaza in Ocala. I guess you didn't see what I did and ((name deleted)) didn,t see it either until it was way East of us but I seen it when it was almost overhead and watched it untill it was almost out of site going in a strait line and at the same altitude at about 40 or 50 miles an hour. SSSSooo , What was it ? ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH SOURCE OF REPORT)) Peter Davenport Sorry bout the delay , but being my age (70) , or near that when it happened , it just faded from my mind for some reson , i guess there just wasn't  anybody around that cared at that time so it just faded from my memory . The only reason i got re-interested and sent my sighting in to you was because i was looking thu some of the mail i had sent to my daughter, and it just poped up  , so there it is . It realy upset me about nobody being anywhere around because while this thing was going over , i looked all around and there wasn't a sole in that parking lot and any  other time there was people going back and forth to there cars . Then after the thing was out of sight then my wife came out and THEN i started to see other people but telling them about it would just turn them into 'doughters"" so i just drove on home and forgot it ! I was wondering if the people at the Cape would have seen that on there Radar or something , , , Oh , well , probaly not since the shuttle thing was gong up , all eyes were probaly on that . I know the Cape is a few miles down the road from route 40 that ends at I95 When I was at 6 Gun Plaza that thing was going over my head about a 1/2 mile away from straight up . And it was headed right towards the Cape.  I just can't fantom how that thing stayed up there with  no wings , notail , no engine that i could see . Do you know if there is anyone that has seen an object like that ?  Also , i would like to know if there is a UFO group in my area ? Maybe someone in that group would have seen that thing .

I could only watch it for around 10 seconds before it passed over.   The aircraft was black or gray, with no lights at all and only visible due to the slight reflection of city lights on the underside. I could just make out circular patterns on the underside of the craft, one large ring or circle in the middle and smaller circles at each corner.  I estimate each of the  three equal sides were around 100 feet in length. The black craft was very low, just over the trees, making no noise that I could hear. The first thing that occured to me when I saw the black triangle was that it was man made, some sort of top secret black stealth.  There are air bases, NASA, Lockheed Martin and government agencies dotted around the Northern Virginia and Washington DC area. I can understand why a black stealth would fly low, to evade radar, but why would a top secret aircraft fly or hover over a city so early in the evening while people are out and about?  This black triangle looks more advanced than any man made aircraft I've seen before, perhaps the fact that it looks alien provides a cover in itself.  How many witnesses of the black triangle would risk telling others about their sighting?  The risk of losing credibility from a black triangle sighting will keep many quiet, others may get labeled as UFO weirdos, perhaps the government is counting on this as part of the Black Stealth's cover.

Whilst ambling through the dimly lit backstreets of Chiang Mai i observed in the distant sky an orange glowing sphere moving towards our group. It was the most brightly lit object in the sky and despite trying to hold a conversation with my fellow travellers i was transfixed by this light. There was something distinctly odd about it that attracted my attention. It was travelling in a straight line and at a fixed speed. Could not ascertain any idea of its height, size or speed. There are a lack of reference points in a clear night sky. Within a 30 seconds all conversation stopped as one by one my fellow travellers noticed said orange sphere. It occured to me that it would overfly our position on the ground and so i attempted to take a photograph with my Canon Eos 300D camera. The camera failed to operete for unexplicable reason. (not done that before or since) As the light passed over us it changed vector by about 5 or six degrees with no discernable change in speed. Not a satellite then i thought. We discussed what it could be amongst ourselves but failed to come up with a rational explanation. Hot air ballon ? ..... that would account for the orange/red aura (flame) But the object was travelling too fast for a ballooon and then of course there was that noticable vector change. Not to mention it would be a very foolish balloonist to fly in total darkness. The orange glow it generated seemed to flicker and change to a slight reddish tinge from time to time. It varied a little in intensity of brightness. The object made no sound at all that we could discern. It kept its speed as it dissapeared into the distance, heading roughly North west.  On my return to the UK i researched said object on internet and discovered an article describing several similar sounding objects flying above Chiang Mai on Feb 7th.  I have always kept an open mind regarding UFO`s. My mind is that little bit more open following my experience in Thailand. To my mind this was literally a flying object that was unidentified. I would be interested in hearing from anyone else who witnessed this object or similar objects.  Sorry, no pictures. (i tried)",2005-04-16T00:00:00,,

All three did this. Around 7.10pm 6 miles from Swansea, I noticed some stars in the sky. As I focused on the highest star, I noticed it was flashing, but the two below it (diagonally) were also flashing simultaneously. I was convinced they must be planes, but continued to watch them. The lowest in the sky continued to move downwards, whereas the second one followed it relatively slowly, before suddenly moving quickly after it. The highest 'star' remained in the same place, and, as I watched it, I suddenly felt as though it was watching me. Once I thought this, it began to 'spin' and a pinkish light emanated from it. The other two objects lower in the sky became visible again (behind two houses opposite) and all three objects spun and emanated the same light simultaneously. There was no trail (as in a plane), and no noise. Then all three disappeared very quickly. I'm not a UFO enthusiast, and have never witnessed anything like this before. Around 30 mins later, I noticed a plane moving from the direction where the objects had disappeared, with a bright red flashing light, and a number of white lights all around it. This was a plane which went over my house, and left a trail in the sky. It wasn't a commercial plane. Planes never travel directly over my house either.  I'm pretty skeptical, although try to maintain a sense of critical open-mindedness. I have never seen anything like this before, and felt compelled to share it with others. It really does make you wonder. My profession is psychology - I have a PhD in psychology (one of the most skeptical professions ever), and I'm just finishing a doctorate in clinical psychology. I find it amazing that after feeling that the object was 'watching' me, that it began spinning immediately afterwards.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,,

I noticed an orangish light moving in the direction of east relative to the moon. Thinking it was a plane but watching anyway I noticed it seemed to change direction and move back west. Still thinking it may be a plane I wondered why it would circle at that altitude and in that location, as the nearest airport is in Portland and the light appeared to be quite some distance away from Portland. I continued to observe and the object began to move in highly erratic ways, not typical of aircraft and at too high an altitude for a chopper. It would move in one direction then abruptly the opposite direction. It made short ""arching"" motions, ""swung"" back and forth, and sometimes made very short zigzagging motions. I was sitting on my porch which lies on the left side of my driveway if you're facing away from my house. The driveway is flanked on either side by trees. The starting point of my orginal sighting was behind the trees on the left side. At times the bare branches partially obscured my vision of it. It continued to ""swing"" back and forth in a slow, almost drunken-looking manner and at times appeared to travel in half circles (although because of my perspective they could have been full  circles). At times it would appear to move toward me, appearing to rise in altitude, then it would reverse direction with no apparent turning radius and move away from me. About ten minutes into the sighting I called to ((name deleted)), a housemate and the only other occupant at home at the time, to come take a look, asking him if he saw what I saw or if I was imagining things. After observing for a couple minutes he confirmed the object did appear to be moving. I was able to call out the directions I thought it was moving in (right, now left, right again, up, left now) and he confirmed that he was seeing the same movements. The object continued to move in a general direction of east in relation to the moon until it was fully clear of the trees and instead of being on the far left of the driveway it was on the right. Most notable about the movements were that although it was hardly ever still, they seemed to have a ""directionless"" quality to them. At times it would zigzag in quick motions, sometimes appear to ""swing"" or ""sway"", and it reversed directions seemingly at random.  I stayed outside as long as I could. My housemate and I had moved from the porch to the driveway to get a better look, and stayed in the driveway for what might have been 15 minutes. Then we returned to the porch and David went back inside. I was absolutely frozen at this point, the temperature was about 20 degrees. I wanted to go back inside but was afraid to miss something. Back at my original position, the position I was in when the sighting began, it was notable that not only was the object not obscured by trees anymore, it had crossed the imaginary median of the driveway and was at a higher point than when it started.  Finally I absolutely could not stay outside any longer. I rushed inside and turned off the lights, hoping it would be visible from the two large windows at the front of the house. I felt pretty stupid for having sat outside for so long when I discovered it was indeed clearly visible from inside the windows. I made ((name deleted)) turn off the TV so there was no reflection on the glass to obscure vision and we watched it continue to behave in much the same erratic and meandering manner. About five minutes into observing it from inside I noticed another light, this one brighter and whitish, in relatively the same spot the first had started in. It was acting much the same way, possessing the same ""zigzagging"", ""swinging"", half circle-making traits. The first orangish light sort of seemed to calm down with the appearance of the second light, still moving but not as obviously. It seemed to settle in a basic area, northeast of the moon. At this point my mother came home and we all observed the movement. About 4 minutes after that a very bright whitish-blue ""star"" that had been there the whole time began to show signs of movement. We all watched as the lights eventually settled into basic areas, still moving but not meandering around anymore. They held their basic postions (the first, orangish light appearing not to move at all anymore, the second only making occasional tiny movements and the third primarily seeming to ""ascend"" and ""descend"", but also making the characteristic half-circles and zigzags) and their positions formed an isoceles triangle tipped on its side with the ""point"", the brightest and most recent light, pointing southeast. The first, orangish light was holding position on the northernmost tip and the second whitish one was southwest of the orange one. At one time a plane bisected the triangle horizontally and the objects did not appear to respond.  A while later I stopped observing them. I was tired and my neck hurt from looking up. I know they were present at a little past ten still. I don't know when they disappeared but by 10:30 they were gone.  Another thing to note...it was dark and cloudless but when the objects moved, especially when they moved dramtically, a cloudy or smoky haze could be seen in front of them and the light would be a little obscured. It seemed like the smoke mimicked the movements made by the light, i.e. if they moved in an upwards backward-facing ""C"" motion, the ""smoke"" would also form a backward-facing ""C"".",2006-02-14T00:00:00,43.8635,-70.0976

I could'nt believe my eyes as we drove by it and noticed no blinking lights that would portray a personal/commercial aircraft.  If I were to guess, it looked to be a one of ours due to the engineering aspest of the craft.  I've spotted E.T UFO's in the past but, this one was somewhat rustic in nature. I say this because there was no discoloration from the lights at the bottom of the triangle it just shined a yellowish/white light.  I should of pulled over to get a closer look however, circumstances and traffic didn't allow it.  I also forgot to mention that after sighting the object some of the street lights blacked out as it appeared there was a energy force within the area.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,38.67384449152542,-121.14875677966101

I consider my powers of observation very sound. As an interesting side note another person from the Kingston Ontario area also saw a noteworthy sighting around the same time, place, and date as reported on HBCCUFO.org website. My sighting was a rather complicated event but basically  my attention was drawn to the night  sky initially due to display of Northern lights. This was around 7 pm. Some minutes later I saw a very bright moving light approaching fairly quickly from the North/East which could easily be misperceived as a UFO. However this light eventually turned out to be what I believe was a conventional prop  aircraft---although one which I have never seen presenting such an intensely bright light nor such a large craft at such a low altitude. I believe it was a conventional craft as it appeared to have small blinking  red lights on the ends of both wings. Strangely it was silent until it began a banking turn and then I could hear the drone of the engines. But most noteworthy was the intense white light that must have been affixed somewhere up front. I say up front because after it banked and turned it was no longer visible but the smaller outside marker lights, as well as a couple more, were weakly seen. This intense illumination is the brightest  light I have seen in the sky besides several reentering meteors seen during meteor showers. But the quality of the light was quite different. Returned inside my house. Went back out with  video camera and observed a  patch of evenly illuminated light to the North which I took to be this prop plane which must have turned back again and then flew farther North of my position and then West while I was inside ( I surmise that but am not sure if it was the same craft). Diverted my attention and now this patch of light was due West and then much more South in what in retrospect must have been a very quick progression.  Not sure how it moved from North to South so quickly.  But I don't believe this was a UFO.  However what I caught on video next surely was. To make the story short.... After returning inside and back out again  I saw 2 light balls or orbs at about 1 km/half mile distance due North of me. They were in a line and  separated by about 30 feet and looked to be a few feet above the ground. First I took them to be lights from 2 cars--although brighter.  One had a reddish hue while the other was more white. But they started to act ""strangely""---appearing to move slightly up or down or forwards or backwards. Then one winked out and to cut to the chase the solitary remaining orb approached to about 300 feet away and appeared to be about tree top height.  It was quite bright and was a soft yellowish white in color.  The time it took to approach and then leave was less than a minute. It is clearly discernible on tape. I never zoom the camera so its change in apparent size and luminosity shows it moved forward and then departed after some moments. I took some video a few days later of the  same daytime setting and it helps to illustrate how this light had to be floating over a farm field.  As a final note I should add that this is not the first time I have witnessed strange aerial activity.  But this is the first time I have captured it on tape. What I have observed is clear, what it is, is not. If you require more info or want video please contact me via email.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,44.2619035460993,-76.5252768321513

Four of us ran out to the front porch to see bright neon blue smoke in the sky with electricity arcing over the blue hue about 1 1/2 blocks away.  My mom who was standing next to me said, ""Is that an ash floating over the smoke?"" as she pointed to it.  We all saw it at the same time - 4 bright white lights come through the smoke - it was off in the distance, behind the trees but above the roof line of the houses directly across the street from us.  We could see 4 bright white round lights - not blinking, bright as car headlights. They were a diamond shape. It was narrow in the middle, long on the ends - basically an elongated diamond, maybe somewhat of the chevron shape.  The lights headed in a southern direction.  We live less than 1 mile from the beach and these lights were over the ocean.  The explosion had knocked all the power out in a 4-6 block radius.  It was eerily silent - the lights made no sound what so ever.  Standing on the porch observing all this was me, my mom and dad, and a good friend/son-in-law of the family who is a NJ State Trooper.  As we watched the lights, in pretty much a stunned silence, we saw them start to shift shape - the rear light moved forward and the diamond narrowed.  It started to slow, passed behind a light cloud, dimmed, then slightly dipped as it sped off in an east-south-east direction.  The entire siting lasted about a minute and a 1/2.  This was not a plane, there were no blinking red, green or white lights. There was no sound of an engine - it was silent.

I moved around in my van and it moved so I knew it was further away. What was wierd is it was hard to focus on. i couldn't tell it's distance away from me. I kept blinking trying to focus. Then some clouds partially obscured it and I knew it was way up in the sky.

The sky was overcast since it had been raining all afternoon. I saw what appeared to be an object hovering several hundred feet up in the air in a northwesterly direction, it had what appeared to be flashing red and green lights all around it.  They were flashing in a running motion sort of like neon lights do or like a series of bulbs going on and off in a very quick pattern.  It was equipped with a powerful floodlight that is turned on occasionally when hovering and pointed the light up into the clouds.  When I first sighted it it was motionless in the sky with just the lights flashing, I ran to grab my binoculars to get a better view and when I got back it had turned on the floodlight on by the time I got the binoculars focused the light had switched off and the craft was moving at a rather fast rate going over my house.  When hovering there was no noise but as soon as it started moving I heard a noise rather like a lowflying airplane.  I ran to the window on the other side of the house and watched it's flight it paused again just before the treetops would have hidden it from my view and once again turned on the floodlight. I watched it for several minutes more until it just winked out of my sight. There were low hanging clouds in the sky so it may have just risen above them but from my perspective it just seemed to vanish into thin air.  I don't know if what I saw was a UFO or just a survey helicopter, since I have never seen a helicopter at night I can't say for sure but what caught my attention were the lights flashing in a pattern in what appeared to be a circle around it, I have seen airplanes at night and to my knowledge they carry signal lights that just blink.  The other thing was the complete absence of noise until it started moving, won't a helicopter make a noise even when hovering and lastly the powerful floodlight that it only turned on when it had stopped in the air and pointed up into the clouds.  What I would like to know is could it have been a UFO or just a helicoptor with its nightlights on.  I would appreciate a response from someone on this.",2006-03-11T00:00:00,,

The observations I made that struck me as being odd (in no particular order) were;  the circular shape of the object the ""reddish"" colour and glow associated with the object the lack of vapour trails no flashing lights no sound whatsoever the speed at which the object was traveling (it was immense even by a modern jet fighters standards!)  Being an aviation enthusiast, I know an aircraft when I see one. However, bearing in mind the aforementioned characteristics, I am somewhat miffed by what I saw.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,,

I was arriving at work, prior to my 8PM shift. As I approached the building where I work, I noticed an object that looked as though it were hovering in the sky. At first it looked like how a planet might look if it were too close to the earth. Then I noticed it was kind of trianglular in shape with the edges rounded off. Also, it had a greenish-white glow to it. It seemed to get bigger and that made it look like it was getting closer. I thought to myself, ""Oh it must be a jet airplane approaching. In a minute I'll see taxi lights as it gets closer"". My interest was lost right then. I turned my attention to a coworker who was walking accross the parking lot to enter the building through the front doors. Watching her, it was impossible for me not to see what the object was doing, because she was in between the object and me. Just before she reached the front door to go in. The object shot down from the sky at an incredible speed. I thought it was going to crash right into the ground, but right before it got to the treeline, it shot forth at 45 degree angle in the opposite direction and disapeared in the distance in the blink of an eye. The whole think happened so fast that I was completely taken by surprise. I remember that it was moving faster that any aircraft that I have ever seen in my life. It left green streaks accross the air as it fell then shot off. My coworker didn't even see it, because it wasn't directly above us. It was at a distance that would have put it over the freeway of where route 2 and route 140 meet (1/4 mile away) in Gardner. It was also a few hundred feet in the air. Another thing I noticed was that, during the whole incident, the object made absolutely no sound. This morning, I called the Gardner police and they said that no one had reported anything. I once was a flightline mechanic in the US Marine Corps. I've been around every type of aircraft that you could imagine. In the past I've taxied aircraft for many years, at night, but I've never seen anything like this.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,42.5899,-71.9887

I had just finished reading in my bed when I turned out the light and lay down.  A few minutes later the room started vibrating slightly, and I assumed my mom was doing the laundry.  It was late at night, so I discounted that, and became curious as to what it was (and somewhat anxious).   A few seconds later the room illuminated bright turquoise blue.  My area has many upgraded cars/luxury cars with Xenon lights, so I assumed someone was in the driveway with lights pointed towards my room.   I opened up my shade to invesitage, and I saw nothing.  I was very confused, but still curious.   I saw a cigar shaped object (I just got the chills while writing this) that looked like it had windows on it, maybe 6 to 10, and had red lights on the bottom and top.  It was about fifteen feet away from my window, and was going by very slowly (I am getting the chills again?).   Immediately I got an extreme relaxation, best described as euphoria.  It felt fine, but weird.  I didn't believe my eyes, but knew I saw it- it was literally out of this world.   I got up and told my parents and they said I must have been dreaming, but this was not the case.

We were just about to get on Vietnam Vets Parkway.  I had noticed a couple of aircraft in the sky.  Both of them were leaving a contrail as they went through the sky that very quickly disappeared behind them.  It was generally clear; the only clouds I noticed were at the horizon where the sun was setting.  Just as I was about to approach Vietnam Vet's, I slowed down for a traffic light.  I happened to glance up, and noticed a metallic object quickly going by.  It was at my 11 o'clock position, traveling from NE to SW.  Just as I saw it, the sun glinted off of it, and then it simply vanished.  Since I was at a stop at the light, I had time to really look for it, but it was nowhere to be seen.  There were absolutely no clouds up there that it could have gone behind.  I remember thinking as I first saw it that it was strange that it was not leaving a contrail, as the other planes were. I could not judge the altitude, but it looked like it was considerably lower than the planes were.  It looked bigger than the planes I had seen, so I'm assuming it was lower.  It did look spherical, but of course, right as I noticed it the light reflected off of it, so I could not say for sure that it was.  I know I didn't notice any wings.  After it disappeared, I tried to make sense of what I saw, and thought that just maybe I had seen a plane.  Then I happened to see a real plane as it was making approach to the Nashville airport.  I could see the wings and everything, even though it was many miles away, and the object I had seen was almost directly overhead.  I realized that 1) if that had been a plane that I had seen that was just too low to leave a contrail, I would have seen the wings, and 2) the reflection flash happened on the opposite side of the craft from the setting sun.

((NUFORC Note:  We include here the SFO Chronicle, written by Sabin Russell, because of its importance to the investigation surrounding the crash of ""Columbia,"" and because of the two reports NUFORC received from independent witnesses in the vicinity of Dallas, TX.  We express our gratitude to the San Francisco Chronicle for allowing use of the article here.  PD))  Cosmic bolt probed in shuttle disaster  Scientists poring over 'infrasonic' sound waves  Sabin Russell, Chronicle Staff Writer  Friday, February 7, 2003Federal scientists are looking for evidence that a bolt of electricity in the upper atmosphere might have doomed the space shuttle Columbia as it streaked over California, The Chronicle has learned. Investigators are combing records from a network of ultra-sensitive instruments that might have detected a faint thunderclap in the upper atmosphere at the same time a photograph taken by a San Francisco astronomer appears to show a purplish bolt of lightning striking the shuttle. Should the photo turn out to be an authentic image of an electrical event on Columbia, it would not only change the focus of the crash investigation, but it could open a door on a new realm of science. ""We're working hard on the data set. We have an obligation,"" said Alfred Bedard, a scientist at the federal Environmental Technology Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. He said the lab was providing the data to NASA but that it was too early to draw any conclusions from the sounds of the shuttle re-entry. The lab has been listening to the sounds of ghostly electromagnetic phenomena in the upper atmosphere, dubbed sprites, blue jets and elves. For some time, scientists have speculated on whether these events could endanger airliners or returning spacecraft. A study conducted 10 years ago for NASA found that there is a 1-in-100 chance that a space shuttle could fly through a sprite, although it concluded that the consequences of such an event were unclear. And in 1989, an upper- atmospheric electrical strike ""shot down"" a high-altitude NASA balloon 129,000 feet over Dallas. NASA officials have said they are looking for a ""missing link"" to explain the shuttle's breakup that killed seven astronauts Saturday, and they are downplaying the theory that foam insulation falling from the shuttle's extra tank may have contributed to the shuttle's demise.  The little-known infrasound project at the Environmental Technology Laboratory operates a network of sophisticated electronic ears that can pick up subaudible thuds of waves crashing on either coast of the United States and the hiss of meteors and spacecraft re-entering the atmosphere thousands of miles away. Sound waves of this nature are called ""infrasonic"" and are below the range of human hearing but travel unimpeded for extraordinary distances. Arrays of infrasonic sensors in the high Colorado plains east of Boulder recently have been looking for the crackle of the ghostly electromagnetic events in the Earth's upper atmosphere. ""We basically detect events at very long ranges,"" Bedard said. But he stressed that it was too early to draw any conclusions from sounds of the shuttle re-entry. Bedard said the acoustic sensors had previously detected the re-entry of a space shuttle from Northwest Canada to the Kennedy Space Center. CELESTIAL THUNDERCLAP Originally, it was thought that the electrical charges in the thin atmosphere 50 miles above Earth were too dispersed to create infrasound. But Los Alamos National Laboratories physicist Mark Stanley said that, on closer inspection, ""we've seen very strong ionization in sprites"" indicating that there were enough air molecules ionized to cause heating and an accompanying pulse -- a celestial thunderclap, as it were. NASA administrators confirmed Thursday that the photograph, taken from Bernal Heights in San Francisco by an amateur astronomer, is being evaluated by Columbia crash investigators. However, Shuttle Program Manager Ron Dittemore told reporters at a Houston news briefing that right now NASA is trying only to verify ""the validity"" of the image. The astronomer, who has asked that his name not be used, has declined to release the digital image to the media. But earlier in the week, he permitted Chronicle reporters to view the image and invited one to his home Tuesday evening, when the camera, and a disk of the image, were turned over to former shuttle astronaut Tammy Jernigan for transit to Houston. The image was also e-mailed Tuesday evening to Ralph Roe Jr., chief engineer for the shuttle program at Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston. Dittemore would not say during the news conference whether NASA has ruled in or ruled out one possible explanation for the photo: that the image could have been caused by jiggling of the camera. It was a Nikon M-880 mounted on a tripod. The automatically timed exposure of four to six seconds was triggered by finger. ""We have to validate whether it is real,"" Dittemore said. ""This particular one is no different from the others. . . . It has yet to be determined whether this is important to us or not."" SEEKING EVIDENCE NASA officials have stressed the importance of photographic, video or debris evidence from the earliest moments of the shuttle's distress, which sensors indicate began at about 5:53 a.m. above California. That's when sensors in a wheel well blinked out, in the words of NASA investigators, ""as if someone cut a wire."" That is also roughly the time during which the amateur photographer snapped his image of Columbia as it streaked across the sky north of San Francisco. A precise time may be mapped by matching the photo and the strange electrical signature to the crisp background field of stars. Physicists have long jokingly referred to the lower reaches of the ionosphere -- which fluctuates in height around 40 miles -- as the ""ignorosphere,"" due to the lack of understanding of this mysterious realm of rarefied air and charged electric particles. The family of ""transient"" electrical effects occupy this part of the sky, including sprites, which leap from the ionosphere to the tops of thunderheads, and blue jets, which leap from thunderhead anvils to the ionosphere. Streamers of static electricity can travel these realms at speeds 100 times that of ground lightning, or 20 million miles an hour. Ten years ago, Walter Lyons, a consultant with FMA Research Inc. in Fort Collins, Colo., conducted a study of sprite danger for NASA. ""We concluded that there is about 1 chance in 100 that a shuttle could fly through a sprite. What impact, we didn't know for certain. It didn't appear at this time that the energy would be enough to cause problems."" But Lyons conceded that the ""ignorosphere"" is a mysterious place that has yielded startling surprises. ""Since then, with research on electrical streamers, the discovery of blue jets, the doubt has gone up,"" he said. ""There are other things up there that we probably don't know about,"" Lyons said. ""Every time we look in that part of the atmosphere, we find something totally new."" LACK OF RESEARCH FUNDING But the field is dominated by a small club of electrophysicists who have seen their money for research dry up. Ironically, an experiment of Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, aboard the doomed Columbia, was among the last fully funded work conducted on sprites. Lyons, considered to be one of the leading authorities, said he played a role in the design of the experiment. To date, sprites have required the presence of a significant electrical storm on the ground. As the shuttle passed over Northern California, there were some heavy rain showers in the far north of the state, but none of the wild weather normally associated with sprites. Hearing a description of the purplish, luminous corkscrew in the San Francisco photograph, Lyons said, ""This was not a sprite event . . . but maybe it is another electrical phenomenon we don't know about."" Whether or not an electrical discharge might be involved in the demise of Columbia, there is precedent for an event like this. Scientists have observed interaction between a blue jet and a meteor. And in December 1999, Los Alamos National Laboratories researcher David Suszcynsky and colleagues, including Lyons, published an account of a meteor that apparently triggered a sprite. Their account is published in the Journal of Geophysical Research. ""It was a singular observation that had us all scratching our heads,"" said Lyons. In the strange world of sprite and elf research, scientists have documented one event in which some sort of high atmospheric event ""shot down"" a high-altitude balloon over Dallas. On June 5, 1989, before the first sprite was ever photographed, a NASA balloon carrying a heavy pack of instruments suffered ""an uncommanded payload release"" at 129,000 feet, according to Lyons. It landed in an angry Dallas resident's front yard. Investigators found scorch marks on the debris and considered it one of the first bits of solid evidence that sprites exist. As a result of the accident, NASA no longer flies balloons over thunderstorms. Ironically, the balloon was launched from a NASA facility in Palestine, Texas, one of the towns where debris from the space shuttle Columbia fell Saturday.

They rose from behind a hill across the lake on which I live, along a set of power company transmission lines and stopped just above a set of power lines.  Using 10x50 binoculars, we could clearly see two bright, distinct lights, at least as bright as what might be found at outdoor stadiums.  The lights lit my home and trees brighter than any moon ever has.  I am a consultant to the Department of Defense, an aviation buff and the son of an airline pilot; this was no standard aircraft.  Using the notch cut into the hill for the power lines as reference, I would estimate the distance between the two lights at anywhere from 100 to 125 feet.  The lights hovered over the power lines and remained silent and motionless for nearly 23 minutes.  I contacted the local police, but they were unaware of any activity in the area.  I contacted the local power company, but they relayed that they had no service or repair crews in the area.  At approximately 20:58, while observing through the binoculars, the lights began to move slightly towards the left (my left) and then appeard to turn slightly on their own axis to their own right, as the distance between the lights began to close and the light on my left dimmed a little.  After 30 seconds or so, the lights appeared again to turn on their own axis, this time back to their left, re-establishing the original distance between them.  Then both lights slowly (5 seconds) dimmed until they went out. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and we deem him to be an exceptionally qualified observer.

It was a halogen-white object that seemed to be wobbling and moving around in a circle.  At first I thought it was odd but knew that I easily could be looking at a planet, satellite, or star, but after I got my binoculars to observe the object, I realized it absolutely could not be any of those things.  There was a chevron-shaped metallic object surrounded by a glow, and I witnessed it dart across the sky at ridiculous speeds several times, always returning to it's port of origin.  As I further observed the event, I saw what I can only describe as disk-shaped crafts which were considerably smaller entering the chevron-shaped object.  It was then when I really knew something strange was going on, so I woke up my friend to have him as another witness and to get his opinion on what was going on.  At first glance, he told me he thought it was a helicopter, but it emitted absolutely no sound.   Almost instantly after he came to look, we both witnessed an orange orb ""floating"" from the ground north to the object, slowly at first, but then speeding up until it entered the craft.  At that point, my friend decided that it was definitely something that he could not explain.  We continued to observe the activity for a total of at least 45 minutes, as it hovered and several other crafts darted and manuevered across the sky.  I also observed a purple colored beam emitting from the craft at random intervals, though it didn't project far.  It was like a short purple strobe.  I wanted to wait to see if the thing would shoot into space, but my friend and I got so tired we just went to bed.   I reported my sighting via telephone but forgot to include the fact that as we were in bed about to fall asleep, we heard several very loud helicopters fly over or at least near the house.   I regret that I am not more knowledgable about the technicalities of the night sky, though I observe it almost nightly and have NEVER seen anything remotely close to that.  The only other incident I ever have had regarding UFOs was that a beam once entered my room, but I did NOT witness a craft at that time and have no evidence that it was from any otherworldly craft, although it was a frightening event at the time.  This incident however, with the orange orb rising into a ""ship"",  I KNOW was something strange, be it government or something else that I can't explain.  After submitting my phone report I took the advice of Mr Davenport and called the amateur astronomy club at my WVU, the university in my town.  The administrator listened to my account and said that he had not heard anything, but would contact me if he did.  I will be watching for further events like that, this time I will have a camcorder and compass handy. I would be extremely interested to hear if anyone else saw a similar event occur. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed to us to be quite rational and eloquent about her sighting.  When we explored the possibility that the two witnesses might have been observing a celestial body, she pointed out that the object of interest, at one point during their sighting, suddenly moved a large (angular) distance across the sky.  We suspect, therefore, that they were not observing a prominent star, since celestial bodies are not seen to move across the sky rapidly.

The top light of the diamond shot straight out while the 2 outter lights expanded outward and forward until they were in line with the 1st.  Now, the 1st light and outter 2 are in a perfect row across the sky with the 4th tailing right behind the 1st.  The distance between the 3 lights in front was enormous.  They traveled at ungodly speed in this manner for about 5 seconds.   After about 5 seconds they shot back together again into the same tight diamond formation.  This also happened in a matter of seconds.  Then, out of no where, it vanished!  It vanished like someone unplugged the lights.  We were stunned.  We lived within 8 miles of Lambert Airport for 9 yrs, including through 9/11, and have, many times, seen aircrafts that we hadn't seen anything like before.  However, we have never seen anything even remotely close to this.   My husband said that when he 1st looked up, it looked like a misty cloud.  He said there was something very strange about it.  The sky was very clear and there wasn't another cloud in the sky.  No sooner than he had drawn my attention to the thing it had changed and appeared to be a plane.  He assumed the plane was momentarily hidden behind the ""cloud"" although the cloud was not there at all once the lights became visible.   We observed that the lights seemed to expand and contract.  When they were together they didn't seem odd.  When expanding the speed was astounding and they must have separated at least a mile apart in a matter of seconds.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,38.772866865671645,-90.55506208955224

It flew as if it was tumbling across the sky, but in a regular fassion, meaning that you could set your watch by its flip. It would flip, a second or two would go by and then it would flip again.

This craft was hovering over a mountain range,in line-site of my position.I used the interstate to gauge it's size,and estimated it at over a mile and a half in lenght.It had sequential running lights that illuminated the clouds that were just above the immense craft.I have seen every known military plane,blimp,tanker,helicopter and stealth included.My esteemed colligue got a deathly white sheen to his face and would not come out of his personal jeep and quit 2 weeks later,no explanation.It re-appeared 2 more times in different location's but never too far from this gold mine it was hovering over.I,myself have seen more than i am writing about today,i just find it hard to belive that no one saw this gigantic craft making no bones about hiding,or playing hide and seek.Incidently,the next night,we were visited by 2 attack cobras who sat and watched us for god knows how long,until i cranked up the track hoe to feed the incinerator,and had to flick on the floods.As soon as i was aware of their presence,they circled our site several times,scanning us with a green laser light and i flicked my day-lighters in approval and the left at a high rate of speed going directly towards that gold mine.I have never seen attack helicopters fly in such miserable weather.My co-partner didn't want any mention of this to anyone,like it shook his very religious foundation,he was scared,i know scared and he was babbling like a child.ME,i turned the track hoe to face it and kept flicking my day-lighters in the hope they would come and see who was behind those lights.The back ground was a unique canvas,snow cloud white and a deck down to 9500 fett and the immense reflection from the circulating lights gave a crystal clear image of size,color and pure mavolence.I felt at ease,no panic.you see,i felt as these were friends,like we had met before.As i said earlier,i have many a tale to tell,maybe we can converse on another time,another report,maybe even meet some day.I am a regular guy,i have an associates degree in structural engineering and an advanced degree in heavy equipment operation.My name is barry,and you should be able to gleen my e-mail from this.Thank you sooooooooo much for reading my story.",2005-06-20T00:00:00,32.259940756602425,-110.92754232690936

It was dark out already, and I can't quite recall the time of the incident as it was about 3 years ago. I was at my then girlfriends house, sitting on some steps in her backyard. She has a very large back yard which pretty much surrounds the entire house from all sides. We were sitting in the area to the left of the house, so the house was to our right. Directly in front of us was her drive way which curved from the street towards her house. I was looking up at the sky, as I like to do so many nights, to admire the stars, and as I looked to my right towards the house, I saw a red ball of fire which looked to be steady over the house. It was not a huge ball, but much larger than what stars look like, and much closer. At first glance I took it to be a flare as it had the resemblence of one. Its no movement also made me think of it as a flare as I know flares are known to stay in place in the air for a brief moment. So all this was not strange to me yet. Here is where the story gets a little weird, upon seeing it, I focused my attention on it. My girlfriend was sitting to my right, but had not seen the object yet. I called her attention to the object, and as she focused on it, at that exact moment, it seemed like the object became aware of me pointing it out to her. She saw it, but for a brief moment, because at that point the object streaked upwards towards the right and then dove down behind the house. Not saying it landed behind the house, but is shot downward behind the houses path of view making it no longer visible. I immediately realized that it was not a flare, because a flare would not have that sort of movement and speed after being in the air. It moved so fast that it literally left a streak of red behind it for a few brief seconds. This object seemed to have full control of its movements, and furthermore, seemed to be conscious of our presence, as if it were watching us. That incident freaked me out but also intrigued me as I have been interested in UFO's since a very early age. I definitely think what I saw was a UFO or some sort of surveillance device, used by who, I don't know. I have had other sightings, but less conclusive than this one. My uncle is also a big UFO buff and has experienced sightings. A flare, it definitely was not, something else, in my opinion it was.

Said Canyon has an elevation differential of about 5500 feet with steep grades and sheer vertical cliffs.  Thru Fossil Creek Canyon exists the Child Electrical Power generating camp consisting of maybe 10 structures.  On the return trip to Strawberry, we passed said power station and ascended upon dirt roads that winded on the southerly edge of the Canyon. I would estimate that about half way up this Canyon we noticed that on the northerly edge of the Canyon that an oscillating light that changed colors emanated from a portion of the Canyon that is unaccessible to vehicles. The light was visible to the naked eye, but nothing more.  We stopped the vehicle and I would estimate that at a 1-2 mile range I scoped the light with high power scope on my rifle and was able to see much more detail.  When viewing this light with my scope I was able to make out a disk shaped saucer with ""windows"" and a ""door"" with ""steps"".  Said object had two ""legs"" that emanated from either side of the object.  A portion of the object was obstructed by shrubs. These shrubs moved, although there was no wind from the position in which I observer said object. From our position and vantage point we were able to at lenghty time and measure observe the object.  Strawberry, Arizona is located about 19 miles north of Payson and about 60 miles west of Heber, Overgaard. The commonality between these three location is the Mogollon Rim, Fossil Creek Canyon is at the root of the rim that has elevation of about 9000 feet in places. The other interesting items that surround this area is the fact that the famous movie ""Fire in the Sky"" was based upon an incident about 45 miles West of this sighting.  I had at the time told some people in the Town of Payson about this occurence and was surprised by some of the responses I received.  Once response was that of one of the Electrical workers at the Child Plant that confided in my Father in law that this was a regular occurence and that has had his vehicle and watch stop due to ""craft"" flying overhead in this same Canyon.  Another response that surprised me was that of a Town of Payson employee that also confided in me that in his youth he worked on a Logging crew and coincidently happened to work that night of the dissapearence of person in the ""Fire in the Sky"" movie.  He told me that that night the Forest had a green aura and a hum that filled the air.  He also stated that he had heard other stories similar to mine from that area where I had seen this object. My backround is that of a Civil Engineer and Surveyor with approximately 14 years of experience. I served 6 years with the United States Air Force as a Civil Engineering Specialist and have been deyployed worldwide in said capacity.  I currently work as a Survey analyst and Geomatician at a private Civil Engineering Company.  My Father in Law has been a successful Construction Contractor for at least the last 30 years and is still building. I have no clue to the whereabouts of my then brother in law and his backround was in maintenance. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My wife and I were sitting on our screened-in porch at our home in Westerville, Ohio, which faces east.   At around 6:00 pm on an October evening, we saw a large bright stationary object in the southeast sky.  I tended to ignore it for awhile.  I thought that perhaps it was a communications satellite.   I went into the house and got by 7 x 50 field glasses to help identify the object.  It was no helicopter, commerical or military aircraft, and certainly not one of those blimps that occasionally make its way down to the Ohio State University to cover a football game.  As far as I could tell, it didn't move.  There was no noise coming from it.  The object was perhaps 50 to 60 feet in diameter.   The setting sun was reflecting off the object and made it somewhat difficult to see.  As far as I could tell, there were no external lights.  There were 5 large rectangular windows that took up much of the space of this object.  There was a yellow glow in the interior.   I saw a person dressed in a light-colored single piece suit from the neck down.  The person had a head, 2 arms, and a body.  He appeared to move only once and only slightly.  It stood next to what appeared to be a ""file cabinet"", which stood as tall as his shoulder.  There was some mass around these windows but nothing that would constitute the body of some aircraft. The next evening, my wife and I saw the same object.  I called a local television station to report what I had seen and if anybody had any idea what it was.  The lady gave me some answer and that was the last that I heard of this object.   As far as I know, nothing was reported on any television news broadcast or, printed in the Columbus Dispatch.   Surely, others in the area must have seen this object.  I know what I saw, but I have no idea what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Since then i have figured out that it was 9:15 because i dialed 411 at 9:21 to get a friends phone # to tel them to look up at the these lights  Also since then we have figured out that the lights wer emaybe the size of 1 or 2 737's as the other night we saw a plane fly over our house and the size of the plane allowed us to roughly determine the size of what we saw..as what we saw was maybe 300-500 feet away from our house (we live in the country in total darkness with no city lights or anything) and the tops of the trees and part of the gorund covered in snow was lit up orange... On the tuesday after our house (wife, fatherinlaw, motherinlaw and I) saw this a friend phoned me and mentioned her husbands two contractor buddies and a couple children at a group home about two streets over or maybe 8 acres away saw the exact same thing.  I was told by my friend that they were so scared they hid under their house until it moved away as they thought it was going to crash into thier house (that is how close it was) ..when it slowly moved away (which was towards my house ) they came back out and watched it slowly move away and stop and then shoot straight to space.   i have phoned them a couple times but i am afraid they are still to scared to talk about what happened...these two objects were so close to our house and i guess their it was unbelievable...it was truly unbelievable and has changed my life forever... on the wednesday after our sighting...in iqaluit (nunavut) CBC reported a story of two bright orange lights over that city following each other and sounded like a mirror image of what we saw that night.... Also since talking to the UFO BC web site people...i have read recently that there was 2 other sightsing out here in teh past 7 years....similar story... All i can say is i wish i could talk to somebody to understand what we saw... Again there was no sound...and also since talking it over many times we both agreed we saw a red lights in the middle as it got closer and top and bottom was the orange... the strangest part i will never forget was wathcing it go away...it didnt go north, south east or west...it went UP...i had goosebumps the size of elephants on every inch of my skin...

Came back into living room where I told him that tonight would be a good night to see the green northern lights.  Took a peek outside to see if it was actually clear and two quite large VERY ORANGE lights were slowing coming towards the house very slowly.  They seemed side by side and we noticed no other flashing lights or anything.  We heard absolutely no sound from the outside as we looked towards the weird lights.   They continued to approach the house ( we live in Mary Lake Country Residential Subdivision, 15 minutes outside of Whitehorse Yukon).  They went ot he side of our house and we watched them for maybe 5 minutes as they just seem to hang around outside slowly moving away.  The lights then came really close to each other, then one went up , the other went down, and vice versa.  Then the right light slowly appeared to move farther away with the other light following the first light.  The lights didn’t go further away but rather straight up.  Then one just disappeared completely.  Then the last one just sat there way up in the sky and appeared to have some additional colors flashing    I ran back downstairs as I went upstairs to watch them move away.   I got back, the other one had disappeared.    My heart is still beating fast.  I have never seen something so silent, so bright, so close just float by my house.    Weather :-30  Wind, nil; clouds, none    Never had such a weird feeling, and as I write this I remember the TV flickered a bit just before I saw these northern lights, but they were not the lights I originally looked outside to see?    If you hear of others this night please email.    A couple years ago I thought I saw a disc shaped object by a fox lake we have up here but thought nothing of it..till now.  That one also disappeared.quickly    Have a nice night!    ((name deleted))",2005-04-16T00:00:00,60.7161,-135.0537

I then read the report and saw the drawing from the December 12, 2005 Austin event and they seemed to be describing what we had seen.  The sound became quite loud as it flew over and it sounded sort of like a jet, but not exactly and I could see a light from another aircraft to the east. THE sky directly above us was clear but there was a erie pinkish haze in the direction of Austin and San Antonio.  The color of the haze was distacting to me.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,30.0279,-98.1179

But now it's all better and so I've been taking some time and catching up on all the latest ufo buzz.  Even though I wasn't keeping up with the postings on the National UFO Reporting Center, I still continue to observe the sky every night.  I've been out every night since Nov. 3, 2003.  Anyways, it's been very interesting to read everyones different experiences (I decided to only read reports from California for the time being) and  hear their discriptions of the wonderful and unique objects that are always in the skies above us.  I have to say that many of you are writing reports and describing some of the EXACT same kinds of things that I have seen!!! For instance, one couple have seen in the Eastern sky,(5 or 6 times they said) a bright white object that is emitting other white objects from it that fly away on their own.  I too have seen the same thing about 3 times over the past 2 1/2 years.  Quite a few people have seen ""lime green"" objects in the sky that also light up the sky all around with a flourscent green hue.  I have seen this many times and have observed many green objects that somehow form a green vapour cloud around themselves that comes and then disepates every few seconds.  Sometimes it appears that the object does this to camifloge itself.  I've seen purple vapor clouds around a purplish object also. It is such a rush each and every time I'am lucky enough to see these strange wonders.  I think I was one of the first people to report seeing what appeared to be ""stars"" that suddenly became ""moving stars"" that moved about in a certain area of the sky as if they had a certain raidius around them to guard or protect.  Well, I just wanted to say that I'am so happy that there are others of you who can truely relate to me and I to you, and I feel very fortunate to be a small part of the BIG picture.  I don't know exactly what the BIG picture is yet, but have a feeling we're all going to find out in not the too distant future. I do hope that you all treat our beautiful earth, skies, and those who live there with love, kindness and respect because that's what it's all about.

While traveling north bound toward Tampa, Florida (crossing the Howard Frankland Bridge) on Interstate 275 my wife and I witnessed a strange UFO.  We were about little past midway across the bridge when my wife, who is very skeptical about UFO's in general commented, ""What is That up there?""   What she noticed was a strange twinkling light (changed from reddish to yellow and white very quickly) over what appeared to be South Tampa. The object was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon and was slightly descending in a tight corkscrew pattern.  Suddenly the light was emitting glowing red balls that were larger than the object and with a much brighter luminosity. These lights seemed to descend to different altitudes before disappearing.  When I saw this I thought that they may have been doing exercises off of the back end of MacDill Airforce base and that the balls might have been flares but these balls did not remain luminous for a long period (a few seconds).   Then the object made the most stunning emission of what looked like a flood of sparks. It took on the appearance of the classic comet type of configuration and moved in lazy circles speeding up and slowing down; becoming more luminous and less luminous. I was hypnotized by the object. It was very beautiful. I asked my wife, who was driving, how would you describe that and she commented, ""It looked like fireworks"".  I tried to notice the turns this object was making and the sudden turns and decreases in speed were amazing. The object continued to emit this flood of sparks and move in a lazy corkscrew while speeding up and slowing down.  During this observation we noticed that a bright light of white yellow color split from the head of the object and rejoined a few seconds later. The observed event lasted approx 10- 15 minutes when we exited on Westshore Blvd.  The buildings obscured the view of the sky.  It may be of important note that the annual Gasparilla Parade was taking place in Tampa this evening, though I am not sure the times.  I am very interested to know if anyone else submitted a report.  My background-I am a 41 year old Graduate Student in History and my wife is 32 and a Graduate student in Library Science. We are both completely sober and do not drink or smoke. ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone can identify the object, we would welcome additional information about this incident.  We wonder whether it might have been caused by an aerobatic display, performed by an aircraft with pyrotechnic devices on its wings, but that is just a guess, one of many possibilities.

It didnt appear to have a sharp edge.. it appeared blurred, but again with the color and the speed and with the night sky, thats would be hard to detect.

One was at 12 o'clock and one was at 3 o'clock.(This was the position in the sky) So I kept looking at them and they were not moving. So I thought maybe helicopters or so. I went to get my binoculars and when I looked thru them the first one (12o'clock) appeared to be green and red lights circleing a white light. Then I looked at the 3o'clock one and that was a solid red. I went back in and woke my wife to show her. Although she could see exactly what I described she wasn't sure of what she was seeing. It was a pretty clear night and the rest of the stars were way farther away and not nearly as bright as these two. I looked at all the stars thru my binoculars and they all looked like stars. I think my wife started believing her eyes when after a long long time the two ? started moving very slowly but in seperate directions. The one at 12 o'clock went straight out toward the horizon and the 3 o'clock one went on the same height straight out to the right. The rest of the stars did not move in the same pattern as these two ??. After watching them for awhile the 12 o'clock one seemed to turn sideways and the lights were rotating fast. My wife and I both agreed that this could not be anything other than a UFO sighting. I have never seen anything ever before in my life that looked like this. In fact before this I was not sure how I really felt about UFO's. I figured that it was possible but highly unlikely. I am not a nut and I own my own successful business.

They were straight ahead of me, and although I couldn't really estimate their distance I guessed that they were a few miles away.  I first assumed that they belonged to military aircraft flying in formation, since they were in a patch of sky that was too light to see stars, and they were brighter than any stars and an unusual color that I don't recall ever seeing in the sky before.  I watched the lights for a full minute or two.  They possibly had red or green flickers, and my rational mind was thinking that these could be additional small lights.  I was thinking at the time that the formation moved very slowly, since planes always move, but looking back I'm not sure it moved at all.  After this minute or two, as I watched with mild curiousity, the lights just vanished.  I figured.... um.... well, the planes must have turned to an angle where I couldn't see the lights any more.

I was on the roof and asked one of the guys on the ground to hand me a nail gun.  As he handed up the nail gun, he said, ""Hey, look at that"".  ""What,""  I said.  He said, I don't know, look. So I did.  I saw nothing and was busy so I blew it off for a few minutes.  Then he said check it out.  I turned and looked at the sky for several minutes and saw nothing.  It was 10:00 in the morning and the sky was almost clear.  Just then a small cloud was drifting across above us.  He said right there above that cloud.  Do you see it?  After a few more minutes, I did.  It looked like a little speck of cotton off of a cottonwood tree, way up in the air, only it wasn't moving.  I had to get back to work, so I did. The next chance I got, I started looking for the dot again.  Now all 4 of us were looking for it.  After a few minutes the person who originally spotted it, spotted it again.  An airplane was flying alomg now and we used it as a guage to let eveyone else know its locatuion.  Pretty soon, we all saw it It looked like a silverish metallic orb with the sun shining off of it.  It's altitude was way greater than the airplane or the cloud that went past earlier.  It was not moving.  I thought for sure it had to be a satelite.  Everyone else went back to work except for me and the person who spotted it first.  After about another four or five minutes the object moved in a direction that appeared to be down for about a half a second, then went to our right (west) very rapidly until it went out of sight.  When the object moved the speed appeared to be constant.  No starting slow and then going faster, and when it went out of sight, it was due to the fact that the sun reflecting off of it quit shining on it, so we couldn't see it anymore, not that it went behind the mountains or anything.  I would estimate the speed to be about five times as fast as the speed of the planes that were flying over at the time.   I looked at my friend and said did you see that?  Yes he said.  I said what did you see?  He said he saw the dot drop down and then take off that way, (indicating towards the mountains).  Me too, I said.  That was about all that was ever really said about the incident.  It was just forgotten and dismissed as one of those things that make you go hmmmm.  I will never forget what I saw though.  And I still remember it as if it were yesteday.   My opinion.  It wasn't an alien spacecraft.  It was something our government made.

I'm not even sure if my date is that accurate, but I do recall it being around winter time...  My friend and I were on my way to my brother's house, when he noticed an orange ball drop into the atmosphere.  At the time he pointed it out, I thought it was a street light, because it appeared to be the same color as one, but soon noticed that it went from hovering to moving at an exceptionally fast speed to our left.  We followed the ball for a mile or so and saw that we were actually gaining on it until we ended up behind a grocery store.  It was very clear that we were much closer to the orange ball now.  It appeared about half dollar size from our viewpoint and was hovering over a patch of trees.  It moved closer to us (what seemed a very gradual speed) until it was right above my friend's parked car and much lower to the ground.  The thing seemed only a matter of feet above us, and had a bright orange light in the middle with blue-ish lights surrounding.  It hovered over us for some minutes, and made no sound at all.  It shortly took off with such a speed, that neither my friend nor I could recall which direction it left in.  There were a series of strange occurrences that my friend and I experienced throughout the next several weeks, but I don't know if it's relevant to our experience, as we were experiencing some paranoia.  I developed what seemed like scratches on the back of both of my shoulders (in semi-symmetrical lines of 4), but they seemed to be under my skin, as I could not feel them.  They lasted over a week and vanished.  My friend and I both awoke to doors slamming when we were home alone, with no explanation.  My friend also claimed to develope the scratches some weeks later, but I didn't get to see them before they went away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

In Dec 2004 at approximately 2:05 p.m. I saw an object that I cannot explain.  While driving to work on the Crosstown expressway in Tampa, I noticed a strange rectangular craft in the distance, traveling in a NW direction.   At first I thought the craft may have been a balloon because it was traveling slow (about 60 mph) and was very large.  I first noticed it about 2-3 miles away while I was traveling 55 mph in my vehicle while going to work.  When I was about a mile away I noticed that it had no curves like you would expect a balloon (blimp) to have and the ends were squared off.  It was of a rectangular shape.  I never got close enough to get under it.  It maintained an altitude of approx 1000 ft. The altitude, speed and direction were all consistent and I could not notice any deviation in any axis.   I had a camera in my bag on the passenger seat next to me and I wanted to take a picture of it but I was unable to do so-weird I know but I just couldn’t do it. Physical Description: The length was in excess of 500 ft (2-C-5 type transport aircraft parked end to end)  The height was in excess of 120 ft.  Since I retired from the USAF 5 years ago and have worked on many kinds of fighter, cargo and high performance reconnaissance aircraft, I sort of know what to look for in aircraft and below are my observations. The exterior was more rectangular shape with minor angled variances along the sides. The exterior composition had the appearance of sandy gray concrete. There were areas along the sides that that had several rectangular colored red and some orange areas. I specifically looked for any type of letters, symbols or markings which would indicate anything of significance and there were none. No windows, ports, hatches, panel lines or discoloration of surface could be made out from my closest approach (2,000 ft) were noticed.  No external pods, antennas i.e. long-wire, Radar-dish, directional, panel mounted, loop, adf, blade, towel-rack or anything that resembled an antenna was noticed. No engines or propulsion system of any kind were noticed nor any noise of any kind.  No electrical interference on my car AM radio was noted either.

I lived out in the country for 3 1/2 years, and was returning home from a Saturday morning shopping excursion.  I took some back roads out of town, one of them running directly along the local airport, Dupont by name.  This is a very small airport, handling only small, private recreational craft.  No jets of any kind, including small Lears can land at this airport.  The runways are too short, for one thing.   As I turned off Roods Lake Road (airport address) east onto Haines Road, a huge shadow passed over my car.  It was so big that I thought, ""What the hell was that!?""  There was no noise.  I drove a few more feet, slowly now, up the road all the way looking to my right.  A line of trees blocked my view for several hundred yards, but when I could see I came to a stop and looked hard.   At first, I didn't see anything, and then, I could.  It was huge and hovering over the short, dirt runway.  It was shaped like (and this is the only  thing I can equate it to) the starship from Star Trek-Enterprise, the one with the lady commander.  Please don't laugh.  I only describe it like that because it's the only correlation I can think of.   The thing that makes it even stranger is that this thing looked 'cloaked.'  By that, I mean you couldn't see it at a glance, but if you stared (like I did), you could see the shape and the size being surrounded by some kind of shiny, reflective shield or something.   I didn't hang around, and no other cars came along, or I might have stopped them, to say, ""Look!!""

The road that I was traveling was the same road that Fountain Powerboats Inc. is on, so I thought that it was the lights from the parking lot, but I didn't remember seeing them there before.  Then, as I was closing in on the lights, I noticed that they were starting to move. At first I thought that it was just an illusion because I was driving in a curve, but then I was on a straight stretch and I realized that it was not an illusion. There were two lights that looked about like street lights and they were about 50 -75 feet apart from each other. There movements were simultaneous which led me to believe that it was one craft, but I could never make out a shape.  As I closed in on the object it seemed to increase its speed and I was trying to keep up with it as there was another car in front of me who was also trying to follow it.  Due to the trees and the curves in the road, we would loose it for a few seconds and then it would re-appear.  I was trying to make it to the end of the road were it opened up to the river where I would have a wide open sky to view the object, but by the time I and the other driver had reached the end of the road the object was gone.  The other 3 people in the other car confirmed that they had seen the same thing that I had seen. We were all in disbelief. I tried to make sense of what I saw, but nothing added up. My house is in  an area that I watched the object fly over. When I got home I asked my wife if she heard anything; a jet, airplane, heli-copter, blimp? She said she heard nothing. The only thing that I thought it could have possibly been was a blimp, because noone heard it, but that doesn't explain why I couldn't keep up with it in my car running 60mph. Or why it disappeared out of sight over a river that is 1 mile wide. I heard nothing about this sighting in the news or the paper so I assume that we were the only ones who saw this.

About 5:45 a.m. Wednesday February 11,2004, I was out with my dog before leaving for work. I happened to look up at the moon and noticed, what at first, looked like two planets (one over the other). I recall thinking how unusual this would be without any pomp and circumstance in the news. They appeared to be planet-like instead of stars because their light was steady - not winking. I just couldn't believe the closeness of these two celestial bodies.  They were below the half-moon by about a hand width at anns length and very bright - similar to Venus and Jupiter. It was too high above the horizon to be Venus (approximate location of the sun at high noon), but there wasn't any other explanation in my opinion. The objects weren't moving - they were stationary. While standing there frozen in my gaze, the top one began fading in strength much like a variable star but happening so fast it couldn't have been.  I thought perhaps it might be a cloud or mist rolling across my view of this planet like object, but when I checked the sky, there wasn't a cloud or mist of any kind whatsoever. The stars and the moon were crystal clear and there was a faint star just below the moon that remained the same brightness throughout my observation.  Within less than 20 seconds the light from the first object had disappeared completely. I was flabbergasted.  And then shortly afterward the second source began fading until within a short period of time, it too was gone.  It couldn't have been two stationary satellites reflecting the rising sun, because the sun would be shining on them (rising within the hour) - not setting on them.

Cigar shaped object with two orange lights flies low and FAST across sky only blocks away with no sound,Sedro-Woolley,WA,2004-02-15T20:15:00,cigar,20-30 seconds,"Occurred : 2/15/2004 20:15  (Entered as : 02/15/1904 20:15) Reported: 2/24/2005 10:58:53 PM 22:58 Posted: 5/24/2005 Location: Sedro-Woolley, WA Shape: Cigar Duration:20-30 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42316.html,"Cigar shaped object with two orange lights flies low and FAST across sky only blocks away with no sound My wife and I had been watching the star Sirius because of the unusual prisms we were witnessing. It usually changes colors and flickers; however it was more blinking that night.  Vivid shades of green, blue, red, amber and yellow were quite visible.  It was about 20-25 degrees above the horizon and very bright that night. At around 7:30pm PST, we were standing on our front porch (facing North) looking at the night sky when we first noticed something strange.  It appeared two red orbs, very small and very far away, almost ""spewed"" from the Sirius star. (This isn’t actually what prompted me to file this report.)  We watched them move very similar to a plane at first, slowly making their way across the sky. The biggest difference was that the lights weren’t blinking and there was only that red glowing light. It was a bright magenta, though it appeared very far away. We first witnessed one shoot off to the left (West) and take about 45 seconds to move what seemed like a mile or so. It then suddenly appeared to stop in the air, then disappear seconds later.  We weren’t sure what to think of it and decided to get a 2nd opinion. We called my wife’s mother who happened to be out driving on Cook Road (country road about 5 miles away to the Northeast) and asked if she had seen anything. She said no. At this time, we started to witness another red orb that looked exactly like the first, but this time it shot off to the right (East). We asked if she could see it as well and she confirmed it.  It acted very similar to the first one, moving a mile or away from Sirius, then stopping and disappearing. Somewhat stunned and excited, we decided to grab my camera and be ready for the next time.  About 10 minutes later my wife’s mother arrived at our house. We talked about what we had seen and decided to keep an eye on it through the front bay window. (It was a cold night so being outside for hours at a time was difficult.) Over the next 45min I ventured in and out; keeping an eye to the sky whenever we weren’t talking.  What happened next is what not only prompted me too make this report, but turned my previously skeptical wife into a believer. I had also called my father since he’s always been interested in UFOs and the paranormal. (He’s also a very smart man. PhD in Psychology licensed Shiatsu therapist, LMT, etc.) While standing just off our front porch in the front walkway and talking to him about the night’s events, I noticed two very clear amber/orange lights moving rather quickly towards us from the North-Northeast; also seeming originating from Sirus. I had been watching the sky the whole time and didn’t see it come up over the foothill. It appeared from nowhere.  At first I dismissed it as a plane, but as it came rapidly closer, I realized there were no wings. I yelled for my wife and mother-in-law to come look.  By the time they arrived at my side, the object had moved drastically closer. It now appeared to be maybe a mile away from us at the most. It had only been maybe 10 seconds since I first saw it from what seemed like 20-30 miles away. All three of us just stared up in awe. Within 2-3 seconds, it passed almost above our heads (maybe a few blocks away) at a surprisingly low altitude (couple hundred feet). We got a pretty good look at it… it was cigar shaped with no wings or tailfin or anything. We couldn’t make out the surface, although it looked very dark. There were two lights on it (the amber/orange ones I had seen) that appeared to be on the bottom, plus a dimmer and smaller red light, similar to the orbs we had seen earlier. They lit up the area directly underneath them; apparent by the treetops. The surface of the object didn’t appear to be reflecting the light back at all – it reminded me of a street light color and beam. A kind of floodlight, but controlled.  There were two very distinct things that stuck out in all of our minds. This object was moving *FAST* at first (appearing to travel 20 miles or so in 10-15 seconds), but then slowed down when closer to us, then speeding up again as it went away. The other thing that really surprised us was the lack of sound. It was dead silent. No wind noise, no motor, nothing. It was shooting across the sky at easily 80-90 miles an hour without making a peep! The fact that it appeared so close to us added to the confusion..  We watched it as it flew overhead and eventually out of sight (to the South-Southeast). The time frame from when I first saw it appear to when we couldn’t see the lights anymore was about 30 seconds. We started trying to rationalize what it was. Plane? Nope – no wings or sound. Helicopter? Looked like it *could* of been, though again it was completely silent, plus we never saw the blades or tail light. It was a night we’ll remember for years to come if not for the rest of our lives!   Some quick background information on my wife, me, and my mother-in-law:  I am a computer security professional (own my own consulting business) and have been so for over a decade. I’m very well respected in my field and have always been a perfectionist on the job. I pay a large amount of attention to detail and have been told I’m quite intelligent.  My wife owns her own company as well, manufacturing an up and coming product that a handful of large businesses have shown interest in selling. She has been doing it for about 4 years with a business partner. She is also well respected by her customers and business associates.  My mother-in-law is a volunteer coordinator at the local church and a Boy Scout district commissioner. She is a very particular person when it comes to facts and research. Just like me, she prefers to research all the facts for herself and then make the best educated decision that she can.

As I began to watch I noticed what looked to be 7 objects. Their was 1 taller than the rest. Their was a light that hovered over the group.The only way to describe the light is it looked like that thing that divers use for transportation while diving under water, except it seemed to giving light to these thing's.  As I sat there I began to get scared, because they were getting closer to my deer stand. They were going up and down this hill side, like they looking for something. The only way that I can describe these beings is they seemed to glow and they didn't take steps they hoovered.   They got to the log road where I was, then they stopped.  It was obvious to me that they knew I was there.  It was at this time that I really became frightened, because I knew that this phenomenon that I was witnessing were not human.  1/2 hour before sunrise they all seemed to go to this bright light, which was about 75 yards from me. Since I was in the wood's the foilage kept me from seeing real good. The bright light that they seemed to be headed to disappeared.  Since this occurance there have been a lot of strange thing's happen. Since I live in the Bible belt if you say that you've experienced a UFO phenomenon people tend to think your nut's.

Here is where it gets wierd, my brother and I know those roads on the base. There is no way to move that far in 5 minutes. So we might be able to believe it was a helicopter but it was on private propery an hour before that. Also why would the military have a light that bright and shine it in the air? The last wierd thing is that there wasn't any sound. Everyone believes the light was too powerfull to be mounted on a automobile.

Object: ""Kite-shaped"", but shorter and wider than a typical kite-- approximately a 5 to 4 length to width ratio-- travelling toward what would be the ""top"" of the kite.  The following diagram approximates the axes of the kite shape.  | -|----  (Direction of travel: <---) |  At the ""nose"" there was one bright light flashing at about one-second intervals, along with two smaller, softer white lights, close together and slightly off-center to the left.  There was one soft white light at each of the other three corners, not as bright as the strobe.  No red and green port and starboard lights.  As indicated in the diagram, the cross-axis defined by the ""side"" lights was no more than 20% of the total length back from the nose-- too far forward to be at the wingtips of large modern airplane designs.  The lights made it difficult to see the shape clearly, but stars disappeared and reappeared behind it at the edges of the kite shape-- i.e. not as would occur with wings and a fuselage.  Size: Visually equivalent to a Boeing 757 at 2,000 to 2,500 feet altitude.  That is also our best night-time naked-eye estimate of its maximum altitude.  Sound: A loud, fairly high warbling whine, from a single sound source. No jet exhaust roar, definitely not a piston engine. Also, there was no interference ""beat"" or other indication of multiple engines/sound sources. (I'm a musician, and am used to using wave interference to tune instruments, and used to distinguishing between single or multiple voicings of a given sound.)  Speed:  The object took about 20 seconds to go from directly overhead to disappearing beyond trees and a ridgeline two or three hundred feet high and a quarter mile away. Estimated distance traveled while in sight no more than one mile.  The other witness is an ex-pilot, multiple-engine rated.  Her first comment was that it must be ""in trouble"", because the sound was all wrong and it was at or below what would be stall speed for an airplane that size.  Direction of travel: Northeast, with Polaris in sight for visual reference, observed from a house and walkway oriented within one or two degrees of true north-south. The sky was clear except for some high ""mackerel"" (cirrus?) clouds off to the south, with a three-quarter moon.  Location:  Del Dios community on Lake Hodges, approximately 4.5 miles southwest of the town center of Escondido, California.  (Note: An ex-air force friend, told about a similar sighting in February of 2004, said ""it's one of ours"" but would not go into any further details.)",2005-09-02T00:00:00,33.13055039787798,-117.02199071618035

I went outside for a bit to cool off because of the hot night and looked up and saw 3 dimly lit circular things in the sky. I at first thought it might have been spot lights but looking longer at it I ruled out the possibility that they were the spotlights. They were dimly lit, kind of a light gray and not a bright light it was like a haze over them, and were what looked to be 20 inches wide. They also moving in and out of the clouds and they looked like they would follow eachother and then sometimes they would hover apart from eachother for a bit. It wasn't a pattern to their movements either which made me also realize they couldn't have been spotlights.  I finished my smoke and went inside to wake up my boyfriend and tell him to come out and look at this. Then our neighbour was coming home and we called over to him and him and his wife also watched these things.  They seemed to give off a very low humm sound. It wasn't like anything really electrical we ever heard. It was something very very low but yet it was almost loud at the same time. It's very hard to put into words.

I live in Exeter, New Hampshire. I am a retired Navy Chief with twenty-two years of service. My job in the Navy was a lot of fun because I was an Instructor Flight Engineer on the P3 Orion  and EP-3 Reconnaissance aircraft.  I also gave in flight check-rides to fellow pilots and flight engineers. I have twenty-one years of flying experience and I have logged over 10,000 hours of flight time. I also worked for Boeing in Everett Washington north of Seattle for two years as a Quality Assurance Manager leading a team of 65 people in the Systems Installation Division on the Boeing 777 Production Line.  I’ve flown over the entire globe and never have I ever seen anything like I saw on the afternoon of July 20, 2005 at approximately 3:15 PM. I was outside preparing my lawnmower getting ready to mow my yard. I had just fueled it and finished checking the oil and had finished installing the grass catcher when I took a drink from a glass of water and was looking up into the sky as I tilted the glass of water back to finish it off. That’s when I noticed this enormous silver cigar shaped object in the sky at about a 40 to 45 degree angle above the horizon. There were very few clouds in the sky and it was about 90% clear blue sky that day with excellent visibility. Below you can see the information taken from the local Seacoast Online News Weather section for July 20, 2005 during that timeframe.  Time   Condition    Temp  DewPoint Humid. Visib.      Press. Wind  2:55PM Partly Cloudy 90°F  59°F   36%  Unlimited   29.89  From WNW7mph  3:55PM Partly Cloudy 90°F  59°F    36%  Unlimited   29.88  From W9mph  To put the scale of the size of this object into perspective think about this, take a Cessna airplane and park it next to a Boeing 747. Then take the 747 and place it next to this object and the 747 would look like the Cessna does beside a 747 in relation to the size of the object. Another example would be that this object was about twice the size of a modern day US Navy Nimitz Class Aircraft Carrier. On first glance my initial thought was that it was the Hood blimp, which has been flying around in the area recently but I quickly dismissed that idea.  While watching this object for about ten minutes I realized that it wasn’t making any sound at all and although I can’t be exact, I thought it was between 2500 and 3500 feet in the air. With something that large it’s hard to really tell but I remember thinking that was about right because the clouds were around 5000 feet that day and it seemed to be below the clouds. There was also a row of large windows evenly spaced around the entire perimeter of the object a little bit higher than center on the object. I did not see anything or anyone in the windows.  The object was moving from the West directly toward me heading in an Easterly direction and moving very slowly. Again with something that large it’s hard to estimate speed with something that large but my educated guess is it was moving much slower than 100 knots.  I looked around to see if any of my neighbors were outside but no one else was outside at the time but me.  I also thought about running into the house to get my digital camera, but I didn’t know how long the object would be there so I was afraid I would miss seeing it the entire time it was in view and I didn’t want to risk that.  I’m glad I decided to stay because not long after I made that decision the object changed from a bright shiny silver color and started to glow a red/orange color. Then there was this strange looking cloud of orange/red flames that started growing and billowing underneath the entire bottom of the object. The billowing fiery clouds reminded me of the way napalm rolls along on the vintage war film footage of Viet Nam I’ve seen on television except that there was no smoke associated with it. At that point I had a shot of adrenalin due to extreme fear because I thought it was going to attack me in some way. It looked as if the air itself had been suddenly ignited in a large billowing cloud of flames. Just as I was about to turn and run into the house due to fear the fiery cloud grew larger and it seemed to be pushing back toward the western end of the object and once it reached its peak (probably about half the diameter of the object) the object seemed to stretch out about twice its original size toward the eastern end of the object thus filling the entire sky in front of me and then in the wink of an eye the western end of the object caught up with the eastern end and it simply disappeared right in front of me. This entire process only took about four or five seconds and the instant the object disappeared so did the billowing fireball cloud. There was no apparent residual evidence that the object was ever there once it disappeared. I was stunned and stood there for several minutes wondering what to do and what had I just seen. I thought about calling the police but because no one else was there to see it with me I didn’t think they would believe me so I didn’t call. I knew I had to report it to somebody so I Googled the words report UFO and that’s how I found the web site for the National UFO Reporting Center.  I didn’t notice any bright lights on the object although that doesn’t mean it didn’t have any because it was a bright sunny clear day and any lights would have been washed out by the bright sunlight and the reflected sunlight off of it’s surface. Also the sun was high in the sky and in no way did it obscure my visibility of the object nor did any reflected sunlight from the object obscure my vision of it in any way. There were no trees or man-made structures obstructing my view. The object made no noise at all during the entire event.  This was absolutely one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life and I’ve seen a lot. In my opinion this was not something man made and it was far too big to be a blimp or an airplane. I believe it was not of this Earth. Other than that I have no idea what it was, where it came from or where it went. It absolutely appeared to be under intelligent control and exhibited use of technology far beyond anything known to mankind today unless this is some kind of new top-secret government craft previously unheard of. I seriously doubt that though because it would be almost impossible to hide something from the public of this gigantic physical size if it were a secret government project.

The former flight engineer, who wished to be identified only as ""David,"" said of the experience, ""this was like nothing I've ever seen before.""  What the retired Navy chief petty officer said he saw last Wednesday could only be classified as a UFO, an unidentified flying object.  It was a bright and sunny afternoon, about 3:15 p.m., and David was outside preparing his lawnmower. He had filled the mower with gas, checked the oil, and took a sip from a glass of water he had poured. When he tilted his head back to get the final sip, through the bottom of the glass he saw a large cigar-shaped object hovering in the sky.  David said windows were equally spaced around the object, however he didn't see anyone or anything inside. The size of the object was enormous. By comparison, he said, consider what an ultralight plane would look like next to a Boeing 747. He said it was about the size of two USS Nimitz aircraft carriers.  At first glance, through his empty glass of water he thought it could have been the Hood blimp.  ""But, the instant I put my glass down, I said, 'that's not a blimp.'""  The object moved from west to east, very slowly for something that size, he said. His initial instinct was that the object was moving at about 100 knots, but something that big shouldn't be able to stay in the air if it's going that slow, he said.  The object began changing colors from a bright silver to an orange-ish red. A strange cloud of red and orange flames began surrounding the object, and before he knew it the object stretched out like a rubber band. It grew to about twice its original size, and then it was gone.  The entire incident lasted about 10 minutes, he recalled Monday morning, but he is unaware of the specific time because, ""it felt like time stopped.""  He went into his house and first thought to call the police. He decided not to because he didn't think they'd take him seriously. So he went on the Internet and searched for ""report UFO,"" and found the Web site for the Seattle-based National UFO Reporting Center.  Peter Davenport, director of the UFO reporting center, said David's report was astonishing because of his history with flight. ""I have no question on his reliability.""  He said he gets several accounts each year, but this one stood out. The report was well written and scientific, Davenport said.  ""In my view, that's one of the cardinal rules of an account,"" he said.  The center was founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert Gribble. The center's Web site, www.nuforc.org, has a large list of UFO sightings.  According to the site, the center's primary function is to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have witnessed possible UFOs. David's report, which will soon be on the Web site, will be among dozens of documented sightings to be formally reported to the center.  Not the first time  The Exeter area is no stranger to UFO sightings. In 1965, two Exeter police officers and hitchhiker Norman Muscarello, who was with them, gained national attention after seeing a UFO hovering over Route 101 in Kensington. The sighting was documented in a book called ""The Incident at Exeter.""  And then there was the incident involving Barney and Betty Hill, a husband and wife from Portsmouth who claimed to have been abducted by aliens. The couple was driving from a vacation in Canada in 1961 when they saw a UFO.  The object moved directly over their car, and before they knew it they grew drowsy. They later claimed to have been abducted by aliens and gave identical accounts while they were hypnotized.  But for this recent sighting, David said he believes that there is life beyond Earth. He said the galaxy is so enormous, it's hard to believe humans are the only intelligent life.  ""To the point of not being obnoxious, it'd be egocentric to think there is no other life out there.""

I was taking a few of a passenger jet flying from west to east and I heard what I thought was another flying off to my east.  As soon as the passenger jet disappeared from my view into the treeline I turned around and spotted the source of the sound to my east, and I don't believe it was a jet because it had no wings, though it sounded like one.  I am certain it's the same object I photographed on 6/23/05  ( http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44577.html ) as it is the same color, has what looks to be an indention or band in the center, and the rear seems to have a bit of a hump.  The object was flying roughly from south to north again and was to my east northeast by the time I took these photographs of it.  It was low again (maybe 10,000 feet) and moving fairly slowly (I would guess 200-250 MPH) and seemed to fly in a straight path.  I didn't notice any lights or any other strange behavior.

For some reason I kinda feel scared about telling anyone, not scared that they would not believe me but scared of what I saw could possibly harm me.",2005-04-16T00:00:00,38.4004,-85.7725

This whole experience is quite blurry to me, I must point out before going on.  I'm not sure why, but it's rather hard for me to recall for some reason, what reason I myself am unsure.  I speculated it might be because a portion of my memory had been erased, or possibly I was just tired (though I'm am a big alien nut and seeing an alien air craft, no matter how tired I was, wouldn't be enough for me to forget).  Anyway...  I was on my way to work and it was around 6:50 in the morning.  I start work at 7:00.  I had just pulled in the long driveway that leads both to my boss's house and to her dog kennel where I worked when I spotted something very bright in the sky to my left.  I watched it as I drove slowly down the driveway and soon I realized it was coming my way.   I pulled into the parking lot and hurriedly opened the door just as the thing came over above me, flying low to the ground and at a slow pace.  It's so fuzzy to me now to try and recall, but I remember walking towards the building where I work, thinking, ""Oh, it's just an airplane,"" but knowng that it couldn't be, especially since I heard no noise, like the engine an airplane would make.   The craft was large and circular, from what I recall.  Lights were very bright and large underneath it and illuminated parts of the ship.  I'm not sure why, but I watched it as I opened the door to the building and stepped inside, dismissing it, almost as if I was forced to think nothing of it.  In fact, once I stepped inside, I nearly forgot about the whole thing completely.  It wasn't until much later that I even remembered anything at all.  This seems odd to me since something of that magnitude wouldn't normally be something someone would forget so easily.   The aircraft, whatever it was, was gone within minutes since I had stepped outside once again to unlock the gates and it was no longer in site.  I wish I could remember more, and the memories I do have are clouded for some reason, but it's all I've got. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Basically what I saw was a group of intermintent lights that had no distinct shape traveling very high up in the sky together.  It was almost like flares that were lighting and then extinguishing or perhaps mirrors reflecting the sunsrays.  One thought that I had was that somebody had done a balloon releases and used those silver reflective balloons.  I don't know what direction the wind was blowing and they would have been moving at speeds comparable to that of an jet aircraft and they were traveling much higher than any commercial airplanes in the area.  You could see the clouds and sky in between the lights but still the lights traveled small group.  Also there were no strangling lights, all the lights appeared and disappeared within that group.  One very strange thing about this is that I could not see the lights without my sunglasses on.  At first when I saw the objects in the sky I thought that I had scratched my sunglasses.  When I took the sunglasses off and could not see the formation and had to put them back on to locate it again.  I tested this a few times.  It definately was not scratched sunglasses.  I did take a picture with my cell phone, well actually two pictures but I can't really see much on my cell phone and I'm not sure exactly how I am suppose to email them to myself.  Also at some point while I was watching this thing cross the sky, at one point about 7 lights lined very distinctly on the front of the flying group.  That was really the only patter I saw.  Even when the 7 lights lite up they still had other lights behind it sporatically going on and off.

It was so low it looked it was going to land, but we are 16 miles from the nearest airport.

The sun was about 5 to 10 degrees obove the horizon, as viewed from Aurora in late afternoon.  A very bright rainbow type light illuminated a short ""hanging curtain"" cloud to the left of the soon to be setting sun. The light was a brilliant aqua green that shifted to yellow then a pale orange as if you were looking at a short section of a rainbow.  I am sure this was a form of sundog, however I noted that the flat luminous cloud reflecting the sun, sort of like a shimmering curtain of a cloud  was totally unlike the other clouds in the sky, which were mostly small round puffs covering most, but not all of the sky.  It was only after I had watched the sundog, and it was starting to weaken, that I noted the short curtain cloud causing this effect was directly under what I would call a dark, cigarette shaped cloud from which the curtain cloud descended.  I would not call the dark cloud a cigar shape, but more of a thin, long cigarette.  There were no similar cloud formations in the sky. But there were other apparently higher clouds farther west and thus that might account for the cigarette cloud being darker, as it was in the shadow of other clouds between it and the sun. But again, the sun dog seemed limited to just his halo or hanging curtain of mousture.  It might have been verdigri extending down from this long, thin cloud, but normally that is in very long strings whereas this was shorter and more compact.  But the cloud causing the sundog was like a mist cloud, perhaps an effect of the angle of the sunlight.  I am fairly certain this was a form of sundog, with the cloud particles in just the right spot to bend and refract the sunlight in my direction. (I was in the south parking lot of Aurora Mall on Alameda Avenue.)  I am not posting this as a ufo or unidentified object, but wish to post it in reference to the contrasting long thin cloud above the sundog in case anyone else had a differing view of this event that would indicate something else.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,39.68000198902607,-104.7929670781893

I went outside when I realized that I had forgotten a blanket on our clothes line. Since our neighbor's dogs were barking I decided to wait outside long enough to see what was disturbing them.  At this point, I was not certain what direction the dogs were barking, and if they might be barking at me or something else.  I sat down on the ground so the dogs could not see me.  When the dogs stopped barking, I continued to listen for about three more minutes.  When I heard nothing unusual, I decided to go back inside the house.  As I started to sit up, I noticed a strange brown-gold light (football-shaped) off to my right (north) side. There is no light source in this area so I wondered where the light had come from.  Each property lot is 150 feet wide and the object was above the south quarter of the third lot to the north.  I was in the north half of the first lot to the south, and there was one full lot between us---so the object approximately 300 feet to the north of me.  The object appeared to be moving at an approximate height of about 25-30 feet above the ground.  It was above the roofline of the furthest neighbor's house north, yet still under the treetops of the trees located in the lot to the west and north-west.  The trees, a mixture of mesquites and elm, range in height from approximately 6-50 or so feet tall.  The object traveled very slowly, and without any sound, from east to the west.  The brown-gold light appeared to be some form of contained light source, as thought the light was reflecting inside a semi-transparent barrier with very little exterior illumination. The object did not light up the neighboring houses, the sky above it, or the ground below it. The light from my vantage point, appeared to be about half the size of a football held at arms length of 30 inches. [My closest night time “guestimation” is that the object was under ten feet in diameter.]  The object continued to travel horizontally and did fluctuate in height, speed, or direction of travel. I watched the light for approximately 5 seconds before it blinked out. As it blinked out, from light to totally dark, I noticed a slightly yellowish colored light at the east (back) side of the object like an arc of electricity sparking in a line from the middle south (left) side to the middle north (right) side. There was still no sound. I continued to watch to see if the object had continued to travel along the same path but it never passed in front of the trees to the west or north-west. Since it was dark outside and lightly overcast, I was not able to determine if the object had ascended up and out of my line of sight, or if it was still in the same spot and just not visible in the dark.  Shortly before sighting this object, it sprinkled a few drops of rain and several bits of sleet. I had reached out to catch a piece of sleet to see how dense the ice was and to my surprise I drew back pieces of a reddish-orange particle that looked like tiny dried tree buds. The objects were not cold to the touch nor were they moist. They were crisp when rolled between the fingers and brittle. I was unable to see if there were similar objects falling further into the yard.  We were due to receive scattered rain showers mixed with sleet and snow some time after midnight. There was no lightening in the area during this incident and there was no perceptible electricity in the air. It was partly cloudy and had sprinkled earlier but there was no precipitation at the time of the incident. There was a light wind from the ENE at about 6 mph. The temperature was 44 degrees F and we were expecting a night time low of 32 degrees. The humidity was 49% with a dew point of 25 degrees and a barometric pressure of 30.26 inches steady with a visibility of 10.0 miles.  As an end note: The neighbors dogs to the west had been barking as though agitated for nearly a quarter hour before this incident. My dog went outside with me and she usually ingnores the neighbor's dogs, but she appeared to watch to see what the neighboring dogs were barking at. My dog normally likes to romp in the dark and pick up sticks to encourage me to chase her but she never left my side. She never appeared fearful or agitated but she did not hesitate to come back inside the house with me.",2006-02-14T00:00:00,33.6755,-100.7548

On top were 12 orange and green round lights which looked a bit dim,6 on the left and 6 on the right.The lights were not blinking or flashing.  It was completely silent. The speed was medium slow.  It flew then over my house and I could see the underside.  It just looked like a black surface. Up front there was something that looked like an opening of some sort but it was not clear to me.  I ran to the backyard but by then  I saw that it was disappearing behind the trees.  I have no idea how far up this object was.It was not too high or too low.  The only height I can compare it with are the jets coming from Newark Airport about 35 or 40 miles from here.

We have seen this object twice this month- 1/8/2006 and now most recently 1/24/2006. We saw it both times at S-SW from Stanwood..that would put it over north Everett or west Marysville (Snohomish County, WA).  It appears to be a bright light, making one think it's just a really bright star, but it was too bright.  Just when we are arguing w/ourselves, the object moved.  It would just ""hoover"" in the same spot and then would shoot off the to right, then come back to center and go to the left.  It had lights that were twinkling and they would get brighter as it was about to move in a direction.  Red blinking lights were spotted occasionally..but it was too far away to be clearly seen, we thought it resembled a ""V"" like shape. We thought- helicopter, but there was no noise on either occasion.  Then within 1/2 hour two planes passed the object and we watched totally fansinated because the ""object"" disappered.  No lights were seen when the planes approached the area of the ""object."" After the planes passed the object reappeared and went about it's ""searching"" or ""scanning"" like manuevers.  Last night we noticed that the object made circular motions very quickly and that we had not noticed before, as well as little ""U"" shaped motions to the left and right.  The thing that is interesting is that this sigthing lasted (on BOTH occasions) for OVER 1 hour periods of time and relatively the same time and same location.  I just want the person who reported the first one over Snohomish in 2003- that we saw the same thing..TWICE now- several years later.

We continued to watch this light for over 2 hours as it slowly descended from high in the sky, to just above the tree tops. At this point we decided to get in the car to get a better view before it disappeared behind the trees. As we traveled down the  road we kept looking up to try to find the light. At first we couldn't see it, so we thought we had passed it because of the trees blocking our view. We then turned around, went back up the road, and saw the light, so we decided to turn on a side road to get a better view. We pulled off the side of the road to look at it. After looking at it for only a few seconds, the light quickly faded out followed by several red blinks of light, and then nothing.  At this point another bright light caught our attention in the Southeastern sky. We quickly took out the binoculars to get a better look at it.

When we got home, we got out of the car, and looked at the sky in the same direction and there it was.

OK, alot odd.  I was traveling north on Rt.1 last night at about 9 PM in North Kingstown, RI just past Oak Hill Road but south of the Exeter exit, when I saw what looked like two very bright lights on the west side of the road (about 100 or so yards off the to the north and west.  As I approached, I realized the lights were standing still.  I slowed way down in my right lane to get a better look because as I passed the bright white lights, there were about ten neon blue strips of lights in triangular and pentagon shapes just hanging there in mid air above the trees but back into the woods.  I started to pull off the road to get a better look but I was A) shocked at what I saw and had a little bit of fear B) concerned that the cars behind me would be staring at the same thing and would rear-end my car instead of watching the road and C)I didn't want to be late to pick up my daughter from the movies in Warwick.  As a result I only got a 15-20 second close look at this ""thing"".  I found it odd that only about 2-300 yards away there was the usual police officer parked on the south side of the road looking for speeders and he obviously didn't see anything (but he was facing north looking for the cars.  I went back with my daughter hoping it was still there and that there was a logical explaination but there was nothing there when my daughter and I returned about 9:55pm.  Anyway, I was wondering if any of the other drivers reported anything to explain this VERY UNUSUAL Phenomena.  P.S.- I'm a physician with a scientific background.  This souds as odd to me as it probably does to you. .",2006-03-11T00:00:00,41.5877,-71.4623

No object outline was seen. Its apparent speed was slow, but in a South Direction. Object ""strobed"" approximately once every 7 seconds, as it moved in what appeared a straight line. I asked the Captain if he could see what I saw, but from his seating position in the aircraft, and the height of the sighting, he could not, and did not get out of his seat. We turned down the ""DU""s...(Data display units) in the aircraft to rule out any reflections from inside the cockpit.  I called NY Center and asked them if they had any traffic or military traffic 20 to 30 thousand feet above and behind us and he indicated that he only had a Falcon Jet behind us going North...  ""Center"" asked other aircraft in our general area, if they could see any other traffic on their TCAS, or visually if they had any other reports. I think we were talking to NY Center, as our position was about 40NM south of KBGM (Binghampton, NY).  As the object passed above and behind us, I was indicating to the Captain where to look out his rear Clearview window to see the object.  He did not see it, as we were flying Westbound and the object was proceeding Southbound. We were out of range visually. All Aircraft reported nothing.  I think they asked Southwest and American, and possibly United. At the end of the sighting the time was 0020 Zulu or about 19:20 Eastern Time local.  I don't believe it was a satellite, as the sun was down, and satellites dont have strobes.  I have not run Nova Satellite prediction software, so I don't know if satellites were in the area.  http://www.nlsa.com/index.html Air Traffic Controller indicated that he was not surprised at the sighting as he receives them from time to time.  To Clarify:  In my report I refer to ""object"".  I could see no object just a visible strobe.  No position lights.  I also thought when I first saw the strobe that it could be a distant star going supernovae.  Just a thought, as I was trying to figure out what it was.    END.

One to three minutes passed and I again saw the light appear this time centered above the road in the distance.  It moved relativly slowly in a 45 degree upwards angle to the right (west).  As it did so it dropped smaller lights in grouos of three, three times which slowly descented and vanished after a second then diasappeared.  Roughly 30 seconds later it reappeared in a lower position slightly to the right and began the 45 degree path again, again dropping the smaller lights.  It reappeared a third time again in a lower position and began its 45 degree path this time without dropping the smaller lights.  barely a second after it reappeared the third time a second light appeared to the left of the first light and began dropping the groups of smaller lights.  I then exited the Parkway at exit 88 onto Rt 70 in Brick Township.  Across the street from the tollbooth is a Best Western Hotel, the light then reappeared over the hotel and lingered for a few seconds. I then turned onto Rt 70 west and lost sight of the light. I've lived in the area all my life and there are several small airports, and airforce base and a naval base within 30 minutes of the area of the sighting.  The lights did not appear to be or behave like aircraft, not could it have been a meteor as the speed was too slow and was headed in an odd trajectory.  Military flares also do not explain it as there was no aircraft in the area during the sighting, and the area is very densely populated as well as the military bases being only stop offs for larger cargo planes which fly low and are very noisy.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,,

At 10:45 pm I caught sight of a VERY bright orange light out of my periferal vision while sitting at the computer indoors.  All of my interior lights were on so this light was very, very bright.  Airplanes and stars never grab my attention like this object did.  The light was north of my home and approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.  The wind was gusting to around 25 mph at the time and it was overcast.  I stood up from the computer, dimmed the lights and went to the window to watch a tightly grouped collection of fast blinking lights that surrounded a very bright orangish light that would extinguish and re-light every two or three seconds.  The fast blinking lights were orange, red, blue, green, yellow and white.  They blinked so fast that it almost appeared like a giant scintillating star.  This object was low enough over the horizon to gauge it's movements in reference to trees which were backlit by Jackson, Michigan's orangish glow.  This weird collection of lights would rock back and forth in the air and seemed to rise and fall dramatically.  After approximately five minutes swinging, ascending and descending in the air it lurched upward and disappeared into a cloudbank almost directly overhead.  This is the second sighting I've had in the area over the past three weeks.  On Sunday February 27th, at approximately 7:45 pm I observed two brightly lit triangular formations of lights sitting above the eastern horizon while driving south on M50 between Napoleon and Jackson, Michigan.  The two formations of lights each consisted of three bright orangish white lights.  Two lights formed the triangular base and a single light at each apex.  They sat just a few degrees above the horizon from my position and were in view for about a minute before I lost sight of them behind trees.

It was not an airplane or a military rocket so I think the object was, indeed, a UFO.  The object seemed to be a greyish mattalic color, but then it kept changing from greyish to redish matallic...and some sort of haze seemed to surround it.  It wasn't too hot, so I don't think it was a mirage.   I stared at it almost in awe...and suddenly I heard a strange sound.

This was a monumental endeavor never mind the fact that the two wheeler hauler/trailer was critically overloaded!  Since the trailer was new and had new 8 ply tires my brother decided to pass on a spare and this was a mistake.  The temperatures  during the day ran from 95 to 108 degrees  and we got baked!  A few times I told ((name deleted)) to slow down as he was pushing it and about 30 miles north of Lareto the rear right tire on the u-hauler melted. The first indication I had that something was wrong was when I heard that familiar and dreaded sound of a tire breaking down!  As soon as I felt the Ford Exloder we were in shake my brother was fighting the wheel to bring us to a pull over stop on the side of the road.  One of those gravel pit side bars that humans seem to gravitate for with a variety of reasons and intentions.  Right away I ran a mental inventory and realized we did NOT have a spare for the trailer!  Phil did a problem solution and I sat with the trailer like road kill waiting to happen and ((name deleted)) drove to Lareto to find help.  About an hour and a half later ((name deleted)) drove up with another car following him into the roadside rat trap.  ((name #2 deleted)) told us not to worry that he had been in the ""business"" for 25 years!  As he checked out our bad right tire on the trailer he told his friend to check the air pressure on the left side.  ((name deleted)) and I did not pay attention as I was sick and he could only watch so much of it. ((name deleted)) told us he would take our rim to his shop to find us a tire and fix the bent rim. This was around eight o clock to eight-thirty. For about twenty minutes ((name deleted)) and I hung out and as I was looking out into the darkness I saw spotlight come out from what I first thought was a helicopter going real fast. I said to my brother, ""Are they using a helicopter to look for illegal aliens or drug smugglers""? Thing was the light source was a square box as apposed to a round searchlight!  The light source then did a sweep over the hills lighting up some hillsides and this was about 2 to 3 miles from where we were.  Then the light source seemed to zip straight away from me and I was looking towards the north west. It the seemed to turn to the left and at that point my brother and I were yelling at each other that we had to take in every second of this.  I could just make out a slivery pinpoint that was stationary in the sky for at least 20 to 25 seconds. Then it took off and all I could see was a thin vapor trail.  However this was a vapor trail that was different from any I had ever seen.  It was heavy and dense and as it started to dissapate  it started to form a long egg shape/oval  type balloon!   It was then I noticed a shiny glint coming from the vehicle.  Almost like some had a silver knife at a camp ground and the sun reflected off it as you looked down from a switchback or peak of a mountain.  Right away I thought I was looking at some kind of inter-planetary space shuttle type vehicle!   My brother was also in a state of near hysteria as the vapor trail continued to expand and for 8 to 10 minutes it continued to expand as it dissapated.   The pin point silver object seemed to have left for a journey into space!   ((name deleted)) and I talked, ranted and raved about what we had seen and what it could be or mean.  I do know that I did see this light coming out from a vehicle that I thought at first was a helicopter but it had a square light source and ended up taking off like a space shuttle only NOT from a launching pad strapped to 3 rocket engines!   My brother and I will always be convinced we witnessed a UFO and when ((mechanic)) and friends returned they told us they had seen the ""strange"" balloon type light that lit up the sky!  They all told us they had NEVER seen anything like it before!!",2005-11-03T00:00:00,,

Both the witness and I are pilots involved in a flight training program and fear our careers as airline pilots may be jeapardized by this report.   On September 23rd, 2005 the witness was flying a small light twin aircraft (a Piper Seminole) on an IFR flight plan from Montgomery, AL to Jacksonville, FL.  The sun had already set so it was dark by this point.  Both witnesses on board the aircraft were instrument-rated pilots and were on frequency and in-contact with Air Traffic Control.  The aircraft originated in Dallas, Texas and had been attempting to outrun Hurricane Rita before it hit the Texas and Louisiana coast, so there were very few, if any, other aircraft on frequency or even airborne in the area.   Very frequently, it is normal to be one of the only, if the only aircraft on a controller's frequency later at night.  This was the case this evening, as the airlines and other traffic were being vectored or vectoring themselves well north of the gulf coast area.   The two pilots were about to enter what is an MOA or a Military Operations Area.  The name of the MOA was either the Moody 3 MOA, or the Moody 2 South MOA which are both located over southeastern Georgia, but the witness can't remember as to which one it was.  These areas are a type of airspace mainly used for military aircraft training purposes, or other types of military activity.   When one of them is active or what we call ""hot"" it is normal for aircraft to be vectored around them via Air Traffic Control.  This was not the case that night, as the MOA was reported ""cold"" by Atlanta Center after the pilots queried ATC.   It is not illegal to enter these areas, for they are not prohibited or restriced airspace.   Suddenly, prior to entering the MOA, ATC informed the pilots that their aircraft would go out of radio contact for the next 5 minutes.  This is fairly common, especially along the gulf coast during this active hurricane season when transmitters have often been hit.   Soon after radio contact was allegedly ""lost"" with Atlanta Center, the pilots both said they saw a light, like a strobe or beacon, similar to that of another airplane, not far in front of them at a distance of 3 miles or less.  As it began getting closer, the two pilots became nervous as ATC normally informs aircraft within that close of a vicinity to one another.   Suddenly, the object began to move rapidly in a way that known aircraft don't move, darting to the right, then straight up, then back left in right angles.  It got close to them, then suddenly sped away at what seemed to be thousands of miles an hour.   The pilots then conferred with one another as to whether they should try to contact Atlanta Center and ask about what they saw.  Since it seemed that their safety was at stake, they decided to make the attempt.   The following is an aproximation of what was said: (I am making up the call-sign in order to once again protect both of the witnesses identities)  Witness: ""Atlanta Center, 123 Alpha Romeo"" (short pause)  Atlanta Center: ""123 Alpha Romeo, go ahead""  Witness: ""Atlanta Center, do you possibly have any traffic up ahead of us at our 12 o'clock?"" (almost immediately and seemingly aggravated)  Atlanta Center: ""3 Alpha Romeo, negative I have nothing ahead of you.""  Witness: ""Roger, 3 Alpha Romeo""  The witnesses never saw the object again and had an uneventful duration of the flight.  They both found it peculiar that Atlanta Center would report going out of radio contact, but when asked about traffic ahead got a very rapid and aggravated response.   Upon arriving in Jacksonville, both witnesses met up with me and described the event.   After discussing it with them, we've come up with our own conclusion:  It was probably something military in nature, possibly top secret or a black-project aircraft but we can't be sure.  We also think that Atlanta Center knew it was there, and wasn't supposed to give any traffic advisories while the object passed through his airspace.   Thank you for your time, and any more info upon the event would be greatly appreciated.

This object was cigar shaped and was moving rather briskly in a S.W. direction from the N.E. sky.  It took approximately 10-seconds for this object to traverse the sky and disappear behind the treeline.  The color was black, but far darker than any shade of black we've previously seen.   It was almost ""void"" of reflectivity, so much so that it's shape was clearly dilineated against the night sky (which by comparison seemed to be dark gray).   There were no clouds in the sky, only a modest wind of about 15 mph from the N.W., perpendicular to the motion of the object.   While the object could be characterized as ""cigar shaped"" it would have to have been a pretty fat cigar as it was almost a third of the way between a basic cylinder and a football in overall shape.  The front and back ends were brighter, with a steady but dim glow.  There was no apparent sound for this object.   After it was out of sight, we scanned the sky and found an airplane as a point-of-comparison.  The plane was clearly and significantly different from the object we had just seen.  The plane's shape could be seen against the night sky, but it was lighter in color than the background.  The plane also had strobing beacons that flashed quite brilliantly.  The plane also took about 45 seconds to traverse an area across the sky that was roughly the same number of arc degrees that the ultra-black object crossed in only 10-seconds.",2005-10-11T00:00:00,36.04787185185185,-94.04453777777778

Like the light given off from an arc welder, but it was not obscure.  It was very clear intense light.  In the center the object appeared to be bigger, as the light appeared to be in a cluster.  It was very clear and intense, but it was blue in color.  I picked the object up in the south southwest sky over Farmington.  It was traveling North Northeast towards the mountain.  I stepped away from my truck and followed the object over head where I saw the below view.  I could only see white light from the bottom.  Following from behind the object was a tail in the shape of a cone.  The large portion of the cone attached to the object and the point at the end.  The cone appeared to be whit light also, but it was not as intense as the light emmiting from the front of the object.  There did not appear to be any turbulance in the cone, like it was a jet engine. The object made no noise at all.   speculate that it was approximatly 100 to 150 feet over my head.  I lost the object as it went behind my home.  My first assumption was that it would crash into the mountain just to the north of my home. I stopped to listen for any sounds of impact, but heard none. When I was able to run throuh the whole scenario again when I came home from work, I realized that I should have been able to see the object come out from the roof on the house, as the path that the object was traveling would have brought it into view again.  I surmise that the object made a turn staight East while the house blocked my view and went up the canyon and over the mountain. The speed that the object was traveling was about the speed of a plane that was gliding without any propulsion.  This is the most facinating thing that I have ever seen.

It seem to be the same object I had seen maybe two years earlier on studebaker rd in long beach around 12 midnight.  Ever since the first sighting ive been keeping my eyes open.  As I made the turn I saw the UFO and it was flying low and was extremely quiet/ hovering over some homes, some 40 feet in the air maybe higher. As I was heading east on stearns the object was parrallel to me and was heading west. I noticed there were no cars around, so i slammed on my brakes turned off my radio and rolled down the window. I heard no sound coming from the object and since there was no traffic I made a quick U turn. As soon as i made the U turn (now heading west) I was trying to intersect it to make sure it was the same object i had seen before but as I hit clark st. The object made a quick 80 to 90 degree turn and just disappeared. My vision was blocked by some trees and as I was on the corner of stearns and clark the object just vanished. It seemed like it knew what i was doing. This area is near the long beach airport and I know for a fact that this is not a place to do testing of military planes. Ive never called the l.b airport or authorities since I know they wont do anything about it but it was a triangular shaped object, black, it had some lights on each corner of the triangle and was extremely silent. This happen to be the second time i saw this object in the same area. The first time i saw this object was about 2002-2003 at around midnight Iam not to certain of the date. I was staring into the nights sky and was driving south on studebaker when all of a sudden i noticed the object dropping altitude rapidly. I figured it was a plane since the airport of long beach is so close. As the object dropped i slowed down.Since there was no traffic i completely stopped my car in the middle of the road and another vehicle traveling beside me was also slowed down but kept on going. I a stared at the object it must of been close enough to me that i could of gotten out of my car and hit it with a baseball. As I sat in my car with the windows down and looking up at the object which had to be hovering was going so slow and there was NO sound whatsoever coming out of this object. I could clearly see the details of the triangular object. It had lights on the tips of the triangle and was extremely silent.As it kept heading towards me by the time it hovered over my car for a brief couple of seconds it made a 45 degree turn and started going towards the residential homes. Thats when i made the same turn in my car trying to follow it but as I made the turn the object took off over the homes at a very very fast speed. Something a plane cant do. As i made the turn west I hit a school with a tall fence which I jumped out of my car and climbed the fence so i could get a better close view of it,I also did it just to make sure i wasnt going crazy but all i saw was the back end of object hovering over the homes at a high rate of speed and it vanished.

I saw something go across the sky at a very low altitude and at a greater distance than our office.  I would guess that it was maybe 400 yards or more away, again this was very hard to tell.  What I saw was what seemed to be a reflection off of something that was roughly about the 400 yards away. It was a reflection almost kinda like you would see if a car goes past you at night while you are standing on the side of a road watching.  What I mean is like if the city lights below this where reflecting off the side of this thing.  I could not see any shape to it just the reflection go down the side as it passed.  Speed was maybe around 80 mph if I had to guess.  There was no noise at all.  It was basically invisible except for the reflection I saw go down its side.  If I was to guess I would say maybe something military? I have heard of electro camoflage that is being tested, who knows maybe this was something like that not sure.

I see from your reports that a couplen of people saw something on New Year's Eve, however no one has reported anything for this date.  Anyway, I was walking home in Pacific Beach (more precisely, I was walking west), and in the sky I saw a little speck of whitish orange light, moving around in a random-looking way, i.e., it danced around back and forth and in loops.  I stopped to watch it, and I thought about running to go get my digital camera, but I worried that it would disappear by the time I returned.  It did not move terribly fast (its entire path was confined to a relatively small area of sky), and it had a sort of ""sputtery"" or ""jittery"" motion to it, which is to say that it did not fly smoothly like a plane does, but with a kind of shakiness.  This made me think that it may have been a meteor, but I have seen meteor showers, and what I saw was different: it did not move nearly as fast, nor did it streak in those do as those do.  Rather, it moved around in an odd little path for probably just over a minute and seemed to diminish in brightness and size as it did so, until I really couldn't follow it anymore, it was so tiny.  Again, this makes me think it was a meteor or some other object that was burning up in the atmosphere -- but do meteors move in such seemingly random paths?  Is there some way to check meteor activity for that date?  Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD))",2005-06-20T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

I was driving home from work along the south frontage road that parallels I-70 near Troy, IL.  It was approx. 0400 in the am and I was traveling east at a speed of 35-40 mph.  I always drive slowly at that hour since it is prime time for certain wildlife on the roads (deer, raccoon, possums, rabbits).  There were only a few cars and trucks on the interstate and my husband was following in a vehicle behind me.   As I hit the crest of a hill offering a panoramic view, my peripheral vision caught sight of a very bright white light in the north sky to the left and ahead of me.  It was moving slowly toward the south and would eventually intersect the interstate and the frontage road on which I was traveling.  I could not see the craft at this time, only the bright light as it moved through the dark sky.  At certain times of the month, this is a flight path for Lambert airport in St. Louis, Mo (I travel this road frequently).  I assumed it was a plane and drove on, returning my full attention to the road.  A couple more minutes up the road the white light again attracted my interest.  It now seemed somewhat larger in the sky, since we were closing distance.  I could now notice both a red and a blue light beneath the level of the white one.  The red light was blinking.  I realized that the craft had to be too low in the sky for a plane and that it was traveling too slowly.  I remember thinking that it must be a helicopter, but my brain did not seem to fully accept this idea because the relative sizes (positions) of the lights seemed to indicate that they were not lined up in a lateral fashion but instead were indicative of greater depth.  (Amazing how fast a brain can assess and conclude!)  But then it must be a helicopter, what else could it be?  I returned my attention to the road.  I came to the place where a side road joins the two frontage roads and the interstate overpass crosses above.  I am always very careful here.  This is a spot where accidents tend to occur due to a very short visual field created by the interstate embankment. Suddenly and surprisingly, I caught sight of lights above my van and to the right.  There was a large craft hovering above the houses near the end of the residential lane just ahead and to the south.  There was illumination from nearby street lights.  Regarding its width, it seemed to stretch across at least two roofs.  It was grey in color and triangular in shape.  Judging by the houses and the trees it was only about 400 or 500 feet above the ground.  It was not moving at this time.  My windows were up, the radio was off.  You can easily hear the sound of cars as they pass on the interstate, but this craft was completely silent.  I was trying to lean over the steering wheel to look up and still look ahead to avoid going off the road.  There was no shoulder to pull off on so my viewing of the craft at this close range was intermittent and consisted of short bursts.  I remember thinking, “Is that military?”  (This sighting occurred approx. fifteen miles from Scott Air Force Base.)  It reminded me of the pictures I have seen on TV of stealth bombers, but my understanding is that they cannot hover.  It also reminded me of harrier jets, and although they can hover I thought they emitted an enormous amount of noise.  I was bewildered and trying to reach the cell phone in my purse to call my husband and ask if he was seeing this too.  This juggling proved too difficult and I decided to continue on and stop at the church parking lot several hundred yards ahead.  I said, “Did you see that?” To which he responded, “See what?”  (My husband does not generally look at the sky and additionally was tired from a long day at work.  He did not see the craft as he was preoccupied watching my taillights, assuming that I had come to a near-stop due to an animal ahead on the roadway.)  I pointed to the craft still hovering but having shifted just slightly south.  From this new vantage point, the craft itself was too far to be clearly seen but the red and blue lights were visible beyond a deciduous tree line (no leaves on the trees).  No other lights were noted from this angle.  My husband could see the lights and was in agreement on the estimation of height.  Then the craft began to move southwesterly over the fields of a rural area.  I got back in the van and we traveled along a south road with the intention of intersecting it again on the next west road so my husband could see the underside of it.  But to our amazement the craft picked up an incredible amount of speed and while we watched, disappeared rapidly into the southwestern sky past the city lights of Collinsville toward St. Louis, covering at least 20 miles in about two minutes.  From the initial sighting of the white light to the moment the colored lights of the underside were gone from sight was approx. 10 minutes duration, although direct viewing of the craft itself from underneath lasted only about 30 seconds.",2005-06-20T00:00:00,38.69179999999999,-89.9911

Now the par has two parts the screen the elevation which is depicted by a 10 degree line running across the top half of the screen ( you use this to tell the pilot how high or low he is in relation to the angle of attack for the approach to the runway) and another line (straight) depecting the center of the runway you use this to tell him if he is left or right of centerline..  so basically two targets for each plane one from each ""beam"" of radar..  Well lo and behold if the par is not painting one helluva a target ( the target size depends on how much return it is recieving) about the same id say as a c-5 galaxy.. as the radar supervisor im like wtf? i call the tower the target is at 5 miles and im like do you guys have someone shooting a ILS ( we have Instrument landing system aka big microwave sytem that lets the pilot fly his own precision approach) to the same runway and the angle of attack is similar .. Tower response we have nothing and see nothing...

Nearly a year ago, on the evening of April 8, 2004, I was standing in my backyard patio looking at the clear night sky when I observed 2 big, bright, yellowish-amber lights hanging in the southwestern sky approximately 35 degrees above the horizon.  At first I couldn't figure out which 'planets' these were being so bright and below the orbital plane of the planetary solar system. These objects were much brighter than the apparent magnitude of Venus and of course a different color. I then located ice-blue Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and maybe either Uranus or Mercury - they were all where they should have been.  Then I thought they must be 2 hovering helicopters but being that bright they would have to be very close and I should be able to hear them.  These lights never made a sound the whole time. My son, unbeknownst to me at the time, had been standing in the street in front of my house to get better reception from the cell phone as he was calling his aunt and uncle in Richland, WA.  He saw these same 2 lights climb out of the southwestern horizon (which I had not) and then stop and hover. He too was puzzled and described the phenomenon to his aunt while still on the phone.  He then walked through the house and into the back patio to tell me but as I have said, I was already watching them at that point.  As we looked, the left light only receded back down toward the southwest to approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, stopped, and hovered there for about 2-3 minutes. Then, on its way back up to join the other light, it emitted what looked like 3-4 streams of sparkling lights or projectiles that reminded me of tracer bullets or Roman candles.  For an instant, it scared me so my heart stopped as I truly thought we were under some sort of attack. (Too many war and space movies I guess!)   Now the left light had rejoined the other one and they both just hung there.   I went inside the house and got my binoculars which revealed the big, bright, amber lights, both left and right, to be actually 4 steady, separate lights on the corners of a perfect square.   These two bright amber lights, continued to hang there for about 4 more minutes then the left light began climbing up the sky until it was directly overhead (12 o’clock position).  It moved at about the apparent speed of a satellite but it was obviously no satellite as it was a hell of a lot closer, bigger, and brighter.   When it got to the 1 o’clock position on its northeasterly course, the lights instantly disappeared as if being turned of by a switch.   When I went back to look for the right light, it was gone.  My son said he had watched it depart on a course 90 degrees to the other light, in a northwesterly direction.  He said it appeared to drop a couple of tiny red dots vertically downward and then it too suddenly disappeared.  Neither my son, who is a college graduate, nor I was able to explain this phenomenon to each other. In the ensuing days, I scoured the newspapers and watched the TV news but not a peep mentioning anything about this.   I asked several fellow pilots in my flying club, and after some joking at my expense of course, none had observed anything as they were inside their houses that night.  I also called the Traffic Control Tower at Buchanan Field in Concord, CA several days later and no one had observed it.   What really boggles my mind is the fact that in a large metropolitan area of several million people,  you’d think at least a few people would be outside their houses looking up at the night sky to see this phenomenon, and knowing this could not be explained as ‘conventional aircraft, satellites, or planetary behavior’, would therefore report it to someone.  Of course, neither did I, officially, until now.   This has been on my mind for almost a year now, and it wasn’t until I saw the Peter Jennings Special on UFOs a few days ago that I learned of your site for reporting this sort of phenomenon.  So here I am and now you have it.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,,

Both my husband and I tried to watch it as long as possible and even kept an eye on it as we were driving away.  We noticed that when it spun long ways slowy, it would also stop at once parrallel to the Earth's ground again.

We made our friends in the other cars stop to see it and they all said it was a weather balloon. None of us know what a weather balloon looks like, and if it was, it wouldn't be able to move and stop like it did.

April 24, 2004, in Marietta, Georgia, was a beautiful, sunny, spring day.   At about 4:30pm, I was lying on my bed, just looking up through my bedroom window (which has no blinds or shades), at the clear blue sky and a few puffy white clouds.  All of a sudden, I noticed TWO PINK TRIANGLES way up in the clouds.  I could not judge the distance, but it was very high...high enough for airplanes to fly, as I have seen many times before...but I knew these were not airplanes!   Continuing to watch the TWO PINK TRIANGLES as they moved in close proximity to each other...I was trying to figure out what they were.  I knew that they were not balloons...as they did not move with the wind...nor were they kites...which could easily be blown about as well.  These either stayed stationary, or they moved in unison to the left, then right, and then up.  Finally, they disappeared into the clouds. Immediately phoning my cousin in Darlington, PA to report what I had just witnessed, a short time later while still on the phone, I was astonished to see the TWO PINK TRIANGLES reappear in the sky.  I observed them again, for about 5 or 10 minutes, and then they disappeared into the clouds, never to be seen again. Having seen many programs on TV about UFO's, I knew that what I observed were very unusual.  Never before had I heard of a UFO described as a PINK TRIANGLE.  But I knew what I had seen was NOT an airplane, balloon, kite, or anything else I have ever seen before.  I felt in my gut that what I had seen was very definitely a UFO!   I am a Doctor of Chiropractic and I live and practice in Marietta, GA.  I have no history of hallucinations, nor of seeing UFO's.  My professional education has taught me to make objective observations of scientific evidence, and not to jump to conclusions until all the facts are in.  However, I am quite convinced that what I observed on April 24, 2004 were, in fact, TWO PINK TRIANGLES THAT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN UFO's.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,33.96188745901639,-84.51021319672131

I was flying back from North Carolina to Arizona on July 21st 2005.  The flight took off around 5pm EST from Raleigh Durham on America West.  I think the flight number was 844.  About 3 hours into the trip (I assume maybe somewhere around Texas area but I really dont know for sure) I saw an object out the window.  The sun was still up and there were scattered clouds.  My plane was flying arounnd 33,000 feet.  This object was above a section of clouds (not in the clouds but a cloud bank formed a backgroud).  So the object was definately not on the ground and if I had to guess I would say it was maybe 1/3rd the distance to the ground from us so it was flying at about 20,000 feet.  The object appeared as a cylinder shape, its surface was slighlty reflective it sort of appeared metallic but it was at an extreme range to me so I dont know for sure.  The objects color was sort of a light/pale orange color or possibly light biege.  The color was uniform across the object.  I saw it for around 10-20 secs.  The object appeared to be static.  It did not move and seemed to be fixed in the sky appearing to move at exactly the same speed as all of the surrounding clouds.  The other thing that was very odd was that unlike a plane that would fly in a horizontal positon the cylinder was vertical.  If it was a plane it should have been moving downward at a rapid speed, if it was climbing Im not sure it could have kept that up for 10-20 secs and in either case it didnt appear to be moving at all.  The distance was too great for me to descern any details like wings, designs, etc.  It just looked like a very small cylinder or possibly a cigar shaped object.  There were no visable ballons or anything like that above it.  Most everyone else was watching a movie on the plane with the windows closed so I doubt anyone else saw it.  The pilots probably saw it.  I was sitting on the left side of the plane (if one is sitting down facing foward towards the front of the plane I was on the left side).  I am a systems engineer for a major semi-conductor company and I was flying on a business trip that day.  I am also an amatuer astronmer and I have spent a lot of time looking at the sky.  I dont know what this thing was but I am pretty confident it was not a standard plane.  It could have been something the government was doing or it could be something else.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,,

It was a full moon and there was a large cloud formation just blocking the moon, but the upper side of the cloud formation was illuminated by the moon.  It was a great image and we got out and my son started photographing the cloud formation with his camera phone.  The cloud formation resembled a developing thunderhead.  I'm a fairly avid sky watcher and I noticed an object moving from left to right across our line of sight as my son was photographing the cloud formation.  The object was illuminated an unusual amber across it's length and there were no blinking lights as a plane or helicopter would have, and the longer I watched it the more obvious it became that it was, in fact, unidentifiable.  There were no wings on the object.  It was travelling a path not normally taken by local air traffic at the altitude it was at.  I wish I could give an altitude, but I'm not well versed in that.  It was at an altitude I normally see the business class of Lear jets travelling at as they leave the airport on the east side of Columbus.  However, this object was flying a straight horizontal path with no deviation in altitude during the time I observed it.  There was commercial aircraft visible in the region higher up, but nothing close to this object.  I commented, ""That's not a plane.""  My son replied, ""What is that?"" He then took a picture of it and commented how weird it was.  Some of what appears as a faint outline of a series of trees in the background at left is, in fact, the clouds we were looking at.  The object was in the foreground of the cloud formation we were initially looking at.  The object is just about to move out of our view to the right.  The light in the foreground is over my garage.  There is a Magnolia tree visible and the living space is to the right of the garage.  My son's laptop had to go in for service, and it took awhile to get this photo back from him.  I document our hours so I'm positive of the date.  The time is accurate to +/- 15 minutes.  Strange, the object appears sightly different than what I visually observed, and looks closer than I recall.  It was better lit visually I also recall.  It's entire side circumference was a dull amber glow, with a distinct dark border on top and bottom when I first observed it.  The trajectory was roughly east to west.  There was no sound evident.  I'll foward the image exactly as I have received it from my son.  Nothing has been done to alter the image.  The camera takes very good images, but a little blurring is evident in the foreground, which may have also affected the clarity of the object. itself.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

However looking more closely I notice it was quite a large type star and the colour was not constant as it seem to be changing.

The distance of these lights from the sighting location is indeterminate. This is the first sighting of unusual lights after 4 years of amateur atronomy on almost every clear night.

On the evening of 2/24/05 at exactly 20:02 ( we received a phone call at 20:03 so the time was exact) I was saying good bye to a business friend in front of my house in Bellevue, WA.  He had just unlocked his car so my eyes were diverted then I heard him say ""What the heck is that"" and so I looked up to where he pointed.  I first thought it might be a shooting star but then noticed that the object appeared to be  a line of stars or lights (maybe a comet).  When my eyes focused more closely I noticed that the lights were in the shape of a large V. The lights were of the same intensity as the stars around.  However the lights moved together at great speed and as one object.  There appeared to be four or five lights per side of the triangle.  When my eyes focused on moving object for a second or two, I then noticed that the object had to have great size and mass and was also moving at great speed.  The object was first observed at a nearly overhead position and moved from overhead to the east and into the dull hazed light of the full moon.  I will mention that the sky was completely clear and no clouds.  It was also a complete full moon.  The object moved east and faded into the moonlight within 10 to 15 seconds.  We were so excited.  I am 53 years old and a gemologist for over twenty six years.  My eyes are attuned to visual comparisons of light and color on a daily basis.  I know what I saw was not a common plane or object. I am certain that we saw something quite unusual and if not very lucky to view it when we did that it would be very hard to view on a normal basis.  This is because the object blended into the night sky so well and the lights that formed the object matched the starlight intensity exactly.  This object was built to be difficult to see.  I estimated that the object traveled over the Seattle area from vertical sighting to the East in 10 to 15 seconds so the entire time over Seattle area was no more than 45 seconds to a minute.  I also live where commercial jets do travel over my house from the south to north route.  The object was 4 to 6 jets in width on each side of the triangle.  That is to say at normal viewing it would take 8 to 12 commercial jets in  width to produce an object that was of the size of the triangle we saw.  Also the lights were white/whitish and NOT blinking green or red.  I do know what this was but I have seen satellites, but not from my house and these lights on the craft were much brighter.  The commercial jets that I see are commonly very easy to hear also.  This object produced no sound.

My 4 year old was sick laying on the couch, My wife was holding our 4 months old in her arms sitting in the easy chair. She was facing the TV with her right side to the windows.  I looked out the windows and noticed a ball of light that was not moving but just sitting in the sky. I'm used to seeing airplanes flying in the sky out that same window. We are really close to McCord airforce base and Seatac airport.  The thing that caught my attention was that it was not moving but sitting still way above east Tacoma on the oppisite side of the water. It had a white light but also a orangiesh color. I ran and grabbed my digital camera and took a blurry shot of it. I sat and watched it for about 10 seconds. Untill it slowly faded away. At this time planes were flying in the foregraound and in the air.  I told my wife and she remained sittig n the easy chair holding the baby. I said that was wierd and sat down to watch the rest of the show.  About 5 minutes later I saw it again. This time I ran and grabbed our digital video camera. I took footage of it for over a sec. It then did that same thing that it did earlier and fadeed out of the night sky. I did not have my tripod so I went and grabbed it and but the canera on it. I told my wife ""If I see that again I'll be trippin!!"" Soon it appeared again. I got the camera and took about 2 seconds of footage of it untill it faded away again.  I have digitazed the footage and will send you a version of the full thing.  I'm not sure what is going on right now in our times and world but I feel that something is different. I've also ran into a lot of Nikola Tesla information lately and find that to be very interesting. He may hold a link to how this is acheivable.  I hope the footage is helpfull.  A.I.

Sometimes, they can appear stationary when they are headed straight towards you.  There were several other aircraft in other parts of the sky, all clearly moving in various directions. But this light remained stationary in relation to the moon, which was visible to the east.  I and my passengers coud see it all the way into the Washington DC area.  It seemed much too bright and large to be a star or planet, but I didn't really give it much more thought.  However, this morning, same time, same route, it was there again.  The moon was lower in the sky than it was two days ago, but the light was in the same place.  This time, I paid more attention to it.  While I waited at the commuter lot, I watched this light closely.  Ever so often, it seemed to move up, down, and side to side, very slightly, and very rapidly. I guess you'd call it a barely discernable wobble.  Coincidentally, one of the riders from two days before got in, and I called his attention to the light.  As we sat waiting for another rider, we both watched it, and he observed it wobble.  I've seen bright lights in the sky before, and never really thought much about it.

It seemed very peculiar. I even looked away and when I looked back it was still floating slowly with no noise or lights. It was not a large air craft, but the color seemed clear or iridescent. The most vivid thing was how it just disappeared. It wasn’t like a blink. It was more like a smoke, fading away slowly. I have never seen any thing ever in my life like it. It’s hard to explain how incredible this was. I’m a normal person, married suburban life with two kids. I’ve never seen anything move like that and just disappear.

I looked straight up above me and did not see anything at first and I finally made out an object that looked like a huge boomerang.  It was black and pretty much blended into the night sky.  The only way I could make out the shape was because on two ends it had these tiny red faded lights and the tip of it had a tiny white light.  I have great eyesight and they were hard to see.  The object was higher than the incoming planes so there was no chance of it crashing into them, but not much higher.  It was moving westerly towards the ocean almost towards the airport at what seemed about 40 to 50 mph.  It had to have shown up on radar at the aiport. There's no way anyone would have seen it on the road unless they were in it's path, outside and looking up at the night sky because it looked like part of sky. Also, Ive seen what the stealth bomber looks like and seen it fly (which is pretty fast) and this thing would make the stealth look like an ant, it was slower and it was a bit of a different shape.

How the sighting happened: I went out on my back patio at 12:02 AM PST to have a smoke and noticed a very bright light in the night sky. Originally I kind-of assumed it was a star but after watching this object for a couple of minutes I realized that stars do not change color from an extremely bright white/halogen blue to a brilliant red and seemingly every color in between... this thing was amazing and SO BRIGHT!! I ran inside and grabbed a monocular that I have and ran back outside to 'get a closer view'... what I saw when I looked through the monocular was a little blurry at first (the monocular doesn't have the best range) but after stabalizing my arm and focusing on the object, the lights seemed to be shaped like a triangle (many small lights making up a triangle shape) and the object was kind-of pulsing. I was in dis belief!! This couldn't really be happening!! I always watch the sky and until this night... I have never seen anything that I couldn't associate with some type of known object (star, plane or helicopter). After I was able to see some shape to the lights, I attempted to contact a friend who lives about 2 miles from me (I felt it was very important to have another witness - especially from a different angle then my view)... but he did not answer...  I watched this object for 1 hour and 21 minutes until it eventually moved behind a building and was no longer visible to me. During the last 8 minutes of the sighting, the object literally completely disappeared from visibility for about 2 seconds at a time on four occasions!! I would describe it as either rotating and therefore the lit side of the triangle was not visible or the lights on this object simply dimmed out completely... but the object was never completely dark for more then about two seconds. I verbally said ""OH MY GOD"" when the object first disappeared from sight completely and then re-appeared two seconds later... it was absolutely unbelievable!  I took 5 images with my Nikon Coolpix 3.2 Mega Pixel digital camera but only one of the photos came out somewhat decent (attached to this report).  I REALLY want to know if any other people saw this object and what thier description is... my monocular isn't the best so hopefully the triangle shape I saw was not a trick of lighting or caused by the distance.  Thank you for being here to take this report!! I feel absolutely blessed to have been a witness to this amazing object!!",2006-03-11T00:00:00,33.666209249999994,-117.91191325

Walking up my parking lot stairs with my trash, I saw a bright yellow light (like a plane's headlight) coming toward me (moving southwest). The altitude appeared somewhere between a prop plane's and a jet's cruising altitude. I was a bit curious because no plane should be on that path since the airport is southeast of me. Also, I saw no flashing marker lights. I stopped and stared at the light waiting for it to go over my head. After about 1 minute of watching, an incoming 737 flew by from the west. Jokingly in my head I thought, ""they're going to hit each other"". Then, right as the jet passed just in front of the light, the light quickly backed up! After the plane was gone, the light began moving east as if after the jet. A bit worried, ""I called for my wife to get the camera"".  After about 30 seconds, the light appeared to bulge twice its size like a slow explosion. When my wife came up with the camera I tried to snap a photo, but it was just too dark for a good picture. Then the light, continuing to speed up toward the east, dropped two small lights from it burning out after about 3 seconds. These small lights were about a 10th the size of the light and look like it would if someone dropped road flares from a hot air balloon. The light then disappeared above the clouds. The duration was just over 4 minutes. At that altitude it would be about ½ mile the light backup up, and in only  1 or 2 seconds! We thought it might be a weather balloon on fire, but I can't explain the quick speed it had when it reversed! About 10 minutes afterward, about 4 military sounding helicopters flew overhead heading east. I hope that was a coincidence.

We await photocopied materials from the witness.  PD)) On April 17th , 1966, one of the greatest UFO chases occured With police  in NE Ohio and Western PA At 0510 hrs on April 17th, 1966 2 Portage County Deputies in one car were dispatched to drive towards the Summit County line to check out a call from Summit County Sheriff's Dept. about a strange light or craft in the sky, heading east down Route 224 toward Portage County.  While enroute they stopped to check on what appeared to be an abandoned car with antennas and full of ""radio & electronic equipment"". It had a strange emblem on the door in the shape of a diamond with lightning bolts and other symbols. While checking out the car, a large luminous object arouse from beyond the north bank of the State Route, and hovered above them. Both deputies described it as ice-cream cone shaped, with the 'ice cream' being solid and the 'cone', pointing down, seeming to be mostly light. Both instinctivle jumped pack into the patrol car. The object then started moving east down Route 224 toward Atwater Center, and they started following it. They also called their radio operator who told them to keep it in sight.  Another deputy, in a single unit car was in Atwater at the intersection of Waterloo Rd & Stroup Rd., and called to say he saw it, it was about 800 feet up and the ""cone"" of light beneath it appeared to be blue to purple in color. He heard no sound but noticed static on his radio until the object had passed several miles to the east. The 2 persuing deputies in car P-13 followed it east on 224 to the Deerfield circle, then SE on State Route 14. At the dinner on the circle, a night cook & waitress both saw the object and attempted to hide behind a car in the parking lot. As the object proceeded down Route 14 across the corner of Mahoning County and into Columbiana County, 2 Salem patrolmen were sent to the edge of town to see what all the radio calls were about. They describe seeing a bright object, about 1000 feet up going from their left to right (or, as they were looking north, west to east), and it made no noise, but had a trail of bluish colored smoke or light trailing behind & below it. They watched it for a few minutes and listened to the deputies on the radio, but the object veered east following Routr 165 and did not enter Salem city. After it had been out of their sight for 15 to 20 minutes, they both saw & heard jets, 2 or 3, travelling at a high rate of speed from the northwest heading south then turning east as if folloing the object. There was the Youngstown 459th Troop Carrier Wing, Youngstown AFR located in that direction.  As P-13 approached the intersection of Route 165 and State Route 14,  a Patrolman from the city of East Palestine saw the object and had been listening to the radio. He pulled out behind P-13 and joined the chase. Both cars now stated that the speed was between 85 & 105 MPH. As they approached the county line, the fell well behind the object a couple of times, and it would seem to slow down to 'wait' for them. They crossed into PA where Route 14 becomes Route 51 and continued SE. A officer partoling at Conway PA saw the object coming and went down to Route 65 (51 becomes 65) to see if it was an aircraft having trouble. Being from PA his radio did not pick up the Ohio unit's chase. As the object shot overhead, he saw the apporaching Ohio cars. The object came to a hover over Harmony Township, and all 4 officers sat at a gas station to discuss what was going on. Then they heard the jets. One came in and flew over the object, while the other 2 started circling around. The Conway officer called his dispatch and asked him to call the Pittsburgh airport to see if they had any activity going on. Then as the first jet turned to make another pass over the object, the objects 'cone of light' turned orange and it shot straight up into the air, and dissapeared in a couple of seconds. All 4 of the officers heard a high pitched winning sound, when it changed color, and their hairs all stood up as it shot up. Also all of their cars shut off at the same instant, though they all easily restarted when tried. The Conway radio operator called back and said some military man at the airport wanted to talk with them. They went to a nearby police station (Rochester) and took the call. The Rochester officer stated that the man said they had scrambled jets, but another man, a Colonel, as he identified himself, came on and said that there were no jets scrambled, and that they had probably been chasing the moon.  When the Portage deputies returned to Ravenna (where their HQ & jail was) they were told to sit tight. A Maj. Quintanilla, USAF was driving up from Dayton to interview them. In the mean time the Sheriff started his own investigation into the events. In all, of all the officers involved (2 Portage deputies, 2 Salam patrolmen, 1 East Palestine patrolman, and 1 Conway Police officer), 6 of them, were interviewed by a detective from Portage County, then by Maj. Quintanilla, a Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (RET), William B. Weitzel (NICAP), Prof. William Powers of Northwestern University and Director of the Dearborn Observatory, and various newspaper reporters. The Detective that investigated this found elevated levels on his CD survey meter, and scourched earth in the field where the deputies claim it rose out of. And there were the photos taken by a local police chief (From Mantua) which were discounted by the ""official"" investigators, that this experienced detective found compelling. And there are the recorded tapes from the interviews, that never made it into the official government investigation because the Sheriff wanted his to be an independant investigation and not to come to the attention of the military - which it did not.  I was a deputy at Portage County Ohio from 1985 - 1989, and came across these files while cleaning up old files for removal to the new facility. I was to dispose of all the case material that was not related to open cases or those involving deaths of violence. But this was just too good to  throw out. Much of the material is on the NICAP web site, just search under Portage County Ohio UFO Chase. However, what I found was the independant investigation the Sheriff had done, and which was never turned over to the investigators - at the request of the Sheriff himself. So I have witness statements made on the Sheriff office's report forms, the detectives report, and material never before examined by UFOlogists, or skeptics. This was a significant case in 1966, and the chase seen in ""close Encounters"" were the UFO goes over the lead actor's pick-up and it stalls, and as the object leaves it is being chased by police cars, was inspired by this very case. The Portage officers followed the object for 86 miles. It was chased by 6 police officers, seen by many civilian witnesses, was chased by Air Force jets, and resulted in 3 of the officers leaving the profession, 2 quit, one was fired and he got a divorice as well - all because of this chase.  I am preparing to include this in a book,  with all of the new details, reports, and the evidence which was never before released, along with some other interesting events from Eastern Ohio / Western PA. But in the mean time I am sending copies of the documents and tapes to the UFO center for their examination. ((CORRESPONDENCE WITH SOURCE OF REPORT)) Dear Mr. Davenport:   Thank you for your prompt reply. The information in the material is interesting, and I would be glad to put it into report form. Some of the material I have is indeed in the NICAP database (Just do a search there under Portage County and you get lots of hits), but the vast majority of it came from the Sheriff's Office report, which again were in the detective's files, and according to deputies who participated in the investigation the material was never given to Maj. Quintanilla or to Mr. Keyhoe or the NICAP folks - it was just locked away in the detective division's files. The taped material is from reel-to-reel tapes of the interview of the 2 portage deputies involved (interview by Major Quintanilla of Project Blue Book), a Salem police officer and East Palestine police officer (both by Portage County Detectives), and some material that I cannot make out what it is. There are police reports, the original NICAP report, and some interview transcripts of 4 witnesses - all not in the NICAP data base. I did email NICAP, but was told that it is not an ""active site"" anymore - just a data repository. I could attach these to some emails, or better yet I could fax them if you have a number. As for the tapes, I have copied most onto cassette format, and can easily mail you a copy for you to keep.    These files were not considered an active case, so I believe legally it would be OK to publish this stuff. I will, however, ask my lawyer to be sure I am not breaching any confidentiality rules (it was not a solved case either, so it had not ever been placed in the public domain file at the Sheriff's Office; and I want to be sure that I am not going to be liable for slander in any way). The telling of the story back in 1966 led to one deputy involved loosing his job, getting divorced, and he lived in poverty for most of the intervening years - so mentioning him again in a public forum MAY be a problem. At worst, you may have to withhold my identity until I get these questions answered. But I will get this stuff together in the next few days and either email or fax the documents, and mail you the tapes.   Thanks again for your fast reply.

It was like brushed stainless steel, shaped like two pie pans put together with no lip and as it passed over it was tipping from side to side.

We were watching the skys and out from the southeast moving northwest, we observed an aircraft with 3 colored lights, moving in a silent slow pace within what I was assuming normal jetliner height.  With the breeze coming from the same direction we saw the aircraft but, we never heard it.  Within 10 seconds after seeing the object the triangular patterened non-blinking lights on the craft turned off.  We both thought this was quite unusual and I began to track the craft with my right hand index finger extended under my right eye to judge the speed.  Approximately 7 seconds had elapesed and we heard the afterburner of a jet aircraft, with its light flashing, persuing directly behind the first craft.  I would say within 5 seconds of sighting the jet aircraft, the lights of the first craft turned back on and, to both myself and my friend's amazement, 2 more identically lighted aircraft zipped in on both sides of the lead aircraft making an arrowhead formation.  The three aircraft started to speed up and then make an extraordinary sharp 90 degree turn to the north/northeast. After the turn there level of speed was unbeleivable.  We raced to the right side of the house down the driveway and we saw all three aircraft dissapear within seconds.  We raced to the back yard where we saw the persuing jet just making it to the point where the three craft had meet.  The speed was just incrediable, in a blink they were gone.

We were about 2-3 miles or so NE of Camp Horno On a night firing range where we were scheduled to do a familarization fire on a 200 meter course at 1/2 size silhouette targets using M-16 Rifles with Starlite scopes mounted on them. There was a 1st Lt., a 1st Sgt.,and a Cpl.(troop handler) in charge of the training. Three squads of Marines were lined up behind three bench rest positions and there were three Rifle and Starlite Scopes to be used for the firing.  It was just getting dark enough to shoot when one of the Marines in my squad called me to the front of the line and pointed with his finger to what appeared(with the naked eye ) to be a star in a northerly direction just above the horizon. It looked like it was approximately 1-3 miles away.The ""star"" appeared to be changing colors like the twinkling effect of a star that you might see on any given night. The weather was clear and the stars were out and was providing good ambient light to enable us to see astonishing detail as we viewed what was vey plainly a saucer craft that was hovering slightly above a small mountain peak in the distance. Using the Starlite Scope(1X or 2x,), the craft appeared quite close. It was a classic saucer shape,dark in color, like black graphite,not shiny; similar to what the Stealth Aircraft of the 90's looked like. There were no visible landing gear,or other protuberances of any kind, nor were there any apparent ""hatches"" or doors, entrances etc. visible.  The most noticible thing about the saucer was the five portholes and the bright light eminating from them,and the turret (not dome), that was slowly rotating counter clockwise. The portholes were an estimated 20 feet apart, and appeared to be tinted.  The portholes were eminating bright light in various colors; red,blue green, amber(or yellow), and white.  The source of the light was a very powerful beam emitter similar to a brillant light house beacon, and appeared to be stationary in the approximate center of the craft. The twinkling effect seemed to be due to the revolving of the turret which caused the tinted portholes to eminate the various colors described;however,through the scope we could not only clearly see the different colored portholes. We could see through them into the interior of the craft as well.  The interior of the craft was consistent in symmetry to the shape of the craft's outward apparence.  The walls were curved, rounded and the floor was flat but the interesting fact was that there was no visible control center; no consoles, instruments,desks, chairs, or items,objects or property --nothing at all. We could only see into the right side of the craft; perhaps 49% of the interior space from our angle of observation.  After about 5-10 minutes the craft went down behind the peak and stayed there about 5 minutes.  Just about the the time we were ready to start firing, the craft rose back up above the peak.  A short time later two more of the saucers,identical in appearance to the first, rose up, one on each side of the first craft, only lower in the sky, forming a triangular shaped formation. All three of the saucers moved slowly accross the sky to the East and then stopped. The first saucer started moving now SE at an increasing rate of speed until it reached a ""pivot-point"" and shot off in a reverse angle,of about 45% to the west at an incredibly fast speed; much faster than the military jets of the day(F-4 Phantoms and A-6 Intruders). When the craft hit the atmosphere  the front of it starting giving off tremendous sparks and a tail of fire like a comet 3-4 times the length of the saucer, trailed behind it. About 30 seconds later it was out of sight. The outher two craft repeated the same manuever and disappeared at the same point in the sky.  During the observation of these saucer craft no noise was heard coming from them at any time. The area that they were in, while on or near the ground, was in a restricted area, possibly an artillary impact area. The craft displayed speeds of travel that were far in excess of any known aircraft in existence then or now and performed turning manuevers that were, according to my knowledge never seen before and even now years later.  The technological capability displayed by these craft I believe far exceeds anything I know to exist on earth.  As a group we did not talk about what we saw since we were seriously concentrating on our training which was preparing for Vietnam. After the last saucer was gone, one of the Marines asked our Lt. if he was going to report the incident. He replied: Do you f---ing think I'm crazy ?

After about an hour or so, after we had chatted and sung ourselves out, I layed back and was looking up at all the constellations. The big dipper was directly above me and I remember looking at it for about 5 minutes, not noticing anything odd, when all of a sudden one of the stars in its handle shot off at a high speed in an eastward direction, stopped, shot off again in a nothern direction and disappeared. Needless to say my neighbor and I were stunned. The thing that amazes me to this day was how well the object disguised itself. I knew the big dipper handle only has three stars but I didn't think anything of the fourth because it was spaced perfectly between two others, was sized perfectly, and was twinkling like the other stars. Nothing looked unordinary until it took off. Til this day I like to think that it waited for me and my neighbor to look up and conentrate before it took off.

I don't remember the exact date but know it was winter and during the one year period I dated the passenger in my car during the sighting. I was driving northeast on I-43 in Wisconsin from the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater via East Troy and heading to a restaurant in the suburbs of Milwaukee. This section of the highway is ""in the middle of nowhere"" and quite dark with only farm houses and the stars for illumination. You would see another car maybe every minute or two. The girl I was dating at the time, who attended UWW, was the passenger.  As we drove on I-43, we noticed directly ahead, maybe 5-10 miles distant, a single white spotlight heading towards us at a low altitude, as if it was a helicopter flying low with a bright spotlight on it, but the light was only aimed straight ahead - not sweeping the ground. The light was moving towards us as we drove towards it, and it was also following the highway - but in the opposite direction. As we got closer more details revealed themselves, and we could now discern three lights, a red blinking on one ""wing-tip"" and either blue or green blinking on the other, with the white light in the center-front edge. We now thought it was an airplane, due to the light pattern, but were curious as to why it was so low and flying very slowly. As it got closer yet (within a mile?) we could see more and more lights in a ""V"" shape and began to think it might be an advertising blimp. When we were moments away from driving under the aircraft, we could see all of the details. I was a huge (300' wide?) bommerang shaped craft. It was a dark color, and the shape could only be ascertained by it's blotting out of stars, it's slightly different shade of black from the night sky, and a small amount of residual glow on it's surface from it's own lights. All of the visible lights were on the front leading edge of the object. There were the previously mentioned red and green/blue blinking lights on each wingtip, the white spotlight-type light shining forward from the point in front of the boomerang, and many, many small christmas tree-like white lights along the leading edges of both wings and filling the spaces between the three principle lights. These white lights were all evenly spaced from each other. My recollection is there were maybe 25 or so of these tiny white lights giving shape to the front edge of the boomerang shape. At this point we knew we were seeing something extraordinary.  As we came underneath it I pulled to the left hand shoulder of I-43 and slowed to a stop. We both opened our doors and leaned out of the car. The craft had stopped directly over us! I turned off the engine and our lights, the craft was completely silent and hovering right over us. If you took your arms and put them straight over you and at 45 degree angles, that is how much of the sky it took up - enormous. After maybe a minute it dawned on us that if it was stopped directly over us, then it was aware of us and watching us. We were torn between fear and a ""deer-in-the-headlights"" urge to keep watching. Suddenly, this huge craft started doing what I could only describe as ""tumbling"" while directly above us. The lights started moving in a way that suggested it was either majestically pirouetting in place or doing some sort of extreme manuever. This lasted about 15-30 seconds. Just as we were deciding we should get the heck out of there, the craft righted itself and started slowly, silently ""drifing"" off at about a 70 degree heading from the direction we were pointed up the highway, which means it changed it's course from following I-43 southwest to heading almost straight east across the farm fields. As it started drifting off and was maybe only a quarter of a mile away, I started slowly driving again and trying to watch it out the passenger window. As I was weaving and driving very erratically from trying to watch it, my friend said I should keep my eyes on the road and she would keep watching it. Just after she said this, a huge flash of white light, like a lightning flash or a huge flashbulb, lit up the road and countryside all around us. It was just a single flash, like a single strobe flash. I looked at my friend and started to say ""Did that come from the...?"" and she nodded yes! She said she was looking straight at it when it happened, and it looked like a searchlight was beamed at us, but only flashed instead of staying on. She didn't say exactly from where on the craft the light came.  Immediately after this light flash the craft did the next, very odd manuever - and one that makes me think there may have been two of them traveling parallel and side by side. As it drifted off, the lights would suddenly wink out entirely and simultaneoulsly come on again on an identical object flying next to it and perhaps 200 yards away. Then the second craft's lights would wink out and the first craft's lights would wink on again. This would happen perhaps every 5 seconds and the visual effect was like there was one craft that could somehow instantaeously displace itself from side to side a few hundred yards, but all the while continuing it's slow forward airspeed uninterrupted. It was a very weird sight and that night, and for perhaps a year after, I believed there was only one craft that was somehow ""displacing"" itself as it flew. It was only later that I figured out it could have been done with two craft, and that maybe the weird ""tumbling"" that I saw was the visual effect of two craft doing manuevers while one was directly above the other.  As the object got further and further away, we finally arrived at our restaurant destination about 30 minutes later. The craft was in view the entire time, but was now very far away, maybe 15-20 miles, and appeared to be circling some radio or tv towers in the far distance. We watched from the parking lot of the restaurant and pointed out the lights to some other patrons getting in and out of their cars, but at this point the lights were far away and very mundane looking and the people must have thought we were crazy. In the restaurant my friend and I compared notes and that is when many of the details of that night became cemented in my memory. We were trying to figure out what to do and I ended up calling some agency, on the lobby pay phone, but I don't remember who I called. My recollection is that it was the tower at Milwaukee's Billy Mitchell Airport, but for some reason I can't remember.  As the years have gone by I have told this story to many friends and by pure chance saw the book NIGHT SIEGE in a bookstore in St.Paul, MN over a decade later. I passed on buying it that day, but finally did in the late 90's. I am now fascinated by any TV shows I see on UFO's - especially boomerang or triangle shaped ones. I've also noted that my sighting pre-dates many of these other sightings. If this is some military craft, I can assure you that it was already in full operation in Wisconsin in the mid-70's!

It was the eighth anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing.  As darkness descended I was chatting over the fence, as it were, with a neighbor who was approaching retirement age; we often spoke like this.  Housing in our south-side neighborhood was modest single-family residences on smaller urban lots, with narrow driveways leading from backyard garages to the public street.  Lighting was typical of what one may find in an urban area in the late 1970s, that being mercury vapor street lamps.  I do not know why we each paused in our conversation, what may have attracted our eyes, but we both halted at the same point and looked skyward toward the west, and perhaps 20° above the horizon.  The best I may describe what we saw was a small group of intensely colored lights, moving steadily and in formation, east by southeasterly.  As the group of lights approached what would be due southwest of our position, they halted suddenly.  And then the fun began.  The lights no longer remained in formation.  They darted.  Here.  There.  Then there.  Changing position.  Appearing in this part of the southwesterly sky.  Then there.  The rapidity of movement, the intensity with which each craft changed direction, was absolutely startling.  The lights would dart and flash in the sky almost as if wishing to convey a message that could not be readily understood.  Then the sky again was absent of these lights.  For a moment.  They reappeared again in the formation that initially caught my eyes and that of my neighbor.  In formation they resumed the same path at the same rate of speed as when we first observed these and before their awesome light show.  There was no audible sound.  With a modest separation after the formation of lighted objects, we then observed two military jet aircraft on the same path as the formation and following at the same pace.  My neighbor and I looked at each other.  ""What the heck was that?"" we both said to the other.  ""I guess we'll never know.""",2005-07-05T00:00:00,43.051744026104416,-87.95998544176706

I was driving home from work and became aware of a small red flashing light in the sky as I left work.  For some reason I continued to look at the red flashing light in the sky which seemed to move at a similar speed to my car the whole of the trip home,(approx.twenty minutes).  In those days,I kept my car in a rented garege a couple of roads away from the road where my house was situated.  After garaging my car I looked again in to the sky and the red flashing light had gone.  I walked from the garage to my road.  As I turned the corner in to my road I observed the red flashing light stationery in the sky above the house opposite to mine. I would say at this point I was approx. 300 ft away from my house.  As I walked to my house, I continued to look at the red flashing light which seemed quite low, above the house opposite (the neighbour's roof).  As I almost reached my garden gate, the red flashing light came across the road and stopped above my head, at which point the red flashing light went out and a large green light came on which was circular in shape and approx. 20 ft in diameter. When it was a red flashing light accompanying my car, when it was above the neighbours roof and came across the road, went out there was NO outline of any sort of craft whatsoever.  That was strange because it was a clear summer's night. I remember there was only one cloud in the sky and it was not dark.  As the red flashing light was over the neighbour's roof it was perfectly still as if it were a fixture and there was no sound.  As it came across the road it moved in perfect silence and did not shake or quiver, it came across the road in a perfect silent line.  When the green light came on (the circular shape), which looked like looking up at the bottom of a saucer, (saucer shaped).  It was just like looking in to a green traffic light. It appeared to be glass. I could not see through the green light to what was behind it.  Whilst all this was happening I remember that my mouth dropped open in shock, amazement and shear awe!  I decided to rush inside my house and fetch my family out to share in this most facinating experience.  As I moved, the green light went out and the red flahing light came back on and it moved off in an upward angled direction and went behind the one visiable cloud.  I reported what I had seen to the then called Elmdon airpot, (now called Birmingham International airport.  At the time they informed me that they had a resident UFO expert who was one of the air traffic controllers.  When I reported my sighting, they said they as the crow flies, we were about two miles from the airport.  They said what I described could be done by a helicopter, but they said it was strange that on that particular night they did not have any helicopters out and said there would not have been helicopters from anywhere else. I remember that when I was on holiday and was lying on the beach I saw and heard a helicopter way up in the distance and it was tiny and loud.  What I saw was just over my head. I don't know how high.  I would say at a guess, 30ft up. Certainly not in the distance.  I then rang the airport and they wrote back, unfotunatly I do not still have the letter.  Then letter said because I did not request a radar check they did not do any checks. I rang later that evening of the sighting.  What was interesting was that when I was giving my account at work the next day, a lady who worked there and was listening said ""Oh my God"" ""last night I was sitting in my boy friend's car at the petrol station"".  ""As it was a hot night, I wound the window down and put my head out of the car to get some air"".  ""As I looked up there was a massive orange ball hanging low in the sky above the car"".  ""I immediatly shut the window and sat almost frozen in my seat, terrified"".  It has to be said that following my experience, I became facinated for several years in UFOs spending most nights in the garden looking in to the night skys, such was the strength of my experience.  It was only as I came across your web sight that I read that you publish very old sightings and therefore decided to send mine.

I was nine years old at the time, We lived in a rural area outside of Rolla, Missouri. There was this older gentleman and his wife that lived accross the street from us. He had just purchased a new Kodak One Step Camera for a trip that he and his wife were going to take, and asked some of us kids that were playing nearby at the time if he could take our pictures, he wanted to try out the camera. We were standing in his driveway waiting for the first picture to develop when this huge shadow blocked out the sunlight. I looked up and saw this object, it wasn't emitting any sound what so ever, it was like one of the smaller ones in close encounters, with lights spining all around it. This took place ""before"" I saw the movie. I still do not understand how I could see the lights so brightly, in daylight! The older gentleman, my eleven year old brother, myself, two twin boy's that were around 7 if I recall corretly and one other 10 year old girl all took off in the direction that the object headed. It wasn't going fast at all, kind of hovering and slowly moving off toward a fenced field that we picked blackberries in. We went as far as the bob wire fence and then stopped. The object just hovered in the middle of the field, about 3 stories above the ground. The older man snaped a shot of it, and my older brother wanted to climb over the fence and get closer, I stopped him. I don't remember feeling afraid, I wasn't even shocked, I just didn't want him going any closer. I was only nine, If I saw one now I would probably freak out! We all crowded in as the picture was developing, it turned out pure ""white"" Like when you try to take a photo of something too bright. Now this is all that I can remember happening, we were looking at the photo and then our backs were turned away from the field and we were heading home, the sun was going down. My brother and I went home and told our mom what had happened, my oldest brother placed a call to the radio station and asked if anyone else had reported seeing anything... he was told,""It must have been a weather balloon"" We never talked about that evening with the older man accross the street, the other children and even my brother and myself didn't discuss it until years later. He can't remember anything after looking at the photo either. To my knowledge, that is the only incident in my life of witnessing a UFO.

I recently obtained my first computer and have spent the last couple of months learning how to use it.  I have also recently discoverd coasttocoast on am radio and have been listing to it nearly every night.  Some of the stories we hear on it have brought back a flood of memories to my wife and I.   I have two stories which occurred about 24 hours apart.  I don't know if they are somehow related or just coincidence.  I think it's important to relay that I am a G.I. Brat who was raised on Air Force Bases throughout the US as well as Germany and England.   Shortly after high school I joined the Air Force where I was trained as an Air Traffic Controller.  After leaving the service, my girl friend (now my wife of 26 years) and I took a trip from Ohio to Florida.  While in route to Florida we stopped to spend the night in my van.  During the wee morning hours of Aug 26, 1978, I recall having the scariest most vivid nightmare of my entire life.  I woke up screaming at the top of my lungs, scaring my girlfriend of two weeks to death.  For years I could recall in vivid detail the majority of the nightmare.   But now, two and a half decades later, I can only remember bits and pieces.  I can recall running and hiding in the ruins of city buildings, dodging ray like beams which were fired from numerous disc shaped craft hovering over the city.  I don't remember seeing any movies prior to this dream that might have led to it, but since the dream, I've seen many war of the world type movies that always bring back little flashes of my nightmare.   My wife says I screamed for a long time after my dream, and even after I stopped, it took me quite a while to completely wake up and overcome the dream induced fear that took quite a few minutes to shake.  I remained shaken all the next day as we drove the rest of the way to Florida.   The first thing we wanted to do was see the beach.  So, at about 3 AM on Aug 27, 1978, we were laying on our backs in the sand on St. Pete Beach.  It was a beautiful totally clear night and we noted that the stars never looked so bright in Ohio.  A bright star caught my attention as it seemed to get brighter and bigger over a couple of minutes period.  We were trying to decide rather it was actually an airplane or if our eyes were just tricking us for starring so long.  It seemed to be at least five times larger than any other star in the sky, then it started.  It seemed like a normal size star had emerged from the larger one, then another.  At this point they had our undivided attention.  The smaller ones darted back and forth in erratic fashion for several minutes then darted off faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen before or since.  We talked about what we had just seen when several more darted out of what we were now calling the mother ship, and in like fashion darted around occasional disappearing as though they had gone back inside, zipping off into the distance etc.  As best we can remember there were between 6 to 8 lights that we watched come and go in no particular combinations.  Sometimes only one at a time sometimes groups of mixed numbers.  We watched in amazement for twenty minutes or more.  We can't recall rather or not any or all of the little lights had retuned to the big one, because what happend next kind of made what we had been watching insignificant.  The largest light hovering over Tampa Bay was obviously getting bigger and bigger and seemed to be comming in our direction.  What once looked like the largest star in the sky soon became the size of a dime at arms length, then a quarter.  As it grew larger it turned to a bright reddish orange.  By this time we were on our feet and my girlfriend was tugging on my arm trying to get me to leave.  It was at about this point that the quarter size light which seemed to be miles out to sea accelerated so quickly that in a matter of a couple of seconds it was directly overhead and appeared larger than the sun in the sky.  The beach lit up as though it was high noon as it soared over us.  At this point I had no choice but to run as my girlfriend was already heading for the van.  We did'nt have far to run, but by the time we got in the van, the light had disappeared inland over St Pete.  We argued over rather or not to leave for less than a minute, then we could see the reddish orange ball returning in our direction very rapidly.  As one of us was now screaming bloody murder and jumping up and down, I thru it into drive and sped away.  There is absoluteley no doubt in our minds that we saw an extremeley large space craft which sent out a half dozen or so scout ships to explore the area over Tampa Bay and the city of St Pete Fl.  What we are unsure of is rather or not the nightmare the night before and the actual sightings are somehow connected.",2005-07-05T00:00:00,27.79451493256262,-82.67515963391138

It was at first white, but upon arriving outside my bedroom window different colored lights were visible. It was a perfect sphere with a window and two heads visible (albeit slightly obscured by the bright light in the middle of the night - they did have eyes, but I don't remember anything else) looking out the window at me. They proceeded to ""speak"" to me, though there was no way I should logically have been able to hear them. They were calming and reassuring. I was not nervous at all. I wanted to go outside and see them, but before I could think that far they jetted into the starry sky and disappeared. At that young age I thought they must be angels and was afraid to tell anyone about my experience. The next morning I awoke and assumed it was all a dream. However, while playing outside I found a circular burn mark about 2 feet wide next to my window. The grass was burned in a perfect circle that oddly lasted for several years. I returned there about 5 years ago and the circle was gone. Thank you for listening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.

I was lying on my front porch at the bequest of my little son (something I wouldn't normally do at this time of year) with my son and daughter.   We were simply looking at the stars.  We saw a couple of star-like objects move across the sky and I mentioned to them that they were likely satellites and that I had seen a lot of them in my years.  We were about to go inside when I saw two blurry redish hues (I can't really call them lights because they were not as clear as that, they gave off the sort of light you would see if you were to look at a black light.) I didn't think much of it at first as there is an international airport near us.  I told the kids to look at ""that plane"" and my daughter saw it but my son did not.  Just as I said that, the ""lights"" separated by about 8 times the distance they were when we first saw them!  This indicated to me that it was not a single object but two seemingly identical objects.  The speed with which they separated was quite quick, and they then proceeded to accelerate in a south-westerly direction far more rapidly than any plane could.  The duration of this observation was approximately 12 seconds and they covered 80% or so of our field of view in that time.  We lost sight of them due to the lights of the city.

Just moved here from Fresno CA.  I have had only 2 other sightings in my life.  None of which compared at all to what I have seen on the dates of 10-05-05 through 10-07-05.  The first night, I was stuck outside of the house (keys were not made yet) waiting for my girlfriend and her family to come back home.  We live in a residential area nearby the airport, and Malstrom AFB is about 10 or so miles away.  Around 9:30 pm, I saw 2 shapes outlines under the clouds.. pitch black.. large boomerang shape, no lights, not a sound.. at arms distance, they would be about the size of my hand.  One was slightly smaller, or further away.  I have no idea how high the clouds were that night, but I felt they were close.  I didn't think much of the sighting at first.. there were lots of large birgs flying south, and I had seen them in the day time, flying in similar formation.  But I kept my eye in the sky.   About 5 minutes later, a few more went nearly overhead, no sound, same shape.. but these were not birds, or crazy hang-gliders.  They seemed to be going to slow to stay in the sky, but really how  can you know how fast they are going.  After that.. I saw something that made me scream literally... And cuss... just a bit.  A triangle shape, with two rows of lights on all sides came just over a nieghbors house, about 200 ft. down the road.. silent. Then stopped completely, and stood up as to show off... and sat for maybe 3 or four seconds.. and faded into the stars...  I am surprized I didn't get shot at for yelling like that.. my heart was pounding.. and no one else was seeing this.  After some more sightings.. and around 10:00.. the family pulled up, and I told them what I had seen. After a few jokes...haha, and unloading the car at light speed, I was out in the driveway again.  My girlfriend stayed inside. I ended up seeing ""something"" 32 times that night.  The next night about 16, and the last night, I stayed up until past 4 in the am.. and saw roughly 44 of these... altogether, a a few triangles, and even a circle shaped craft.. my girlfriend and I together have seen well over a dozen... and even her mom saw one nearby.. and well, shes not one to give in easily...  I know the airbase is nearby, but the people here say that the runway at the base is shut down, and they are flying out of the airport... Unfortunatly, I haven't seen anything since...  I believe these are not experimental.. and why would they fly them right over the city all night... ""Electric City"" at that.  I don't have internet access my self, but I had to get this report down.. so I am at the library.   If you have any other questions, or any other reports of this, please contact me .. I know others have seen these craft... unless the people here didn't look up on those days.  Have a great day!  ((name deleted))",2005-11-03T00:00:00,47.46981803278688,-111.33172786885245

My boyfriend and I were having a smoke out in our back patio.  I happened to look out towards the west and saw a bright object.  At first I thought It was a really bright star. I said to my boyfriend, "" Isn't that a really bright star?""  He agreed.  The more we looked at it we realised that it couldn't have been a star.  We're not too far from Vandenburg air space so we tried to rationalise the whole thing.  But then it started.  From the left of the bright object a flashing red object appeared.  Naturally we thought it was a plane, but the more we stared at it the more we realised that it was not moving like normal planes.  It would hover down then go up suddenly.  But naturally we tried to rationalise what we were witnessing.  The red-flashing object was getting closer to the bright star object and circled it once and then quickly hovered away.  The more you tried to look at the red-flashing object it seemed to go out of focus.  I decided to get my camera, and as i came back out both me and my boyfriend witnessed something that almost made us S*** in our pants.  The redflashing object stopped floating and became as bright as the bright star object for just a few seconds and dimmed out quickly.  As i tried to focus my camera on the redflashing object, I noticed another redflashing object that we had not seen before.  As I panned out to look at it, not through the camera lens, I noticed that it was THREE more redflashing objects higher up in the sky that weren't near the original one we initially saw.  I wanted to take pics of them and as i tried to fit them into the shot i noticed that they were traveling at a very slow pace in a triangular pattern.  One was all the way at the top or the point of the triangle, and the other 2 were below.  I have to say that I'm not a UFO nut, never been something I've been interested in, but this night sent shivers down my back.   We went back inside after having enough of what we saw.  We really tried to rationalise.  After watching tv an hour later I decided to go back outside to see if anything was still going on.  When i stepped outside I was stumped to see that everything, the flashing red objects and the bright star looking object were all gone. I only had a disposable camera and the flash kept going off. i have yet to develop the camera.  I was really hoping that i would read any similar sightings on this site.  There is no way me and my boyfriend were the only ones that witnessed this.  The object was bright like a comet coming towards earth.

The times are different but with such a coincidence having occurred, I thought it worth mentioning.  I was part of a large group of amateur astronomers at a star gazing event when several people yelled out to look at the constellation Cassiopeia which was at approx. 45-50 degrees or so to the northeast at about 1920 hrs. or so.  I'm not sure of the exact time but it was not quite dark.  I, along with several others observed (2) very bright white lights traveling through Cassiopeia in a north/northeasterly direction.  The lights were about 2 fingerwidths apart with an outstretched arm and of a magnitude of approx. -2 to -3.  One light was behind the other. They shined for no longer than 8 seconds or so then faded out quickly.  Discussion afterwards varied but several, including myself believe we saw 2 Iridium flares very close together which would be very unusual or a rocket launch/seperation of some kind.  The location of this sighting in relation to the Orland Park/Tinley Park sighting which occurred later on this same date is of concern because those two towns are only approx. 25-30 miles north of the location we observed the lights. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports of these two satellites, although we are not able to identify them.  We wonder whether they might somehow be related to the ""triplet"" of satellites, which, from time to time, are reported to our Center, and which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy's ""NOSS"" satellite program.   We suspect that the lights, given that they apparently had an easterly component to their groundtrack, and that they faded in the eastern sky, almost certainly were satellites.  Just a guess, on our part.  PD))",2005-10-11T00:00:00,41.1916,-87.8555

While camping at Spring Mill State park on Friday, Sept. 30, 2005, my 2 children (ages 14 and 22) saw what appeared to be an extremely bright star in the night sky (around 10 PM).  Our point of orientation was just above and just to the right of a large spruce tree.  Because it was so bright, we were observing it and trying to determine if it was a  star or a planet.  As we watched, it moved slowly up, then left, then right, and back down - but not as low as it had been.   We were all amazed and watched intently for several minutes.  It moved almost continuously, but not very much at one time.  The pattern was never exact but always up and down, back and forth.  It reminded me of a balloon, with some type of brilliant light attached, tethered to the ground and swaying in the breeze.  However, in general, it continued to gain altitude and move to the right.  We watched it for nearly an hour and finally gave up trying to figure out what it was.  I did not think too much more about it until the following night (Saturday) around 8 PM.  I thought about it as we sat around the camp fire and asked my children if they had seen yet that night.  As we all looked in the direction we had seen it the previous night, sure enough, there it was again.  Some differences this time.  It appeared to be farther away than the previous night and much lower on the horizon.  It was much further to the left of the same spruce tree than the previous night.  Also, instead of a brilliant white light, it had more of an orange cast to it.  The movement was excactly as the previous night.  It looked as though it was swaying in the breeze but steadily moved higher and to the right.

Said event occurred at extremely close range. This prompted the witnesses to locate and call a UFO investigator directly from the scene once the event terminated.   LOCATION   The precise location of this event is being described in a slightly vague manner. Certain factors dictate that we keep secure the exact location in order to protect the privacy of certain community facilities and nearby persons. The below described events occurred in RURAL ORANGE COUNTY, just north of ORLANDO FLORIDA   The body of water described below is a typical small Florida freshwater lake with the attendant subtropical ""bushland"" growth in the area. This terrain DOES contain a number of alligators and snakes.   BACKGROUND   The Georgia UFO Group (GUFOG) sponsors a ""UFO Hotline"" for all of Georgia. On 22April05 at about 10:55PM, the GUFOG line received a phone call from rural ORANGE COUNTY FLORIDA. Tom Sheets of GUFOG answered the call and spoke with the complainant who identified himself completely and without hesitation, also providing his cell phone number. The caller was found to be the Primary Witness (PW), a 19YOA Orange County area resident. He sounded excited (but maintaining control) and related that he and two of his friends were currently at a local lake where they'd been fishing since earlier in the evening. PW stated that about 15 minutes prior, he and his two associates had encountered at close range, a glowing round light that was so astounding the three of them concluded that a report MUST be made to someone and ASAP. The PW asked the 411 operator for contact information on UFO investigators.......""ANY UFO INVESTIGATORS"", thus the GUFOG Hotline was contacted. Thereafter, Tom Sheets referred the case on to Roberta Puhalski in Lakeland. Puhalski is the founder of the Central Florida UFO Group, and herself a colleague of numerous investigators in Georgia as well as other states.   The facts in this case were gathered by both investigators; Sheets conducting administrative chores at long range, with the field work and interviews falling to Puhalski and the Florida group. Sheets took the original phone call, plus conducted subsequent verifying phone conversations with the PW, and provided other consultation in this matter. Then Puhalski continued with additional phone conversations, leading up to her 24April05 meeting with all three witnesses at the scene of the occurrence.   EVENT DETAILS   As previously indicated, this party of anglers had been out since earlier in the evening, at this, their personal favorite fishing spot used for several years. (As far as the witnesses know, nothing unusual had ever been observed in this immediate area prior to 22April05). The PW stated that they were carrying Mag-Lites for illumination (heavy duty law enforcement-style flashlights), and were wary of the numerous alligators known to infest this sub-tropical area. At this point, witnesses observed what was first thought to be an animal's eye shining with reflected light i.e. an alligator's eye off in the bushes and undergrowth about 20 yards away. Suddenly it became apparent that this WAS NOT the case, as a ROUND, ORANGISH-RED, DIMLY GLOWING ORB-LIKE LIGHT, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL (+) suddenly rose up into PLAIN VIEW ABOUT 20 YARDS AWAY. This round light continued UPWARDS AT A FAST RATE OF SPEED, described by witnesses as being perhaps 200MPH or almost FASTER THAN THE EYE COULD FOLLOW (at that close range). It was SILENT, and appeared to be SUBSTANTIAL in it's emission of light. Upon reaching about 150 feet in altitude, it hovered, then moved SIDEWAYS perhaps about 100 feet, then back DOWNWARDS, and then SIDEWAYS again, TRACING something like a TRIANGLE in it's flight path. This glowing light was ALSO described as possibly being ATTACHED to some sort of SOLID OBJECT OF UNKNOWN SHAPE that was DIFFICULT TO SEE as it was not emitting any LIGHT or GLOW i.e. the impression that this SOLID SHADOWY MASS was BEHIND the glowing light and as stated, moving extremely fast. This object/light eventually flew off behind the adjacent trees and vanished. ALL witnesses were impressed by the AMAZING SPEED demonstrated by this object at such CLOSE RANGE. The witnesses made unsuccessful attempts to relocate it, then called 411, and then the GUFOG Hotline.   INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS   Tom Sheets indicates that the PW seemed very sincere during the initial phone conversation, with no reservations about providing continued cooperation. This party of young fishermen (senior teens) was obviously STILL searching the event area when the first conversation with GUFOG took place via cell phone. Additionally, after subsequent conversations, the 19 YOA PW seemed to impress Sheets as being more ""on the ball"" than the average older teenager, conversing on a mature level.   Roberta Puhalski went to great lengths in setting up the 24April05 witness interviews and the physical inspection of the event site. Puhalski received full cooperation from the three witnesses, each providing additional information in separate writings, along with their signatures. The event site being in rural ORANGE COUNTY, a sort of brief ""bush trek"" (!) was necessary for Puhalski and the witnesses to arrive at the lake shore. She conducted a thorough witness debriefing, which included a physical ""walk-through"" of the occurrence, along with supporting photographs. Puhalski maintains that these young men are credible witnesses, citing their body language and tendency to look her directly in the eyes when giving their account. Furthermore, witnesses were VERY forthright in their statements, using open handed gestures, as the details of what occurred during the event NEVER varied.   During subsequent discussions between Puhalski and Sheets, a mutual opinion was reached regarding the PW......a seemingly credible witness who was looking for answers........something aerial, something mysterious and unknown had invaded his long time, heretofore peaceful, fishing spot.   ADDITIONAL FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS BY INVESTIGATORS   WEATHER CONDITIONS   The weather at this rural event site was reportedly fair and mild on the evening of 22April05. Specific information was obtained from the NWS daily recap of conditions at the Orlando International Airport; 10:53PM-----Temperature 70 degrees; Visibility 10 miles; 5.8 WNW winds; Humidity 53%; Sea level pressure 29.91, General description being partly cloudy.   The moon on 22April05 was almost FULL, fullness being reached two days later on 24April. The investigators feel that even with the almost full moon, the HIGH SPEED and SHORT DURATION of actual flight time made any physical MASS behind the GLOWING light DIFFICULT to clearly see i.e. that part WAS NOT emitting light. (Note: Sheets indicates several other investigations where the witnesses reported similar circumstances).   DURATION OF EVENT   The investigation revealed that about 5 MINUTES elapsed FROM the initial observation of the glow off in the nearby brush, THEN it's aerial flight and departure, CONTINUING with the witness' effort to search and relocate, THEN calling 411. <<<<<ACTUAL FLIGHT TIME OF THE LIGHT/OBJECT WAS ABOUT 5 SECONDS>>>>>.   ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING SHORELINE AND EVENT AREA   As described above, the witnesses were fishing from the shore, and off to their right about 20 yards away was the denser brushy area where the light/object was first observed at ground level. This area has one portion that extends slightly out into the lake. Located by Puhalski very near this shoreline, and within the described brushy area, was an unusual looking grate structure in the ground, along with several short pipe like structures coming out of the soil. The witnesses called it a drain, but it looked out of place to Puhalski, being surrounded by small overgrowth, yet in a small cleared out area within the aforementioned brushy area. This grate is within just a few yards of where the light was first observed at ground level. Speculation regarding the short pipes and the grate currently tends to associate them with some sort of drainage or below-ground conduit, perhaps linking up with an underground spring or water source.  The event site inspection revealed NO signs of trace evidence. (Photographs and diagram contained in the investigative file).   OTHER PHENOMENON   Investigators Puhalski and Sheets have conducted numerous past inquiries where, perhaps not rare, but certainly uncommon and only slightly understood natural phenomenon might have been in play. These were explored in light of this reported incident. One sample of this speculation is described below, to wit;   Research Source- ""Remarkable Luminous Phenomena in Nature"", compiled by William R. Corliss (Catalog of Geophysical Anomalies).   GLN1-----Low-Level Nocturnal Lights Outline and Brief Excerpts   Description; "".......softly glowing globes..........other luminous apparitions.....hovering, drifting erratically.......range from candle-size to radiating masses several feet in diameter.......colors vary widely, white, blue, yellow being most common......bobbing, swooping, evasive antics seem to beckon observer, frequently vanish......appear nearby.....low-level nocturnal lights seem to prefer wet, swampy areas"".   Background; "".......standard explanation........spontaneously ignited gases escaping from swampy ground........this apparently reasonable explanation.......shut off all scientific research..........examples (provided in text) demonstrate the marsh gas theory will simply not do in many.........a complex, challenging phenomenon"".   Corliss continues on to describe that no explanation has been found as to how escaping gases can spontaneously ignite and that they are actually COLD as opposed to what would NORMALLY be expected from burning methane. Furthermore, Corliss is perplexed that no one has been able to determine how clouds of luminous gas can perform all sorts of aerial maneuvers for extended periods without losing shape and size. Corliss provides some possible explanations related to a cold flame being some sort of unindentified phosphorescence that is related to electromagnetic fields that might help in the production of light and maintaining size/shape. Numerous examples of low-level nocturnal lights are given in Corliss' text, which is compiled from MANY first hand reports. Some are in ways similar to this Florida event, but those cited examples DO NOT SEEM TO INVOLVE SUCH HIGH SPEED, DIRECT MOVEMENT and SOLIDITY as described by the Florida witnesses.   As indicated above, Investigators Puhalski and Sheets have spent years looking into various types of UFO reports, which include a number of possible natural ""spook lights"" (we use this term generically) as described by Corliss.......BUT.......at this time, it is UNKNOWN what was observed in ORANGE COUNTY on 22April05. The BLAZING SPEED described by the witnesses, plus the DIRECT MOVEMENT and SUBSTANTIAL GLOW is consistant with many other ""up close and personal"" UFO encounters. ALSO CONSISTANT is the description of an UNKNOWN and HARD TO SEE MASS being behind the more easily observed glowing light. UFO encounters such as this are OBVIOUSLY NOT a natural atmospheric phenomenon, ""spook light"" or other such glowing apparition. If this is the case in the ORANGE COUNTY investigation, the Corliss information described above simply does not apply.   It should be noted that these fishermen have returned to their fishing spot since 22April05 with no similar events being noticed.   ORANGE COUNTY and ORLANDO area residents that may have witnessed a similar event on or about 22April05 (or any other time frame) are urged to contact Roberta Puhalski, founder of the Central Florida UFO Group at <<<<<CUFOG@webtv.net>>>>>   The IDENTITY of EACH witness is held strictly confidential by both the Florida and Georgia groups.

A light in the sky caught our attention, so we decided to stand there and observe it.   It was a red light with a tail located in the sky above the field directly across the street from the restaurant.  At first, we thought it was a flare, but quickly dismissed that it wasn't because it wasn't moving upwards.  Rather, it was moving very slowly towards our direction.  The tail faded out as the light slowed down to a stop and eventually became a solitary red light.  We watched it for several minutes and during this time, it stayed stationary.  We ran through all of the possibilities of what it could be and we were just stunned having seen nothing like this before.  I even remember looking around the packed parking lot and seeing if anyone else was observing the same thing.   We decided to move on because nothing was happening.  After walking a short distance, I thought to myself to just take one more look.  I'm glad I did because what I observed next was shocking. The red light had grown into a full-fledged self-contained exploding orb in the sky.  I know that sounds weird, but it's almost as if the light were in a clear balloon and exploding within the balloon.  There was no sound as this happened either and we thought that was weird.  Next, the bright orb dimmed and became white, then split into three separate white orbs.  Two headed southward and one headed northward.    The two headed southward traveled a short distance until one literally faded out and the other looked perfectly like a star amongst the others in the night sky and just stayed there.  The one headed northward also faded ever so slightly at a slow pace in the sky and also eventually looked like another star in the night sky. That is what we observed from the time the red light caught our attention until the three orbs faded and blended in with the night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Cape Canaveral.

In May last year I was photographing the moon using an slr mounted on a tripod, cable release, 70mm lens, 400 asa film. The exposure times varied between less than a second to maybe 1 minute, you can tell by the streaks left by the stars. when I took the photographs there was nothing in the sky, when I had got them back, there was a very unmistakeable light near the moon. In the first photo it was directly in line with the moon, then as the moon moved in its orbit the light stayed where it was, which was for something like 15 20 minutes which can be vairifed by the amount of motion of the moon. The photographs were developed at a commerical lab the original preview is included. the next night I did the same, this time the moon rose later and so was in a completely different spot. When I got the photos back there was the light again obviously infra red or similar. Again it was near the moon and therefore had to move their to be in the photo. The next night I did the same but there was no light, then the night after I again photographed the moon and it was back again, and again in a completely different positon but still near the moon. those photographs are in the first album. to give some perspective, I have included a photo of the moon taken with a 400mm lens, it is still samller than the light and nowhere near as bright. You will also notice that in the photo of the moon the background is very dark and there are no stars visible and no trees or clouds visible even though I included trees in the shot to gain some perspective. This means that the light needed to be close enough to light the trees, as well as provide the added light energy to make the stars visible. In the second album the photographs were taken in january this year, there were similar exposure times some shorter some a little longer yet it is much brighter and obviously closer as it clearly lights up the roof and trees, you can see clouds and stars and the background is visible unlike the moon photos that are just black. again I have included the original preview from the photo lab which is a different lab again, I also have the original film. These were taken at a completely different angle and you can see how much closer the light is.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,,

There was no sensible pattern to the blinking of the lights sometimes 5 white and 7 red and then 13 white and 2 red would blink on and off, and not all at the same time.   I told ((name deleted)) to look at it and he said he couldnt because he was driving.  We were about 30 seconds from his development so when we pulled into his neighborhood i leaned out the window and looked above the car and the craft was right over me.   This time from underneath it i could make out it's shape instead of a huge cluster of lights.  It looked like a triangle but along the bottom of the triangle, it was inverted, like someone had cut a triangular peice out of it.  It was so close to the ground if I would have shot at it with a paintball gun i could have hit it and made no noise at all, just a dull humming like when your refrigeator kicks in in the middle of the night.   I could see the outline of what looked like seams in the metal (which was dark) that looked like it had been welded together ( there were little dark dots along the seam).   I am screaming for him to stop the car and look at this thing but he saide we were almost at his treet and to hold on (he's very skeptical).  When he finally parked the car we both jumped out and ooked across the street.   The object moved into view between the rooves of two neighboring houses across the street and then hovered (a little wobbly) for about 25 seconds in the same spot where we both got a great look at it. The lights wre around the outside of it now.   I held up my hands and tried to measure it between the two of them and it was about 6 or 7 inches which means that for as far away as it was, it had to be HUGE to appear that big from my point of perspective.   Then it just glided back out of view behing the houses from the direction it had come from.  We ran down to the end of the street and tried to see it again but by that time it was way off in the distance and just a cluster of randomly pulsating lights.

I just stared at the night sky, trying to clear my mind so I could get my own issues sorted out, which I had initially gone to Creation for.  As I stared into the sky, I noticed a small light that kept moving, slowly at first, then it would zip over across the sky a bit, near some other star which was stationary. I thought I must be seeing things first, so I watched the light move about for about 10 minutes alone, then went to ask my friends whether or not they saw it.  Two of my friends saw the light, and noticed that it seemed to be moving, and that it would zip away at certain points during its movement to another part of the sky not too far away.  I then proceeded to ask the campsite next to ours whether or not they saw the light's movement, and, as they were drunk, they didn't believe me and decided instead to mock me for being blind or something of that nature. Regardless, I watched the light by myself a few minutes later, then noticed it stopped.  The light itself seemed to be spinning in place, which struck me as very odd indeed, and then what happened next was a bit scary; the light started spinning in place, then a little red light flew off of one end of it and traveled in a straight path for a bit, then faded out, while the main light kept spinning. This phenomenon occurred several times, until eventually the light was obscured by clouds and I could no longer see it.  Nobody who saw it could tell me what it was, and those three who assumed it might be a UFO said nothing about it after that, though I think about it often, wondering what exactly went on that night.",2005-05-24T00:00:00,40.34,-77.8558

We went over to the house around 9pm. We checked on the dogs, and went out by the pool to relax and watch the stars. The house is situated on the hill in such a way that provides a panoramic view of the sky and the entire Antelope Valley.  As is our usual custom, we were viewing the sky.  The first ""star"" came from the southwest corridor, and even while planes were flying around, this ""star"" almost ""hovered"" as it flew in a slow, steady, northeastern direction. Like our previous sightings in Lancaster, this object dipped occasionally and then eventually ""dissolved"".  We both confirmed what we saw: no sound, no flash pattern or lights with the exception of the objects ""brightness/ sphere shape"".  We waited a while longer, perhaps 8 to 10 minutes, and the 2nd ""star"" appeared out of south heading in a northerly direction. This 2nd star was different, however. This time, while it made a slow, almost ""hover"" like pattern, with slight dips, etc. it made it's way into our northern view, stopped, hovered, then suddenly became extremely BRIGHT, as if someone turned on a spotlight, while it remained motionless, felt like a signal to us that we see you seeing us. Then it dimmed again, and dissolved into the same spot as the 1st ""star"".  We waited awhile longer again, this time it was approximately 15 minutes, and eventually, another ""star"" came out of the direct west direction, made a slow, dipping, hover like pattern, and again, moved across the sky and ""dissolved"" into the same exact area of the sky (due north)  As previously stated in our post of last week, we are very close to Edwards AFB, and see many flights of different aircraft all the time and are familiar with private and military craft.  These objects are not airplanes. No sound, no flash patterns, no direct flight path, no usual flight path taken (as we are used to seeing here in the Antelope Valley)  We are reporting this again in the hope that some other people in the valley have seen the same objects in the sky.

The object was much larger than a normal aircraft, and totally silent. It appeared to be at about 10,000 feet (I live near a major airport therefore know approximate heights). The lights were exactly the same size and intensity as the stars that were out that night.  The object moved about halfway across my field of view in about three seconds. In one second, the object appeared to make a 90 degree vertical turn, that is, move from horizontal flight to direct vertical flight. The change from horizontal to vertical happened in about one second, and in a space of about the length of the object, i.e. much faster and more smoothly than a normal aircraft, and without sound.  I remarked to my friend, who was nearby: ""Hey, it's a triangle shaped UFO"" and by the time he looked up, the object had vanished.

These storms contained heavy lighning, and 70-80 mph winds.

The object was observed in the night sky at the foot of Brindlee Mtn. roughly above southbound Hwy 231.  At first site, the object was located above the trees about half a mile east of the road (estimated perhaps 300 ft. above ground level on the slope of the mountain).  The object appeared to be roughly round, very slightly elongated, and from my vantage point seemed to be composed of bright blue-white light.  The intensity and color of the light was inconsistant with all fireworks, street lamps, yard lights, and other such sources of illumination that I am aware of.  Within the 2-3 seconds I had a good view of the craft, I observed it to hover above the tree line for an estimated 1/10th of a second and then rapidly moved upwards and westwards, crossing the sky in front of my vehical in approximately 1 second.  From my vantage point, it is my opinion that the object moved in three dimensional space in the same way that an aircraft takes off a runway, only much more rapidly and at a much sharper angle (I estimate the angle would have been roughly 70-75 degrees and the trajectory did not change as it moved).  As the object moved, it also changed color.  The blue-white quality of the light changed to a greenish color and then to a reddish orange color as it gained altitude, and decreased slightly in size proportionally to it's altitude.  The object seemed to vanish completely at the end of it's approx. 1 second trajectory, and the final location of the object I estimate to be at a substantial altitude (at least 5,000 ft, though that is a very conservative estimate) and probably at least 1 mile west of southbound Hwy 231 (also a conservative estimate). A slightly audible sound followed about one second behind the object, and I can only describe it as a Doppler Effect-type sound, though very faint and high pitched (I would compare it to the scream of a fighter-jet engine, only much higher pitched with a very unique undertone).  It is my opinion that this object could not possibly be an airplane or other man-made craft, as it began too close to the ground and progressed at an extreme angle and speed that I have never seen or heard of in a human aircraft.  The only object I know of that could travel from close to the ground to that alititude at anything nearly approaching that speed would be a rocket of some sort, and the intensity of illumination and the speed of the object is not consistant with any amature rocket.  So far as I know, there are no housing or human habitation sites in the area that the object was hovering over.  The local area is nearly completely covered in hardwood forest.  My geological survey map of the area shows no unusual geological phenomenon.  There were no powerlines or cell phone/radio towers located in the area where the object originated.  The atmospheric conditions were humid, but clear.  There is no chance that the object was a star or planet, as it appeared closer than the horizon and was too close to the ground, and from my moving vehical, the object changed perspective in the way that a three dimensional object would be expected to.  The object could not have been a meteor because it ascended into the sky, while a meteor would have descended.  As for my background, I am a native to this area and I am an archaeologist, currently investigating an excavation site on the Flint River flood plain.  When I saw the object I was returning home from visiting friends in Huntsville.  I had not imbibed any alcohol, nicotine, narcotic, or any other mind affecting substance.  I was not affected by fatigue and I have no history of mental illness, nor any physical or psychological cause for hallucination.  I am reporting this because I can think of no other logical conclusion for what I saw than to label it a UFO.",2005-09-02T00:00:00,34.727967771639044,-86.62783879680786

We noticed a very bright star-like object just over the horizon in a SSW direction at about 11:00 PM.  I had been looking at Orion (it was a very clear night) and noticed that the object was sustantially brighter than other stars.  My wife also noticed it when she came outside.  Then our two friends also started studying it.  We weren't sure if it was moving, but we all watched it for about a minute or two and realized that it was heading towards us.  From that point of view, it just appeared to be three very bright lights.  I went inside for my binoculars and by the time I got back downstairs, they were yelling that it was over the house.  I went outside and my friend said it seemed to be diamond-shaped.  I focused my binoculars on it and I could make out four bright lights, one at each corner (or possibly several small lights at each corner).  It was definitely diamond-shaped, I could just make out it's outline, but I couldn't see any fine details such as texture or any contours on its belly.  As it continued moving, one of  the lights dimmed and then was no longer visible (I assume they were directional lights, maybe), but we could still see the other three.  It continued moving in a NNW direction until it was out of sight.  This event happened over a time period of about 10 minutes.  It was never really directly over our house, but I would estimate that it passed over the the small town of Espy, through my ""neighborhood"" and continued over the I-80/Rt 487 interchange.  I can not say for sure, but it seemed like it was only several hundred feet off the ground at the most.  I could not give a good estimate of its size.  I did not notice it making any sound during this time, but afterwards, my friend said he thought he remembered hearing a humming sound.  If its direction remained constant, I would estimate that it came from near Mainville and continued on towards Millville.  The following day, a coworker of mine told me that he and his wife witnessed a bright flash in the sky near Millville that same night at about 9:00 PM (two hours earlier than my experience).

This happened last saturday night when I and 4 of my friends were trying to cause some mischief in our creative new ways. Now don't come to the conclusion that we are a group of jug heads and half-retarded socialites, we are actually rather prominent students, 2 of them are music majors home for the weekend. Anywho, we were ""yarning""(taking yarn and wrapping it around desired objects.) a bridge above an aqueduct so that if anyone drove by they would run right into it, we did it so it was a wall, not too dangerous but itll scare the hell out of you. So we hide in the orange groves and wait for someone to drive by, low and behold its a cop. So he slams on the brakes and starts searching and what we believe to be calling in other units. We take off backwards in the groves for about an eigth of a mile so we can cross the aqueduct without the cop seeing us, so we can enter a much larger feild of orange groves to get in the clear. The plan is to make a full 2 mile flank to get to our vehicles which we parked purposly away from the scene. So as we are running in this very very large grove, a mild and warm light starts up in the direction we were running in, so we make a turn, scared as hell it was a cop car in the groves or something(by the way this is what we live for, we do it for the rush). We had to turn in the wrong direction because if we hit the road at that time we would be seen. So we then run into a large aqueduct and head down that for a couple minutes, but the light reappeared to the right and up ahead of us. We felt very exposed so we decided to bunker down in the groves on the opposite side of the light. Once in the groves we watched as the light then started to rise in the air, and I thought we were screwed that they called in a helicopter, and being they have the large lights and night vision, we would surely get caught. We didnt hear any propellers though, so we were confused, and thought it might be a guy with a lantern climbing up these really tall windmills and towers that help to keep the tree's from freezing in the winter, what he was doing at three in the morning in the warmest january we could remember we hadn't a clue. Then the light started towards us left, and very slowly it seemed, so now we were pretty much crapping our pants. as it got a little closer, maybe half a mile to a quarter mile away it took shaper. We could see that it had a colored tinge to its outside(not the part that held the light) but what color im not very sure, I say it was more of a burnt orange to a redish gray, everyone else has their own color interpretations so who knows. The shape was hard to tell because the light on it was so bright it hid the parts further from it. This thing kept going without regard to us, so when it got to where it seemed it was leaving our presence we booked it to the road faster than I think any of us have ever ran in our lives, made it to our cars, the cop was gone, the yarn was cutt, and we then went to denny's and talked it over for about an hour. We were so shacky we were afraid to drive home, especially me seeing as i lived only maybe 2 miles linear from where this happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax, we suspect.

We had just turned at Hollis Crossroads and were driving down the road when we saw what was either a very low flying object, or an enormous object at a higher altitude. It was trianglular with a flashing green light on it. It moved slowly, or slower than a plane would, across our field of vision, which was the windshield since it was almost directly above us.  There were trees on either side of the road and it took up most of what part of the sky we could see. We called our friends in the other vehicle to ask them if they saw it, and they said they had and described it like we did. They were about 30 seconds in front of us and said they saw it going the other direction, as if it made a loop or a circle. There wasn't any airfield near by that we know about and it didn't look like any plane we had ever seen. If it was an airplane, it would have to be either landing, taking off, flying way too low, or gigantic.

He and his wife had spotted objects in the sky and asked my husband if we had seen them/been watching them.  My husband went outside to see them then came back inside, woke me up and had me go out and look at them.  There were 3 distant objects (that I could see) in the Eastern sky.  They appeared not to be moving at all.  They were brighter than stars and ""twinkling""/""blinking"".  Had they been moving I would have thought they were airplanes or helicopters or something.  But what struck us all was that they appeared to be motionless but just as bright if not brighter than an airplane or such.  When we first looked at them there were two other aircrafts in the air that were moving so it was easy to tell the difference between and airplane/helicopter and what we were seeing, which were seemingly motionless. I decided to use my husband's binoculars to see if I could get a better view of what they were.  I looked at each one and they each had the same characteristics.  It was FREEZING outside so it was hard for me to stand still and my shaking from the cold made my vision a bit blurry at times through the binoculars.  I couldn't see an ""object"" per say, but each ""object"" had bright, blinking lights (red, green, white, blue, etc.) that appeared to blink very quickly and seemed to change the pattern of their blinking/lighting-up.  With the binoculars, I could clearly see the lights.  The lights lit up clearly in circles but it was difficult for me to see their patterns as I was shaking from the cold and the patterns that the lights lit up in seemed to change very quickly.  We came to the conclusion that they were satellites since we know very little about this type of thing, but after looking into sattelites on the internet have determined that not to be the case.  We are all completely stumped at what we saw.  But these objects didn't appear to move a bit for at least an hour and a half (till we finally went to bed).  There has been no mention of it on the news and am very curious for an explanation of what we saw.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,35.66189285714286,-97.47531375661374

It didn't seem to move much and may have changed length slightly and gradually as I watched it (as if it were turning?).  It consisted of several, mayby 5, VERY BRIGHT yellowish lights that appeared to be circular in shape and in a perfect line, very close together.  I thought that this could be how the windows of an airplane might look if it were rather close (it seemed rather large) and if it had only a limited number of passenger windows.  It was just starting to get dark though, the sky was well lit and overcast and the stars were just starting to show as I recall.  The lights SEEMED to be FAR too bright for aircraft windows especially considering that it wasn't really dark yet. The sky was a sort of grey color.  The extreme brightness of the lights indicated to me that they might have been actual exterior lights (not windows) but they didn't strobe at all, were yellowish, were too large in number and I don't think that they occur in a straight line, one right after the other on aircraft. No strobing navigation lights were seen.  I continued to drive towards and then into this small town and looked at it very frequently to try to identify it. when I entered the town and turned a corner, my view was blocked by trees for about 15 seconds or so. When the view was again clear,the object was not at all visible. It was large and seemingly near and very brightly illuminated just seconds before. I saw the star that I assumed was the right one but looked around and could not see this object. I wondered if it were a plane (lear jet as far as the approximate number of windows is concerned?) that could have turned and become not visible. This didn't seem likely to me at the time.",2005-12-16T00:00:00,,

I'm a big skeptic.  I keep an open mind, but draw no conclusions.  What my fiancee and I saw was nothing like we've seen before.  Around 6:00, both of us got into our cars and proceed home from of different jobs.  I was commuting North from Glendale into Valencia.  My fiancee was coming from Reseda Blvd and was battling out the freeways in heavy traffic.  At about 7:40, going west on the 210 freeway I spotted three lights traveling from the North to the South (San Fernando).  The three lights formed what I can almost positively identify as a solid triangle.  Two lights were a cool blue and did not pulse or strobe in any way, and a thrid, on the side (not directional front) was more white/yellow (also did not flash or blink).  The object was large and low, about the size of a large commercial air craft at about the altitude you see them when they're approaching an airport to land.  Sometimes you might see a strange light in the sky, but as you watch it it always explains itself by changing direction or distance and you come to realize, ""Oh, it's just a plane... I couldn't see the wings before.""  But I observed this as it traveled across the complete 180 degrees of my field of sight, crossing over the freeway and continuing on over San Fernando Valley.  This object never changed perspective.  It appeared as a SOLID, large, geometric triangle with three lights at its points.  No curves.  No wings.  And it glided slowly perfectly smooth over the freeway.  Too slow for a plane at that distance and altitude.  This was strange, but I might have been able to dismiss it easier if I hadn't arrived home to hear my fiancee saw the exact same object from the other side of the valley.  Our observations were identical, and we both agreed that our after-work sleepy daze was broken when this strange object immediately stuck out.  We both, independently came to the same conclusions (not that it was a space ship or anything, just that this was no ordinary plane) and we were shocked to find we both witnessed it.  One case of over-active imagination... maybe.  But two?  I was going about 60 MPH but my fiancee was stuck in heavy traffic.  I'm sure others on the freeway must have witnessed the same thing and I'd like to know if anyone got a better look.",2006-03-11T00:00:00,34.284437499999996,-118.43984374999998

Saw a very bright light moving overhead at a good clip; about as fast as a low-flying aircraft appears to move. Thought initially that the light was the landing spotlight of an aircraft but there was (a) no noise whatsoever and (b) the light was unaccompanied by the blinking red and green id lights common to aircraft. Also the light remained steady for the duration of the sighting. The light was approximately magnitude -5 or possibly -6; it was distinctly brighter than venus, and a yellowish-white in color. The light displayed a peculiar sort of sliding motion in additon to its forward vector as it crossed the sky from west to east in about 2 minutes. (we have a big sky in New Mexico). By sliding I mean that it appeared to move slightly north as it travelled eastward, but to do so in a way that made it seem it was an ancilliary to its primary motion eastward. It's hard to describe, but it was like when the wind is perpendicular to the road and it makes your car veer slightly as you're driving. But I the skidding motion of this light was constant and did not seem to vary with the gusting wind that evening. I have seen the ISS and this did not resemble it at all, being far brighter and apparently closer, and moving faster, as my wife who also saw the tail end of the sighting confirmed. Nor did it look like a balloon reflecting the setting sun, as the light was constant throughout the minutes it took to cross the sky, fading out only after it had gone far to the east almost to the horizon, and this was 10 or 15 minutes after sunset. It was also moving far faster than I've ever seen a balloon move, even in high wind. (And the International Balloon Fiesta is about 60 miles north in Albuquerque every year, so I've seen my share of balloons.)",2006-03-11T00:00:00,35.661082683982684,-105.95390714285715

Beginning at approximately 7:30pm EST I noticed a odd configuration of lights west of my location which would just to the north of the Tampa International airport.  There were two alternating flashing red lights on top of each other and white non-flashing lights to the left and right about 2.5 to 3 times as far apart as the red lights.  The red and white lights formed an elongated diamond shape (I was never able to make out any physical shape).  I observed the grouping of lights remain stationary for about 5 mins and then they collectively drifted very slowly in a northward directly a short distance and stopped again.  They maintained the same position this time for about 20 mins.  Then, the grouping of ligths dipped slightly clock-wise relative to my position and the object drifted to my right (northward) again, tipped sligthly in a counter-clockwise direction and then moved very quickly in a west or south-west direction, disappearing over the horizon directly west of my position within about 3 or 4 seconds.  About 10 seconds later I saw plane fly over heading in the exact direction of the object moving very quickly relative to other routine air traffic in the area (looked like a fighter jet).  Possibilities ruled out for object: traditional airplane - too big and stationary for 20 mins, grouping of helicopters - none of the individual lights ever changed position relative to the others (not even remotely) and object moved too fast to be a helicopter or multiple helicopters, blimp - far larger than any blimp I've ever seen and moved much faster than a blimp when it did move, hot air ballon - don't think so, lights on building - buildings and radio towers don't move.

Even the year is foggy.  But I do remember my brother had left for college, so I must have been a Junior in high school.  I had shelves built in to the wall at the foot of my bed.  Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I awoke to a crashing sound on my floor.  I leapt out of bed, headed for the light switch, and flipped it on while runningout the door (feared the boogie man).  As I tried to excape, I ran into my mom who was standing just outside my bedroom door.  She scared me half to death too, since her room was on the opposite end of the house...and she was not the type to check and see what went boom in the night.  I couldn't figure out how she got there so quickly.  I then turned around, out of breath, to see what the noise was.  My shelves had fallen to the floor with all the books, etc...  Relieved, I said, something to the effect of, ""Oh, thank God, it was just my books.  I flipped off the switch and went back to bed, leaving my mom in the doorway.  She turned the light back on and said, Karen, look out your window, in a monotonous tone.  Now, this is coming from a hyper melodramatic woman.  Again, ""Karen, look out your window.""  I yelled back like the brat that I was, ""Mom, it was just my books, I'm trying to sleep.  I'll clean it up tomorrow. Now, turn off my light!""  And she repeated herself again, ""Karen, look out your window.""  This went on a couple of more times, until I huffed and crawled to the end of my bed, opened the blinds and said, ""What?""  At that very moment, I saw a huge fireball about a hundred yards above our back yard.  It was partically over ours, and the house behind us. I was wowed, and instantly thought that we should call somebody, but I didn't know who.  Just to report it, or to see if someone else had seen it, or, I thought, perhaps it was there just for us.   I wasn't afriad of it.  I thought it was cool. She said that there was no point in calling,that no one would believe us, or someon else would have called in by then.   She said, ""Yeah, I've been watching it for hours.  It hovering above our yard like that, then it just... and at that very instant, it seemed to respond to her words.  It took off way across the infinite skyline and became the size of a pea, then it zoomed all over the sky and soon anough came back to our backyard, only slightly higher and further away this time.  I ended up getting in my moms bed with her so that I could watch it through binoculars out her sliding glass doors.  It didn't look like fire through the binoculars.  It was not of this earth.  I frustrated me, because I wanted to label it, even the colour seemed to change to various shades of orange.  I'm not sure, but I think I remember seeing a little red.  The colour hovered around the ball, like a tangile hue. I watched it for hours.  I oinged all over the sky, then land slightly further away, over and over and over, until I fell asleep.  I never talked about it again, my mom and I never spoke of it.  Many years later, whenI was about thirty, I called my mom after years of not speaking to her.  I asked for two things; 1) my birth certificate and 2) I wanted to know about what she saw.  She said, oh, that thing.  Who knows what that was.  It could have been anything.

All but a few of our sightings took place usually just after dark.  This was just the first time that we saw something in that area. After that on many occations we saw the same type (shape) of object. Also there was a round or oval object that we would see sometimes The triangular object was about 50 to 75 yards from tip to tip. I am 54 years old now, and at the time we were both employed at a hospitals in St. Petersburg, Fl I (we) didn't want to sound crazy to everyone, specificlly to the places that we worked.  I was a respiratory therapist and he was a LPN. We were both reciently divorced and did a bunch of camping during that time. We told very few other friends about our sightings.  Although after the first time it seemed that for about the next aprox. 2 years nearly we saw something that neither one of us could explain. Anyway each time we saw these crafts they moved almost directly over our heads and made no noise that we could hear. But it seemed that one could feel like a presure or something when they were directly over head. I really don't know how to explain it. They almost always moved from norhwest to southeast very low no more than 300 to 400 ft off the ground. We were both into model rocketry when we were younger and kind of used to judging height. We even tried shinning a spot light at them a few times but it didn't seem to do anything so we only did that a few times. The bottom of the triangular craft was smooth and kind of (roundish). The round craft went bye much faster and was harder to make out. For a while we were camping sometimes 2 weekends a month and for that period of time we saw something almost every time we went up. I wish I could tell you more but thats about it. After about 2 years they just stopped showing up. We both remarried and stopped doing so much camping. As I said. I am 54 years old now and dying of liver disease so I really don't care what anyone thinks about me anymore. I was a very interesting time i my life and at least now someone else knows. I don't have any photography but I will try and draw then scan and email the shape area map and direction to you. We did take a few pictures but my friend has since gotten very religious destroying the photos saying that it was the work of satan. I was his camera.

(west of Pulpit Rock) Location of Sighting: Near and Around Pulpit Rock (about 4000 feet from apartments). Looking out one of the apt. windows, viewing the rock possibly after a rainstorm and watching the rainbow, I saw a mysterious ball shaped object floating south in a staight horizontal line toward the middle near the top of the rock. It was golden-white, sometimes with a bluish tone. I knew that it wasn't an airplane or any known flying object, especially since it never had any blinking lights, made any noise and lacked other shape than a sphere. I felt entranced everytime I saw it. The most peculiar thing about it, was that after reaching the rock, it appeared as if going behind it, yet never came out the other side! I have hiked the rock many times in my life and there is no trace of any aircraft landing, nor any place for a helicoptor or even a smally plane to land, since it is very treacherous terrain, behind the rock, ie., rocky hills and ravines with lots trees and uneven territory. In recent years, I came to conclude that this object may have not even entered behind the rock, but perhaps into the rock itself, judging by the rocks enormity. I not only had seen this phenomenon on this occasion, but aproximately three to four other times, in a span or two to three years, always in the same location...and horizonal direcion and height. The appearance of this happening occured usually in the mid summertime, and always durring the early part of the evening, where it was still lit outside. It was usually after it rained and the sky was almost all clear, yet I observed the same occurance on a clear evening, where it had not rained at all! I do not recall any other witnesses beside me, I was perhaps alone in the room everytime. I always felt that Pulpit Rock was a Strange and Mystical place, where I always felt drawn to. Up to this day, this place is like a magnet to me....It energizes my spirit, stimulates my Higher conciousness, and body and a peculiar something that isn't logical and radiates from it.

This is a feeling that is shared by millions of human beings around the world, including myself, who have not placed a 'belief in UFOs' on a wish and a prayer or some peculiar fuzzy lights bouncing around the skies; but on heart stopping, nerve stunning, in-your-face, up-close and personal 'I am HERE, I am BIG and you are very, very small' close encounters with these things. And I'm madder'n hell that this continues to go on every day without any advisement or counsel from our so called 'by the people for the people' governments whose biggest fear next to real democracy is that we'll find out in fact they do not nor ever had a clue about what these things are or where they come from. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS when these things appear, do we greet them with a smile and a handshake or do we run like hell away from them! I think our governments know at least as much to describe the various objects, tell us what their present state of affairs is concerning UFOs, and what is the nature of the contact environment for human interaction with each type; so we can at least act neighborly without placing ourselves in harms way or if these things are dangerous and out to git us we can pop off a few rounds when they get into our cross hairs. I think it's time humanity had its own 'million man march' on capitols around the world to force the truth out from between those bright shiny perfectly lying teeth of politicians responsible for holding back the truth. This is a new millenia and it's time for a new world order allright but not the stilted, contrived childs building block type promoted by patrician 'we know better than you' demagogues. Their silly secret society, michiavellian intrigue ways of running things are as outdated as the buggy whips that remained in the last century, and as unnatural and bizarre as the pathetic face-hip-boob lifts obsessed by celebrities today. There are many, many things that press for answers and change in our society, that require a different focus for human behaviour away from competition and greed. Today let's start with our new neighbors; who the hell are they and where do they come from? Are they here to eat us or eat with us? SORRY FOLKS, I just had to get all that off my chest. I've been saving it up since my first encounter in 1971 and its built up over the years with three unforgettable episodes.  #1) - October 7, 1971,1 am. While travelling east on a country road towards Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, on a clear moonless night; my wife and I noticed a peculiar glowing object hovering just above the tree line to our left about 1000 feet away. I remarked what an interesting effect the moon had reflecting off the top of a silo that way. It looked like a flying saucer, (chuckle) As we proceeded along the road at a leisurely 40 miles per hour, I continued to glance back over my shoulder to watch the changes occur, expecting it to change shape and get smaller as we moved away from it. However when my observations discovered that not only was it holding its horizontal, elliptical shape but getting larger and brighter, I immediately and frantically searched for the moon, craning my neck this way and that. Not finding it, I asked my wife to search for the moon and she discovered also, no moon! I then asked her to look over her left shoulder, and tell me what she saw across the field. She confirmed there was a horizontal, elliptical object, nearly as bright as moon light, getting bigger and closer; I pulled over and stopped the car. By now my wife was frightened and refused to get out of the car, clinging to the door knob out of fear. I wanted to settle this and conclude it was the movement caused by driving that was responsible for what I expected was an illusion. Up to then my only knowledge of flying saucers was in the realm of Buck Rogers, science fiction and stories of peculiar incidents and artifacts from the history of humankind, never putting much credence in the few current reports I had read, I didn't really know what to think, the jury was still out. So I got out of the car and stood very still, bracing myself against the automobile to be sure of my bearing. Well this thing kept moving very slowly from an  ENE direction, still skirting the tops of the forest across the field from us, but not yet coming directly towards us. By now its scale had gone from a dime size at arms length when we first saw it about five minutes earlier to a nickle size. Its steady movement and even moonglow illumination convinced me this neede closer inspection, and that it probably was a flying saucer. Looking back at my wife I said I was going for a closer look to which she groaned her displeasure. I blythely and quite naively raced across the road towards a point in the field about five hundred feet away to intersect its direction of travel, this involved risking an encounter with a barnyard dog because we happened to be next to a farm house to our north east. I made it across the yard without incidence, over a fence then into the field which I discovered was fallow with just short scrub and weeds. As I was running towards my point of intersection in the field ahead, I kept my eyes on the prize and noticed it had altered its course and was coming towards me more directly. Our paths crossed quicker than I had anticipated and was caught up a bit in surprise. Now looking due north, with my head canted back so sharply as to cause me to stop suddenly with the realisation this thing is REALLY close and REALLY big and I should stop now. Art arms length, if you were to hold a yardstick horizontally in your hand it would give you some idea of the scale. My best guess was one hundred feet off the ground and it was dead still. I stood there hollering up to it, 'Come on down here and talk to me!' It just sat there and glowed. I saw no one, no details, no sounds. Just two saucers inverted together glowing brighter than a full moon. Out of the corner of my eye I caught the glint of headlights from an approaching car so I ran back across the field and onto the road to flag it down. They stopped, I pointed to the UFO telling them to look there! At that moment it went from roughly four inches across at arms length , to a pin point and vanished in one second. My wife and I reported it to the night officer in charge at the old OPP station on King street near Rockway Gardens in Kitchener that night. He made a written record of our report, also checking with the local airport for possible fly ins or radar evidence. Nothing. Since then I have encountered a born again christian and a business man both men of character beyond reproach, confiding to me  encounters very similar mine.  #2) - November 15,1987, 2 am. While returning home from work on a crisp, clear moonless night, I was travelling east on hwy 50 just north of Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. I had passed the airport on my left which was closed for the evening and was alone in my vehicle with no traffic on coming or following. Making my way to Buckingham I passed the several overpasses encountered on this highway and was approaching the last one before my turn off which is about six miles east of the aforementioned airport. As I approached the last overpass I noticed a bright red light just ahead and to my left off the road about 100 feet and 100 feet off the ground. The size, colour and brilliance resembling the kind of warning light you see on top of hydro towers. I thought this was peculiar because the hydro tower that was near by was not located there, so I conjectured to myself it must be a late arrival flying in to Gatineau airport. But it was closed and this is way to far away for a flight to be in a landing pattern so I slowed down expecting the plane to make a hard landing in the field.Eventually I pulled to the side of the road just west of the overpass, stopped and got out of my car.The field extending north from the highway is fairly level and consists of weeds and scrub for about 1500 -2000 feet until it reaches the bottom of a rise in the terrain that goes up suddenly about 100 - 150 feet. So looking north is fairly black with no illumination or dwelling in my line of sight until the horizon which is higher up than where I'm standing. Then the night sky explodes with stars and the milky way from the horizon up. The red light is in a fixed position in the darkness below the horizon and I'm marveling at how an aircraft can remain stationery for so long. I look around for possible wind sources to make this happen but the air is still, And I haven't yet been able to make out any kind of outline to put a fix on the aircrafts shape. So I walk across the double highway, down the ditch and up to the fence.This gives me a lower but closer perspective, all the while looking at this thing to see if I can make its shape. When I reach the fence I begin to think this might be some new stealth vehicle the military is trying out because I don't hear a sound and still can't make out its outline.My eyes becoming more accustomed to the inky darkness I find a hard edge that leads up into the night sky and then to my utter shock begin to see the staggering size of this thing! I stumble back from the realisation that the inky darkness was part of a craft that was triangular in shape blotting out most of the bluff in the background, the horizon and part of the night sky. What I mistook at first to be just a lack of stars in that particular section of the sky was an enormous triangular shape that reached from above and just ahead of me to just below the horizon. The point forward seeming to be to my left bearing the red light under its tip.It was all I could do to see its shape. No one, no details and no sound. You could almost describe it as an absence of light. Having never heard of flying triangles as possible UFOs I didn't speak of this until 2001 when I read my very first report about them. I was very excited by the facts and descriptions regarding the triangles reported and discovering I wasn't alone in sighting a triangle. When I drove away from the object that night, I contented myself with the explanation that I had witnessed a military exercise for forty five minutes and always referred to it as such, never suspecting a possible UFO context. It was still there when I got up and left thinking what a mammoth airplane. Truly football field size as they say.  #3) -This final event involved my entire family of seven including myself and our elderly neighbor and his wife. It occurred on the night before the first Phoenix, Arizona flurry of multiple UFOs appeared. Those identical lights appeared here around 10 pm looking east over Waupoos Island towards Kingston, Ontario, Canada. They remained in the sky over Lake Ontario for several hours, were brighter than stars, orange/gold in colour, creating geometric patterns and remaining basically stationary. We went next door upon discovering the lights to watch them unobstucted from my neighbours deck. As some would vanish others would appear maintaining roughly 9 to 12 at any one time in the sky.It was an awesome display that none of us will ever forget and I'm still puzzled why no one else in our area reported seeing them. We didn't hear about the Phoenix lights until several days later when my son saw a report on mainstream news. One difference with our sighting though was the object that simultaneously flashed red and white lights, like a cop cars, to our immediate right looking south half way across the bay seemingly just sitting on the water while the orange light show was happening high in the sky towards the east.

I was driving Ford wrecker unit at the time and I decided to turn all the rotator lights on the truck.

It had lights that blinked and some that didnt change or blink.  I remember that I was frozen in my place I couldnt even speak.  I finally got my bearings and ran into the house to tell my mom about my sighting and franticly yell for a camera.

All I could think was INCREDIBLE, it moved that amount of distance in a matter of seconds.  I spent the night telling my friends about what I had seen and them not believing me.  It was when we were listening to the radio that night that when the announcer mentioned the object in the sky and asking anyone that had seen it to call the station.  I kept telling my friends that THAT was what I saw!  It is so very vivid in my head...I close my eyes and still see the craft and how it didnt make any noice when it moved over my house.

We made a stop at a rest area in louisville Kentucky.  After we had all gone to the bathroom and streched for a minute we headed back to the car.  We were on the road going on to the highway from the rest area when we noticed a huge object with lights way off in the distance.  Just joking my dad said ""Oh it's a UFO"".  Just as my dad had finished saying that the object started moving towards us at a fast rate of speed. As it approached we could tell that this object was very very huge.  It kept coming towards us untill it was literally right on top of our car.  I was so scared I clung to my friend in the back seat.  I couldn't believe what was going on.  The object that we saw hovered above our car about 3-4 stories above it.  It followed us for quite some time.  I know that what we saw was not from this earth.  We got a really close look at the thing.  The shape of it was triangular and it looked to be at least the size of a football field.  It was really big.  It also made no sound, which I thought was really strange.  It had three bright lights that were shining on our car, on on each point of the triangle.  The thing that bothers me the most about all of this is that I remember that it was hovering on top of our car one minute and then it seems like not long after that it went up slightly and then took off at an incredible rate of speed and vanished.  When we first saw the object it was around 11:00 p.m. after it left it was about 2:30.  I remember only seeing it for minutes.  what happened with that other time? Is it possible that I could have been abducted? This event has changed my life in so many ways.  I have been brought up believing that these things are make believe and that crazy people make up these stories to get attention.  I had to change many of my views and include the possibility that we may not know the full story.  I thought I would share this story in hopes that it may help other people to consider that there may be something out there.  I didn't believe or go looking for them.  It is so hard because I have only told a few select people about this.  People think you are crazy if they here this.

I looked down and I saw the trail of light this sphere had left behind as it made a figure eight around us. We are not sure if it made the figure eight around us once or twice.

PD)) I was taking in the day looking over a field from the golf course on Aviano AB, Italy, when suddenly an object appeared to be hovering at approximately 200 feet in the air. I would estimate the distance to be about 2 to 3 miles away, between the base and the town of Pordenone.  The shape was slightly triangular to diamond shaped on top, with a cylindrical extension coming from the bottom. It almost had the appearance of a very rounded, exaggerated arrow. The top portion consisted of distinctly separate tubes or cylindrical elements connected together, and rounded on the ends. The color was off white, like a white car that hadn't been washed in a while.  It seemed to shimmer in the sky like heat waves coming off of a hot road would shimmer. Size wise, it was if I was looking at a traffic cone in the sky. I have no idea how this relates to the actual size of the object in relation to the distance I presumed I was observiting it at, but that is the closest comparison I can make.  I was so amazed by what I saw, and was so intent on capturing as much detail in my mind as possible that I neglected to alert anyone in my group as to what I was witnessing. After what seemdd like 5 to 7 seconds, it simply vanished, and I had not looked away from the object even for a split second.  The day was sunny with near perfect visibility, the temperature was near 60 degrees F. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport,   Thanks for your quick response. I actually ((athletic activity deleted for anonymity sake)) with someone who works in the tower, and sort of tried to ask in a roundabout way if he had heard of any strange blips on the screen lately, but he said no. I mentioned my sighting to a few folks, and I can understand why so many people are hesitant to report their sightings, and especially those that feel they may have experienced abduction. I must say, it was infuriating and embarrassing at the same time listening to them make jokes about it. I dare say they would change their tune if they had seen what I had seen.  I read about a very dramatic UFO event here in Aviano which occurred in 1977. Is that the one you are referring to? Supposedly all the power on base got knocked out for about an hour until the craft slowly crept away over the mountains. There were both American and Italian witnesses. I read it in a big blue book about UFO's and an alleged worldwide governmental cover-up (Goodwin as the author, maybe?). There are some amazing stories in that book. I also read the book about the incident at Bentwaters, and many others on the subject.    I experienced one other sighting which I believe is worth mentioning. Would you like me to describe it in a reply E-mail, or would you like me to submit it on the website again? Also, I would have no problem with being contacted by the retired officer.  Sir, my wife and I are both keenly interested in the UFO phenomenon. What kinds of employment opportunities are available in the field? Thanks!

As soon as the light went out, power was restored.  The duration of the blue light was maybe 1 to 2 seconds. It was similar to lightning, except blue & intermittent with our electricity loss.

I have reviewed your recent listings of UFO sighings in the hopes that someone else saw what I did on April 4.  It seems that someone did see this fireball in Nashville, TN the same night.  We live in a rural area about 50 miles west of St. Louis. I am 55 years old and a bookkeeper for my husband's business.  I'm not real sure about the time, I know my clock said 3:00 am but I can't remember if I had turned the clock forward in my bedroom since daylight savings time started that previous Saturday. I know it was a couple of nights before I remembered to change it. (One of the advantages to working from your home, I am not chained to my clock.)  I was having a hard time getting to sleep that night and was laying facing my window which faces the South. I saw a large blue/white streak going parallel to the horizon traveling through the sky from the East to the West at about the 2 o'clock position.  The Nashville report did not state the direction the object was traveling.  I have seen many meteor showers before and this was quite different. It didn't travel in a completely straight path - seemed so sort of ""wiggle"" slightly up and down and get slightly thinner and fatter along its path. It almost looked like it was an object tumbling slightly along. The width of the streak was quite a bit wider than the width of a normal meteor shower streak. (Maybe about the width of a pencil at arm's length.)  The object traveled very fast. It was only in the view of my window for approximately 2 to 3 seconds, but was so bright that it left a glowing blue trail behind it. I can remember seeing the entire length of its path, including its slight up and down movements for a second or two after it passed by. Normal meteors fade almost as quickly as they are seen. Unusual also was the fact that I don't recall seeing a meteor travel almost perfectly parallel to the horizon like this before.  My feeling is it was probably something like space junk re-entering the atmosphere. Hopefully that would be something easily checked out.",2005-05-11T00:00:00,38.79,-90.8549

Out of the corner of my eye, I figured it for a plane, but it didn't move, and that's what got my attention.  It was probably a few blocks away from me, but hanging right above my street.  It was a row of strobing lights, tilted at about 25 or 30 degrees.  The lights strobed very fast, from left to right, emerging from around the side of the object, and disappearing around the other side.  They were mostly white and red, with a few blue strobes near the middle of the object.  The way the lights disappeared made the object appear to be either circular or triangular shaped.  It hung in the air silently for about one minute after I noticed it.  It was still hovering when I ran inside to try and get it on camera.  (I did what I could, but I used the video setting of my digital camera, and it came out very dark, and I don't have the technology to lighten it.)   After I returned, and tried to film it, it began to slowly move southward, down my street it seemed, and then curved to the southeast, out of my view.  It frightened me when I first saw it. Really scared me.  It took awhile for me to realize I could capture it on film.  When I got my camera, I fumbled it around a lot. I was shaken.  I know it was not a plane.  Two planes flew by later, following their normal east to west, or west to east paths that I see all day.  This object was very low in the sky. Probably less than 500 feet above the ground.  It was close enough that I should have heard some sound from an engine.  It was also huge. I can't say how big, but from one end of the strobing lights to the other, it was far bigger than any plane I've seen.  I'm even familiar with the sight of C-130's flying at night, having lived for two years at the Marine Military Academy, right next door to the Confederate Air Force, and an airport that allowed C-130's to practice touching down and lifting off.  This object had a solid row of strobing lights that moved in one direction.  I've seen no plane look like that before. It was not a plane.  It was also not a helicopter.  The only thing it COULD have been, besides being an unknown craft, is a blimp.  Actually, come to think of it, it couldn't have been even that.

I saw people pulled over on the freeway and thought it was wierd.   About 15 seconds later I noticed an army helicopter flying in a circle.  I looked straight ahead and saw a MASSIVE silver thing flying across the freeway from downtown towards the mountains.  This thing was shiny like my wedding band, and shaped like a cigar.  The helicopter was following this thing!  It crossed over I-25 about a mile ahead of me, and about 1000 - 1500 feet up in the air and was about the length of a basketball court.  I watched this for about a minute, and actually pulled over and got out of my car.  I lost sight of it over Invesco field.   DID YOU SEE THIS TOO?   I need to talk to someone that saw this thing too, so that I know I'm not crazy.  I have always been sort of a skeptic but I SAW THIS THING!   It flew slower than an airplane and it had NO WINGS,  NO FINS, and NO PROPELLERS.  It was like seeing a cigar dipped in silver flying slowly across the sky.  What was it?

When the white tank mountains came into view, we observed three (3) lights (white) that looked like they were on top on the north side of the mountains.  We watched them for at least thirty minutes dimming on and off.  There were no strob lights or the normal plane lights one would see.  When we arrived at my house we observed a large bright white light to the southwest of the white tank mountains.  This one was either much closer or much bigger than the other three that we had been watching.   My neighbors came out and started observing the big light with us.  About that time my wife and daughter,husband and two kids came home.  My daughter went and got my high powered binoculars and spotting scope.  With these we could see is a bigger brighter light. It seemed to have a red glow around it at times.  My brother deceided to drive down sun vally parkway west to give chase to it as it was moving off to the west.  By now an hour had passed.  As he got north of the white tank mountains they could still see they smaller lights above the mountains still stationary.   But now the biggest light was center of the mounatins some three or four hundred feet above the mounatin top headed west.  Sun Valley parkway turns at some point and heads due south, as they were now headed.   They started gaining on the object and could see 6 lights in a circle.  They followed it and watched it head toward the Palo Verde nuclear power plant.  They watch it for another 45 minutes before it finally fadded away.  I believe all air craft are required by law to have (strob lights) these had none..  They were diffently not flares, nor choppers. This is the second time in a year I have seen these lights over or behind or on top of these mountains..whats weird is we watched jets from Luke Air base flying all around but seemed to be oblivious to these lights.  I will be watching this site to see if others report anything? ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE)) Peter Thanks for taking the time out and speaking to me about this incident.. I would like to add I am a Vietnam Combat veteran and have seen every type of flare.  I have shot off hundred's of hand held flare's myself while in Vietnam.  I know what a flare looks like and how it reacts to wind and other climates.. These lights were NOT flares.. Flares do NOT move horizonally at the rate of speed these traveled when they left the area.  I will send you a map and try and get asmuth's for you..  I spoke to the friend in Tonapah, Az, whom I called that also wittness the light but unfortunately he doesnt want to get involved..  But I still have his location..  If you can send me your fax number I will put together a detailed map and fax it to you in the next few days..  I'am going out tonight with my camera and camcorder in hopes it will come back tonight.. My brother who was in the chase vehile will collaborate this story and give us a very good line of site on the map..  He wrote down the highway marker as they sat watching these lights..  He also would not mind speaking to whom ever is interested in listening Thanks again..

Was completely silent, close, and very large My girlfriend, brother, and myself we on our last day/night of vacation in North Myrtle Beach, S.C.  It was nearly the off-season and was pretty empty at the pool/patio area where we were.  We were at a table talking on the patio that borders the beach.   IT was a clear night and you could see stars, airplanes way up in sky, etc.  I was facing the beach, my brother on the left of me facing my girlfriend who was seated on the right of me.   I saw two lights appear about 400 yards out over the ocean  (orange-ish in color) that looked like wingtip lights of a large airplane that would be flying directly at us.  However it was much too low to be an airplane and it wasn't moving.  I got the attention of the two others with me who watched.   A 3rd (center light) then appeared.  The object was silent and not moving.  Then the lights disappeared.  It was there for a total of about 5 seconds.  We watched the ocean, waiting for something to happen.   About 4 minutes later the object reappeared closer and a bit to the left now.  It was now at about 200 yards (close) and it was not moving at all.  It was completely silent and you could see 3 lights rotating to the left (clockwise).  It had more lights but you could only see 3 at a time as the object was rotating in place on it's axis.   We were all shocked and my girlfriend who is a complete skeptic just kept saying ""Oh my God, Oh my God.""    It stayed in the same spot (silently hovering) for about 15 seconds and then the lights turned off all at once and it was gone.  It did not reappear.   I noticed about 5 guys gather on the beach after this occured who were pointing toward the ocean.  I believe they saw the object also but to my regret, I did not ask them about it.   Did anyone else see this?   I know airplane types, sounds, and statistics VERY well and this object was not an airplane, balloon, or normal aircraft of any kind.  It was very large (about 20 yards across), silent, and extremely stable.  It was almost like it was looking at the coastline from the ocean, then left.   Needless to say, my girlfriend is now a believer.

Or a ring surrounding a fixed point, that's what I was staring at.  But it was clouds.  And the moon was at the EXACT center.  The cloud formation had to be a couple of miles in diameter.

Driving from Beth-shemesh toward Kiryat-Gat.  First I saw 3 lights over the hills a head. At the first couple of minutes  I Thought it was sort of military aircraft activity. Then the 3 distance lights splitted while two of them maintained about 500m ahead about 500m- 1000m high above the road, and the 3rd went down. I would guess to about 100m or less above my car.  No extra-ordinary lights were seen beside the exact triangular shape of the object. No effect was seen on the car, everything kept working as it was prior to the encounter.  Also it is the first time I'm reporting here, I wish to say that it wasn't the first time me or members of my family have encountered such objects. more then that, some members of my family (my brother and I) have some strange marks, mostly on our hands and legs. Short streight elevated lines under our skin (about 1cm long each). Also I have a Ph.D. in physics, I can not explain the sights. But still, we know so little about our universe.

When they finally caught up they made a triangular formation for about a minute, then lined up in a row.    At that point i drove to another friends house at about 11:35pm and when i got to his house he said the first light had turned from red to yellow (color of a star) but the last two red lights were still there.
