The lights were moving in the same direction at first but randomly separated; my husband said it could be a meteor shower until some of them stopped and changed direction.  Then several more began to appear directly above us as if they were coming from nowhere, traveling in the same direction, at the same speed, the same distance apart from each other.  We tried capturing pictures and video but the lights didn’t appear on camera.  After several minutes in the same formation, the objects separated and began traveling in random directions, some disappearing and reappearing, others completely disappearing.

On August 3, 2020 at approximately 1:00 AM I was woke up by the rustling of several large oak trees.  I looked out my window up to the sky and saw a thin contrail.  It was in the opening in the sky that was covered by a huge gray cloud.  There were only a few areas in the sky not covered by the gray mass. I thought it was unusual for a contrail to be in the sky at one am so I kept looking.  A bright light appeared in an opening in the gray mask that was to the right.  It was slowly moving and disappeared into the gray mass.  Then I saw two more bright lights that were horizontally opposite of each other.  In my opinion it seemed like the first light could have been in the center of these two forming a triangle.  Then the the two lights disappeared into the gray mass as it appeared to cover the entire sky at that point.  The next day I looked at our security cameras and unfortunately they do not reach the sky area; however, at the same time I saw the lights i! n the sky an unusual shadow was covering our backyard which gradually disappeared.  I checked other nights at that time and for the entire week there were no shadows on the ground showing only on the night I saw the lights in the sky on August 3, 2020 at 1 AM. Thank you.

There was one spot in each side of the circle across from each other that was a gap in the light.  We proceeded tk take photos and videos in the sky and throught the telescope.  Looking with the naked eye or phone camera it looked like a star.  However the telescope showed its true form.  Higher than thr planes in the sky it stood in the same spot.  Not moving an ich it seemed to flex from circle to oval shaped.  We all sat staring until around 8:36 pm the clouds covered the craft from sight.

As we exit onto the balcony we notice the clouds are making very strange geometric patterns and as the lighting storm continues and becomes upon us there is one short burst of light reminiscent of the Northern Lights immediately followed by another burst of the same color light that exposed this massive dome structure in which we could very clearly discern the edges of the craft and the height in which it reached into the sky.  My roommate and I were both immediately hit with this immense feeling of fear which made us not only brace but bring each other in closer.  The structure was not visible for longer than a strike of lightning would last and after it hit our neighbor came out onto their balcony but did not seem to notice us.  My girlfriend who also witnessed it didn’t feel the same sort of fear that my roommate and I experienced. She seemed to be completely unaffected by what she saw which makes us believe that my roommate and I were possibly abducted then placed back in what seems to be absolutely no time at all.  Which would also in our perspective explain as to why our neighbor did not acknowledge or notice us even know we had been talking rather loudly.  After the structure made it self apparent and then left we did not seem any further signs and in the next few minutes the geometric shapes in the clouds no longer seemed to be there.

I went outside to look at the bright moon approximately 1:30 AM.  I stay up late usually.  My back yard sits on a large river.  From where I stood out back, facing southeast, I saw this very bright, mostly round, solid circle in the ski and it was moving at a very slow speed towards the moon.  The moon was more in the South position at this time. I realized it was not a star as it was surely in earth’s atmosphere.  It was just too close to be a star. At first I thought it was one of those lanterns you can light up and send in to the sky, but the way it moved up and then horizontally, and then would be stationary in the sky, plus, it seemed to also get larger then smaller. It’s light didn’t flicker as a lantern would so I ruled out that thought. I observed that I could not see one other star in the ski that night. Not one.  It seemed to hide in the clouds and then pop out where the cloud had a separation. It almost seemed “shy”.  I knew it was unusual so I grabbe! d my phone and took pictures to the best of my ability. I took many pictures trying to get a good focus but it wasn’t easy. I also tried to video tape the object, with my phone,  but the videos did not work. My videos remained black. I then used binoculars and the object seemed to have tentacles that also lit up. In the center of the round part seemed to have darker shades as in a nucleus. I took many pictures and in one pic, where it took a double shot (moving picture), the object obviously shoots out a plume! In another picture, there is a pale blue looking object next to it. Another picture seems to show the object sideways and it appears the be crescent shaped. I watched this object for about 40 minutes and because of it getting so late and it just was so slow, I went to bed.

I thought it was strange for Venus to be so orange and bright and high at this hour, so I slowed my car and pointed my EarthSky app in its direction and got nothing that should have been there. Venus was below the horizon and like I said, it was bigger and brighter than when I’ve seen even Arcturus or Sirius at their brightest. And it was VERY ORANGE. I drove to the end of the road where a public boat launch is located. I come to this place often to look at the stars due to the wide-open viewing area over the lake. At this point, the orange light was much lower in the sky, hanging just above the houses on the opposite shore of the lake (looking straight out from the boat launch, which is SW…to my left are the Great Smoky Mountains in the S and to my right are the distant lights of our small downtown to the W…where I watch the sunset). The light appeared motionless as if it were a planet (even though it clearly wasn’t as high as it had been a few minutes earlier). I viewed the light through my binoculars which I rested on the roof of my car to stabilize my view. It looked like an orange sphere with maybe even a black shadow on the right side. I got back in my car and I took a video with my iPhone8plus through my open passenger window. The time stamp on the video is 8:01pm and the video is 48 seconds long. The camera is zoomed in to its max and you can see the light hovering over the house iights on the opposite shore. Even though the video is shaky, the light never appeared to move or even “twinkle” to my eye. I quit recording and continued to attempt identification with my sky app (and make sure it was properly calibrated). As I pointed my phone towards the light about a minute and a half later, the light was gone. . GONE. I immediately filmed again to say “it’s gone !” and the timestamp on that 26 second video is 8:04pm. I never detected movement of the light with my naked eye (like one would with a plane or a satellite), but I clearly observed this light at two very different heights above the horizon within minutes…and then the light just not being there at all.

Though I live out of state now, I’m familiar with the area as I grew up there. My wife wanted to visit Crossroads Plaza in Cary, North Carolina for a quick Black Friday shopping stop, we brought our younger son and left our older son at home with my parents. On the way back from shopping, we pulled into Brass Lantern Court, it was a few minutes before 8 pm. My wife and I saw five pulsing green lights and a large object, beyond the trees, out of the front window. The object was like a rectangle with a triangle on one side --- I don't know what this shape is called but, basically, imagine a rectangle and on one of the short sides of the rectangle imagine a triangle. This is clearly the same lights/object that is visible on these links below, however, these links show the object far away, but I saw this right above me in the cul-de-sac of Brass Lantern Court and followed it during a short drive: - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCmewxCeJEKpeSMTy-4VauQ/videos - https://ufostalker.com/sighting/119427 The pulsing green lights, the slow and stable (almost hovering) movement, and the dimensions of the object in these videos are exactly what I saw right above me, blocking out much of the sky. I saw it first and mentioned it to my wife, who was in the backseat taking care of our seven-month-old. When I first saw it, I was driving down Brass Lantern Court, I imagine the object was above the cul-de-sac of either Tupenny Lane or Dawsons Mill Run (shown on map). Initially, for the first few seconds or first minute as we were driving down Brass Lantern, the object was mostly visible through the pine trees but part of it was visible above the tree line. As I drove down Brass Lantern Court to the cul-de-sac the object came over the tree line of the Brass Lantern Court cul-de-sac and banked at what appeared to be at about a 30- or 45-degree angle compared to the ground, pretty much above the cul-de-sac and the lawn next to the cul-de-sac. So, I could see the object more or less right above me and without any obstruction. A structure was clearly visible with five green lights at the edges. I could see a normal dim glow of the night sky behind the object and five lights and in between the five lights, it was completely dark, indicating a solid object. It was a clear contrast to the dim glow of the night sky. The object wasn’t far from me but I could not hear any sound. Had it occurred to me, I should have lowered my car windows but even with windows up, it was kind of shocking to see something so large, hovering and then moving, and to have the soft hum of the car engine be the only sound that was audible at the time. In the moments I saw it unobstructed in the cul-de-sac of Brass Lantern Court, the object filled much of the front windshield of my SUV. I would guess it was about 2 to 4 times higher than the tree line and if I extended my arms and held a piece of paper at arm’s length, this object took up about the same amount of my visual field as say an A2 or maybe even an A1 piece of paper. Probably closer to A2 size, I think. So, someone can do the math as to an estimated size of this object --- 2x-4x higher than the tree line (these are the common pine trees you find all over NC) and it would have filled a space in my visual field equivalent of about an A2 paper (or a bit larger) if my arms would be extended out. The object began moving down Brass Lantern / Penny Road (i.e., towards the west or towards to southwest), so I turned around in the cul-de-sac of Brass Lantern Court and drove back up the street. I’ve attached a map to illustrate the short route I followed while I still had visual contact. But, basically, to put the route shown on the map in words: I drove up Brass Lantern Court, turned left on Old South Road, turned right on Penny Road, and followed it down Penny Road for about three minutes. There was continual visual contact through the drive shown in the map. I lost visual contact after driving over Lake Johnson. I thought I could catch it but I came up the hill after passing the bridge on Lake Johnson and I could not re-establish visual contact. The map represents the route we took following the object. The start of the map is Brass Lantern Court and the end of the map is the point we lost sight on Penny Road. After losing visual contact, we continued down Penny Road for ten or fifteen minutes but could not see anything so I went back to my parent’s home to drop off my wife and seven-month-old. My wife has a better camera on her cell phone than I have so I asked her for her cell. As I was in the front seat, she gave it to me as I turned on Penny Road but her phone basically died as soon as I started filming the object. I took out my cell phone which doesn’t have a great camera (original Surface Duo) but by the time I could start filming we'd lost sight of the object. I was driving and trying to film at the same time so I wasn't that fast. I went out immediately afterward with a good Canon camera with a full battery, which I picked up at home, but could not find the object or see it again. In total, including the drive down Brass Lantern (one min or so), a few moments in the Brass Lantern cul-de-sac (one min or so), and the driving trying to follow it (as shown in the map, three min or so), the object was visible to my wife and me consistently for about five minutes. Any of the movements performed would be possible for a drone or maybe a helicopter --- I did not see the object do anything that, say, a drone could not do. But the object was massive, it blocked out a large part of the sky (or a large part of my front windshield) when it was directly above me and higher than the tree tops and completely silent the whole time. It hovered, changed direction, and moved very quickly within five minutes.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,,

The craft did not make any noise, unlike any type of thing my wife and I had ever seen. This craft had unusual orange lighting, also unlike anything my wife and I had seen. If I was to guess the size I would say it was 15x15. At first it seemed like a disk, as it glided past us it then seemed to be a triangle based on the orange lighting on the craft. It stayed low in the sky and continued to move out into the distance about a mile out, where it seemed to pause in mid air and hover. The craft stayed in this position a mile out for the remainder of the sighting. After watching the craft for a few minutes in awe we decided to move to the next exhibit and gave up on watching as it was bitterly cold and stopped moving.

I thought that it was a meteor, at first. I noticed its acceleration and gave extreme notice. It was then that I noticed the second object ahead of the first and traveling in the same direction (north). The second object was much smaller and less bright. Both objects moved to within a few degrees of directly north. The first object began a slight, curving turn to the left and began to fade away ( as if to move into the earths shadow ). A few seconds later, the second object faded from view and with no turning noticed, as with the preceding object. They disappeared in the reference vicinity of two stars to the distant left and 'below' teh orion constellation. I notified a friend who was behind me by some miles in his aircraft (40 - 50 nm). He remarked that it was probably an aircraft, given the large number of them in the area. This was not possible. I have seen aircraft all of my life. These objects had none of the characteristics of aircraft and were either in the extreme upper atmoshere or in space. They looked very similar to satellites moving overhead. This is unlikely, in my opinion, due to the fact that the first object began a slight, parabolic turn to my left. Approximately 2 minutes after the initial sighting, the objects reappeared in the same fasion as before. They moved in the same fashion and direction as previously noticed. The smaller object was in the lead, as before. I noticed them this second time directly above. They moved in the same direction as before in almost an identical path. The fact that I saw them a second time is why I am writing this. If these objects were satellites, they would not have been seen twice, moving in identical fashion along the same route. During this second sighting, the! re was no turning motion seen. They were directly in tandem and some distance apart. My friend behind me observed the same phenomenon and stated that he saw the objects turn slowly to the right. I did not observe this. I did observe that they 'faded' from view in virtually the same position as before. They were not seen again. Approximately 2 minutes after the second sighting, I queried ATC to the effect of ' did they see two objects very high directly above Dallas aand at extreme altitude'. The response was 'negative'. I have a question for my reader-Does the space shuttle move south-north? Is it capable of retracing its path in a very short time, in what must have been a large distance? Can it turn in orbit to appear to be curving to one side? This is the only possible solution I can give. Given the fact that there were two objects, I am at a loss for an explanation.",1998-03-07T00:00:00,32.83516807743405,-96.80811785917632

I looked up and saw a round shiny bright object in the sky.  We’ve been having issues with neighbors setting off illegal fireworks, for a quick moment I thought that’s what I was viewing until I realized it was more of a very bright stationary orb and much higher up than a firework, or even the planes in the area go.  I watched it for a couple of minutes and asked my husband to go inside and get his phone for me so that I could try and get video of it.  I recorded three small videos, the whole time the orb stayed in the same location until the last video, after recording the last one and then watching it on my husband’s phone I didn’t think I had footage of the object until we watched it on our computer; around the 00:08 second mark you can see the object quickly fly off to the left of the screen, I was still recording afterwards because neither myself or my husband had seen the object fly off.  I apologize for the shaky hand, I was having a hard time trying to focus on the object and hold the phone still. If I had to compare the object I’d say it appeared to be as high up as Saturn or Jupiter have been appearing lately when they pass. It was in the East. I’m having a hard time guessing the altitude but it was much higher than any of the planes we have fly over in the area, no sound emitted from the object. There is some background noise in the video from our neighbors as well as some traffic noise, if the object did have any noise it would have been too far up for us to hear it. We did have an airplane flying much lower, we are near flight paths for LAX, Long Beach, and Santa Ana. There was also a police helicopter that flew by, but much lower and towards the West, it didn’t seem to be out to look at the object, we’ve had some crime in the area lately and it’s not uncommon for the helicopter to be out at all hours of the day. I’m curious to know if you think this is a UFO or maybe just something like a drone breaking FAA flight regulations.  I know that drones can reach very high altitudes even though they aren't supposed to.  However, I’ve never seen a drone that could take off as fast as this object appears to, or emit a light like that during the day.",2020-07-03T00:00:00,33.83243273727648,-117.89132517193949

I live in a small town called New Castle. New Castle is about 3 hours west from the states capitol of Denver, Colorado.  On Thursday, July 2nd, my girlfriend and I decided to go for a late in the night drive along a winding dirt road, miles away from any civilization, Buford Road. Found a private quiet place to park, not a soul in sight. Up high in the mountains, giving us a excellent view of the sky in the dead of summers night.  After a long day, and a long night of adventuring we both decided to get some shut eye camping in my Suzuki.  Now this is where things start getting weird.  Neither of us have any recellection of attempting to close our eyes to sleep or falling asleep, however every time I have a experience there is a trans- like paralysis state I’m always in.  The last few times I’ve been able to resist this state, therefore I now have some memories intact. I first remember looking out my driver side window seeing a being that was barely able to peek over the car into the window, which was very small in length, not even reaching 4ft.  The body was only a few inches wide, head was shaped similar of a old fashioned iron. Having large oblong jet black eyes, with a slit of red sitting in the center.  The beings appearance represented how a abstract painting looks, if that makes any sense? I then look over towards the passenger seat.  This feeling felt as if there is an invisible force pushing back on you as you try to move anything to keep you in place, in a state somewhere between reality and the dreaming relm.  There was one sitting right there next to me! Appeared to be identical to the same one looking through my window moments ago. In the backseat sitting was a friend of mine (who happens to be my girlfriend now).  That being had startled me enough to the point that led me to take a swing, able to make contact with my fist, all while knowing she was back there.  Once making full-on contact, The Being then disappeared, leaving me with a sore hand, now convinced this is all very real.  While still in a paralyzed state, mentally and physically I was able to understand what was going on. Which helped me manage to get a grip, and to focus. Focused just enough I was now able to take control, freeing myself choosing to slam down onto the steering wheels ! horn.  Instantly had started yelling for girlfriend, almost begging to look up at starry eyed sky.  Both now with our heads cocked straight back, I noticed the same light from before catching my attention, making me curious once again.  This unknown light was now brighter than all the others, now appearing much closer.  Watching intentivlely as the light emitted a shower of sparks as it darted across the sky… and was gone. The next morning I tried calling rifle airport (the nearest airport) to inquire about if they had a radar and they told me the nearest one would be all the way in Denver.  I did not call Denver seeing as I am sure they wouldn’t have told me if something had of appeared on radar. This is just one experience of many.  I have woke up one time on a road that did not connect to the road I was on before the experience.  I’ve woken up 30 miles away in the wrong direction.  I have even came to one time going about 30 miles per hour on I-70 with traffic flying by me honking their horn.",2020-07-09T00:00:00,39.4693,-107.51350000000001

There's a pretty large lake hearing Galesburg.  We like to go on walks at night out there and never had any problems other than raccoons pestering us.  So about 2 weeks ago we get to this really dark part of the trails that's kind of deeper in the woods.  And we heard something very large falling like it's going to land on our heads.  I yanked her out of the way and look back and see something almost hit the ground but don't.  I don't know how else to explain it but then it was gone.  I chalked it up as Shadows playing tricks on me or something.  She thought it was weird and she doesn't believe in anything paranormal, UFO, or spiritual related.  Then a few days after that we are walking again and something very similar happens you can hear something dripping through the trees kind of violently.  Every time we just kind of brush it off but we're really freaked out.  So then just a few days ago we go ou! t walking again and get to the same exact spot on the trail.  And we look up and there is something about 4 ft tall standing maybe 30 feet in front of us. At first I thought it might have possibly been a deer but she seen it too.  I told her to give me her flashlight really fast.  She gave it to me I shined up it was no deer.  Before I could even get a flashlight on it this thing was ripping through the woods at a very fast pace.  I don't know who to call.  The police would all think I'm a crazy person and I don't want to jeopardize my family.  Unless there is a methed out naked midget in the woods throwing stuff and stalking us I don't know what else to say.  We are really freaked out. We have encountered something in the same spot three different times.  This location is the Deep spot of the Woods at Lake Storey on the far end like you were heading out towards the country.

It would move to the right for half a second and then to the left.  At roughly 2219 I grabbed my phone and started to record it both on video and still pictures. The more I watched it the more random and steady the movements became. at about 90% of the way though the duration on my viewing it became very almost deliberate and at the last moment it shot to the south west and covered 2-3 miles in less than a second and was gone.

They experienced virtually the same thing as me but I am 150+ miles to the NW of that area.

The object in question was mostly stationary in the sky only varying a pattern of clockwise movement in a minute fashion, and was slowly rotating on axis.

My husband was the first to spot it while he was resting on a chaise after some yardwork. Initially he thought it might be “floaters” in his eye, but then he was able to repeatedly see it even after looking away.  He called for me to come out and see.  The object appeared as a  star that was visible almost straight overhead, and about at 1:00 to the west.  It was 11:00AM on the morning of August 4, 2020.  We continued to observe it for at least an hour with initially our naked eye and then with two different pairs of binoculars.  It appeared to be reflecting the sun in a clear blue sky, not emitting its own source of light.  With the naked eye it appeared as a star.  With binoculars it took on an oblong shape, according to my husband. To me, it was oblong , but I could also  see some angles and an obvious red color at one end of the structure.  Once I told my husband that I clearly saw the red spot, he was able to also make it out to a degree ,though not as clear to him as it was to me. I almost think I was seeing an airplane like shape, with the red area being on the upper left, but being unable to keep the binoculars steady enough for long enough, I can’t be certain. It was pretty much stationary for the entire time.

This security system is an ""ReoLink,"" equipped with infra-red capabilities. At approximately 9:20pm, the criminals arrived home & began unloading objects from the car, to the house. At approximately 21:29, I noticed a very large bright light signature on my infra-red monitor (Smartphone, see attached security camera photo.) This light on the monitor was NOT blinking, like most normal airplanes & helicopters. It was shaped like a disc & had a protrusion on top. (It resembled a lid on a cooking pot, complete with the knob handle.)  It was a full moon that night, not a cloud in the sky & stars, too many to count. It was quite clear that night. The skys were very busy with Homeland Security airplanes. I believe they're the aircraft's that have that quick blink Police car Mars lights. I counted 6 planes in the eastern skys, before the UFO manifested itself from thin air. I watched this non blinking UFO for a couple minutes & decided to step outside to look at this object with my own eyes. I took my Smartphone/monitor with me. I stepped out onto my northern/front porch, looked toward the eastern sky & could NOT locate the bright object, all I could see were distant flashing DHS Flashing airplane lights, however, when I looked at my Smartphone/monitor, IT WAS THERE, CLEAR AS DAY & large, bright, silent & stationary!!!  I did a double take! Again, I looked into the eastern sky with my naked eyes & saw nothing but distant blinking DHS airplane lights, then I once again looked at my Smartphone & there it still was, just silently floating there, huge & bright!!!  I ran inside & informed the Mrs. that the object was INVISIBLE! I left the monitor on the table where she was sitting & this time, I ran to the other porch, on the eastern side of my house. Again, the large bright, glowing object was not there. I ran back in the house & the object was still on my infra-red monitor, silently hovering in place & stationary. Again, I exclaimed to the Mrs., ""THAT THING IS INVISIBLE!""  She decided she wanted to take a look for herself & just as she got up to go to the eastern porch, we noticed on my infra-red monitor, another object suddenly turned as bright as the first one & it was right next to the original object!!  I wpuld estimate that these objects were over or near the ""T&K Cattle Farm"" on route 84 & Miller Road, 2.5 miles from my home.  The two objects then proceeded to fly directly west in our general direction & covered 2 miles in about 3 seconds & they stopped on a dime, very close to the twin mountains near my house! There they remained, silent, no noise whatsoever, hovering, bright & bigger than before due to proximity. This was observed by me & the Mrs. on my Smartphone in infra-red mode. The UFOs stayed stationary for about 3 or 4 seconds, then they flew off at a high rate of speed toward the southwest, in the direction of the Barry Goldwater Military Firing Range.  We concluded that either our military has an amazing technology that enables an aircraft to travel over 3600 m.p.h., silent & cloaked, invisible to the naked eye OR it was NOT one of ours, from this dimension. I know that sounds crazy, but I know what we saw! It was a one in a million chance encounter.

I was out taking a walk like I usually do in the evenings in the area of south university neighborhood in Eugene a few blocks away from the University of Oregon when I just happened to look up to see what I thought was maybe an airplane or satellite flying southwestward.  What made me realize that this craft was not either an airplane or satellite was when the orange-colored, star-shaped orb stopped in mid-air, started flying southward, then stopped again, only to then start to move down towards the ground. The UFO seemed to first start heading in my direction, being eastward, but then suddenly stopped and began heading southwestward.  When it started moving towards the ground I knew for certain that this was a UFO.  The entire incident lasted about 15-30 seconds. The road I was walking down was a steep hill, which gave me somewhat of a range to see around the area which would be Amazon Park.  This orange-colored orb-shaped UFO seemed to be flying almost directly above the area of Amazon Park.  The aircraft looked like a very orange star.  If the aircraft hadn’t been moving I would most certainly have mistaken it for a star in the evening sky and kept walking. This aircraft also did not make any noise.  If this had been a helicopter or airplane I would have heard it. And man-made aircraft cannot stop mid-air and suddenly change directions.  This was something completely out of this world (maybe even literally).",2020-08-20T00:00:00,44.039544983277594,-123.12515735785954

I wanted to stall our walk on the North-Eastern corner to get her a better background as the sun would be dropping below the horizon and gives an incredible view. As we walked up and down the northern stretch gathering panoramic and regular still images of the skyline, I noticed a peculiar shape that did not align naturally and drew my eye to it.  After I thought I lost it behind the moving clouds, Marcia, a sheriff‘s deputy here in Laramie County, still had eyes on it and helped me reacquire it. At that point, I was able to capture it on my iPhone with some not so flattering commentary. As we walked home, it started to move and was what I thought was something slowly crashing through the atmosphere, and we could witness breaking up into smaller pieces like the shape of salmon steak and much more brightly reflective than the more massive body which started to thin, and the wind revealed it to be a formed cloud. I decided to not waste time walking the rest of the loop and cut through the undeveloped land full of live tumbleweeds in sandals just to hurry and grab my pair of Nikon Aculon A211 10x22x50 binoculars to help determine what we were watching. I called my parents, who reside an hour north of me (Fort Laramie), and see if they could see anything or not. They could not, so I sent her some images trying to show what we were witnessing while trying to talk through what it possibly could be. Marcia and I continued to talk with my mother on the phone and pass the binoculars back and forth as we watched this object seed clouds in little lines and change angles, descend and ascend while hovering above a wind farm and turbines we have out in the West/Southwest or eight o’clock with proper North orientation. I had purchased an adapter for the binoculars that I could also use on a telescope and spotting scope come this hunting season and allow me to attach my iPhone to and capture images by magnification. Remembering I had it is a box from my recent move, I left the road in front of my house to quickly grab it to prove what we couldn’t describe. By the time I found the bracket adapter and made it outside, Marcia had lost it, and I swept the last known location, and I too could not locate any further trace.",2020-09-04T00:00:00,41.149224771404825,-104.82391246882793

I took my binoculars (50x10) perhaps to show the kids airplanes, Jupiter and some stars.  We are south of the Indianapolis International Airport, so usually there's a lot of light pollution, light pollution was still plentiful however there was a flight coming from south towards the airport and I asked my son to have a look with the binoculars. As the flight passed right on top of our heads I noticed this very bright light approaching from North East (over 2 o'clock if pointing North).  I excitedly asked my son that was using the binoculars to look at it (wife, sons and little daughter were there), few seconds later I got the binoculars. When looking this object (roughly at the brightness of Jupiter) I didn't see any blinking light or discernible light, so I thought it could have been the ISS, I have seen it before, but with a 10 times magnification is a bit squarish (I have seen it before).  I asked my elder daughter to pass me her phone so that I could check the ISS using her data, but to my surprise it was on an orbit to South America, hence, I'm writing this. When I checked the phone the time was 9:56 PM, thus my reported time is approximated, if possible to trace that airplane passing overhead the time would be found precisely. 15 minutes later there was another less bright UFO (I call it such because I checked it with binoculars and was not a plane), this was from the direction of the airport towards South.  On addition, I have seen an object following the same path before, but not this bright.  And few minutes later the same will go in the other direction... sincerely they seem too bright to be satellites.  At this main one I'm reporting I'm pretty sure was way too bright. After the second UFO my wife started complaining about me being too excited and noisy, and told me that she has seen it multiple times once even during the day, just a light, same direction.",2020-08-27T00:00:00,39.80764884833982,-86.14221402931499

My friend and I decided to take a walk on the beach at around 1:30 am after a long night of talking catching up.after about 20 minutes we noticed three bright lights on the sand, we thought they were police checking the area for trespassares.  So we didn’t think much of it. We then noticed two of the light sources started to create a line between each other... it looked like a beam interchanged between two sources.  Fast forward, these lights disappeared we figure it was some kind of weird glitch in some security light...  we then notice a light that looked into the ocean.  It was white... shining very bright. We noticed a smaller green light flying over it... moving very fast all over the place. I mean like very disoriented.. nothing we have every seen before. I was a believer and the first thing I thought was aliens and I thought my friend would think I was absolutely crazy by my idea but when we both saw we looked at each other. The look on my friends face was shocking he was! absolutely startled... I was too. We both saw the same thing. These light forces moving ramp idly with no distingued pattern or direction.. around the light source. At one point it seemed to dive into the ocean and back out. It would shine bright.. move and then disappear and appear again. It would make sudden movements and we would both look at each other. It would then stop and align with the bigger “light source” and then move about again. We watched it for about 40 minutes. I shined my light at it (blinked twice) and it disappeared... then shined back twice. And disappeared and we got to scared and walked away. We both realized this was an experience we will remember forever. We thought hard about what we might have seen but there just doesn’t seem to be any explanation to a light moving that rapidly and that unorganized like it did. We both knew what we saw but it seems unreal right now. I’m writing this because My friend and I truly believe we saw something out of th! e ordinary tonight.",2020-08-27T00:00:00,,

A 7am morning sky was busy with military aircraft & a grand array of contrails as far as my 11 year old daughter's & my eyes could see. Leaving my neighborhood, we spotted a lightning bolt-like imprint from mid-sky to the ground in a field nearby. I parked at a place I knew the view could be vast. At 8 am, as multitudes of jets & US Gov aircraft flew back & forth, a star-like object was seen flitting around. It then got closer & I was able to get several photos. They show an oval-like shape with 3 rectangular lights, but each image looks a bit different. That could be because it was a ""lightship"" and/or because it was moving so quickly. The skies were busy with jets & planes all day. In my backyard at 8pm, I witnessed what looked like a large dark ship, oval or rounded square, with changing lights, stationed above the horizon. I got in my car in hopes that I would get to it. On my drive, my daughter counted 23 jets. I noticed that the closer I thought I got to the ship, the smaller it became. I originally thought that was because it was moving further away, but then realized that it was also changing locations in the sky. As jets got closer to it, it would quickly move locations, as if in the speed of light. It also seemed to morph into different shapes & the changing colors were brilliant & bright.

The two discs were overlapping with one another slightly, and looked almost as if they were on a different “level” from one another.

The sky was mostly clear with a thunderstorm offshore to the SE, 10 miles or so out.  Temp was 77 degrees F. At that time, three very bright orange lights appeared in the sky ENE over the water, approximately 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon.  They were much larger and brighter than the stars, and initially looked like military flares, but they didn't fall.  The lights stayed in place for 5-10 seconds before fading out. At that point, 6-8 tiny white lights appeared in their place.  They were much smaller and dimmer than the orange lights had been and they resembled conventional aircraft when viewed at night from a great distance.  However, they were blinking randomly, did not appear to use conventional navigation lights, and were moving erratically in different directions.  Three of them headed NE while the others moved SW. We observed them for around 4-5 minutes before they disappeared from view. Within about 10 minutes, the large, bright orange lights reappeared a little further down the beach toward the SW. Initially, one light would appear in place, lasting 5-10 seconds before fading out.  Then another would do the same a few minutes later.  They were not launched from the surface nor dropped from any aircraft. A few minutes later, a chain of three orange lights appeared, flaring up in succession, one after the other, in a straight line in tight formation.  This chain was perhaps 10 degrees above the horizon.  They then faded out in the same order they appeared. After this, two appeared and then disappeared in the same manner.  Then, a chain of four appeared and disappeared in the same manner.  All of these “light chains” appeared in a range that was 10-15 degrees above the horizon.

I was an airborne paratrooper in the military and I am familiar with all domestic and foreign aircraft. I’ve flown and jumped out of many fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. I’m also an electrical engineer. After about a minute of observance. I realized this was something different. Something I’ve never witnessed before. I consider myself a man of science and I am a true sceptic of unexplained events. Until there are answers I will be impacted by this event. Initially we noticed 3 objects in a Triangle formation. Orange in color and possibly pulsating. The objects seen to be coming towards us and then they appeared to be retreating in the north direction. These objects seem to be at an altitude of approximately 4000 ft. Approximate size and shape if the illuminated objects were 20ft to 100ft in diameter. As we continued our walk the 3 initial objects became blocked by the trees. At that time my niece noticed anther object higher in altitude and to the North East of the other objects. As we observed this object we noticed an even more faint object to the East of that object. This one eventually faded out like a dimmer switch to a light. We then regained sight of the first 3 objects. At this time, we saw one on the objects fade out. Then reappear to the west approximately 5 to 10 miles away from its last seen position.

After a while I noticed there was a pattern, and I think what I was seeing was one very large craft with two lights on each side of it, and it was spinning and rotating. It was very high up in the sky, so high that the lights were so dim my camera wouldn't catch it, but if it was one large object, it must have been enormous. It looked quite abnormal.  Watching it actually made me a little dizzy.  I couldn't really say how high up it was, but it seemed very high up and the craft VERY large. I was watching it for several minutes, maybe 5-10 minutes, before it slowed down and then made a dead stop, and hoovered in the air in the same spot for the remaining time I was at the park, at least 20 more minutes, and just appeared to be two stars, one brighter one on the left and a dimmer one on the lower right.

We were traveling on Hemlock Farms Road in a community called Hemlock Farms in a town called Lords Valley. The road was going South west. To our left side, we saw an object about a dime's length in size out our driver side window going somewhat faster than the car but not exceedingly so. It was fairly big as far as a signature goes. The sighting began at exactly 7:37 PM as we looked at the dashboard clock. We are seasoned observers and do not submit reports nilly-willy. It eventually pulled very far ahead of us in the course of one to two minutes. It was a triangle. It had all yellow lights. The lights were along the front two lengths of the object. About 4 on each side. And there were at least 4 more lights in what would be the body of the craft behind the before mentioned perimeter lights. It was bright! The object was fairly low so that is why we perceived it as a dime sized object which is fairly large as far as sightings go. No FRA green or red lights. All yellow. Total about 10 to 12 yellow lights. The pattern was like a ike a Christmas tree traveling on its side. It had an inordinate amount of lights on it. It was not perceived by anyone in the car as a normal aircraft. Maximum speed probably under 100 mph based on how fast it gradually pulled ahead of us at our speed of 40 mph. We looked it up on Flightradar24.com. We began the search at 7:15 pm. local time (5 hours earlier than UTC time). There were no aircraft over the location 15 minutes before or prior. Thus, this object did not have a transponder. It was high enough above the radar line that it should show up on flightradar24. Based on our position, and the low perceived altitude, we take a ball park guess that the object was larger than a large heli and smaller than a Boeing 737. Windows closed so we heards no engines. My dad is a UFO Investigator with MUFON . He was with me when I saw this. He agreed it was unusual and told me our area is ripe with UFO reports including triangles this year. Apparently there are corresponding MUFON and NUFORC reports of this type of object in our area in the past 12 months. He is always free to contact. No anonymity required. Thank you!

On December 2 2021, 620pm I walked to our community mailbox a few houses from ours and across the street. This is in a northwest direction. Upon getting our mail and walking to return home in a southeast direction I normally look to the south and observe the exisiting planets and stars if visible. This night a couple of planets were visible, I believe Jupiter and Saturn. I then scanned toward the east above the two-story homes and slightly overhead. What caught my eye was an object in this direction (east) appeared to be 6 to 8 white lights in two parallel rows, it is now 624pm (according to the camera phone photo). I stopped to observe the lighted object. I could not tell if this was one object or multiple. As tight as the lights were, I would say one object. Absolutely no sound or blinking lights were observed from this object. I tucked the mail under my left arm, took my phone out with my right hand, activated the phone and snapped a photo which of course it turned out blurry since I had the phone camera in an exposure mode that delayed completion of the photo. I should have activated the video. As this was happening, from the east - northeast we had a very high layer of cloud cover approaching the object. I trotted to the house to get my wife to step out to the back patio and observe this, however the object was gone or hidden by the cloud cover. Total observation time was 1 minute.

It was travelling slowly and steadily in a roughly north-eastern direction. I have lived near an airport for over 30 years and am used to seeing airplanes and drones but it was immediately clear that this was something that I hadn't seen before. It was a thick line of light. It did not blink or change. It made no sound. I stopped what I was doing to look at it. The sky was clear. I pulled out my phone to record a video but later discovered, to my great disappointment, that it was in picture mode instead of video mode so all I got was one blurry photo. The object was very bright and to my eye it appeared larger and had a haze around it, giving it a halo effect, which was not captured in the picture my phone took. Interestingly the picture also captured a second oddly shaped light which I did not notice myself at the time. I estimate that the object was visible for between one and two minutes. It slowly travelled in a straight line. If straight up is 0 degrees then I observed it from about 45 degrees to the south-east until it was about 15 degrees to the north-west, travelling not quite over my head but a bit to the north of me.

Around 7:30 p.m. I looked southeasterly out into the night at the ocean and see 3 huge yellow lights forming a slightly obtuse symetrical triangle of the size range of a football field to 2 football fields, lighting up in unison and making no sound or movement then in three or 4 seconds completely disappear in unison. Super big, quiet, suspended perfectly in midair and possibly being a quarter mile to a couple miles away and maybe half that in altitude above sea level. I have never seen anything like it. It was surreal. And then what appeared to me to be a military plane flew in from the south, which I captured on video, right through the airspace of the 3 huge mysterious triangle of lights. Then after it has passed a single light identical to the 3 that formed a triangle suddenly appears (not moving - my camera moves to catch it) for a few seconds, which i also capture on video (yay!!!!) and then disappears. Then it returns in the same spot for a second then disappears again. It wasn’t a drone. It was huge and suspended in the air perfectly like a hummingbird. I was super excited to witness this extraordinary event. Then more (military?) planes fly in and zigzag around the area of the unidentified other worldly lights. Later, while on the phone with Deborah I look out and see them again. I quickly ended the call and tried to video it but wasn’t successful before they disappeared again. Extraordinary. Then later still I was texting with a friend about this and she sends me news clippings of similar sightings in this area. Turns out Myrtle Beach is a UFO hotspot. Yay!!!! This video shows the blinking lights of the plane that flew in after the sighting, then a single UFO light appearing and then vanishing, and then reappearing and vanishing again at the end of video. — in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,33.83166,-78.65013

Quite a few stars were visible.  I then noticed one very bright star disappearing past the south jamb of the window which started me.  I then saw another identical star moving in the same direction and then a line of maybe ten or twelve more equally spaced, equally bright objects coming one after another from approximately NNW to SSE.  I was too bewildered to count or time them accurately.  They finally all passed out of view to the SSE. I then went to an east facing window and all I could see was the very bright waning half moon and a couple of stable dim stars. I went back to the west facing window and saw another string of identical lights moving in the same direction. Then my wife came out to see where I was and I pointed out the objects to her. To my great relief she also saw them (I thought maybe the covid had quietly snuck up an scrambled my brains). We watched a few more disappear beyond the window then went back to bed @ 5:39 am, extremely perplexed. I don’t know if we saw the beginning or end of the event. When I got up later I checked my reasonably accurate iPhone compass an estimate the line of flight was  originating somewhere between NW (315 d) and NNW (330 d). There was no variation in direction.  The Monterey Regional Airport (MRY) terminal is almost exactly 1 mile slightly east of due south of the viewing point and the pacific coastline is about 0.8 miles NW.  I wonder if their radar detected anything?  We could not estimate the height of the objects, but if they were airline height they were moving extremely fast.  We could hear no sound but the house is insulated stucco construction with double pane glazing and plane take offs from the  airport are fairly faint if the widows are closed.

I have spent a great deal of my life s from childhood on observing the night sky both sober and otherwise including many meteor showers.  This is the first time I have encountered anything similar to this. I would attribute it to military maneuvers of some sort but they probably would not be so noticeably bright.  Sunrise here today was 6:33 am and astronomical twilight was 5:01 to 5:34 am so it was possible a convoy of planes illuminated by the sun far over the horizon in a very dark sky.

Totally off grid.  At night the sky is amazing.  We have no lighting to interfere with viewing.  Our tv program ended at 9 pm and my husband Carl went outside.  He called to me a couple of minutes later to Come See!   So I went out and what we watched for the next 20+ minutes really amazed us. Venus, that beautiful brilliant lady, was to the west of our location.  Up about 45-50  degrees from horizon. Coming from barely to left of and just below Venus and traveling in a very straight line was a well lite dot, much like a small distant star.  The ""dot"" traveled from south or left to north or right (Venus being west) from just below and south of Venus to north of Venus... now the odd thing was, that the dot began at one specific place, just south of Venus and traveled to a specific place north of Venus and vanished...  then another one came into sight.... same trajectory, and vanished at the same place the first one we saw did.... then another and another and another.... for over 20 minutes.  Some were a little higher but still below Venus and others a little lower... all coming into view at the same place and vanishing at the same place... like coming into a room through one door on the left, crossing the room and leaving though another door on the right.  It was very odd indeed.  The space between entering and exiting was about the width of two hands, if you extended your arms fully out with hands up like in the stop position...  two hands wide would have been the distance from seeing it to it vanishing. The time it took to travel that distance was about 5-6 seconds.  If you count one one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand… it was 5 or 6.  It was way up there and just a tiny dot... so didn't seem unusually fast.  Wasn't a zoom or flash... just a steady here it comes and there it's gone... here's another and it's gone. it looked like one was entering as one was exiting...  we have no idea when this began, but while we watched we lost count after 23 or so. So easily over 30. We sky watch often and planes or satellites or the space station can usually be watched as they travel all the way across the sky.  That's what made this siting so unusual.  These all began at the same place and vanished at the same place... they were not visible before the entry point or beyond the vanishing point.  Since there is very low air traffic at this time... the movements of these were seen right away. They were too far away to detect shapes, hear anything or see any detail.  Just coming into view, then vanishing... Any way.... that's what we saw and wondered if anyone else saw them as well. Thank you for all you do.  Have been listening to your reports for a very, very long time.  Sure miss Art Bell....",2020-05-01T00:00:00,33.6639,-114.23

To Whom it May Concern:  I have three incidents to report in the Plainfield/Shorewood, Illinois area. The first took place on May 30, 2020 at 6:23 p.m Central Time. I know the exact date and time because someone on a local Facebook group posted a video (link below). You can see that I commented and said, “They were balloons” because right around the same time I was walking my dog and saw a cluster of silver balloons floating. The video is NOT what I saw and is clearly NOT balloons.  Second, I do not know the exact date. It was around 8:00 pm Central Time due east in the sky at a normal airplane altitude. I saw it from my bedroom window. I noticed it because it was a very bright, white, circular or cylindrical light. At first, I thought it was Venus because the object was stationary or very slowly moving. I thought that it seemed lower than Venus’s position, but did not know what other extremely bright object would be in the night sky at that time. I kept watching while I was brushing my teeth and even called my fiance to come look. I walked back into the bathroom to finish brushing my teeth and went back to the window. The object VERY quickly shot directly towards our house, due west from it’s hovering position, and was gone. I checked my flight tracking app and there was nothing in that location.  The last event took place today, July 29, 2020 at approximately 4:25 a.m. Central Time. I was walking my dog as I normally do because I wake up very early for my job. I happened to look up because it was a very clear sky and I love to see the stars and planets. At approximately 30 degrees northeast, I saw a fast moving object. It was high in the sky, higher than I’ve ever observed an airplane, white and circular. I thought that maybe it was a satellite or shooting star. I continued watching the object and it suddenly “turned off,” or disappeared. I kept watching and the object reappeared slightly more to the east in the straight path it was traveling. Suddenly, it fully stopped and reversed it’s flight path. Then, it began moving in a slow zig-zag pattern. At this point, I had to return home so I held up my phone to take a video and my phone was spazzing on and off. Not sure why. I have never seen this happen to my phone and it was fully charged as I charged it all night lon! g.  Finally, I have noticed a large increase in planes flying over my area. One after another at times. There is an airport nearby (Joliet and Chicago), so I attributed it to that. This is just anecdotal information. I know I am not really a credible or reliable source, but I do believe that all of the incidents are unidentifiable. I hope that this helps in some way.

I reported this to you guys and mufon. I hope that doesn't damage my credibility with this sighting, it just has been something I've been unable to rationalize since. On last Saturday evening, I was watching the sky outside my door when i noticed what i thought was a small airplane on a low angle trajectory coming slightly towards me in a E/SE direction. It had the notion and speed of a plane but made no sound and i couldn't see wings. I turned my music down and heard nothing. I live close to PDX and while air traffic during the pandemic has massively decreased, planes do still take off. This thing was rising from the far north of the airport and i thought it might be from some small airfield across the Columbia in Vancouver. Still it seemed strange and i watched it. I had eye surgery years ago which corrected my vision to 20/39, so not perfect but i can see pretty well at a distance and i could never make out wings. It just continued on this slight upward trajectory until it was out of sight in the sky. It never wavered, slowed down, sped up, made any discernable sound although it had to be within a couple hundred yards at most at it's closest. It was black, spherical although seemed to reflect no light, and i thought i could make out something dangling from the bottom like a cord or string that was attached to something like bucket attached directly to the bottom. This observation made me think it had to be a party balloon but it in no way acted like one. It was not a windy day, but there were currents and this did not respond to them at all. The entire time, i made no attempt to photograph or call my roommate who was within earshot. I thought about both things multiple times but easily rationalized away the ideas immediately before acting. I don't know, this was nothing like the first sighting in creating cognitive dissonance, but the more i reflect, the stranger it seems. I don't think I've added anything to the memory to cause that, but that's what they all say. I literally do not know, and that's the hardest part of this whole thing. I hope that's worth something to you, and if you are interested I'd love to talk about my sightings. Thanks.",2020-07-03T00:00:00,45.51052971304638,-122.66520380380382

On July 4, 2020, I had visited my parents home to celebrate independents day.  Around 9:30pm (21:30) I left to return home.  When I got to the intersection just below my parents house, I noticed a round flashing light in the sky. My first thought was an airplane, headed to the airport.  But then I noticed a second light at a distance behind the first one.  Our airport doesn’t receive airplanes that close together.  It’s a rather small airport with not much traffic. I grabbed my cell phone and snapped a quick picture.  I wanted to get out and watch it but a car pulled up behind me and so I turned and pulled to the side of the road. I stopped the car, and got out.  This is when I decided to film the lights.  I was a little shook up and fumbled around with my cell phone but I was able to get three short video clips.  In the last video, I panned from the light in the front to the light in the back and stayed with that second light until it disappeared. The light was red and yellow like fire and flashed in pulses.  (All caught in video!) then it just dissolved into the sky.  After the event,I reviewed the still picture I took and noticed a third set of lights above the other two with very faint lights in two rows, exactly parallel to each other.  These lights were NOT visible to me with my naked eye and only appear in the photo.  I also zoomed in on the initial ball of light and could see it wasn’t completely round.  There was a “stem” of light on the front. The event lasted for several minutes.  Much longer than any pyrotechnics would",2020-07-09T00:00:00,37.19880653950953,-93.30922288828337

I immediately went downstairs went out the front door, and began to videotape the object. I have extensive footage video. When I was observing it it was at least 20 minutes.   are times I videotaped and other times I just stared up at it.  It seemed to change colors.  It was initially White, but then it looked like it had like rays of colors coming down from it.  It moved, it was way too big to be a drone.  Much too bright in the way it maneuvered it definitely was not a done.  Actually I layed down on my driveway  drivto try to hold my camera steady.  It was right up above the street. It almost appeared to be watching the fireworks.  5 doors down my neighbors are blowing off fireworks with their kids.  after observing this orb for a period of about 20 minutes I walked over there and ask them if they could see it and I pointed at it they were amazed.  Three adult males and three adult females and one child witness this event. I believe at least one person video taped it.  it had moved from where it was when I initially saw it almost to have followed me and as soon as they put up their phones to videotape it it shot off into the distance and then dropped straight down find that houses.

The object was coming closer the sun finally lighted up things more this Ball thing came slowly toward the water way then started across the water by now I could see the Object looked solid But cloud like Smoke was in a Redish Pink Foggy cloud all around it then sudd! enly ANOTHER smaller Object seemed To come out of the larger o! ne and w ent short distance away from the bigger one stopped sat there a few minutes then went back to the big Ball,as it was moving back to the south of the bigger one I noticed a (bluish)foggy like cloud stuff appear then I saw  it go slowly downward to the water the ball like objects seemed to go under the water but the cloud seem to stay on the surface then the Redish pink cloud went across to the West Bank just feet of the west shore stopped turned north then appeared to be coming on shore there are a lot of buildings down below the Cam but then it started to cut through the tops of these buildings coming straight toward the area where this webcam was located then The Cam shut off and Switched to a different Web Cam and that was all I Saw..I took over a (hundred Photos), I kept snapping shots as fast as I could to keep the movement in sequence,I couldn’t get the Video recorder to come on the Site I was on so I just kept snapping pictures.I was Very excited about Being lucky enou! gh to get to see this Weird event and pee’d that the webcam went off just when things was getting good.it was almost to the Clearing ,street below in the view, cars were there people out by now it was around 2:am or after my time so I went on to bed.,The photos of this event are priceless The Red Pink cloud was weird you could see through it like a cloud of smoke but it was only going through these tops of buildings down below the view in size the cloud is a few hundred ft longish and a couple hundred ft. in width. ? I wish the City WebCam Recorder on that sight had worked. I thought that there must have been people that saw it over the water there was Boats people out it was almost DayLight there In Hinwit ..it acted like it was looking for something Pacific it came straight to the waterway came to the shoreline stopped went on shore into people Areas where it could be seen that’s when the Cam Feed Changed and My View was gone.i took a photo of Hinwit in the daytime to see! what it looked like there same feed area I watched two nights! ago On March 19 2020 @ Around 1:00am CST..USA..Looked Really Nice There in Hinwit Switzerland.",2020-05-07T00:00:00,,

At approximately 8:53PM my neighbor, a police officer, and I witnessed UFO phenomena in the mountains 45 minutes Southwest of Denver.  If you are familiar with what a satellite looks like when going across a sky it will be easier to understand what we saw.  Essentially it looks like a star that slowly creeps it's way across the sky.  I was outside, bored from quarantine and playing with my badass blue light laser from China. It is like holding a 25 mile long lightsaber.  I was pointing out constellations for my neighbor when all of a sudden I saw what I assumed to be a satellite.  I circled it with the beam and showed to identify it.  A few seconds later we saw another, directly in line. Strange but not crazy...  Except they kept coming.  Five in a row forming a perfect straight line streaking the sky. They were evenly spaced, but strangely, had differnt magnitudes of brightness.  I freaked the fuck out and tried to take a video, but as you know you can't tape things with the brightness of stars using a cell phone camera.  After the objects made their way across the horizon, two more seemed to follow quickly in pursuit, not in a line but side by side. These however were the same brightness as each other and bluish in color. Also unlike the previous five, these two disappeared suddenly after flying half way across the sky.  From our position we witnessed all objects follow a Northeastern trajectory.  Following the incident I called a Denver new station and asked if they had other reports. They did and dismissed them as satellites. I am an amateur astronomer and know what I saw. Satellites do not travel in formation.  I believe the objects did not have physical lights on them but were rather travelling in space. The light from the sun made their reflections visible. This rules out military aircraft which as a dime a dozen in CO. And not to mention they were completely silent.",2020-05-21T00:00:00,39.4526,-105.5522

At approximately 4:30 in the evening, I went to my car to do some errands. I immediately noticed a very bright white point of light in the sky. It was much bigger and brighter than a star or a planet, but was not identifiable as an aircraft because it appeared to be completely stationary. I noticed it at dusk when there was still light in the sky (roughly in the same area of sky as I had, two months previously, seen a strange collection of lights moving in unison). There was a second, smaller, less bright object as well that I noticed at the same time. I am still not sure whether this particular object was a planet or a phenomenon similar to the brighter one. It definitely was not a star, as it was too large and it did not twinkle. At the time when I saw both of these objects, no other stars or planets were visible in the sky, as there was still some daylight. I was mostly interested in the brighter object, which I could not assign to any familiar category. I kept looking for it as I drove around completing my errands (admittedly, I was alert to strange phenomenon in the sky because of the unexplained objects I had witnessed two months prior). It was clearly visible from several places in town, but it was low enough in the sky that it couldn’t be seen from every location. It remained a very, very bright point of light, but when I saw it from certain angles it almost seemed to have a metallic gleam and I couldn't tell if it was completely spherical. It didn't twinkle (in the sense of periodically dimming) like a star, but at some moments its light seemed almost to pulsate with extra beams. It remained stationary the entire time I was out and appeared to still be in the same place when I arrived home in my usual parking space, but I noticed that it seemed actually to be slowly descending, as it was now partly obscured by the branches of the tree in my neighbor’s yard. At that point, I got out of my car to take a video and pictures of the light to show my boyfriend (because he was very skeptical two months ago when I told him I saw a whole collection of UFOs outside!) The video wouldn't send, so I called him to tell him about it, beginning the conversation with the sentence, ""I think I'm looking at a UFO."" He spontaneously asked, ""Are you talking about that really, really bright star?"" It turns out he was on the Massachusetts Turnpike, heading toward Sturbridge, and he was also staring at it. He said the traffic had slowed and he suspected other drivers were slowing down just to look at it. He wasn't yet sold on it being too out-of-the-ordinary, suggesting maybe a planet had reached the closest point to earth in its orbit. But after he arrived home, as we stood outside staring up at it, he noted out loud that it was definitely not perfectly round, and he thought he saw two extra pieces coming out of it. (His eye are sharper than mine, so I’ll take his word for it, though I did agree it did not look perfectly spherical at certain angles. It is difficult to find words to describe or remember exactly the miniscule features of what was really just a large point of light, but it did at times seem as though light was reflecting off of it, and at times I think the shape could better be described as a knot than a dot.) The two of us decided to drive around to see where we could get a better view. It had been an hour and a half since I first saw the very bright light, and it was still in roughly the same place in the sky, so there is no way it was any ordinary aircraft. As we drove around town, trying to see it better, we eventually turned down Mashapaug Road, which is very woodsy. (As we drove, straining to see it between the trees, I kept my eyes on the other light, the planet-or-UFO. It helped me estimate where in the sky I could find the abnormally bright light, which by now had descended much closer to the horizon.) Finally, we came to a spot where we had a clear view. I think the clearing in the trees was due to a body of water but by now it was completely dark and hard to see landscape. But the light appeared closer now, as it was larger, and it now appeared bright yellow rather than white. As we followed the curve in the road I think we encircled the object, coming so close that we could see it almost right above us. From this angle, it appeared to be an actual saucer-shape with three rectangular lights. We both swearing and exclaiming; it was so surreal-looking! I said, ""It's shaped like a stereotypical flying saucer in a movie!"" My boyfriend said, “That is definitely not an airplane!” We both noted the three rectangular lights and the lack of any blinking lights such as you would see on most aircraft. There was a row of cars behind us, maybe also trying to get a glimpse. We couldn't safely stop. We came to the gas station at the highway and turned around, but we couldn't see the bright levitating object in the woods anymore. We turned around again and onto the highway, and from there we could see the object in the sky behind us. We drove until we were able to reverse-course and keep driving towards the bizarre yellow light but it was so low on the horizon we kept losing it in the trees. At several points I noted the second, maybe-planet-maybe-UFO in the sky appeared to have the same knotty, not-quite spherical quality, and I said, “That has to be another one.” At one point, I saw a bright streak, like a very fast shooting star, and when next we saw the light it had moved and was behind us. We turned again, still trying to follow it. At one point as were staring at it we noticed a car pulled over on an access road with a better view, watching it also. There were also a lot of normal airplanes in the air at this time, at least some of which we speculated were trying to keep an eye on it. We could easily distinguish our UFO from these craft because it was much brighter. We lost sight of it again and when we saw it, far down the highway, low on the horizon, in the direction of New York, we decided it was too far away to keep chasing and went home - still searching the sky in case it came back or in case we saw another. It was gone from the sky when we parked. The brightest point in the sky now was what seemed to be an ordinary planet, and I couldn’t tell if this was the same maybe-planet-maybe-UFO that had accompanied the unnaturally-bright UFO. It was difficult to judge by memory how bright the second one had been compared to the normal heavenly bodies because I had only been approximating its brightness in comparison to the bright UFO. I had difficulty remembering its location for the same reason; I had been approximating its location based on its distance from the bright UFO, and now the bright UFO was gone. By this time it was approximately 8:30PM. For background on the observers - I'm a historian who spends most of my time these days researching a book I'm writing on U.S. history and working online part-time. I'm also neurodivergent and used to being dismissed as weird. My boyfriend works in biotech and is usually not considered weird by anyone. He is pretty open-minded but definitely a scientist and needs to see proof before he'll believe in something as far-fetched as a mystery hovercraft outshining the stars.

On the clear, star-lit evening of April 22nd, 2020, I observed an unidentifiable aircraft while I went outside to feed my horses at exactly 22:00.  Because my home is near two mid-sized airports (30 miles and 62 miles, respectively), there is a high volume of air traffic in the night sky I am familiar with identifying. This one was different.  It was similar in shape to a typical regional commercial jet (~70-seater), but had a much wider cylindrical barrel with wider wings which had a sharper angle in reference to the rear of the aircraft.  It had MANY continuously-shining yellow lights on the ventral surface, moreso on the left side than the right, and specifically had one brighter light towards the left side.  The front end of the aircraft did have some red lights on both the right and left sides, but not on the wings.  What confused me was the fact that it did not have the usual red blinking lights one would normally see a plane in the night sky use. Nor did it have any blinking lights at all. Usually a normal plane flying this low would even have visible lights on the perimeter of the wings, but these lights were illogically scattered with different levels of intensity. Even weirder, it barely made any noise in reference to how low it was flying. Had there been cloud cover, this aircraft would have been flying below the clouds, and there was barely audible detection of any air moving whatsoever.  To put this in perspective, it was flying in an East-West direction in what appeared to be an ascent, and was flying very low in my northern horizon. Making sure I wasn’t crazy after the aircraft had passed out of my sight in the western direction, I gazed off in my southern horizon as well as directly above me, and as always, there were normal-looking commercial jets flying in the distance at much higher altitudes than this one, blinking lights and all. The sky was so clear, I even saw an orbiting satellite without any difficulty. Even when a plane is descending to land at either airport, they NEVER fly as low as this aircraft. There aren’t even airstrips near me that are equipped for this size of an aircraft to be flying that low, the closest one is 30 miles away. There were no helicopters flying in the sky at the time of the sighting.  Because this is in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have certainly had more helicopters and fewer planes than normal. Also, we have had significantly less road traffic, and I even believe there is slightly less light pollution because of the quarantine orders. Because of these factors, there is less room for visual and aural error.  I was just astonished to see something so asymmetrical, low-flying, and silent.",2020-05-15T00:00:00,,

I was dumbfounded so I told my husband to look up and he saw it too.  They were similar to the look of a satellite that you see in the night sky.  They were moving slower than that however.  I began to count the amount that I saw and in overtime it was 59 total. They initially started in large groups and then slowly went down to three, two, and then single crafts.  The two that I saw together moved simultaneously from the west to northwest next to each other.  At the same time that these crafts were moving I began to see two other crafts from the south to the north that crossed paths with these other objects.  I then knew for sure that they were not Aircrafts.  The to the cross the Paz, flash really bright lights for about two seconds, and then went black flashed again and went black.  I also saw in the horizon directly to the north two very bright lights that look like an explosion that went horizontally across the horizon from the east to the west.  These were unlike any sort of shooting star or meteorite I have ever seen before.  I decided to call my sister and my mom who live an hour south of me, they both went outside and saw the same things I was seeing.  When I was on the phone with my sister one of the single crafts close to the end of the group, became very bright, I describe it the brightness of the sun and then turned completely black.  My sister on the phone saw the exact same thing. I then knew that these were not Aircrafts if she is an hour south of me and she is seeing the same thing.  At around 1113 I didn’t see any more so I decided to go back inside.  During this time, I did see one airplane, that I heard and saw different lights on it.  It was very distinct.

Then I realized it was hovering.  There was nobody on the road so I slowed down and stopped for a quick second to look up at it a little closer.  It was a quick look so I will describe just what I saw as I saw it. When I looked at it, I thought I saw a shape similar to a fuselage of a plane but the way it hovered was not like that.  I am not totally sure what the full shape was because it was covered by a thin veil of clouds.  Because I first thought it was a plane/tube shape, I marked Cigar but again, it was cloudy and it could have had more characteristics than that.  The object was either fairly close to the ground or very large.  There were different white and red lights on the object.  The object hovered just above some very low lying clouds for the duration that I drove past the area (Maybe a minute or two). It looked too large to be any drone I have seen before.  I was googling sightings in the area to see if I was completely crazy and came across a video posted from the same are in February with very similar looking lights hovering in the same area.

Each of the previous two sightings occurred in relatively the same way and I have filed a report each separate instance, however I would like to once again describe what I witnessed for consistency’s sake. Around 10:50 PM I (as I often do) decided to take a walk around my apartment complex to look at sky/stars . It probably goes without saying, but with the frequency with which I had witnessed strange phenomena from earlier in the week (7/26 and then 7/27) I was really eager to be able to see and document this phenomena so I have been going out for walks daily.  Thankfully the sky was much clearer this particular evening and as I turned around to face the area of the sky which I had witnessed the phenomena before, at 11:00 PM on the dot exactly I had seen it again. Essentially the experience had occurred in the same way as it had the previous two times this week.  I was facing North/North West and adjacent (left) to the Big Dipper, I had seen a white light which had a similar size/shape and brightness as many of the stars in the area.  However, after focusing on this specific light I noticed that this light was slowly moving towards the South.  Though it appeared to be moving slowly from my vantage point, it must have been moving pretty quickly due to how small it looked.  I once again tried to look for any sort of flashing navigation lights and saw none, nor did it have any discernible features of a man-made craft - it did not make any sounds whatsoever. Each of my other experiences with this phenomena only lasted 10-15 seconds and normally ended in the light just disappearing as it was traveling from N/NW to East.  This time however, the light was going from N/NW towards the south and instead of simply disappearing into the sky, I felt like I was able to see it actually traveling diagonally upwards and then I lost sight of it. Unfortunately every other time that I have witnessed this light, I was profoundly startled and was unable to capture any really discernible photo/video evidence.  However, I was relatively prepared this time and was thankfully able to obtain a whole minute video of this phenomena (which I will be sending along with my report).  Due to this being the third time that I am reporting this, I can understand a certain skepticism that some might read this with and felt that it would be important to do some de-bunking of my own before just making the report - I do not believe this was the International Space Station, as it does not fly over my area at that time of night, and I do not believe that it was a satellite.  I do not believe that this was related to comet Neowise, as I was able to witness that earlier in the month and it was an entirely different type of event because I was able to see the comet’s tail and it was traveling in the exact opposite direction of this light. I appreciate the ability to document my experiences through NUFORC and am hopeful that this might provide some insight to the general UFO phenomena.",2020-07-31T00:00:00,40.0326,-75.719

As I proceeded to water areas of the grass the needed help I could hear just a few local fireworks going off not to far away from my location.  Then after watering the grass areas for about 7 minutes approximately facing my north, northwest position I turned to northeast to hit and bad grass spot and noticed what appeared at first to be a red firework I thought approximately 3-5 miles away above the neighbors garage across the street.  So thinking that it was just a red firework that had exploded I noticed that it did not dissipate.  So I proceeded to keep watering but kept looking at this red light ..at that distance it just appeared to be round.  Then I focus back on it and noticed that it began to slowly move north to a northwest direction and slowly moved more northwest.  Then watching for a couple minutes this red object turned toward my direction and began coming toward my direction.  I thought oh I must just be a plane or jet heading this way.  So after another minute it came close enough to notice that it did not have any flashing lights or appeared to seem like it was a plane or jet.  Then the object appeared to slowly move in a southwest direction still coming towards me.  After another minute passed I realized it sure was not any plane, helicopter, or any type of jet or even a drone.  This red object then slowed to complete stop approximately and guessing an altitude of about 10-12,000 feet above it was probably no more than 2 or 3 street blocks just to the north of me and I noticed the shape better colors better and had the shape of a cigar or rectangle sitting totally vertical straight up and down. I noticed this craft had some white colors appearing to blend in with the red and the very top had sort of a T shape to it but small and was hovering in that position for well over a minute.  I knew right away ! the this was some sort of UFO and it did not make any sound or! sounds whatsoever.  At the time there was a couple fireworks that rose just over the tree tops as I was facing north while watching this object hover at about an 75-80 degree position just above me. The fireworks down the street then stopped and I figured those people might be seeing this same cigar shaped object.  Not sure why the fireworks stopped but then I noticed this craft began to slowly start moving towards the west and began to rise a bit higher while still moving 45 degrees upward towards the west.  I then glanced back at where I first saw it and took maybe 5 steps back away and noticed the same exact red ball in the same exact location I saw this one.  Almost seemed like this object was waiting for this other craft.  Turned my attention back to the one closest to me and noticed to was rising up much higher at 45 degrees and eventually went thru a very high light cloud bank and noticed the red color thru to white and then fade as it rose attitude much much higher then disappear almost like watching clouds start to cover a star at night.  So I kept looking for it but it completely disappeared. After that I turned back to watch the second UFO and it basically took the same path as the first did but didn’t stop over my head.  That object was identical to the first.. same colors, same shape and size.  It also proceeded to rise up at the same 45 degree angle and follow the first one until both completely disappeared just towards the south area of where the Big Dipper was. I looked around to see if anything else would appear and just noticed the clear moon with I believe a planet and star I’m guessing near it. Was I fairly clear evening with moonlight visible and I don’t recall seeing and type of glow from these objects reflecting off the ground. I contacted the two nearest police departments the very next day knowing they probably would be busy due to the 4th of July. I can tell you that I was semi skeptical about UFOs my whole life..well up until the l! ast evening and now I am a believer 1000%. These two objects I! saw wer e definitely not from this planet. I tried to take a video with my cell phone and it turned out bad. Tried zooming to focus but some reason video ended up 16 seconds long w a white blip (the UFO) and you could hear the last 2 fireworks go off and then completely stop well before both craft had completely disappearing, I am bit upset that I did not snap photos but tried to video the first object while tossing the garden hose on the ground without me getting wet. I thought i had good video footage so I never attempted to try to shoot some photos of both objects.",2020-07-09T00:00:00,38.4782,-75.1981

I have been witnessing since 2014. Mostly orbs, ""stars"", sparklers, weird lights in general. Only once have I seen a solid craft.  I felt compelled to report because I saw something almost exactly like the recent events at Bowling Green and Round Rock.  I saw a line of what I might have dismissed as satellites, but they were in the wrong place.  I stopped counting at some point.  They all appeared out if thin air at a certain point Southwest of Venus.  One after the other they followed the same trajectory and disappeared into nothing after maybe a length of 10-15 degrees(? I can't think of a more objective way to describe the distance).  They weirdest part is that they all flashed at the midway point in their journey. It built up then diminished, not instant like a camera. All at the same spot, just after passing beneath Venus. Only one of the objects fucked up. And there was a brief pause at some point.

I immediately down went online to a flight tracking site to see the air traffic above my location and the closest plane was more than 40 miles away in a different direction.   And given the terrain where I live. It doesn't allow you to see that far across the horizon.  When I got no where with that I then went to a site showing satellite activity above location.  Again there wasn't anything above us.  After thinking about it more whatever it was or is.  Was at an extremely high altitude.  Much higher than  what passenger planes would fly at.

Light was about 3-4 times the size of a large star. Looked odd. It was around 5:30 pm. It was dusk but still light outside. As my son and I were pulling out of the Walmart and turning left onto Franklin rd, I noticed an oddly bright, low, and large “star” in the sky almost directly in front of us. I asked my son what he thought it was he said it could be a big star or planet. We both said it was still so bright outside to see a star and it was definitely too large for a star. I thought it was also very low in the sky. Our light changed and I said well it’s probably a planet or something and we made a right hand turn onto Franklin rd and ran another errand. About 40-45 minutes later we were finished. It was now completely dark and we were heading home driving down Bent mountain rd when we spotted it again. It was in the exact same spot but we were seeing it from the back side now. A different perspective from the first time we saw it. It was now a little more discernible. It was very bright in the sky and lower than any other “star”. I now noticed it was oddly shaped. It was circular but with possibly an appendage coming from the top left area. My son even said he thought something was coming out of it. It was now emitting a bluish green light from only the top left of the “craft” over the area where, what I thought was some kind of appendage. My son thought the appendage was just light glare. The bottom of the “craft” was emitting white light. I could now tell it had a shape, meaning I could discern it was a 3 dimensional circular object. Not just a light in the sky. It appeared to be a craft of some type. I cannot say how high in the sky it was, other than to say it was about 4x the size of a large bright star. My son thought it maybe moved a little but I thought it was stationary. It was difficult to tell because we were driving about 45 mph on a fairly winding rd. I’m certain it never moved. We viewed it almost the entire drive down bent mountain rd. I was driving so I only was able to look at it for a few seconds then turn my eyes back to the road. It was in view in the neighborhood of about 4 minutes. We lost sight of it once we got closer to 12 O’clock Knob rd. We made our right hand turn on that rd and then a left onto Lost Mountain rd. I was hoping we would be able to see it again once we arrived at our house but we couldn’t from our elevation. We live in a Mountain area surrounded by trees. Anyway, there were a lot of people on the road and I can’t imagine we were the only people to notice it. One other thing that may be helpful. We live about 30 min from Roanoke airport and we saw an airplane in the vicinity of the object.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,37.275004150943396,-79.97072547169812

Instead the string of lights continued to move in a northerly direction, eventually traveling nearly directly above me. The lights all appeared to be the same size but were spaced at irregular intervals and all were traveling at the same speed as if they were either flying in unison or were part of a single craft. They emitted no sound and were moving much slower than a regular aircraft. It was hard to gage the size or distance as I was looking up into darkness and had no other visual reference points. All the lights were the same color, a whitish glow. I tried filming with my iPhone but nothing shows up on the recordings. I did snap two photos. The lights passed over me, again moving at a constant speed in a northerly direction.

Dozens of small star sized lights continued appearing for about an hour. During one live video a light appeared to brighten and come toward me when my feed was interrupted. I started a new video when clouds began to roll in from the north and a humming sound began.  There was a sudden very strong gust of wind and it became very cold.  We continued to watch for another half an hour and witness many lights darting between gaps in the clouds.  We heard strange noises during this time including humming and very soft crackling sounds like tiny rain drops falling.  I am happy to provide the video that most clearly captured one of the lights.,2020-05-01T00:00:00,41.183600000000006,-96.6195

I have seen many high-speed low altitude flyovers of military jets, and I learned that the sound is not detected until the plane is overhead.  This sound matches that characteristic except for a major difference.  This object had a thin faint sound. The sound was like air rushing over a cylinder or fuselage.  There were no engine sounds, no thundering afterburners, no loud rushing sound of a military jet.  No doppler change.  It was gone in about 2.5 seconds.

However the very front light in the formation shot behind our in the north direction and another took its place in front.  But then the sky got so bright behind us it look as is the sun popped out.  But then that light that disappeared behind was back in front of us and it bright so we pulled over to try and see what it was and it stopped suddenly and meanwhile the formation of lights and its tail of lights were farther in the distance.  Both of us looked in aww and we realized the bright light we were looking at was a craft in the sky and was oval in shape and looked like a giant apartment building hovering in the sky and had other bright lights up the si! de that we could see in different spot throughout the side.  And as we sat on the side of I89 with our hazard lights blinking it seemed like we had been watching for an hour or longer not one vehicle went by on the N or S lanes we noticed that it still hovering above us but it looked like it was farther than it had been.  And all of sudden a bright bright light illuminated the complete bottom side of this craft it shot straight up to the point the bright light on the botton of the craft was a little bigger and brighter than the brightest star in the sky and then moved so fast in the eastern direction it was just flash of light.

Me, My wife and a neighbor were watching fireworks around the city from the rooftop of our building, and among the fireworks exploding, we spotted 3 objects that were definitely not part of the of the light show directly west of our building.  What got my attention initially was 3 red/orange objects hovering above the city at a distance in the formation of an equilateral triangle.  These glowing objects seemed out of place from all the flashing lights coming from fireworks displays because they were not moving.  By the time my wife and I got out our cell phones to record them, two of the lights had disappeared (Top and right) and the one that remained (Bottom and left) stayed visible. We both were able to get footage of that one. The remaining object didn't appear to be moving in any direction only hovering. Our footage shows the glowing object hovering for a minute or 2 and then just fades away.  Being on the north side of Chicago we've seen more than around 30! airplanes or helicopters a day going in or out of O'hare International for years, and these definitely did not match movement or light patterns consistent with either one of those. There was no physical interaction as the objects seemed to be far enough away to be hovering over either Lincolnwood, IL or further west near Rosemont IL. It was hard to tell how far they were as I couldn't determine the size of them. The other strange thing that me and my wife agreed on was that it seemed to be intentional to us. As if it was a personal show to just us. That's probably not relevant, or true, but it was a very strong feeling. So much so that I want to include that detail. I am a fraud analyst and have a very skeptical nature, but this was something that I cannot explain. I'm sending 2 videos, one that my wife took right next to me, and the one I took. My video is a little more shaky but her's is a quite a bit more stable. My neighbor didn't take any footage because her phone was not around at the time. I will include the video and a screenshot of google maps to show where we THINK the objects were. Thank you for your time. Feel free to email me with any questions.",2020-07-09T00:00:00,,

In early evening of Friday, Dec 3, 2021, around 6:25pm I was walking around the block on my usual two-mile walk. I reside in the Ashmoor subdivision located in the western portion in the city of Mobile, Al. The neighborhood I was in when I spotted the object in the sky is Westchester, which is adjacent to my neighborhood. It was already fully dark outside. I had just left Ashmoor subdivision and entered the Westchester subdivision. My route takes me to Westchester Ln S in the direction of Grelot Rd. When I turned left onto Westchester Ln S off of Westchester Run, I immediately noticed a long glowing object to my West not far above the tree line that made me first think of a comet. As I continued to walk and focus on the object, I realized it was not as far away as I had first thought and was slowly moving to the northeast. My thoughts then shifted to this being a blimp. I then noticed that this object was flying in a very peculiar way. I could see what were small individual lights in perfect formation forming what would be a long straight row of lights in a possible rectangle or disk shape with no apparent wings or tail. The strange thing was the way the object was maintaining its altitude, however, in the direction it was flying, the front of the row of lights were much lower than lights in what would be the rear of the object. I then ruled this out as a blimp because there were no lights on top, front or rear of the object. It also appeared much too narrow to be a blimp. The object was also too long to be a helicopter. My last thought was ok, this has to be an airplane, however, there were no lights where there would normally be if the object had wings or a tail; there was only one long straight row of lights. I quickly called home and had my wife and son go outside and look to their north. I stayed on the phone and asked them if they saw the object. They were only about 1 to 2 blocks away from my location. They both said they saw the object and I asked my son to also take a photo and a video if he had time. My son snapped the picture that you will see attached to the form. The photo I took did not come out clearly. After I snapped my photo and my son confirmed he had taken one, I was going to take a video and I also asked him to video the object but in the few seconds we had been occupied snapping our photos, the object was gone. At the rate of speed it had been moving in the total time I had viewed it, over about 30 seconds I’m guessing, it still should have been visible before it flew over the tree line. It must have accelerated in the few seconds we were looking down to swipe from photo to video on our phones and when I looked up it was no longer anywhere to be seen. The object can be found on the attached photo to the lower right of the bright planet or star in the center of the sky. The object is also almost straight above the bright streetlight you can see in front of the house straight ahead. The object was moving to the right as you look at the photo. As you can see the front of the object was pitched way down in comparison to the rear. The object remained pitched forward like this the whole time I viewed it, about 30 seconds, and it did not appear to be decreasing its altitude.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,30.68156511397423,-88.1366939544103

My wife and myself were sitting on our balcony when I glanced upwards at the moon. Conditions were mostly clear, with some high cirrostratus hanging in the moonlight.  I saw a bright light hanging by the moon, which at the time was perhaps 70 degrees above the horizon.  At first, I mistook this light for Venus.  It possessed a yellow-white color similar to Venus when the planet is bright. After pointing the light out to my wife, I noticed that the light was solid, failing to twinkle the nature that stars and planets do.  As we sat, perplexed, the light began to move, retaining its brightness.  The light moved southwards, hanging just above the treeline.  We reasoned that the light must have been emitted by a helicopter, or was perhaps a lantern (which are commonly lit and sent into the sky leading up to the forth of July). Suddenly, the light changed colors, dimming shifting to a magenta somewhere between red and purple.  Following the change in color, the light began moving erratically, shooting upwards and circling in a manner that defied our understanding.  The abrupt changes in direction and altitude would undoubtedly be impossible for an aircraft to achieve. As we sat watching this light above the treeline, it seemed to edge closer to our balcony.  As it neared, it again shone bright, bright enough to illuminate the street below and our surroundings moderately.  The light continued to inch closer, changing to magenta again, then brightening significantly.  It seemed very close, we were honestly a bit frightened by the intensity and movement of the object during these lighting cycles. The object continued to move what appeared to be southwards of our location, as it moved it became obfuscated in part by the treeline.  Even when behind the trees, the brightness of the light was visible through the branches.  The object continued to move erratically. Pausing, gliding, then circling quickly in the sky.  Just prior to our losing of the object beyond the trees, we saw another light.  This one hung farther in the distance and was much more purple in color than red.  We did not see this second object illuminate as the first continued to do so.  Resultantly, we quickly lost the second object beyond the trees. Prior to losing the first object, I managed to record a 1 minute video of the first object, appearing as a grainy spot of light hanging above the trees.  Near the end of my video, the object ascends, illuminates and cuts into the trees.  Even in the video, the brightness of the object can be seen through the branches of the trees. I stood vigil for some time after having seen the object.  Employing a plane-tracking radar app, I scanned the airspace around us, failing to find a plane that was or had traveled along the path in the sky we saw the object. Writing this a few hours later, I am quite perplexed.  We live perhaps 10 or 20 miles south of a air force base, albeit all this activity happened in the opposite direction of the base itself.",2020-07-03T00:00:00,40.48414571428571,-86.12858523809524

They immediately grabbed my attention because they were very different from the stars around them. There was no sound coming from them either. The lights themselves were bright white, rather than the warm white glow the moon and stars give, there also wasn't a hazey ring like you'd typically see with those things. They were also perfectly round and appeared to be about the same distance away as you'd typically see planes. They were quite large, assuming the distance is accurate and not an illusion. There was only 3 lights at first, then within a few seconds of them catching my eye, another light appeared, but dimmer. It started to grow brighter and once it matched the previous 3, another light appears and does the exact same thing and taking the same amount of time. Within 20 or so seconds there were 8 lights in total. The lights were in a perfectly straight line and each light kept a constant distance from the ones on either side. They moved in unison across the sky in a line just as straight. It moved much slower than a plane would have. There was a faint out line surrounding the lights, it didn't appear to be attached but stayed at a constant distance from each light. If there was anything connecting them it was either hidden by the bright lights or transparent. Soon the light at the end of the row started to dim and then disappeared from sight, the rest of them followed suit. I immediately checked public sites to see if there was a plane or satellite overhead. There were none I could find.

Very shimmery, sparkley, not moving or changing in any way. In the sky it was about the size of a pinky finger. We were on a mountain road and it took a few minutes to safely pull the car over, and it remained unchanging for that duration, for approximately two or three minutes. As I got out of the car, it disappeared in place. I can't quite remember if it faded out slowly or if i was just straining to see it, but it was gone quickly, never moving. Several other cars (maybe 4?) also pulled over abruptly, I assume for the same reason. I am generally a logical, skeptical person, and have been looking online at commonly mistaken UFO's (i.e. satellites, atmospheric balloons, fireballs, etc.) and nothing looks like this. I understand that the Star Link satellites were recently launched, but this looks nothing like that. The lights were packed closely together (for example it would be a light, then an open space the size of the light, then another light) It reminded me more of an LED strip of lights packed closely together, and maybe doubled or tripled up.

As soon as the new object appeared the southern object seemed to move more south or increase elevations and leave the view.  I ran next door and got my neighbor to see it as well thought the binoculars and he was awe struck.  The object moved from the north sky to the south and then disappeared.  I checked my app sky view and the objects were not planets or stars.  I also took a screen shot of all flights that were overhead and non-matched.",2020-07-09T00:00:00,41.5755,-83.6847

We are camping in shawnee national forest area and this event happened during daylight before dusk and it was not dark at all. 2 things for certain it was not a plane or a drone and if it did not teleport it was faster than the speed of light. We just got back to the camp sight and stoked the fire up to prepare for the evening campfire and s'mores with the kiddos, my brother in law was helping his daughter ride a bike about 20 yards away beside the front door of the rv. I had just sat down by the camp fire and heard/felt a strange noise like a humming or vibration and it felt like a parrot on my shoulder, as I looked around I could feel and hear the movement/vibration but not like a wind I knew it was there and moving as I tried to catch it with my eye it was like a connection with the craft ( I am not saying I was or feel like I was being abdu! cted). This happened for maybe 10 seconds then I noticed the noise/feeling was gone which was very intense, as I was trying to understand this noise as an engineer aircraft came to mind immediately. I look up and see a black object above the rv high in the sky, no lights were visible way up in the sky and it did not look right as far as flight patterns or craft shape (black triangle moving in all directions at high speed). Then it was just like teleportation and maybe 20 yards directly above my brother in law from the top of the earth in less than 1 second. I yelled at him to look up and immediately he looked up, his daughter did too. The craft went straight to the side instantly maybe 60 to 70 yards away from us and 20 yards above the trees, then it shot straight up in the sky barley in sight then straight back down and came to a complete stop instantly 20 yards above the trees (same location), the lights were visible at this point, it was like we were at a standoff with t! he craft. Take note the travel was frequent but it was as if i! t wanted us to see it in detail. The craft was a black triangle from my chair I seen 2 red lights in the back end (I refer to the back end as 2 visible points of the triangular craft)the lights did not flash and from his angle 20 yards away from me west he said he seen 4 red lights total and little flashing white lights like a glitter dead center bottom of craft( I did not see the white lights/glitter personally) I will add with my knowledge I'm looking for the propulsion system and noticing the lights while looking for it, maybe I missed the other details he seen, this happened fast. We both had full views but from different angles, his 7 year old daughter was watching too but regardless we could all see a black triangle with solid non flashing red lights and no engines or wings, it did not spin, no visible entrance, no visible windows, no visual distortion or noise at take off, no intelligent life, no landing gear  no weapons, no chem or gas trails in any direction but it was cert! ainly being controlled by intelligent energy of some type. We were able to examine the craft for about maybe 10 seconds close up as it hovered silent above the trees as if setting on an invisible concrete slab. I am certain this craft had me under surveillance until I realized it was present initially I could feel it examine me, although I could not see it I could feel it and was looking for it, it had to be right above me within 20 yards and directly to the east, behind me . I was startled and the craft seemed curious after 1st visual contact I felt like it always knew my next move. I felt it was certainly showing off its capabilities and it was uncomfortable for me personally but interesting at the same time I did not feel threatened by the object at anytime but disturbed about the situation when I realized beyond a reasonable doubt this craft was certainly not from this planet. It then went left, right, up, down instantly at great distance and stopped directly by us abov! e the tree again and sat for 1 second then straight up in the ! sky and it stopped at the top of the earth then just was gone. The craft had no detail to describe, no writing or anything other than the solid red lights the triangle craft appeared to look like a slice of cheesecake, flat top, flat bottom it had depth as far as people could fit in it but nobody could be seen, no windows visible. If there were windows we could have seen them and the corners of the craft appeared to have a radius. I am big on American freedom and am against surveillance against the people for no reason, this was not the government and aliens did not build the pyramids nor could any other government have something like this, hands down this was most certainly from another extremely advanced civilization not from our planet no doubt. I thought before this event it's almost common sense that there is other life in the universe but never thought I would encounter it. I am just glad I had witnesses that seen it with me (although we already agreed not to discussit aside o! f with eachother). I do want to add no drugs or alcohol were involved we just returned from the beach with kids and we don't even drink. I hope you take this serious I know I will from now on but something has taken interest in our planet I have no doubt. My rv is 35 foot long and the craft was much larger than my rv bus in length and size. I would say the best approximate description I can give it each side of the triangle may be 50 feet And approximately 12 to 15 feet tall and at no time did we see a shadow and we should have seen a shadow consume this area I want to be very clear that there should have been a visible shadow, there's not as if physically it did not exsist but the craft was not translucent illuminated from the lighting. We all plan to remain anonymous but want to report it so I hope somebody that reads this can use the data.",2020-07-09T00:00:00,37.4245,-88.8862

There was a center light with lighted &quot;spokes&quot; on both It was about 10 minutes to midnight, I was sitting in my chair in my living room and looked out toward the east and saw an object with very bright lights. It was moving fairly slowly in a southern direction. I first saw it over the golf course (east of our home) where there very few trees and continued to watch it as it progressed south beyond some trees. It was moving horizontal to the ground.  I moved to the kitchen window and then the dining room to get a better view of it and saw there was a second one, same shape, as if following it, in the same direction or path. The shape was unusual, it had a center light with what appeared to be a spoke-like pattern of straight lights extending from the center light. All the bright lights were the same size. The “spokes” or straight lines of light could be described as being at the 12:00, 2:00, 4:00, 6:00, 8:00, 10:00 positions on a clock, each line having 4 or maybe 5 lights in a straight row extending out from its center.  I couldn’t see any other shape due to the dark sky. Both objects were of the exact same design and the lights did blink.  There was no noise that I could hear.  They proceeded south then arched toward the west.  I did not see them increase speed or slow down when they were visible to me.  There is an airport in Rockford and we normally do hear airplanes overhead as well as helicopters, but these objects were large and unlike any airplane lights or helicopter lights I have ever seen.  They were in the sky much lower to the ground than any plane or helicopter I have seen fly overhead.  My husband was sleeping and I did not wake him, so I was the only one that I know of that witnessed them.  It would have taken at least the size of a fifty cent piece to have covered one of them from my view. They both appeared to be the same size.  I do not drink alcohol at all and am not taking prescription medications. I am a retired registered nurse. I do wear glasses with a very slight correction for distance and had them on during this sighting.  I did try to take a video of the lights, but only had my mobile phone camera, so it didn’t turn out well at all. It appears in the video as a sphere of light with no spokes showing in the picture. I also took it through the window, which has a screen so all I can see if a bright round sphere of light with screen wire squares dancing about in the video. The video was time stamped at 11:57pm and is 15 seconds long. Unfortunately I couldn’t hold it perfectly still so the light’s movement is probably not accurate as to its actual movement through the sky. We had the house alarm set, so I didn’t open the back door to step outside for a better video. This morning I did describe what I saw to my husband and he viewed the video. He checked our outdoor security camera and backed it up to 11:45 – midnight. At 11:53 it did pick up a bright light in the north eastern direction that was moving south seen through the trees.",2020-05-07T00:00:00,42.27738134206219,-89.04477790507364

While on a hunting/camping trip near Sanderson, Texas my hunting friend and I were watching satellites and meteors since there is no city light pollution as there is at home. I had just gone in the camper to wash the dishes when my friend started banging on the wall telling me to get back outside “right now.” I ran back outside and he was pointing toward the north and asked “what the hell is that?” I looked and what I saw was a horizontal bar of light in the sky about 25° above the horizon and a bit west of Polaris (North Star). The light was a bluish white light slightly brighter than the stars around it. The light had crisp edges much like a laser and appeared to be a long distance off. I could not see through this light as it appeared solid. I have no way of knowing just how far away the light was but it appeared to be quite distant. Whether 50 miles or 500 I could not say. I held up my thumb at arm’s length and the “bar of light” was just over two times its width. I could see stars above, below, and to either side of this light. This was a crystal clear night with no clouds as far as the eye could see in any direction. After a period of about 30 seconds from when I came outside and saw the light, it started to slowly fade. It faded evenly from end to end and became translucent for 3 or 4 seconds before fading completely. (Similar to turning off a light using a dimmer style switch). My friend and I discussed how long he had observed the light before I got back outside. He estimated about 20 to 30 seconds. He also said that the light came on the same as it had gone off, slowly increasing in intensity over a period of a few seconds. The total time that the light was visible was about a minute. The next morning I got my compass out of my hunting bag and determined the direction of the light the night before was about 330°. The nearest town (and known major light source) in that direction is Fort Stockton which is 75 miles away. Neither of us is exactly sure what caused the phenomenon we witnessed but I am sure of several things it was NOT: 1.) Stadium lights reflecting on clouds. There were absolutely no clouds. Stars were visible above, below and to either side. 2.) It was not Starlink satellites. This was a solid bar of light similar to a laser or the light shining under the door of a neighboring room in a building. We have both witnessed Starlink in the past. My impression is that this probably was not a solid object as it would have to have been many miles in length. There was no frame of reference for me to determine how far away it was but my impression was that it was very far away. Although it appeared solid while at peak brightness, it became somewhat transparent as it began to fade out.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,,

There was an object moving at a far greater altitude than normal .   not have the lights the lighting or shape of airplane commercial nor privates nor helicopter . I observed a single light this time.  It appeared to be moving from the south 2 North a little eastbound.  It made continued steady progress like that of a falling star but not at the Rate or speed of it. When it was directly overhead its load paused.  Then climb Tire and I lost track of it.  The other times I've seen them reminded me of when they like a mosquito fly or bee buzzing around the erratic path they take.  The speed.  Was much greater of course.

One was hidden behind another.  There will be another sighting soon. Possibly a visitation boots-on-the-ground Landing.  That's what I've seen in my vision anyway.

It was straight (not curved, nor fanned-out.). It seemed to have rays of light within it (i.e. it wasn't all one solid ray of the same brightness or density). It had a beginning and an end, though I couldn't estimate the length because I could not know it's distance (if it was at jet cruise altitude around 30k feet, then I'd estimate it's length at five or six 747 airliners placed end-to-end). I couldn't watch it for too long because I was stopped in the travel lane and had to worry about any cars that might come by, although no vehicles came near me). It did not appear to be moving. It did not fan out at any angle - all rays of light within it seemed parallel. There was no sound or strange feeling associated with it, although I wish I'd have been looking up there earlier, as I have a feeling it was just hanging up there for a long time, though I can't be certain.

Shortly after 12:30 in the afternoon, I had gotten out of my parked car and happened to glance to my left, when I caught sight of a pure white trapezoid-shaped object just above the top of an adjacent portion of the building that was oriented SE-NW to right off from Hoosick Rd. I was at the SE end. The object appeared to be perfectly still within fast-moving low overcast flowing in from the south (left to right in the photo) that sometimes broke up enough for just a few seconds to enable it to be seen, thus popping in and out of view. It appeared to be slightly semitransparent and seemed two-dimensional. It was clearly trapezoid-shaped with straight edges and was about the size a medium-sized jet airplane might appear viewed from a about a mile away and a mile in altitude. I believe the object was either within the upper portion of the cloud deck or at some height above it. Immediately when I saw it, I shifted my head about to make sure it wasn’t a spot or reflection on my glasses I was seeing. But then I was sure it was there when it popped in and out of view. The sighting lasted about 10 seconds, and I waited another couple of minutes to see if it would appear again so I could snap a picture, but the overcast had thickened too much. The object was almost due west and about 15 or 20 degrees above the horizon. It was a slightly wide trapezoid; all straight edges with parallel top and bottom angled slightly down and right; the right edge at about a 90-degree angle to that, and the left edge angled downward to the left at about 135/45-degree angles. Because it seemed two-dimensional, it was as if I was seeing it head on. My reaction to this event was that as soon I saw it, I was sure it was nothing conventional, as it was large enough and clear enough to be interpreted with no doubt. I’ve included a photo of the view from my vantage point, taken about an hour after I spotted the object. It was almost exactly in the center of the image…just above the top of the building.

A few weeks ago, I reported sighting either one (1) object glowing with many lights in the shape of a wide V, - or - many objects glowing as they traveled in a V-shape. That inspired me to continue watching the night sky, now that there have been 2 nights of totally clear sky. An hour earlier, i noticed a very unusual moon. I could see the entire moon in an opaque way, despite only a quarter shining. The night is perfectly clear. Around 8 pm, I noticed a very tiny dot of light traveling at what appeared to be a normal speed for small aircraft. However, there were no tracking lights. I watched the object for about one minute, as it drifted eastward, but then it instantly vanished. I kept watching where it would be if it had not blinked out, but never saw it again. I can imagine a drone being lit for a period of time to help establish it's location and then having its lights turned off for stealth purposes, but for what purpose? Northern Oaxaca City is not a hotbed of crime, as far as I know. That hooked me, so I continued watching that area of the sky, and perhaps ten minutes later, still looking at the northern sky, I saw a tiny light which had originally appeared next to a star. I noticed the object was moving, but not at a normal angle for aircraft. The airport is south of here, not north ! Only a mountain range is north. Satellite? It was moving downward at a 40-45 degree angle - so it is hard to believe it was a satellite or plane. A drone perhaps? A helicopter however, would not be able to land in the steep mountains to the north of my area. I am supposing the second object mentioned (which might have been the 1st object I saw) might have landed. It was headed toward the ground, but from a very high altitude.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,,

Cannot imagine migratory birds glowing bright at a high altitude and then blinking out. That event inspired me to keep watching the night sky when it is reasonably clear. Last night was perfectly clear. 8:00 PM: All of the moon was fully visible in an opaque way with a quarter of it shining brightly. 8:15 PM: I was looking at the northern sky where three stars form a triangle, or, pyramid-shape (when one connects the dots); * I noted what appeared to be a tiny star which appeared to be quite close to one of the two lower stars, but noticed it was moving slowly, the way a small plane would; * I considered it might be a satellite until it started going downward at a 60-degree angle, as though it were landing in the mountains; * The extreme altitude of the object, combined with the expansive and steep and thus uninhabitable mountains it was over (which define the northern limit of Oaxaca-City) surely could not be used for drug production/trafficking, so unlikely it was a police, govt, or private drone; 8:30 PM: In the same area over the mountains, I spotted a similar object (or the same object) at a high altitude, moving slowly. After about 20 seconds it instantly vanished; No trails, or tracking lights; No changing color; Only dull white light. Seemed to be very high up. Rhetorical Questions: Do satellites shine and then blink out? * I'm aware of what conventional aircraft look like as they approach the local airport; * Venus was shining big and bright as usual; * These objects seem to defy all the behavior of commercial craft, satellites, and drones. * Not sure if I mentioned that about two weeks ago, I watched an object over the same mountains on the north side of Oaxaca-City that moved slowly, stopped at went back the way it came, without swerving. It went back the way it came the way a car can simply stop and be put into reverse without turning. A few moments later, a commercial aircraft w/ ice-trail, heading west, flew 3,000 ft. under object. * Cheap, Samsung AO2s Phone cannot photograph, or make video of something so far away in the night sky. A Jet Flying Very Low Toward Airport Turns Off All LIghts? RE: Aerial objects that might blink out: It is only fair to mention that one night about two weeks ago, a small aircraft (either military, or commercial) was heading in the direction of the airport and almost over my apartment; About 2,000 meters before getting over my apartment, the vehicle turned off all it's lights. As it flew over, I could see it as a shadow and hear the jet-engines roaring. It is fair to conclude, Mexico's version of an FAA may be quite lax if such pilot behavior is tolerated.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,,

It's a recurring event that I have accepted and now it's a regular part of my everyday life. Everyday right before the sun goes down I'm greeted usually with 1 coming into view then another but that's just the beginning. I have a total of at least a hundred upwards of over 200 that follow me everywhere I go. It sounds crazy I hate explaining it cause almost everyone thinks I'm delusional but I can see perfectly I have brilliant vision and depth perception. They are just over the trees at their highest and below the tree tops at their lowest. Just a few days ago I was watching ufo or uap videos on YouTube and saw the Albuquerque video of the white orbs in formation and then the orange one. Same exact white orbs that follow me also with the orange one. They appear in formation and they mimic the constellation. I have been greeted by the big dipper just right above when turning on my road when I'm pulling in at home. It sounds insane but this has been going on since early May. Up until I saw that video in NM I thought they were drones but I started to realize that's not the case and there's other things that's happened that I'm not gonna explain that support the uap theory and dismantle this drone hype that some are trying to convince is the majority of these sightings. I found an article about this lady who can communicate with different beings and I tried this and got a reaction. I failed to hear or receive or understand and communication but I did get 2 of them to descend below the trees at my house and the other was last night behind food Lion with the bigger orange colored orb, it also changed from orange to white back to orange then to red then back to orange. The first one at home I got to descend from what I could tell definitely wasn't a drone. Seen no propellers nor heard any. There was however a tiny glowing red dot or orb that aimlessly danced or orbited this thing with no recognizable pattern or destination. I'm hoping to discover the reason as to why I was chosen to be followed or watched by these things. They stay up until right before the sunrises and it doesn't matter where I go or how fast I go they have absolutely no difficulty finding or keeping up with me..

The best way to describe it is it turned into what looked like a huge PAC MAN because of the pie shaped indent that it had and also it was like really bright Yellow and orange mixed and as soon as the slice missing or door was at full open i recorded a glowing light or ship exit the opening of this pac man like orb then the quickly must have closed cause it was round again and its color was changed back to like a pulsating white again i continued to record for probably another 7 min and it changed to the reddish yellow a coulple of more times but i never saw it open again. i will leave you with this im not a nut and i have it on video just wanted to tell someone oh yes my wife was there with me too .

The night is extremely slow like any other as we typically stay open in case of emergencies, weather diverts, delayed arrivals or cargo planes. I was sitting kicked back in my chair and looking at an array of screens and equipment in front of me that are spanned out horizontally across a low sitting desk so I have a good field of view of the sky. Its a clear night, visibility is well beyond our farthest reportable value of 10 miles. The lowest level of the trace clouds in the sky are 20,000 feet above the ground level. There are very few stars visible, and not a single airplane or even a radar blip of a moving object anywhere within 60 miles of me. These radars are accurate enough to often mistakenly pick up large birds momentarily, so there was surely nothing typical in our skies on this night. Counting the minutes until my shifts end, gazing blankly across my desk and into the dark night, is when I saw what I have no other explanation for than a UFO. Like nothing I have ever seen before, what appeared to be one object with two vibrant glowing green lights in a fixed orientation next to each other appeared several thousand feet in the sky in a rapid downward trajectory. The object was definitely several miles away from my position based on my day to day observations looking out these same windows when there are dozens of airplanes in the area. But the size of the object being several miles away, appeared as large as an Airbus only a mile away, flying into the ground, lit up like a glowing green Christmas tree. The object had appeared at what looked like several thousand feet above the ground, and within seconds it has descended to barely above my horizon view and a ridge line in the distance when it appeared to “pull up” like a modern aircraft would, but being its size and speed and trajectory, no modern aircraft would be able to pull up to a horizontal flight path that abruptly. Just as the object appeared to level, the lights vanished as instantly as any light would turn off from the flick of a switch. I have never seen anything like this, there have been no signs or even a flicker of light anywhere in that area or the surrounding sky in hours… I have been spooked, chilled and at an uncomfortable loss of words since.",2021-12-19T00:00:00,43.05037092436975,-76.157063697479

These faded after about 10 seconds. I thought a boat had sent up fireworks, but there was no sound nor any boats that I could see. After a few seconds, in the spot where the orange glows had been, I saw many tiny white lights flickering in a round pattern. This lasted a few seconds, and then there appeared larger star-like lights pulsating at different intervals in what seemed to be a triangular pattern. The ""object"" (just lights were all that were visible) began to move back and forth across the sky at a relatively medium pace. At times, the lights would completely disappear, but then return after 5 - 10 seconds. After about 5 minutes of this, 2 of lights seemed to separate quickly and become 2 completely different ""objects"" with the same intermittent (sometimes rapid) flashing lights, and both began to travel back and forth across the sky. This went on another 15 minutes, when lower on the horizon 3 more orange ""glows"" appeared and soon faded. When I looked back to where the original objects had been, they had disappeared and did not return. There was no sound.

I had seen the same thing about 2 or 3 nights earlier but didnt get up to check it out because it disappeared fairly quickly and i assumed it was just a plane. But this time i grabbed my cell phone and very quickly went to the window/door which was about 30 feet away from me and started filming the object (Pardon my swearing in the video, i was startled a little). It was amber in color and constantly fading and getting brighter frequently. It appeared to be a 1/2 mile to 1 mile south of the City over the cemetery or possibly the small lake which was a little further away. But it appeared to be no further than a mile away at the most. It was hard to tell. I have NEVER seen anything like this before. And it must have been getting very bright in order for it to catch my attention through a window that was 30 feet away while watching TV in another room. I filmed it for about 51 seconds before i couldnt see it any longer. See attached video. I was also able to go through the video frame by frame afterwards and zoom in on the object and took several screens shots of the object while zooming in on my Iphone 8 plus. Im going to ask around and see if anyone else has seen the object over the next few days.
