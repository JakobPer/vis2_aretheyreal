This event began with a flashing green strobe about 10 degrees over the horizon between the cloud croft mountains and white sands missile range in the Northeast part of the sky. .   The light was pulsating at different intervals and luminosity for about 15 minutes before a solid green light appeared about 40 degrees above pulsating light.  That light remained constant for about 5 minutes when a solid light descended from sky to near the same area as the solid green light.   The white light began moving in different directions very erratically and at times making oblong circles.   I would say that it would travel within 15 degrees above, and below the solid green almost instantly.  Closest way to describe its behavior would be like someone trying to film an object in the sky with a shaky hand or a meteorite moving and stopping and changing directions hundreds of times.  Moved faster than I have ever seen something move.   The entire event ended when the erratic! light stopped and then shot down towards the horizon and green lights appeared to begin moving north easterly. The entire group of people within our dunes area were watching this.  I would suspect that anyone in the park who was looking in the sky would have seen this.

He points out that the White Sands National facility is in New Mexico, not Arizona, as first reported.  Also, the Moon does not appear in the northern sky.  Its orbit around the Earth, which does not change its plane or direction, translates to the fact that it cannot appear in the northern sky.  PD))",2012-09-24T00:00:00,,

We are around two blocks east of Sawmill Rd., so we were relatively close to this craft. The color was of a reddish orange tint which appeared to be sourced from the center of the craft and illuminating the rest of the object defining the shape, but not creating a “glow” beyond it's dimensions. The illumination could be be compared to a Chinese Lantern or a Christmas luminary. The light was not flickering, pulsating or blinking at this time.

Our view was unobstructed for approx. one minute before the object passed behind a large tree which completely blocked our view for approx. 2 minutes. We positioned ourselves from where we were originally at to get a better view for when the object reemerged from behind the tree. When we were able to see the object again, it was heading in a northwestern direction, had put more distance between us and itself, and had taken on more of a ball shape, and appeared to be smaller than when we first saw it. The color had also changed slightly taking on more of a red tint and was also pulsating. As it continued to head in a northwest direction, it had picked up speed comparable to a small aircraft, and raised slightly in altitude. We then jumped in a car attempting to follow the object. Since we could only go West or North by road, we were only able to travel for a couple miles before we could no longer see it due to the distance between us and it, and the amount of large trees obstructing our view.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,39.55,-86.07969999999999

At about 12:15 I looked out to the Northwest, and noticed a single bright light, and signaled my buddy to look at it…I had seen the same thing several months before.  A single bright, slightly off white, somewhat yellowed circular light hanging stationary above the ridge.  We pretty much stared at it for a good 10-20 minutes, and it faded to a point, then blinked out. Ten minutes later, we noticed it had come back in the same exact position – it remained there, slightly brighter, before blinking completely out instantly, not fading, just completely going dark, several seconds later it faded back, then flashed out completely.  Another few minutes passed without any event, then one light came into existence, slightly smaller than the original, but just to the left of the position of the original light, shortly after, a light of the original intensity came back, in the same exact position it had been the entire time. Then they both flickered out, then back once – they’d moved in a Northwardly direction- right of their original positions.  They blinked out again, and reappeared slightly more to the right.  The third time they reappeared, they didn’t blink off again, sliding slowly to the right, and down toward the ridge, behind a cell tower, before disappearing completely.

There must have been a low mist because only the main bright stars could be seen.  On the lower horizon there were none.  I looked up and could easily make out the constellation of Orion.  Several planes, as always could be seen flashing their lights and coming in to land at London Stanstead Airport, mostly heading east.  Some could also be seen climbing on departure in the distance as single flashing lights obscured by the slight ground mist that obviously obscured all distant horizon vision. I was day dreaming and looking at Orion relaxing my eyes from the computer in the dark wondering about its connection with the pyramids when I saw a large flame-red slow pulsing disc coming out of Orion the Hunter. When I say coming out, I mean that I first noticed it as it passed my view of Orion which was partially obscured and edged by my window frame.  For a second or two I thought I was imagining it.  The whole of the disc glowed flame red.  It was not a light as seen on a plane but a whole object that pulsed red from within.  Maybe it would be better to say that it throbbed with intensity from bright to very bright every two seconds.  It had clear definable edges. Although in the middle there seemed to be a horizontal thin bright white line at times.  It was heading east. About the same speed as the occasional incoming planes were in the near distance.  I shouted out at the top of my voice to my colleague who was feeding the dog downstairs.  The door was shut in the upstairs o! ffice but I did not want to take my eyes of it for a second to even open the door to call downstairs.  So I shouted again seriously loud.  The dog barked and I could hear him rushing up the stairs. “Look at fxxxing that!” I said as he entered the room.  He was in time to see it moving just before it came to a sudden halt.  I tried to open the window as it was double glazed as I wanted to see it without obstruction.  It was locked, so I rushed into my bedroom and flung open my window there. John and I watched it stationary for over a full minute as it pulsed and hung in the sky just above the opposite roof top of the adjacent house. Not that it was above it per se, but maybe six or eight hundred yards away, maybe a lot more. I measured it as ¾ of an inch twixt thumb and forefinger at arm’s length. It never budged an inch from its position but was gradually fading and losing intensity of colour, eventually becoming a reddish brown. Also it was becoming smaller as if heading away a! t a perfect angle to us. It slowly shrunk and faded out of exi! stence t o a miniscule point.  We walked out of the room and as he went downstairs to draw what he saw I said hopefully, “Where are you going it might come back.”  To my great surprise it did! In the time of walking from one room to the other it was repeating its movements. I saw it in the sky away from Orion as soon as I looked out of the window and it came on in, on a slightly different route. It halted again and hung in the air virtually in the same area. But before it faded out completely it lowered out of vision beyond the neighbour’s rooftop.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,,

My girlfriend had been telling me ,a couple days before this ,that she had seen a UFO in the sky ,to the east of our house ,above the tree line.I did not pay too much attention to her ,until monday October 1st,2012 when i was watching tv and randomly looked out the window . I saw a light that caught my attention because it looked like an airplane but was not moving. I went outside on my deck and looked closer at this . It was a light that looked like a star ,but brighter,and seemed to have flickering red and green lights on it that told me it was a plane, but it was not moving anywhere.  I had a view of this between 2 trees and could tell it was not going anywhere,this light was west of my house above the treeline. As I am watching this light with my son ( 16 yrs .old ) ,  my girlfriend yelled at me that she can see another one on the other side of the house , to the east.We live outside Eugene, Oregon ,on a mountain, where there are no lights from the city ,m! aking the stars stand out with great brightness. We watched both of these lights for a while and only saw them move slightly up and down ,and side to side once in a while .  I got out my binoculars and could definately see flashing green and red lights and once in a while there was a dark ,almost purple blue light that was not constant, seemed to be random...... When I was watching the on to the west, I saw a bright flash of light close to the others that looked like maybe if you shined a realy bright light at something chrome or a mirror or something . This light never flashed again , that I saw .

Initially, the light seemed to be quite a distance away and relatively high in the sky (it was to the right of the moon from our vantage point at that time). The best description we can give of the object is that it seemed similar to the shape of torch and the red color was extremely bright.  What struck us as most peculiar was that the object was ascending rapidly, practically straight up.  Then it suddenly and rapidly moved right, almost at a right angle.  Then it began moving toward us and its flight appeared to take more of a horizontal course.  Without taking our eyes from the object, we moved our position on the ground to maintain an unobstructed view of its course.  The object continued to fly horizontally and then it disappeared before our eyes.  We remained in the same position for several minutes but the object did not reappear.

We still talk about this case among ourselves quite often, and have shockingly discovered some addition information we know is related to this UFO encounter.  It is unbelievable to say the least.  My only hope is that people will believe what I am about to tell you.  I am no liar or scam artist.  As earlier reported, the huge UFO hovered straight above our heads, and we were blinded by the bright yellow light which was shining down upon us.  We tried to look up but the light was blinding us, and the noise was deafning as well.  The large object made a hissing-swishing sound with a very loud roar to it.  Now, the new information I am disclosing to you is mysterious, and we are left to wonder what happened to us, and why.  We all now believe we were indeed abducted by the UFO, and! lost track of our time.  We also have the ""evidence"" to prove it.  A few short weeks or so after the UFO encounter we were all in our White Plains Elementary School one day having our classes as usual.  All of a sudden the principal sent out a loud message over the intercom telling us that ""all"" of us kids in the entire school (close to where the UFO-abduction took place) were going to be inoculated for some flu disease or something etc.  It was in the summetime?  We were to go class after class until everybody was done inthe entire school.  When my class time came my cousin R. was with me and we both went to the front of the school with our other clasmates in the middle isle, stood in line, and waited our turn.  The funny thing was that the doctors, or whoever they really were, hid their faces behind white masks and wore white uniforms and gloves.  I proceeded up to receive my shot and then it got really strange.  A person took out a large machine, like a huge staple gun, held it to my ""forehead,"" between my ey es and stamped me and said it was done.  It was a ""diamond"" imprint placed right between my eyes, and I still have the strange diamond imprint to this very day.  My cousin R. got a circle imprint placed between her eyes on her forehead just like I did, and hers is still there today too.  Why were we not given shots in the arm or buttocks like normal?  When I got home and told my father what had happened he said, ""What do you mean you got a mark put on your forehead?""  I showed the diamond mark to him and he got very upset and angry.  Then after he contacted the school the next day he never mentioned it again, and I found this strange as well.  I told my current physician a couple of years ago about the incident, and she told me that shots were ""never"" given in the forehead, and when I showed it to her she was dumbfounded.  We all cannot find any information on getting shots in the forehead anywhere.  Why were we marked?  Why the diamond-circle s! hapes?  We do strongly now feel that these unusual shots-markings had something sinister to do with our neightborhood UFO encounter.  This additional material is ""ABSOLUTELY TRUE.""  As stated earlier, we have the proof to prove it, especially R. and I.  I look at my mark today on my forehead &lt;&gt; turned the other way, and it baffles and concerns me.   Today, at times, I know I am beng watched, and have heard radio chatter outside my bedroom at night.  I hear strange ""clicks"" in my house occasionally too.  Sometimes I even fear for my safety because ""they"" know that I know the truth about UFOs and Extraterrestrials.  They are indeed real.  Who are we?  Why were we marked?  Lastly, what does these strange symbols on our foreheads mean for our future?  Are we being monitored for some strange reason or another?  I must remain ananymous about my identity because I feel I might be in danger.  My cousin R. feels the same way.  My story is true, and as a Christian I take my honesty and integrity very seriously. ! I now w ork handling U.S. Government material, and trust me; The UFOs Are Real, and I have the material to prove it.""

My 3 year old son was asleep on the back seat of the car. It was after dark and I had fallen asleep when my friend stopped the car, pulled to the side of the road in the middle of the desert not far from the Mexican border. He woke me up and said, “look at that.”  We got out of the car and there in the sky in front of us hovered a spaceship. It was close enough to see what appeared to be windows encircling the middle section. Circling the middle section was also what looked like light blue and green colored vaporous lights swirling around the windows. The space ship was shaped like two huge saucers placed together in a v shape and it moved slowly in a circular direction. We watched it for awhile and then it just instantly vanished.  I have always been open minded and my male companion who lived in the foothills of the Tucson Mountains, said that he had often seen UFO’s there. Still, all I could think of was that someone was filming a movie about spaceships out there in the middle of no where and that was what I was seeing. It looked exactly like what I had always thought a spaceship looked like.  Soon after when we reached the border, I tried to explain what I had seen to the Mexican border guards and was stumbling to find the Spanish word for saucer, but my friend finally told me not to bother since it was not something that they would probably understand in any event.  After spending a couple of days in the resort area of Guaymas, we drove back to Tucson the way that we had come. I kept looking for tall mesas in the area where we had seen the spaceship as that would explain why it had just instantly disappeared while we were watching it by flying behind a mesa, but there were none.  I have often mentioned this sighting to others and no one seemed to doubt what I had seen. Perhaps there are more people in the world who do not disbelieve in their existence than one would imagine.  I had never seen one before nor since, but I know what I saw. I do not know from where it came or even if it may not have been created by someone on our earth planet.

The subject changed and we were discussing other topics when, all of a sudden an oval light appeared out of no where, no sound. We did not hear it coming. It shot across the sky, stopped instantly and hovered in the distance, it seemed like it was about ½ mile away. It was not possible to judge its height exactly, but it looked like it might have been between 500 and 1,000 ft above us and to the South of where we were sitting. We were all stunned.

When we arrived at my home , but still were in the street, I looked up and saw a round UFO with lights circling the perimeter of it, I seem to think they were colored lights.I would consider it to be a crude UFO more like a Lost in Space variety.  It was hovering above us, Actually very close. I would say about only 4 stories above us. It made no noise. I looked for a minute  until it hit me that it was a UFO and with that, I jumped off my friend's bicycle , ran to my front door , and started pounding on the door screaming for my parents to come out . No one else saw it. The next day my father told me he read in the paper that a weather balloon was out on Long Island , and that is what I must have seen. I believed he was lying to me, and still know that it was a UFO, Government or otherwise.  I also feel that if I did not look up and see it , some possible harm may h! ave come to us.

There were eight of my family and friend that witnessed this event. My UFO sighting in 1969  It was a warm summers night in Princeton Pa. and I was visiting my girl at her house.  Unlike today communicating with your family could be a problem. You see back in those days we were lucky if we had land phones in our houses. Many of these phones were still the old party line phones too. So there could be a long wait at times to get to use your own home phone, unless of course you interrupted the conversation of those who were using it and asked them to allow you the use of the line. Fortunately for me such was not the case on this particular night.  My girl and I were at our favorite spot which was right beside her little record player in a room in her downstairs. We were listening to some of our favorite tunes on single 33 records. Those old record players were cool because you could load up a half dozen or so records and not have to change them every 3 minutes. It was the high tech of the day! At least for what we could afford.  As we listened to some songs the phone rang and I was told it was for me. When I took the call my Mother was on the other end and she was quite excited about something that was outside of our house. She asked me to get home as soon as I could to see this object which she claimed was floating above our farm. I told my girl friend about what Mom had said and we piled into my car to go see it.  She had a younger brother who wanted to go so we let him this time.  I had only been driving since Oct. of 1968. Which was about nine month's total. So it was always cool to get in my 57 Chevy and speed down the road. Today you can hardly get me to drive anywhere.  We were only 5 miles from my place so it took no time for us to make the trip. As we topped the last of several little hills on the way we could see an amber colored object in the sky hovering above Mom and the rest of my family. They were all standing in our driveway looking up at this thing. The object did not move the whole time we approached the house and parked the car.  When we got out of the car it was still hovering over the trees. It covered the house and the road and some trees across the road. It was huge, at least four times the size of our home and it was silent. It made no noise at all. The object was not like many UFO's that we had seen on T.V. reports. Most of those were blurry movie film and camera stills. This was crystal clear and it was amber in color. I say clear because we had no trouble making out that it was nothing like any of our aircraft. The only thing was that its color came from a light that was around the whole craft. We could see what appeared to be a disk shaped metal craft inside of the amber light. We could not see any markings on it or any windows or doors. It looked solid in the light and it was silent.  Well silent that is for most of the time. What this craft would do was hover over the trees and house for approximately five minutes. After that amount of time it would turn on some kind of device which sounded like a very large vacuum cleaner. The noise from the craft lasted only a minute or so and then it would stop. Every time the noise stopped the craft would shoot straight up until we could barely see it. It went so quickly that we could only see a streak of orange light trail behind it. It would stay up there a little while then it would shoot straight back down at us. It came down so fast we thought it would hit us. Lucky for us it always stopped at tree top level. It repeated these sounds and the up and down manuvers for approximately an hour. I do not know how many times but I will guess a dozen or more.  I am writing this event down one more time for my children and their children too have a record of. I believe it is worth remembering. I do not have any memory of an abduction of any of us that night. Even though the craft behaved strangely and returned so many times. If I believed that hypnotizing someone is actually possible I would be hypnotized just to remember the event better and hopefully find out if there were any abductioned.  We did try to contact the police but that was a joke. They laughed at us and said yea right then hung up the damn phone. Ever since this experience I have not trusted any policeman to help me out of any fix. Of course it was 1969 and people then were a lot less inclined to believe that there were any UFO's in our skies.  The little picture I linked to this post is eeriely reminiscent of that night. However, the light from the craft did not shine out from it like a flash light. It just enveloped the craft and barely light up the tree tops.  One more thing before I close, the book of Ezekiel speaks of a craft that the prophet saw in a vision. If you study hard you will see that Ezekiel's craft was a bright shiny amber colored object. (amber is the color of a highly polished brass/bronze metal)  I have wondered many times if our sighting was of the same craft!",2012-07-04T00:00:00,41.00122390243902,-80.31946780487806

We saw 4 lights in the sky.  There was a distinct cloud cover in the area, and these glowing lights were all visible beneath the clouds.  We slowed our car down and heard the beep of a tractor in a field, later I went back to meet that farmer and he was beeping at us to see the lights.  We talked about it and confirmed that it was like nothing that we had ever seen before. When we noticed the lights  I slowed the car down, head kind of out the window, and finally pulled over and stopped and got out of the car.  My partner watched from inside the car.  I could hear no sounds coming from those lights, only the small din of the tractor in the field we had just passed.  He later told me he had turned his tractor off and could hear nothing as well.  We saw 4 lights. One was blocked from view by trees by the time we pulled our car over.  It was difficult to tell about their movement.  They more or less were hovering, and moved a little and disappeared.  We assumed they went above the clouds but who knows.  When we did see the lights, they appeared bigger than airplane lights would in the sky, I would say they glowed, no flashing.  Their color was kind of a red-orange.  They immediately caught my attention as being a sight I had had never seen in the evening sky, and they were below the clouds.  When the three that we could finally see disappeared, th! ey did not disappear over the horizon, rather it appeared that they went into the clouds. I then went back to the farmer and he was putting his tractor away as it was pretty dark by now, not completely.  He was a Mennonite farmer.  He had been beeping at us to see the lights and we talked about it.  He said he had noticed them about the same time as we drove by.  I would guess that from the time we saw them to the time they disappeared that about two minutes went by.  He mentioned a diamond formation.

The “lights” had circular shape in a yellow/gold color, coming from the Lake Union area, down, from the horizon, going up, and travelling from East to South.  I took some binoculars and it seemed that the yellow/gold circle had a red center.  We are not sure what this was, because it was unlike anything else we have seen before.  If they were fireworks, they should have gone up, faster, but these were travelling in the sky, in pairs, it seems, and there were about 16. It took them about 5-10 minutes to go from one place to the other, and then they vanished.

Three Orange Triangular Lights in the Sky  It was Christmas Eve around 10:00 p.m.  It was a clear night with what looked to be a full moon.  The moon was shining bright with a huge white circular illumination.   I went outside into my backyard to let my dog out to go to the bathroom.  I sat down and waited for her.  I looked up and saw an orange triangular light in the sky the size of a small plane.  It was to the left of the moon’s light.  I thought it odd because it was bright orange.  I see planes overhead at night all the time and know that the planes’ lights blink white and orange.  This object did not, but it didn’t get my attention just yet.  I looked back down and continued to wait for my dog.  When I looked back up again the object had not passed overhead.  It was almost as if it had passed round again. When I continued to look up in the sky I now saw another orange triangular light.  I had never seen two “planes” so close together and thought it very strange.  As I continued to look, a third orange light came into view.  Now there were three orange lights in the sky in a triangular position.  It was at this time, I believed without a doubt, that I was seeing some sort of U.F.O.  I was scared but intrigued.   I stared at the three objects for a while and waited for them to pass overhead but they didn’t.  They just hovered.  The lights never blinked like planes and it was silent. Eventually, one light slowly moved to the right and out of my range of sight.  It was blocked by my patio umbrella.  I kept my eye on the two lights in front of me.  Then one of the lights slowly moved to the left.  By now the lights were getting smaller and shrinking into more of a circular orange light.  My eyes darted back and forth between the two smaller orange lights until they became white like stars and faded off. I just kept watching to see if the lights would come back but they didn’t.  The next thing I saw in the sky was a plane.  I watched it carefully to see what the lights would do.  I saw orange and white lights blinking, and of course I heard the sound.

On Christmas Eve 2012 I noticed circular object emitting a strong bright light. it appeared out of nowhere. It zigzagged moving very fast. It then took off and the size of the object was greatly reduced as well as the strength of the light it emitted. I was hoping someone else was outside at the time, but after it disappeared I noticed no one else was outside. As I approached my home I had saw my neighbors outside I looked up and the object appeared out of nowhere again, traveling at great speeds and it was a very strong light emitting from the object. Luckily, my neighbors were outside and they were waiting for family for Christmas Eve to arrive. My neighbor actually had a camera around his neck, I shouted to him look up look up. My neighbor was outside with his two young daughters and we were all amazed at how this object traveled and how it disappeared and then reappeared. It had disappeared and reappeared three times in total that night up to about 12 AM. My neighbor took several pictures of the object. This had no characteristics of a plane or helicopter, it moved at such speeds and such different directions that it could not have been anything we know of right now. It was able to hover, take off, and hover, disappear then reappear. The light it gave off was captivating. My neighbor and I are waiting for the film to develop. I am very excited to see how this object looks on film. I can assure you, there is no way possible it was a plane or helicopter. Without a doubt it has to be defined as as a UFO. One more note,the light this object was giving off was so bright that you couldn't really make out the shape of the object. But, when I had seen it appear out of nowhere as it went across the sky I could see somehow, the top of the object. The top was a circular shape, like I could make out the top half of the object. I don't know if because it accelerated out of nowhere that I could make out the top half of the object, but after that the light was too strong to see the physical shape of the object. The light that was a emitting from it was a circular shape, like a fire ball.  Note- the film still has to be developed. If my neighbor was able to get the image in his shot, of which I am positive he did, it should be amazing proof as I have never seen a thing like it. Please inform me of the best way to send the images. Thanks.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,27.285686301369864,-80.36344363992173

We drove into the parking lot and I waited while she ran inside. Looking straight east I noticed the planet Jupiter bright in the eastern sky.  It was a clear night and cool. Just a little to the Northeast of Jupiter I noticed a small flashing light that just looked funny.  So I grabbed a pair of my binoculars that I keep in my van to get a better look.  Through the binocs I saw a huge white light with a red blue light on surrounding the bottom.  I thought it might be a prism effect of the binoculars when my wife came out of the building and asked what I was looking at. I pointed the light out.  She was looking with her naked eye and I through the binocs when suddenly the object split in half.  My wife commented, ""did you just see the light split! ""?  She saw with her naked eye.  The object moved quickly apart, with the brighter part moving away from the red blue lighted half.  We watched for a few more minutes and then headed home keeping the separated object in view.  When we got home we quickly looked east again with binoculars just in time to see the object merge back together. Amazing sight to be sure.  I would guess the object was huge and at a great distance because of lack of detail.   As a closing thought, later that morning when I picked up my son from work at 6 AM Sunday morning, the object was gone and have not seen it in the sky since.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,40.0034168732507,-82.99822087165134

The home faces almost due north.  Weather unusually cool and dry for the Houston area, very little wind, no clouds. I noticed what at first I thoght was a bunch of balloons floating toward me.  Movement was from approximately N/NE. I could see several colors: blue/green, yellow, reddish orange, all on the upper side of the object. As it got closer overhead I realized that the object was much larger than I originally thought because a twin engine airplane flew at considerable distance below it (flying east to west).  No airports are nearby that I know of. When it reached around 13:30 elevation above me, three very bright lights in a perfect triangle appeared on the bottom.  I then began to doubt that it was a bunch of balloons.  For the lights to to be reflections, the surfaces would have to have been mirror-polished. I had a good digital camera in my car parked across the street (unfortunately the macro lens was installed at the time). I walked to the car; because the object was moving slowly I wasn't in a big hurry. As I got close to the car, I looked up and saw that the object was making a sharp turn to the N/NW and moving very rapidly.  The bright lights below were still visible. I grabbed the camera as quickly as I could, but the object was already almost out of sight and disappearing above the rooftops of 2-story homes across the street.

I noticed another light accompanying the large bright light that looked like a very colorful Christmas tree.  Both were moving in a way that did not make sense to me.  I asked my wife to look at them and she could not figure it out ether. I walked out side to the lakefront and began to watch the lights moving around at, I would guess 1000 feet above the lake.

It was floating slowly not fast at all.  A few ot! her people came up on the walk way looking up at it and commenting as to what it was. The light stayed floating and looked like it was floating away from us because it appeared to get smaller and smaller until it was just gone.

The objects did not appear to be in any sort of formation.  No noise of any sort was heard from these objects as the sound of the waves could be heard in the distance.  Our balcony faced almost due west.  These objects, to my observance, were heading approximately southwest 230 degrees.   Thunderstorms were in the area that evening with a great deal of lighting and precipitation.  At the time of observation of the objects the thunderstorms had dissipated and high thin overcast was observed at the time of appearance.  We observed the four bright orange objects slowly accelerate away at approximately 200-300 knots up into the high thin overcast. No sooner than they disappeared, two more of the same objects appeared to be coming from the surface of the water and traveling the same flight path.  We watched them fly into the overcast.  Then another appeared.  At the sighting of the fifth or sixth object, my fiancé stepped into the room and retrieved her binoculars.  I was able to observe the object as it too traveled roughly the same path.  I did mention to her that the objects appeared to have been coming from the ocean to then being airborne.  The description of the object in the binoculars was bright orange with the appearance of dark vertical lines encircled around the object. The shoreline of our view curved in such a way that I can estimate our distance from the object to be 3-5 miles due to the fact that the farthest land mass was in my estimation to be 8 to 10 miles.  The objects again appeared to be closer to our half way point from that farthest land mass.  In about 35 to 40 minutes we observed a total of twelve of these bright orange objects all originating from the same location close to the shoreline and just above the water surface.  Movement of the objects was initially slow then accelerating to what I would say was about 300 knots. I am a captain of a major airline based in DFW  employed with them for almost 27 years.  I spent 10 years as a fighter pilot in the USAF.  What I described of my observance of these objects was based on my 37 years in aviation as a pilot.

The objects were about 10,000 feet above the ground. Each object had 3 bright lights horizontally without a beam. There was a reflection and refracted light like a rainbow around the 3 lights on both objects. We watched with binoculars and eventually the objects moved slowly northward and disappeared.  DETAILED SUMMARY OF SIGHTING On Sunday evening, March 18, 2012 at about 10PM I was on my patio and noticed an unusually bright light in the northern sky and a light of lesser brightness further north in the northern sky. I looked at both for a while, maybe 5 or 10 minutes, and noticed that they were not moving at all. I observed this from Estero, FL and determined that the two lights were approximately over the city of Ft Myers, FL or perhaps a bit further north than that. The sky was clear with no cloud cover. I called my wife to come and see the two lights and she also noticed that they did not move in any direction. During this time, several airplanes heading to the SW Florida International Airport passed under thee two lights so you could tell that these lights were not aircraft of any kind known to either of us. After about 20 minutes of watching the two lights/objects I got my powerful binoculars and took a closer look. Upon closer observation I noticed that there were actually three bright lights! side by side in a horizontal configuration without any light beam. Surrounding the three bright lights was an aura or reflection with refracted light, like a rainbow, but I could not see what shape the object that supported the three lights might have been. The other object of lesser brightness turned out to be the same, having three lights side by side in a horizontal configuration with the rainbow-like aura, only dimmer because it appeared further north and was more distant visually. So there were two similar objects in the northern night sky separated from each other by many miles, not moving in any direction and making no sound at all. By all appearances the two lights were about 10,000 feet above the ground or perhaps a bit more. I also determined that the size of each object was about 75 - 100 feet in length or diameter and was about half the size of my small fingernail if I extended my arm fully. We continued to watch with the binoculars for another 15 or 20 minutes! with no changes that were obvious to us. Then gradually the t! wo objec ts moved slowly north and eventually disappeared from view. That was it. There was no more to the sighting. The time was then about 10:45 or 10:50PM.  APPEARANCE OF THE OBJECTS I could not see the shape of the objects because of the darkness in the sky but they were probably oblong, like a cigar, or saucer-shaped with us having seen the side view of the saucer. The configuration of the three lights brought me to this conclusion about the shape of the object.  SIZE OF THE OBJECTS They appeared to be about 75 - 100 feet in length or diameter for actual size and about the size of half of my small fingernail with my arm fully extended for relative size.

I got home at approximately 1930 hours and decided to take my Boxer dog Raja for a walk.  We walk a big loop of about 1.25 miles.  Toward the end of our walk in Niceville Florida we were coming down the hill on 27th street just past the Mormon Church.  We were coming from the east and facing west. About one hundred yards before reaching the corner of 27th Street and South Cedar Street I suddenly saw a large ball of fire rise from the tree line.  I continued walking toward it assuming it was a small airplane from the aero club on Eglin AFB.  However, I began to notice it was just hovering there silently—perhaps about one thousand feet or so above the tree line.  It was amber in color and just a big ball of pulsating light. It didn’t blink in or out—but pulsed. I have worked on aircraft for 31 years for the federal government.  I also hold an FAA A&P mechanic’s license. I have seen many things in 31 years on flight lines all around the world. But I never saw anything like this. What struck me was that this thing rose suddenly out of the tree line and hovered for a minute. It was completely silent. It had no standard aircraft lighting, no wing tip lights, no anti-collision or beacon light, nothing but its pulsating amber color. After hovering for a minute it turned toward the north east and moved slightly faster than a small propeller aircraft, but much faster than a blimp could go. I believe it was between one or two thousand feet in altitude. As it moved north east it began to shrink down to about half its original size. I lost sight of it behind a large oak tree hanging over South Cedar Street a couple hundred yards to my right. I walked briskly in that direction but by the time I got there it had disappeared from the sky. It flew at about a 45 degree angle when it cut across south cedar heading north east. I know it went past the high school on John Sims Boulevard (Highway 20) before it disappeared. As bright as it was it seemed as if it held all its light internally. There was no light reflection on the pavement—even though at 22:00 hours it was completely dark outside. An elderly lady was sitting in a lawn chair on her porch at the corner of South Cedar and 27th Street. When I saw her I asked, “What is that?” She said I don’t know but it rose up from the tree line. I told her it’s not an aircraft because it’s completely silent. She said “maybe the base is experimenting with something.”  I said I don’t think so. I work out there and have never seen anything like that.” She then said, “Well two of us saw it.” That’s when I went north on South Cedar Street chasing after the silent light. When I came back the elderly women had gone inside. The object initially appeared about one third the size of a full moon. It hovered for about one minute and was visible for maybe one more minute after it shrunk to about half its original size and headed north east.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,30.507399999999997,-86.49136

Orange County, CA. These lights and white spots have been sighted in the Tacoma, Washington area as well. After nearly 3-years of watching and being VERY familiar with the OC sky, never seeing anything, they suddenly appeared with the advent of the solar flares, perhaps harvesting energy. (?) It is a VERY large scale operation, so the government must certainly be aware. You will NOT see them with a casual glance to the sky; they are EXTREMELY difficult to see. You will have to look until you see the first one. Once knowing what you are looking for, they are easily visible and can be seen anywhere.  They mostly fly specific routine flight patterns, those in the Southern sky all fly to the East, in the Northern sky to the West, the East sky to the North and the West sky to the South. They fly no matter what the weather, above, in and some below the cloud cover.  One interesting twist is occasionally, they morph into what I call “ghost ships,” large equilateral triangular shaped translucent crafts that seem capable of creating their own triangular shaped cloud cover.  Two nights ago was particularly spectacular, in that they formed a large square in the SW sky of hundreds of tiny lights as if to form a picture frame.  As the clouds pulled aside, the interior of the picture frame formation was filled with perhaps over a thousand of these tiny lights.  As the clouds came back in they began streaking across the sky, in rapid fire procession, all to the East.  I have several hours of video.

At approximately 1:20 p.m. I spotted a rounded silver object hovering over the northern portions of the Salt Lake Valley from the vantage point of 4700 south and 2700 west.  The object was first spotted moving Easterly in direction and when an approaching jet liner (based off of the markings of the jet it was a Delta jet) the object changed direction to a more Southerly route at which point I entered the house and called another individual out to see the object that I could not identify to see if they could make out what the object might have been. The object proceeded to move slowly in the southerly direction towards the middle of the valley (taking approximately 3 or so minutes to reach the middle area, approximating its location in the sky in correlation to the ground I would say the object was hovering high above 2100 south and 1300 west) at which point the object began to at a much more rapid pace move in a more Easterly direction towards the Wasatch mou! ntains. Along with the other individual we continued to watch the object move towards (and what looked like eventually OVER the mountains) until we could no longer make out the object in the sky.  We both observed the object with binoculars and with our naked eyes and all we could make out with the binoculars was the fact that the object was silver and definitely metallic in appearance (as it was shimmering like a star at night would) and that it was rounded like an orb.  We both continued to observe the object for as long as we could make out the object and keep track of its direction, it continued to move east at what seemed like a much quicker speed than it did when it was heading in the southerly direction.  We continued to observe the object for approximately another 2 or 3 minutes or until about 1:30 p.m. at which point the object was no longer discernible from the crisp blue sky. How I first came to notice the object is while I was watching the aforementioned commercial jet flying through the sky leaving a small vapor trail behind it. As the jet flew across the northern sky from east to west I noticed something shimmering in the sky moving opposite of the jet (again the markings on the plane were clearly Delta in origin) from west to east. When the object and the jet were about equidistant apart (from the ground perspective anyway) the object changed direction and headed from north to south eventually changing direction again and heading east. At first sight of the object and after initial observation and skepticism about what this could be I ran into the house and called another individual out to see the object as well.  We both went back outside to the same spot I first noticed the object in and with the binoculars we both took turns observing the object.

It was too dark to see any shape.  They were two chevron or triangle-shaped craft with white lights on each point and a red light just aft of the leading white light.  The white lights were constant while the red light would blink very, very slowly (maybe once every 5 seconds or so). If they were silent I would have absolutely ran inside to get my camera but the noise led me to believe military craft of some sort, maybe B-2 Spirits.  (Someone who worked on the B-2 for eleven years told me that is not the navigational lighting pattern of the B-2). One was directly in front of the other.  The total sighting from above my house until they were past the tree line to my north was approximately two minutes. I'm sure it was military of some sort but I am an aviation fan and this isn't any navigation lighting configuration I've seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Leading in front of the helicopter was a fairly bright red light, about the size of a dime from my vantage point, which was leading the helicopter by 100-200 yards.

As I was standing there in the dark Friday night about 9:00pm, something moving caught my attention in the sky.  It was a flying object about the volume of three 50-foot boxcars or the average fast food restaurant.  The shape was that of a sphere and the approximated dimensions of an M&M (without peanuts) and was a ""brushed"" silver finish.  There were no wings nor rudder or any kind of protrusions along the crafts’ smooth lines. The object was traveling from south to north (approximately) and I was curious, as this direction would lead it towards a close encounter with our airport so certainly they would see it on radar.  I viewed the sphere from about a 45 degree angle.  This object was flying at approximately 250 to 300 feet in altitude and was travelling about 100 miles an hour. There was a rushing sound like the sound an automobile makes when it whizzes past very fast but no mechanical sounds were detected.  In addition, there were no lights whatsoever, there were the red and yellow reflections bouncing off its lower surface from our local nearby Burger King. I summarized that this craft was under its own power, under some kind of intelligent control, has a purpose and if made by mankind it is far beyond any propulsion type and aerodynamic configuration that is publicly known about.  It was beyond any doubt an Unidentified Flying Object. I am now 56 and then I was 17 soon to be 18, a aircraft model builder and being raised in the post WW2 environment was an avid young researcher in aircraft of all kinds so I was and still am “up-to –date” with most designs as well as with the experimental aircraft both commercial and military.

I looked to my left and I saw a 12 to 13 inch high humanoid running beside me on a log keeping up, and it turned its head and looked at me. The most horrifying thing was when it smiled. It had a really big mouth with a lot of teeth. It might have been small but I will never forget the terror I felt.

It was hot, so it was summer time, and I am guessing it was August.  We were in Victory Lakes, NJ, and the area was very woodsy, so no city lights or other homes nearby.   There was a lake across the street from the house.  My grandma first noticed an odd light outside and I followed her outside to the patio to see what she was looking at.  There was a VERY bright, whitish, oval shaped (on it’s side) light that was hovering in the sky, above the lake across the street.  It was somewhat high in the sky (a little above line of sight), and from where we were, if I put my fingers out in front of me to measure it, it looked as if it were about four inches across (so, about 1/5-1/8 the size of the moon?).  The object just hovered there. There was no sound from the object.  It then moved very slowly to the left, and stopped.  Then it moved slowly to the right, and stopped.  Then it came back to the “center” basically where we first saw it hover, and it paused again.  Suddenly, it literally shot upwards so fast that it disappeared.  That was the last we saw of it.  Another interesting thing, but something I can’t confirm, is the next morning, my grandma was showing my parents a front page(?) story in the newspaper that a farmer in New Jersey claimed that a UFO landed on his property the same night we saw the UFO.  If I can recall properly, I seem to remember a photo of a farmer and in the background there was a big, round, burned out area where he claimed the UFO landed and that he had some type of encounter with aliens.

The sphere was silvery gray in color. Sort of dull like aluminum. It had no windows, portholes or anything hanging underneath it like a weather balloon does. Also no visible seams or bolts.  This was not a weather balloon. I know what weather balloons look like. This sphere probably a couple hundred feet off the ground as far as I can estimate based on where we were looking down at the craft and at the highway with buildings on it.  The craft was traveling slowly and seemed to be following the path of the highway. It was traveling horizontally, not going up like a balloon. It made no sound at all.  There were no lights on it and we watched it for approximately 7 to 10 minutes until it disappeared behind another ridge with trees. We never saw it speed up or change direction or ascend. A balloon usually ascends as it travels. This sphere did not.  Weather balloons have an instrument package hanging underneath it. This sphere had nothing hanging from it or protruding from it.  This was before digital cameras and cell phones that took pictures so there were no pictures made of the object.  The object must have been traveling west away from Gainsville on Hwy. 53.

I was returning home about midnight driving my VW Beetle.  I turned into the subdivision from a main thoroughfare.  At the first stop sign, I sighted a spherical object about a meter in diameter hovering in the middle of the residential street about a half a block on my left.  I turned left in order to approach the object which was in the center of the road and suspended about 10 feet above the road surface.  I approached slowly and got within 60 feet of the sphere.  The object was bobbing like a cork on the water and was emanating light from its surface.  The light consisted of brilliant colours that seemed to rotate around its surface.  I remember red, blue, orange and yellow patches of light rotating in a random fashion all over its surface.  My impression is that the light was actually photons being emitted by ionized air molecules as the colours were very pure like laser light.  I crept slowly forward observing the object through the front windscreen.  When I got within 60 feet the object began to react and drifted with a bobbing motion toward the far side of the road.  It went behind a small tree and between two adjacent houses.  I could see the light being reflected off the aluminum siding of one of the adjacent houses.  I quickly drove to the end of the block and turned on the side street to go to the next street over to see if it was still visible.  As I turned onto the next parallel street, it was once again hovering in the middle of the road at about the same height.  This time I approached at a little higher speed to see if I could get closer.  The object reacted by once again moving between two adjacent houses in the direction of the third parallel residential street.  I quickly moved around the block to see if it would be in the middle of the third street.  Sure enough it was, once again hovering in the middle of the road.  This time as I rounded the corner it took off at about a 20 degree angle at an astonishing speed.  I have witnessed night time artillery firing trials where the projectile from the artillery piece was a tracer and the speed of this object as it left was much quicker than an artillery round leaving a cannon.  I heard no noise at all during this encounter but of course the engine noise of a VW Beetle is considerable.  However, the departing speed had to be several times the speed of sound and there was no sonic boom.

Then they continued on their way although, when my cousin tells the story, it sounds like they continued on their way without ever talking about it, or like there are gaps in his memory.  After he told me this about a year ago, he ran into the friend again and brought it up.  The friend didn't even remember that they had been together at first (or wasn't sure).  This would be over three decades later, so I was surprised it wasn't something they particularly talked about.  I also should mention Sunland crosses little Tujunga Canyon and River which is not far from Big Tujunga Canyon and Tunjunga CA where there were apparently a number of sitings in the 1970s.  I don't know if he could add anything to the story if you contact him.  I will put my information below if you want more info.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,34.2686,-118.3295

Our house was right on the ocean and also right next to the public beach and within walking distance to the boardwalk.  It was about 9:00pm at night (or whenever it's officially dark)and there were 6 us (4 kids 2 adults). Everyone was in a festive mood and excited to be going to the boardwalk that night, talking over each other, and some of the kids were racing ahead. But I was busy looking at what I thought was a very bright star in the night sky (green I recall). Then it suddenly began to move in a square flight pattern, first down, then left, then up, then right, over and over. It was very far away, almost directly above so I really did believe it was a star until it started moving. I was tugging at my mother’s hand to get her to look, but she was busy trying to keep everyone together as we trapsed across the beach. I wasn’t afraid, and I don’t recall thinking it was a UFO at the time, just that it was a very unusual star.  Unfortunately, once we got to the boardwalk I too was excited about the rides and games and completely lost interest in the anomaly.  As an adult, I now realize just how odd that really was and wish I had been more persistent in getting someone to look up.

OVERHEAD UFO ON INTERSTATE 10  This incident is the reason for my interest in UFOs...why I’m          a member of MUFON.  The year was the summer of ’76, August. I was driving back from a visit to San Antonio, Texas, and had just seen a sign saying “L.A. 90 miles” at around 1 a.m.  I knew I was pretty tired, and this meant nearly 2 hours yet to go.  I was leaning back in the driver’s seat, feeling fatigue. Suddenly, surprising even myself, I took a deep breath and threw myself forward, now leaning over the steering wheel, now my head way under the windshield.  I glanced up...and there, overhead, maybe 15, 20 feet above the car, just beginning to fall behind, was a dark rectangular (I assumed, since the rear was out of sight, so it might’ve been square) object, keeping pace with the car.  I felt a wave of fear striving to strike me... I startle easily...  And then the following 3 sentences were planted in my head telepathically... as clearly as if I were hearing them,  but I knew my brain, not my ears, was picking them up...  “Don’t panic.”  “You’re in no danger.”  Before I could feel relief upon “hearing” those two sentences then came...  “You knew it was there anyway.”  And I was seized by a terrific jolt of fear!  I quickly pulled to the side of the road, shaking, fully expecting some kind of attack. I thought I might be incinerated...lifted up by a tractor beam, then dropped...something life-threatening.  But nothing happened. And now I wanted to get out and see if I could still detect the object. But I didn’t want to do that without a possible attack being seen by another driver. Not that I felt anyone could help me, but at least if someone witnessed my demise, he or she could make a report to the police and my family would know what had become of me.  Just as I was lamenting that no one was there to be my witness, over the top of the hill ahead came 3 sets of headlights.  Now I had witnesses, and as they approached, I stepped out of the car, hesitantly and fearfully turned around to view...nothing unusual in the sky. The object was gone.  Ever since then, I’ve been left to wonder...what does “You knew it was there anyway” mean? Is it evidence that I’ve been traced, tracked, followed my whole life and know it on a subconscious level?  Does this explain why from the age of about 4 to 7 years old I kept having a recurring dream and telling my parents in the morning that “I woke up again ‘cause I knew this big eye was looking at me real hard on the other side of the black, so I never can see it...but I know it’s there”? Of course asked in children’s language.  Does it explain an orb the size of a tennis ball coming down the hallway at my grandparents’ home at about 11:30 one summer night, slowly circling through the room, then crossing through it to stop over my head as I observed through the weave of the sheet that I’d pulled over my head out of fear...that then grew whiter and brighter and brighter till I “whited out”... and then woke up at what seemed to be instants later, even though it was about 9 a.m.? I was about 12 for that occurrence.  And did it have anything to do with several significant precognitive dreams I’ve experienced through my life and other paranormal happenings, such as dreaming my cat had been shot while I was traveling in Europe and coming back home to find she had been, though not killed as in the dream?  “You knew it was there anyway.”  It’s set me on a lifelong search.  Oh, by the way, after this incident, the following spring “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” came out. I about flipped out in the scene where Richard Dreyfus experiences loose objects flying around in the cab of his car, looks carefully and shakily out the windshield, and sees down the road a dark rectangular UFO meandering ahead of him... almost precisely my own experience.  It was almost déjà vu!  And of course convinced me I’d had a significant, maybe life-altering experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At first glance they appeared to be street lights, but I knew right away that based on the location of the lights the source was absolutely something aerial as they were far too high in the air, and too far from any road to be street lights. I then saw another set of lights fly over Holman road, from north to south, as I pulled into the parking lot of the store. I immediately parked my car and got out to get a better look. At this time I realized that there were at least 10 of these lights, in no particular formation, flying southward into the night sky.  They did not appear to be ascending or descending. One of them hovered momentarily above me, long enough for me to attempt to get my phone out. Of course, my phone battery was completely drained of battery life.  Instead I gazed at this thing, taking mental notes of it’s dark orange center that blended in a gradient to a dark red around the circumference.  It appeared to have some kind of texture on the orange portion that is hard to pinpoint or describe in a way that does it justice.... it almost looked like it was organic, for lack of a better term. Like the surface of the sun almost. It just appeared to have some kind of motion and energy to it. It was fuzzy, like I just couldn’t quite make out fine details on it. At this point, a fellow witness drove up toward me in a late model camaro (or possibly trans-am / firebird / i-roc - early to mid 80’s model in great condition) and stopped her car. She asked me excitedly if I could see them too. I informed her I could of course, and she got out of her car to watch them with me. She got out of her car just in time to see the last one disappear from site. It was not clear whether these myseterious lights faded out due to distance or due to their light source slowly being extinguished. The only thing I could compare these to would be Chinese lanterns, but that doesn’t feel right.  They were, at least from my perspective, too large to be Chinese lanterns, and too perfectly round. Plus the lighting was so perfect....almost unreal.  It was so even over the surface of the sphere it almost looked matte.  The lights were not extremely bright, they were actually quite dull, as if they were just bright enough to illuminate the body of these objects. I can say they were definitely NOT fireworks of any kind, as they were visible far too long and moved way too slowly.  I can say they were not standard aircraft because they did not make any audible sound and did not have the standard FAA required lights flashing anywhere on them. That’s it.  They disappeared and I’m in awe.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

The evening was calm, cool and clear with just a little cloud cover in the sky. We were talking about the fun evening we just had  at my sister’s house when my girlfriend pointed to direct my attention to an object in the northwest sky that she was seeing..as we were looking at it my girlfriend was wondering out loud if it was a satellite or a piece of space debris burning up ..I was silent as I observed the object flying through the evening sky.  Both of us saw this bright red-orange light that was rather large (nickel size I think if one were to hold a coin up to block it from your view).  I remember not talking as I intensely observed the object..it was flying in a straight line probably 5-7 miles away several hundred feet up(airplane altitude) and traveling at a normal rate that a an airplane or helicopter might travel..and going from nort! herly  to a southerly direction.  I remember looking for running lights or flashing lights on a tail or wing of the craft –and I could find none.  I remember telling my girlfriend that I didn’t think it was a falling piece of space debris because the object was going in a straight direction from north to south and it wasn’t travelling fast enough to be falling from the sky..I also told her that I didn’t think it was a satellite because it was too low in the atmosphere.  The red-orange light made us think maybe it was a plane on fire..but we didn’t see any flickering flames at all..just a steady orange red light.  We observed the object until it got southwest of my girlfriend’s house and then it made a normal (not a sharp or a very gradual )turn to the west-southwest away from us..it was at this point that the red –orange light quickly flickered and vanished and the object became a pinpoint of light.still visible but barely, that accelerated at a very startling velocity away f! rom us. We could still see no flashing lights on a tail or win! gs of th e object even then.  The pinprick of light then vanished entirely in hazy cloud cover, darkness and distance.  I nor my girlfriend to this day have no idea what the thing could have been ..neither one of us have ever seen a ufo before and neither one of have the desire to see another one again.

Eyres Pl W.  Looking North  Time: 11:40 PM PST  It was a perfectly clear and still Seattle night without a cloud in the sky or a breeze and a very bright moon.  As I got out of my car I observed 6 reddish/orange fireball type orbs in a formation looking to the north from the top of Magnolia as I stood by my car on the sidewalk.  They were just above the tree elevation on the horizon of the sky at first.  They were solid reddish/orange lists and were not blinking. They were north of my location in Magnolia. The appeared to be in a formation with fairly equal spacing between them.  They were totally silent and appeared to be slowly moving south towards me from the north.  They appeared to be at 5000 feet or so and then they started elevating from there to the north of Magnolia. It was difficult to judge the exact elevation they were however.  It appeared to be about the same height that a low plane would be. When I first noticed them, at first I thought they were just the blinking red lights on the radio towers on the top of Queen Anne Hill as they were at about that height in the sky. I then looked to my east and observed the Queen Anne blinking red radio tower lights and quickly realized that these reddish/orange fireball orbs were something totally different than the Queen Anne radio tower lights as they were to the north and there are no radio towers to the north of my location on Magnolia. These orbs were different as they were not blinking and were a solid reddish/orange color and they were moving. I observed these orbs for approximately 10 mins as they slowly came north from the south and slowly elevated from their original elevation keeping in formation. One orb after the other elevated (one at a time)to a certain elevation point in the sky maybe 10,000 feet closer to my location than at first. When each one got to the same higher elevation point in the sky each one of them disappeared at about the same point in the sky (one by one) until they had all disappeared by 11:50 PM PST. They made ! no sound. Normally in Magnolia there is lots of plane air traf! fic that I observe from this vantage point of planes taking off and landing as they fly over the city of Seattle in approach for landing or after takeoff from SeaTac Airport to the south as this location I was at in Magnolia is right over the flight path to the SeaTac airport from the north. I made a point to look around in every direction while I was viewing the orbs looking for air traffic and there were no planes that I observed during this 10 minute sighting while the orbs were present. This was very strange as it is very normal to hear and see planes flying over this location in Magnolia all the time. I noticed that no sooner as soon as the last orb had disappeared above me that I saw and heard several airplanes fly over the area as was normal. It was as if the orbs saw the planes coming and disappeared just before they arrived.  I am a 43 year old Regional Manager for a HR Software Company. I have had three jobs in 20 years out of college. My mother has lived in Magnolia for 20 years and I stay with her frequently and no the area well and the air traffic patterns of planes in the area. These orbs were not planes or helicopters as they were solid lights, moved slow in a formation, and were totally silent. They were not flares either because flares come down and these orbs were going up and keeping in formation. I have never seen anything like them before.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,47.60904638888889,-122.32602834595959

As we were standing outside, I noticed a dark spot in the sky that was not moving.  It was hovering in the same spot, as birds and planes were visible in the same sky. We went into the house after being outside for a half hour, and then kept peeking out the window to see if the object was still there.  It was.  Soon after, our power went out for about a minute, at most.  Nothing else was going on that would cause the power to go out.  Within thirty minutes of being inside, my mom noticed twinkling lights in the sky below the dark object that we initially saw.  We immediately went outside onto the deck and I took some video of what we were seeing. In the video, you can see multiple flashing lights in a horizontal pattern, hovering in the same general spot.  At certain points, you could then see the same line of lights tilting and then going vertical.  We definitely got the impression that lighted object is probably disc shaped.  We stood outside for at least 20 minutes watching these lights.  Based on the fact that we live below a flight path and see commercial airliners flying overhead constantly, we would guess that the object with the lights was very large since the lights went so far across the sky. The clouds began to roll in and the flashing lights disappeared.  After the flashing lights disappeared, I took a still shot of the dark object.  After uploading the image to the computer and zooming in, I would describe the shape of this object to be more of a chevron-shaped object.  Within a half hour, the dark object was not visible anymore either. My husband and I are both college educated, professional, rational people.

We noticed a white tear dropped object that appeared to be falling gradually at a 10 degree angle traveling south east.   We stopped the car and I used my 15x binoculars to get a closer look.  The object appeared to have a core dark in color with an almost white cloudy sheath around it tear dropped shaped with a short tail. We continued to watch it as we traveled down the Hoyt Rd. and stopped again as we thought it could be a Jet aircraft with an after burner but knowing jets have a very long trail this object did not.   Thats when we noticed that many jets not shore what kind (possibly military)where approaching the objects vicinity from many directions.   We started to lose sight of the object and continued south to Rt. 1.  We topped the hill coming out of Monticello headed south an pulled over along side the road.  That is when we still noticed aircraft flying in the vicinity and the object began to slowly spiral down.   The object appeared to be as close as you would normaly see a jet flying over and the long white trail they leave behind but this object was much larger and easier to see with a short tail almost like a tadpole but left no trail in sky.  We then noticed that there were two more objects further off in the distance same shape and same color with jet aircraft near by.  I wish I could say how far these objects were from us but the distance would be very great but still visible with out optics.

I have seen strange things in the sky before, and I know what meteorites look like, I know what satellites look like, stars, planets, etc.  The closest thing I xan compare ot to was that it looked about the same relative brightness as Venus has looked lately. Venus has been quite bright and this objects was as well.  It seemed to just appear, and looked to be going SW to NE, although it was at least as far away as an airliner flying around 25-30' ft. _t was moving faster than a Jet though anwas headed straight toward the small spot in the sky that had the strange lightning.  It never changed direction much but once it got into the cloud with the lightning it seemed to vanish without a trace.  Very shortly thereafter, the lightning stopped as well.  It was all very strange and had me very intrigued.  This is my first post ! here because it is the first time I have seen something I felt truly significant enough to post.

It appeared to be a single rapidly and irregularly flickering light source.  There was conventional air traffic visible in the same general region of the sky at that time, and the difference between this light source and the planes was pretty obvious: those had regular blinking and distinct lights, even at a great distance, while this thing did not. It did not keep a perfectly straight course as near as I could tell--there appeared to be some ""wobbling,"" although not all of us agreed on that.  (At least one of us thought it was an illusion caused by the light flickering.)  My first thought was that it was a large flying paper lantern, but it was much too bright, much too high up, and after a minute it was clear that it was ascending too quickly for that. It was very clearly visible in the middle of a heavily light-polluted metropolitan area, so it wasn't a faint light. It appeared to be ascending very rapidly, much faster than I have ever personally seen a conventional aircraft rise.

I am certain it was not Jupiter or Venus, due to the fact that both of these planets were visible in the western sky and the object in question was much more northerly in direction.   I observed the light in the sky for close to forty-five minutes from Kokomo, Indiana north along US-31 to the Indiana State route 10 at the town of Argos, Indiana.   As I passed the Argos junction, I noticed the light began moving in a clockwise rotation in front of me.  This lasted almost three seconds for the entire rotation.  The object then proceeded in a north western direction towards Plymouth, IN. I am a truck driver and drive this route five days a week.

I watched it out my window for around a minute before getting my video camera hoping to get a closer look and document the event.  As I watched the object it got brighter and dimmer, giving off streaks of light in different colors.  I climbed out my bathroom window onto the roof to get a unobstructed view of the object. The air was freezing  and I didn't grab a jacket so it was hard to hold the camera still and I was standing on the pitch of the roof.  I filmed the object for close to three minutes.  The object seemed to be a orb of energy.  The round light would get really small, then grow large.  As the object got smaller the light got brighter, as it got bigger the object almost dissipated then would reform.  This object has appeared over the ocea! n several times over the last month. Years ago (around 1999) as many as 20 people were standing on the street all looking at an object that defied physics.

California I don’t remember the exact date, but it was several weeks into the first summer where my family was living (Rancho Palos Verdes, California) at the time I saw the craft, and that’s how I know approximately what month and year it was.  I was 11 years old at the time and I just learned to swim a few weeks earlier, and the first thing my dad taught me was to float because if I could float I would never be afraid of the water.  Floating in the pool and looking up at the stars at night quickly became one of my favorite things to do on hot summer nights.  This particular night very hot, even late into the evening it was still hot so I decided to cool off in the pool.  I turned off all the lights in the yard and only had the pool light turned on.  It was a perfect night for star gazing because it was a clear night with no clouds.  My dad and brothers were in the dessert for a few days to ride motorcycles, and my mom was at a neighbor’s house so I was the only one a! t home.  My mom recently showed me how to find Orion’s belt in the sky and I remember those stars were almost directly above me as I floated.  After about 10 minutes of gazing at the stars, suddenly the stars in the east part of the sky began to disappear.  At first I thought maybe clouds were rolling in, but I had never seen dark clouds before.  It seemed odd that any clouds would appear on such a hot night anyways, and I didn’t understand what could be blocking out the starlight?  Then I began to see an area that was blocking the stars take shape and I could see the edges of a pointed tip slowly moving directly above me.  The pointed tip headed west, and the edges stretched from the tip down each side at an angle like a wide triangle (chevron).  Each side stretched out from north to south at an angle for about 150 feet in each direction.  Our yard was about 90 feet wide and the total distance reached beyond my yard and into the neighbors yard on both sides (the entire wid! th was about 300 to 350 feet total, the lots are big in that n! eighborh ood). There was no sound at all.  It was traveling east to west because I know the sun came up in the direction that it came from, and set in the direction it was heading.  Our house was two stories high and the craft was flying no more than 15-20 feet above the rooftop.  My best estimate is that it was about 55-60 feet from the ground.  It moved very, very slowly.  As I watched in sheer wonder, I was amazed that something this large could fly so slowly and so low to the ground and not make any noise at all.  I could hardly see the surface because it was almost the same color as the night sky but slightly darker, not quite black, but almost black.  If I wasn’t looking up at the stars and watching the stars being slowly blocked out as it passed over, I may not have even noticed it.  As the craft passed overhead for about 30 seconds, the point of the front of the craft was already over the roof our house, and it was still blocking my entire view of the sky.  I remember being s! truck with awe as faint lights started to show up through the trees that lined the east side of the yard.   The lights were different colored (red, orange, yellow, and green) glowing on the bottom of the craft.  These were not normal lights that illuminated light outward like a flash light does, but rather these areas of light seemed to be coming from an inner light source that was shining just few inches beyond the exterior of the craft, and had a very soft dim glow.  I had never seen anything like this and I starred at the lights to try to see details.  When the lights were directly above me I could see that the light was coming out of a round opening.  I looked directly up into the opening and I noticed a shimmer effect that warped the dim light source similar to how fish scales shimmer when light hits the scales. Mixed with this shimmer effect was a smoke-like effect that distorted the edges of the round shape of the lights and it appeared to me that the light source wa! s inset deep into the surface of the openings.  There were two! rows of these openings, one on the right (north) and another row on the left (south).  The distance between the rows was about 18 feet (a little wider than the width of our pool).  The lights within each row were spaced about 3 feet apart, and the size of each opening was about 1 foot in diameter.  There were approximately 8-10 openings in each row, alternating in colors. It seemed like it took about 90 seconds to completely pass over our rooftop.  At this point I hurried to get out of the pool, ran through the house, out the front door, and over to the neighbors house next door calling out to my mom.   We lived at the top of a hill, and just before I got to the steps of our neighbors door the craft was moving over the top of the houses on the opposite side of the street.  I was knocking on the door, and yelling to hurry up and come to the front yard quick.  By the time everyone came outside the craft was beyond the viewable line of sight because it was flying so low.  They missed ! it unfortunately, and I tried to describe it to them and convince them to get in the car to go find it so they can see it.  They were in no mood to do that, and they assumed I must have seen a blimp because blimps used to fly over our neighborhood.  I knew it was not a blimp because I had seen the blimp fly over before during the day and at sometimes at night.  The blimp that used to fly over would never fly that low to the roofs of houses.  I knew a blimp could never block out the sky as much as the craft I saw.  The craft I saw huge, and was not shaped like a blimp, but rather a large wide triangle like shape, more like a chevron shape and not an elongated oval like a blimp shape.  Also, blimps make noise even though they are quiet, but the craft I saw didn’t make any noise at all, it was perfectly silent.  I will never forget this, and I’m glad I can finally share my experience.  I heard about the website on the radio that encouraged to share any sightings no matter how ! long it’s been.  I hope the details I’ve given are useful to U! FO resea rch. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-07-04T00:00:00,33.7584,-118.3163

Its hard to explain what it looked like as I only saw it for a fraction of a second. I remember it being somewhat long in the front and had some type of tail. The next thing I remember was the feeling of waking up after being knocked out. It took me a few moments to get my bearings, when I remembered I had seen something over the roof. I then looked back up to see what it was and saw the tail end flying over the front of the house. My heart was racing. I ran around ! to the front of the house, but all I saw was a strange looking rolling cloud configuration dissipating up into the sky, and then it was gone.

When we saw a bright light to the east above the horizon about 15 deg the size of the light was twice that of a landing light of a common commercial airliner.  It was about 70 miles away from us.  I worked for a major airline at the time. So I know what a large transporter would look like. So I deceited to park at the end of the run way and watch a touch and go of aircraft because pilots from major airlines use Stockton airport to training.  Anyhow as the craft approached the control area I figured that the aircraft would do a regular base and final approach,  and touch and go but what happen was this.  The craft was at the same height as the control tower and it looked like the ship was going to crash into the control tower and went on the other side of the tower and across the small aircraft hangars still heading west. As its approached us about 5 cars were a! t the end of the runway and we all got out of our cars and I saw the rectangle black metallic, with lights flashing all around it ufo approach us all going across the highway airport boulevard at 25 feet off the ground moving at a speed of 3 miles per hour. Very very slow its length of a football field, height 40 feet, width 75 feet. As it slowly move in front of all of us there was port holes of 3 where you can see being inside that resembled tall thin looking figures looking at us.  I had a strong flash light and I shined the light into the port hole and gave a delta sign with my light.  As the ship was in front of us a old type of Buick 1951 sedan black car approached the ship with a person inside it drivers side with looked like a man in black and he didn’t even see the ship.  He was gone after that.   We watch the ship make a long round approach into the delta for about 10 minutes.  After that I went to the control tower and reported a ufo as I was doing this other peo! ple were calling up the tower and reporting the same thing.  I! asked t he tower if any aircrafts had come into this area in the last 10-15 minutes and they said no aircraft came through at all.  It is impossible for the tower not to see the large spot light 70 miles away and than the tower high craft passing behind the tower.  After that we left the area a headed south on hwy 99 towards modest California and there we saw the bright light again. It had made a large circle around the the Stockton , Manteca, lathrope.   I saw it coming very fast and low maybe 30 feet .  I went under the over pass of Manteca 99 hwy and saw the ship change shape from a rectangle to a old 707 aircraft and screaming very low and very old looking battle ship.  We were shocked in its new appearance.  After that I went home and call blue book and reported it.  Many years later mufon people wanted to hear our story and put my wife and I under hipnotics because my wife said she saw  the ship at Stockton airport went on top of her and I saw it to the side.

The spacecraft that I came from is referenced by numerous cultures around the earth. From the ancient Egyptians who have a representation of the craft on king Tutankhamun's Golden Throne to the Chinese who represent the craft with a trigram theory and the theory of the life cycle central to martial arts, and from ancient Israel which has a representation of the craft in the Torah and hidden within the Torah Code to the ancient Mayans who made the Mayan Calendar which represent the craft.  The spaceship is represented by the ancient Egyptians on Tutankhamun’s Golden Throne (5).  On the left side of the backrest of the throne is an image of the spaceship’s floor plan. At the center of the floor plan is the circular table and the profile image of the table is shown rising from the center of the circle. Under that symbol is a profile of an inner rectangular wall section; and under that are curved profiles which represent the view screen in the craft. The floor plan is also represented by the Aten symbol at the top and center of the backrest, and there the circle represents the table from the top view and the lines extending from it represents the floor sections. The open gold rectangle made around the central Aten represents the entryway into the space craft.  On the left side of the backrest Tutankhamun is shown seated in the Throne with darkened skin exposed because that is the location of the black thrones in the spacecraft as seen from the perspective of on! e entering it, and that is what signifies him as an important space being.  The ancient Mayan Calendar (3) represents the spaceship as well.  The circular center represents the table, and the surrounding rectangular signs patterned around it represent the walls.  The solar light rays represent the table profile.  As in the Golden Throne image in the left side of the backrest, the Mayan Calendar also represents the rectangular entryway on the top and the curved view screen under the centered face of the sun. Here is my account of being on a space craft.  I walk through the entryway in space.  The entryway is black and rectangular, and it is a part of the wall.  The wall parts are black, rectangular, and smooth; and the rectangular parts are patterned around a central white table so that the wall is a polygon.  The rectangular wall parts are similar in proportion of width to the width of my shoulders, and similar in proportion of height to the height of my body from bottom to top. In white robes I walk forward through the entryway in which my body fits comfortably.  I walk toward the white table which is about the height of my wrists from the ground.  The white table is circular and gently curves outward from bottom to top, and the top diameter is larger than the bottom diameter.  At the top of the table the circle is extruded a small amount to make a side, and the diameter of the top surface is about the width of my shoulders, and the bottom diameter is about the width of my feet.  Around the axis of the table there are lines which extend to the wall and between the thin lines which can appear white there are wide black wedge shaped floor sections which mate perfectly with the polygon wall. I look to my left and I see multiple black thrones located at the wall and which are patterned partially around.  The thrones are far away because the room is so large, and in the thrones are sitting people.  I continue walking and a woman walks in a straight line behind me from my left side to my right side.  I approach the clean white table whose surface is empty and I walk right around the table and I stop walking while I am one fourth of the way around the circumference.  At that point I have a conversation with another man wearing white robes.  Together both of us walk toward the front of the room where a view screen appears. The view screen appears to curve around the joining of the floor to the wall yet appears flat when looking at it.  On the screen I see the Earth and I see that I am in space.  Next on the view screen I see the future life I am to have.  I am told of the importance of my mission.  I contemplate my decision.  The glory and importance are attractive, the pain and suffering are not.  I do not fear the dangers that I am told of.  The importance of my life is high enough that I feel the need to live it.  I make my decision of my own free will to live the life I have seen.  I am told that our armada of space crafts will be arriving at the Earth within my lifetime.  I speak with the other man in the white robe to the right of the view screen. When I have completed speaking with him I proceed to my right and walk close to the polygon wall noticing the precision joining of the floor and the wall.  The floor looks like the ancient Egyptian Aten and the wall looks like the inside of a Jewish synagogue.  I walk toward another man who is touching one of the rectangular wall parts; the touch screen computer is black and resembles the ones in Star Trek TNG.  I am located to the front and right of the entryway.   I levitate upward and I am transformed into light and energy. My soul is free and I look down at the room from above and I feel as though I am seeing myself when I enter the room.  I look forward at the view screen and I begin moving very fast. Suddenly I am inside the womb of my mother on the Earth.  I am pleased.  I am delighted to again walk the Earth.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,,

July 8, 2012:  LARGE CRAFT  	On July 8, 2012, at approximately 3:30 am, my wife saw a huge craft, about the size of a football field, maybe double that size, about 1/2 mile from our house.  We live in the Killian area of Miami and our best estimate is that the craft was near or above the Miami Zoo. Our dog is very sick and throwing up and she went to open the door in front of our house so the dog can go to the bathroom.  When she looked up, in a south-westerly direction, she saw the craft at approximately a 45 degree angle. Attached is a drawing of the craft made by my wife.  It was shaped like a cylinder but with pointed edges on both sides which appeared triangular shaped on each end.   The right and left sides, inside the triangle portion of the edges, had two large bands of extremely bright multi-colored lights on each side.  The middle part of the craft appeared very light whitish or grey colored. The craft made an extremely loud noise, much more powerful than if an airplane was standing directly above us.  The object remained stationary for about 5 minutes and then it disappeared. We have attached a drawing of the object, a map showing the location of our house and the location of the Miami zoo area, and a weather chart indicating that the visibility was 10 miles, and that there were scattered clouds at 3:30 am that night.  My wife said that she saw many stars in the sky that night and thus she had excellent visibility. SUMMARY  	Previous to these events, my wife and I have never seen UFOS or other similar objects in our life. She is not bothered by this because she is very religious thinks that they were a messenger from God.  I, on the other hand, have been freaked out.  I started doing research on the subject, have joined MUFON, ordered about 30 UFO books, listen daily to Coast to Coast, etc, etc.  I never even knew that these radio programs or UFO organizations existed.   I am now consumed by the subject.  I need to find some answers and some closure because my wife says that I became obsessed with this issue. Finally, I am an attorney with the IRS in Miami, FL and my wife was trained as a physical therapist and is a stay-at-home mom.  We live in a very nice upper middle class neighborhood in the Killian area of Miami, Florida.  We have lead normal dull lives until recently.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,25.7741427135084,-80.28951850011829

First time sighting! I was driving northwest on I-580 between Park blvd. and Lakeshore Ave.  While exiting onto Lakeshore, I saw 4 very bright orange lights in the sky to the west, heading southeast toward me.  My first reaction was that they were a string of planes on their way to land, which is a common sight in the bay area.  They were below the cloud cover, which is relatively low (touches the hilltops), but I couldn’t see any sort of shape to them.  A fourth that was hanging back abruptly caught up, bobbing ad looping as it went. At this point I had run through all the options.  Based on their speed, I am convinced they were “aircraft“, but  they were making turns and altitude changes that appeared unearthly.  They started to turn to the east rather quickly, at which point I couldn’t look anymore, considering I was driving.  After finding a parking spot, I ran out of the car and looked up, only to find one craft slowly moving west to east.  As it sat in the sky, I got a good look at it: Orange orb with yellow edges, no apparent solid shape.  It was larger than Jupiter in the night sky, but definitely smaller than the moon.

Before I start, Thank You Peter for the forum you provide. I left a Christmas gathering a few minutes past 8:00pm and once outside noticed an orange light with an occasional “halo” effect that could be seen as it got closer. I could not see the “halo” part the whole time; it kind of flickered a bit, but the bright bottom was illuminated steadily.  I only saw one light at first.  It was silent and its movement seemed directional, not as if it were just drifting. I went back in and called others to come out and see (7 people in total). The first light was still there and I then saw two additional lights behind it, all having the same general characteristics (atypical from SkyLanterns, as the “structure” above was not always visible). They seemed to be traveling on a “flat plane” at the same general altitude (guess-timated at 500 ft.) and then when they were over the property where we were standing, they seemed to go straight up, with the lights becoming smaller until they disappeared (possibly through the cloud cover). There was no further additional travel to the west, just seemingly “up” above the house and then out of sight. All in all, the lights were visible for about 3 minutes maximum. Roughly 2/3 of this time was in “flat planar” travel and 1/3 in what appeared to be vertical travel. While outside watching, I heard the reaction of neighbors to the left who were also observing, and their tone was of excited confusion. (A bit of ""What IS that?"" in excited speech).  I could not hear all of what was being said however. When I got home and had the opportunity to check weather stats from a local media weather site (WIVB ~9:20pm), the winds were noted as 4mph E on the site’s front-page, and 0 mph calm N in their ""Current Conditions"" section.  Precipitation reflection on radar (for upper level winds) showed a very slow trend from north to south in direction. I checked additional stats taken from another weather website -  (Visibility 10.0 miles, Clouds Few 2800 ft Overcast 3900 ft (Wunderground) 10:55pm)   I also checked local news websites and their individual reporting forums for any type of chatter about sky sightings but didn’t find anything. Still curious, I went back outside several times, not expecting to see anything, but saw another orange light southwest over Main St. at 8:59pm, and then saw a grouping of 4 others “behind” the first, to the south (guess-timated at 800 ft.).  I lost track of the first, but they all came from the south traveling north and then seemed to angle west northwest and begin to go more vertically (~65 degree elevation from horizon). They then followed this trajectory slowly to the cloud cover and disappeared. The bright lights that were their primary composition would become smaller and smaller, although with similar brightness, as it elevated (counterintuitive to a flame in a SkyLantern exhausting itself), and it seemed to me that they were breaking through the cloud barrier. The group of 4 moved somewhat randomly although all in the same (very distinct) direction. All were going to the same area in the distance, but moving in and around each other in getting there.  There was then noticed that there was one straggler about 30 seconds behind. The group of 4 was almost gone when I noticed the last. This last one followed the same general trajectory, although it did seem to stay illuminated longer. Possibly due to height variance in cloud cover? These lights seemed to have the same longevity as the first group noticed at about 8:05pm, at least in terms of proportion. They were seemingly 2/3 “planar” motion and 1/3 more vertical motion.  In total, the first group had 3 lights (1, then 2 following) at around 8:05pm and the later group had 6 in total (1, then 4, then 1) at ~9:00pm. Land distance between the two sightings was about 1.5 mi. The first group traveled from east to west then roughly at a 90 degree altitude straight up (total time observed – about 3 minutes), and then the second group from south to north then WNW at ~65 degree altitude (total time observed – about 5 minutes). I have seen nothing since. (I checked off-and-on till about 12:30am that night) I saw nothing great through binoculars either. I only had a good look at the last light in the second group, and its size did not change to any great degree—maybe it was too distant.  Thanks again Peter for the good work that you do.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,42.9784,-78.7998

These objects were all yellow centered with an orange corona, appearing much like the rear view of a fighter jet engine at take-off.  None of the objects made any noise nor showed any visible contrail or vapor stream.  Being a moonlit night such streams are visible even with aircraft at higher cruising heights.  We live on the pathway to Bangor International Airport and regularly see a variety of aircraft including all type of military aircraft as the facility hosts a military installation.   The objects observed did not have any flashing lights as is required on all aircraft.  from our vantage point, the objects appeared to be at a height similar to that used by light aircraft, so on the order of 1000 to 1500’.  At this height, and compared to the size of the moon on this night, the objects appeared to be 1/10th  the size of t! he moon, or as a reverse comparison quite a few times larger than the largest star visible.  In terms of brightness, the yellow portion of the object was as bright as the brightest star.  When I first noticed the object it appeared to be coming toward me and I thought it was the headlight on the front running gear of a large airliner, as it had a similar brightness.  However as the object came closer and no longer was coming at me but going by me it had no shape other than an orb and on such a moonlit night it would have been easy to tell if it had wings or resembled a standard aircraft.  Five members my family witnessed these objects. I contacted the Maine Stage Police who sent a trooper to patrol the area for signs of fireworks or flares, but reported back that nothing was observed.  On the next day I contacted Bangor International Airport, and through a few calls ended up at the air traffic control tower.  My call was returned later that day, and in talking to the tower they mentioned that the previous night one of the people on duty had noticed a bright light to the west (which would be toward where I am located from the airport), thought nothing of it, and when he returned to the window it was not present.  I was told that radar did not pick up anything out of the ordinary, but they are only tracking things with transponders.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,44.86216021505377,-68.83885806451613

I live in springfield, but this thing is far away so it looks like its in the direction of Palmer or Munson.   The first time I saw it it was coming towards Springfield from the Palmer direction.  At first I thought it was a plane but it was going really fast and the lights of the craft were very bright with one green flashing light, not like a blinking light, it was flashing quickly and the angle of the craft was upwards not like the way a plane would ascend.  I thought wow that must be some new spy plane or something that the Gov designed, but it was really fast.  There was a plane flying on the eastern side of my window and it was so much slower than this plane. I saw it for about six seconds ascending and then it disapeared out of my view.   The second time was a few days ago. It was the same bright white lights with a flashing green light, but this time it was just hovering.  I w! atched it thinking maybe it was a blimp or a star and my eyes were playing tricks so I kept blinking to make sure I was seeing correctly.  The craft moved slightly left then right then went into a 90 degree angle but did not ascend.  Then a little white light broke off from the craft and moved around a little in a circular motion then went back to the craft.  Eventually I just stopped watching because I don't have a camera right now and I started to just think it was a tower or a star or a blimp.  I figured if I saw it the next day it was something that had always been there. But the next day it wasn't there.  Then tonight The thing was to the right of my window flashing brightly still towards Palmer and hovering.  It moved to the left and up and stayed there for a while.

At Gulf Beach 7:45PM, wind from west, then diminished ; broken cloud cover. First very bright orange-red spark-like light with orange nimbus emerged above treeline at 5 degrees N.  From elevation of 8 degrees it slowly and steadily rose straight up within cloudless area of sky.  This light initially gave the appearance of a slow-motion firework missile that was launched and primed to explode.  It was extremely bright and obviously propelled, not simply drifting.  Through 10x21 binoculars this light appeared fan-shaped (picture a deep U shape, wide at the top, with a small ball- shaped nucleus of brighter and deeper orange light resting at the bottom).  Overall impression was of a concise ball of light surrounded by a nimbus of hazier orange light.  I do not recall any fluctuation of the luminosity.   Slow ascent of this light continued for approximately 90 seconds.   Strobed a 110 lumen LED flashlight at this object during its ascent, with no response.  During last few seconds of ascent this light faded away until it was no longer visible in cloudles! s area of sky at 35 degree elevation.  Estimated distance from beach = 3,000 feet, which possibly positions it above marshland near a cemetary. Within 5 minutes of the first light’s fading away, another identical light rose above treeline at 355 degrees N.  Same appearance and gradual ascent straight up.  Likewise, viewed through binoculars and signalled with flashlight: same situation as previous until it similarly faded away at 35 degree elevation.  After waiting about 30 minutes for the chance of a repetition, packed up and ready to leave when, through the broken cloud cover to the ESE glimpsed a more distant but similarly colored light slowly ascending into the clouds.  Assuming that this might have been an error on my part, or a prosaic aircraft, I prepared to investigate a playing field about a mile to the north, from which chinese lantern/balloons could have been released.  Within several minutes another bright orange light rose up behind the treeline in the exact same location that the previous light had been briefly noticed.  At 13 degrees elevation and 145 degrees SE  this light, identical to the pair that had just previously emerged from the north, slowly rose at what appeared to be the same distance from the beach (3,000 feet), which would place it out over Long Island Sound.  After about 105 seconds it too faded away in identical fashion.   No equipment used in this observation.  9:45PM was the end of this group of sightings.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,41.223742105263156,-73.05265438596491

At about 7:50pm I was looking at the horizon when I noticed a faint orange flicker, I’ve seen this a few times in the past year or so.  The fireball was coming from the south southeast and was headed west northwest at a fairly slow rate of speed.  As it drew closer it was steadily getting brighter until it looked like a flaming meteor without a tail.  It continued along this path for about thirty to forty five seconds then it slowly faded out and in until it disappeared.  It didn’t fly so far away that I lost sight of it, it just faded out. About seven minutes later I noticed a very bright stationary object low on the eastern horizon that I thought was Venus. About thirty seconds after that I saw that, another fireball coming from and headed in the same direction as the other fireball. This one flew directly over me so I got a better look at it than the other. When it got directly overhead of me I could tell that it was an orange orb with an orange haze around it, it wasn’t a plane light or anything of the sort. It was of constant brightness, color and definition while above me, it also emitted these cone projections of translucent orange light at random spots around it and, similar to what a pulsar star would look like only it wasn’t spinning. This may explain the flickering it gives off at a distance that makes it look like a candle flame and both were completely silent. After the second orb/fireball faded away like the other I continued my walk. Looking east again I noticed “Venus” was gone.  Then about a minute later it reappeared lower on the horizon and stationary. It was a brilliant white light that glimmered like a flawless diamond would under intense light. I watched it for a few minutes and noticed it started moving out from over the house I used as a point of reference north towards some trees.  It continued along this path until it faded out like the fireballs did.  Also i should add that i saw a police helicopter going east a minute or so before the first fireball appeared.  All in all the whole three experiences lasted a total of about thirty to forty minutes.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,38.8008,-91.0487

I had a sense for a few days that something was different in the atmosphere.  The day before I had told my Mom that I sensed an ""eery stillness / quietness on the roads & outside in the sun, etc.""   So anyway, a couple of nights later when it was hot & humid I went out into the backyard and looked up at the sky.  It was around 9:00 pm.  I saw many stars, but there appeared to be something that was changing colors.  And this one object (or whatever it was) was not ""flying"" across the sky like all the other aircraft going back & forth to Logan Airport.  It was kind of hovering there in the sky in the South-Westerly direction towards or over Shrewsbury or Worcester.  It seemed far away, but I could see it . . and it was different.  This object appeared t! o emit a beam or beams of colored light ONCE IN A WHILE from the sides and/or the top and bottom.  I called my Mom to come and take a look at it, and tell me what she saw,i.e. what she thought.  We couldn't believe what we saw.  But keep in mind at this time (9 pm - 10 pm) it was far away.  As the night went on and all the other bodies in the nightsky moved in tandem with the earth (as the moon does) so did this ""object""   - - -  and it became clearer (or CLOSER!) to see around 10:30 pm onward!  Around 23:00 hours (11:00 pm) we COULD REALLY SEE that this was NOT a planet, and we could both agree that we saw pulsating light changes of RED-BLUE-GREEN!  Fascinating. . . didn't want to go to bed . . but we did. On the following night, which is now - Wednesday evening March 21, 2012 - I had a feeling it may be there again.  And it was!  I just had to see it, but this time I went and got some high powered binoculars - anything I could use to get a closer look!  And on this evening it had the same pattern of movement, but I noticed a perfect triangular shape with 3 lights on each corner hovering underneath this ""object"".  The triangle seemed massive and quiet and black.  Mom and I really felt that this original object from the night before was a UFO, because with the binoculars on this night when it seemed closer to the earth around 23:00 hours (11 pm), we both saw square windows around the perimeter of a disc!!  And now we could see that this is where the colored lights were pulsating from.  You could clearly make out a disc shape and an aliveness to the vehicle/craft.  At this time of night the object/craft/whatever was more in a Westerly direction from our backyard.  Kind of amazin! g stuff . .  and wondering what they are doing.  Oh and by the way, a couple of nights ago when our temperatures got very warm, before I witnessed this anomaly, I had my bedroom windows open all night.  The next morning I woke up and told my Mom that I had trouble sleeping because I heard strange grinding machine-like noises in the sky ALL night . .  into the early am hours.  There were no cars passing by and it was otherwise quiet outside our rural suburban neighborhood.  But that noise was there - all night.  It was annoying and I didn't know what it was.  Just FYI.

PLEASE READ ALL. THIS IS NOT A HOAX!!!   Okay so today is October 4, 2012. Roughly around 8:30 pm tonight my friend and I were driving home. I was in the driver’s seat, and my friend in the passengers.  He notified me of an object that looked like a plane about to land off in the distance and I looked up and saw what he was talking about.  As we got further down the road, going straight toward the object, I noticed what I thought at the time was a satellite in front of the plane.  The satellite looking object was a little above the plane object and looked orange. As we got closer I slowed down almost to a stop. It looked as if the plane was flipped on its side and could see a metal/light color filling in between the lights that were following behind the orange light.  We got almost right under the object so I turned the music completely off to see if I could hear anything.  Didn’t hear a thing!!  The objects were flying as low as military cargo planes and I couldn’t hear a single thing!!  The orangish light was a slight bit higher and out in front of the other object. They never got farther apart, higher or lower or anything.  These objects traveled what looked like together, never moving any different from each other, and at the same exact speed.  The other object that my friend and I thought was a plane at first was a lot different as it got closer. It started out looking like a normal low flying plane, than when it was close we noticed the lights were upright.  The lights on the plane object were all red, there were about four or five t! ops and they were not flashing, pulsing, or anything.  It almost looked as if it was a plane flipped on its side, kind of strait up and down but a little slanted. After we stopped the car I looked around the sky and spotted planes flying and as soon as I saw one, counted it out because it was nowhere near what we had just witnessed.  We saw this UFO looking object for about 30 or so seconds.  I completely ruled out a satellite, blimp, plane, anything. We saw the object for a good half minute or so and were close enough to it that if it had been a plane or blimp we would have easily heard it.  It was so strange because the objects never moved away from each other, they were moving all as one. In conclusion, one orange glowing light/orb in front and a slight bit higher, with four or five red solid lights cockeyed trailing somewhat close behind it across the sky.  Sorry that this is so long and specific but I have never seen anything like this in my entire life and neither has my friend.  We both spent all night trying to think of excuses and have no idea.  While I was looking at this object I got chills going up and down my neck and back  I was so freaked out and still am. I even grabbed a pen afterward and wrote down before and after what the objects looked like on a napkin in the car. PLEASE if anyone important who can cover what I saw or thinks they know what I saw let me know because I’m at a loss for words.  THIS IS NOT A HOAX.  I am a normal nineteen year old boy, I go to college, have played sports, no health problems, don’t do drugs or drink, have tons of friends, don’t believe in conspiracy theories, etc.  I can email a drawn picture of what the object looked like even. Ever since I saw what I did I cannot stop thinking about it.  In a way I hope I see whatever I did again sometime, I’ll be looking up at the sky every night from now on.

At about 20:30 EST, my sister called me to see if I had seen any lights outside.  She and my parents had been standing outside since 20:00 watching dozens of lights moving from south to north over Dayton, Ohio.  I went outside and immediately spotted on of the lights. I went inside and grabbed my wife, who also saw.  She proceeded to call her parents and brother, who also all saw the lights. The lights were extremely high in altitude, very fast, and ranged in colors of white, blue, and red. Several of them flickered.  I think the color difference could be explained by differences in altitude. After roughly 15 minutes of watching, I saw three all moving at the same speed in a staggered triangle formation.  Already in amazement by what I was seeing, a much larger, deep red light followed those three. At first, I was waiting to see if they would fade from view at about 30 degrees as most satellites I have seen do.  The only time the lights faded was when they were so distant I could no longer see them, but never did they flicker out like satellites.  Living near Wright-Patterson, I am not entirely surprised to see things like this, but they were definitely not aircraft that the public knows about.  None of the lights changed direction, seemingly all having a set destination or orbit. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The interesting thing about this light and tail was it did not appear falling from outer space as though it was coming through the atmosphere. It only seemed to leave a tail in the lower half of the sky.  Normally when an object falls from space you see a tail in the top half of the sky which burns out in the lower half.  This was opposite, the tail dropped from half-way up in the sky into the earth horizon of Mt umunhum. Coincidentally about an half-hour later I was walking and noticed two lights flying low over the Mt umunhum mountain range.  At first look it seemed like one object, but later after they turned south I noticed the lights were independent.  It was two separate objects, presenting a flight path similar to a military excerise flying over mountains.  Very unusual to see in a very populated San Jose Bay Area.  They were not flying the usual flight paths. The fascinating thing about the ojects was that they had a glow of green-yellow-white lights similar to the object that fell vertical out of the sky about 30 minutes eariler.

About a week before my incident, a neighborhood friend was claiming on the school bus that he saw a UFO and was carrying his camera and was saying that he was going to photograph it.  I obviously disregarded his story. About a week later, a friend and I were staying at my home in Alexandria, MN (chain of lakes area) and we decided to sneak out for some adventure.  We were walking up a very steep road which used to be a winter sled hill.  The road runs approximately east to west from the lake on the east.  We were about halfway up the road/hill, fields and trees to the north, neighborhood to the south, when suddenly a triangular object with a light on each point appeared about tree top level.  I only had about enough time to say ""wow"".  All I remember after that was looking at my friend to say, ""that was strange"" and we walked home and went to bed, not saying another word.  We never talked abo! ut it except when I started having memory flashbacks.  My friend denies seeing a UFO and says it was a ""stealth fighter"".  My friend on the school bus, whom I talked to many years later, says that there are ""many of us out there"".  Whatever it was has the ability to block and influence memory.  It/they are unimaginably superior to us.  I debate with myself if it is a spiritual force rather than an actual ""living"" force.  This could be similar to shape shifting events of other types of sightings;  we see things that are real, yet never can obtain physical evidence.  I tend to believe that we are seeing is likely at a spiritual level or from a dimension parallel to ours but having the ability to influence.  We have not developed the ability to cross over to these dimensions; however, they are real, yet not something we can get our hands on.

He had a one passenger ultralight airplane stored out there.  He wanted to show me how he would ride up into the low hanging stratus clouds and take cloud pictures.  Even though it was hard to keep craning my neck all that time,  I kept my eyes on him most of the time as he slowly climbed to altitude, maybe 3000 ft.  Very hard to estimate.  Suddenly, with no warning, a small cigar-shaped craft emerged from a cloud just above and behind him, and going at the same slow velocity but in a slightly different direction, about 10 degrees rightward.  I do have vision better than 20/20.  I saw this craft for only about 1.5 seconds, before it went back into another cloud, but I was able to see a lot in that short time.  This craft was not much longer than the ultralight, yet had 3 or 4 portholes along the side of it that I saw, and even at that distance I seem to remember seeing somebody or something looking down at me on the ground.  (It was at about 65 degrees angular altitude at the time.)  The color of the craft was unremarkable, probably grayish in color.  I thought the craft appeared to be a bit too small for humans to be able to use it comfortably.   Also I detected no noise from it, could only hear my brother's ultralight motor.  I was hoping my brother might have seen it so when he landed the ultralight, I asked him obliquely, had he seen anything strange when he was up there.  He said he hadn't, and so I didn't pursue it.  That craft couldn't have been more than 40 or 50 feet above and behind him, yet he was not aware of it.  If he had, he would probably have been scared out of his wits.

Hello, I just listened to a radio interview with a gentleman from your organization on Coast to Coast AM.  As I never filed a sighting report when my incident happened, I was encouraged to file one now although my sighting is now twenty four years old.  Around 1:00 AM on a Saturday in July of 1988, I decided to travel home to Albuquerque, New Mexico for a long weekend from Las Cruces, New Mexico where I was attending New Mexico State University.  Having always been a night owl and very used to not going to bed until three or four in the morning, I decided to head for home.  The drive from Las Cruces to Albuquerque is about 230 miles traveling North on Interstate 25 and takes approximately three hours.  I was a little past two thirds of the way, North of Socorro, New Mexico, when I happened to notice bright flashing or blinking lights way off to the East and traveling South.  As I continued to drive, I could see that the lights began slowly moving from the East toward the West in my direction.  I thought that the lights were perhaps a large military aircraft that was banking to the right as Kirtland AFB was only about fifty miles North of my position. By this time, it was about 2:30 AM.  There was no South-bound traffic on Interstate 25 and only one vehicle behind me about a mile.  After about ten minutes, the blinking lights were very bright and very low, perhaps 1000 feet.  It was not long before they were only about ¼ of a mile ahead of me and beginning to cross over Interstate 25.  At this time I pulled my car over to the shoulder and got out of the car to watch the object.  Within a minute, the vehicle traveling behind me also pulled off to the side of the road to watch the object as well.  What we saw was almost beyond belief.  The object stopped its traveling motion and hovered motionless.  It was pitch black and appeared to have a triangular shape.  This was evident because it exhibited bright, flashing lights with each light flashing in unison very quickly.  The shape of the flashing lights was suggestive of a triangle.  Suddenly, all of the flashing lights went out and a round, bright hole appeared in the center of the shape.  A small luminescent ball appeared to drop from the center hole where it slowly moved off and away from the triangle shape.  It then appeared to flash away and was gone.  The light in the center of the triangle shape dimmed and the flashing lights started again.  The triangle object then began to continue to move off to the West and then South.  The gentleman from the other car and I were at a complete loss for words.  In fact, we were both overcome with an urge to get to a populated area as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, we did not exchange any contact information.  Thank you. Submitted from Denver, CO – June 2012 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a warm, sunny, and windy day on the bay in San Diego.  I was about 8 to 12 years old and my neighbor was 2 years my senior.  His father took us fishing at Shelter Island Pier which faces North Island Naval Complex to the southeast(according to google maps).  The pier was wooden at the time and has since been rebuilt but is more or less in the same spot perpendicular then parallel to its shoreline in a 'T'. I am unsure of the exact time of day, it was likely between 11am and 2pm.  I am unsure of the month but the time of year was likely spring or summer because of how high and bright the sun was that day.  This could have been a Saturday afternoon, spring break or summer vacation.  The year was anywhere from 1989 to 1993. I believe my friend's dad noticed the UFO first, to the north.  We were on the south end of the pier looking north to our left.  It was gray/ dull-metallic in color and looked like a flying cruise ship with no protrusions of any kind.  It was flat and thick as if many levels to it, but was rectangular.  It appeared to have ports on its side or perhaps markings.  The craft was so high up that finer details  of its side were blurry and I had 20/20 vision all through school-age.  It had no lights visible and made no noise which I remember finding strange, so I remembered the whole incident fairly well. I think the craft was in excess of 200yards long and thousands of feet high in altitude. If i hold my thumb up out in front of me, the craft appeared about 1-1.5inches wide by about 2/8 to 3/8inches thick and atleast 45 degrees above horizon. It moved very slowly for approximately 15 minutes, traveling north to south from our vantage point. It seemed to be high above North Island and Coronado.   In relation to all the other planes and blimps that were nearby at lower altitudes made the size of this ""craft"" very large and very high.  At the time many of these facts were pointed out by my friends dad, whom seemed to be astonished and in disbelief.   I knew both my neighbor and his father to be intelligent people and I have a background in science and medicine.  We discussed how incredibly awkward the craft was for about an hour with other fisherman after we lost sight of it.  It was fairly unspectacular because of its super slow speed and dull color.  It didn't seem to spin or turn or deviate from its southern route.  Someone speculated it could have held as many people as Star Trek's Enterprise-D if it were real.  We passed it off as a military craft because it was so visible to everyone, it didn't move erratically, it was in close proximity to the naval base, and it disappeared just as silently as it appeared.   To my knowledge no one has reported on this ""mother ship"" sighting.

The road follows the Meramec River the whole way. I was about half way between Hwy 44 and Hwy 30 and I saw a reflecton of colored lights in the river. I stuck my head out of the window and looked up to see what was causing the reflection. I saw some sort of craft about maybe 100 feet up. It had 8 to 10 different colored lights that were blinking in order. There were two rowes of these lights, one row on each side of the craft. It was hovering directly above the river. At first I thought it was a helecopter but it didn't make any noise at all that I could hear and a helecopter would cause ripples in the water, and there were none. It was a fairly large craft but it was hard to judge just how high it really was, so that made it hard to judge the size. I didn,t stop to look at it further because there wasn't any place! to pull over, so I only saw it for maybe 30 seconds. I passed a couple of cars going the other way so they might have seen it also.

As I was walking, to the east a red light in the trees about 100ft away caught my eye. I stopped in mid stride. I muttered, ""What the?""  and within 3 to 5 seconds found myself running towards it.  It was about 200 ft in the air, slowly descending above a thicket of Evergreens, behind a row of houses, and next to a church.  It was luminous red, orb like and very bright.  I am having trouble gauging the diameter of the object.  It wasn't huge, but it wasn't small either. Maybe 10ft x 10ft? The center of the object shone very bright.  So bright I squinted my eyes.  This made me think it was a helicopter.  But the closer I got, it was apparent this was no helicopter.  Associated with this red glowing orb was no sound, no wind, no smoke, no sulfur smell. Just a bright glowing red orb in a slow controlled decent into the trees. I was not the only witness. When I ran out to the street, there were two cars parked and idling in the middle of the road. Their passengers, teenagers. They had spilled out onto the sidewalk and were staring in awe just as I was, ""Did you just see that?""   I said, ""The red glowing light, yeah!  What was that?""  said one of the males.  Neither of us knew.  But we agreed that there was no sound associated with the mysterious red orb in the sky. I had my phone in hand ready to capture video, but it had disappeared into the trees before I could film.  One of the teenagers said he captured it with his video camera.  I was so focused on it returning, that I failed to exchange information with him so I could see the video he took.   After a couple of minutes they all drove away, and I continued to stand there for another 15.  I stared at the trees hoping it would reappear.  I also listened for something to indicate a hoax; people partying in their back yards, laughter, music.  Anything to give logic to what we had seen.  There was nothing except quiet dark houses, white lightning and me alone in the street.

I went to the top floor (7th) of a near-by parking structure to use my binoculars to get a better look.  I was using low powered binoculars to observe Venus and Jupiter, which were approx. 30 degrees up from the eastern horizon.   As I trained the binoculars on Venus, a dark colored object ""floated"" into my field of view.  The object was oblong to egg-shaped and seemed not to hold a steady form.  There were no visible lights emitting from the object.  The object appeared to hover in a stationary position before beginning to ""drift"" in a southern direction.   It continued south for approx. 2 minutes, then made a distinct and sudden turn west.  The object increased it's speed as it moved west for approx. 10 seconds, then continued to hover.  I lowered the binoculars to attempt to view it with my &qu! ot;naked"" eye, with negative results.  I re-engaged the binoculars and again saw the object in about the same position.

I spent the next 10 minutes using the binoculars to scan the area in a ""strip search"" pattern to try and re-locate the object, with negative results. The sky was cloudless with a hint of marine layer haze, low on the horizon.  The object appeared to be at an altitude greater than 10,000ft., though I can't validate that without knowing it's size.  I did not see any light reflecting from the object, despite the approaching sunrise (it should have been high enough to have been above the earth's shadow).  It was dark colored, close to black, and seemed to absorb light.  I did not hear any sound I could associate with the object.

UFO REPORT from Prescott Valley, Arizona on July 8th, 2012, 10:10 PM  	This UFO sighting took place on the evening of July 8, 2012 at 10:10 pm, on a dark Sunday evening.   There were no clouds in the sky,  no wind blowing, a very quiet night, and no traffic noises. The stars in the sky could be seen very clearly.  The only lights that could be observed that night were from neighboring houses.   There were no street lights on any of the streets in surrounding neighborhoods.   The conditions were absolutely excellent for the UFO sighting. Before I present this report, I need to detail the sighting location to establish the fact that there were no obstructions within the viewing area.  The only obstructions were at distant houses and the next door neighbor‘s house as the craft passed overhead.   Refer to the attached Google Earth map for a detail picture of the observation area. This report was written by my father (an electrical engineer), with details added by my mother, and details added by myself.   The three adults who viewed the sighting, all agree to the report’s accuracy.  None of the observers had ever seen a physical UFO, alone one that flew over the next door neighbor’s house.   I am 41 years old, my father is 67 years old, and my mother is 66 years old.   I was a US Marine, am currently unemployed and currently going to college for a degree.  My father was an electrical engineer with Honeywell and is currently retired.   My mother has always worked in retail and is currently retired. I was sitting on the front porch of my parent’s house at 10:10 PM on the night of July 8th of 2012, which was a Sunday night.  It was a dark cloudless evening with absolutely no wind.  There was absolutely no noise or road traffic during the entire sighting.   I was smoking a cigarette and looked south above the houses across  from us, the next street over, seeing nothing strange.  I was seated on the front porch on this Sunday night at 10:10 PM.   I looked down, while smoking and then up again, noticing a bright orange light which was previously not present in the sky above the houses south, the next street over.   I observed the orange light for approximately 10 seconds, traveling in my direction.   I then called my son  to get my parents as well as my youngest son.   By the time everyone was outside, the object had crossed the street, to the south of us.  There were three adults present and my two children, age 7 and age 9. The object was a spherical round shape (like a basketball), as witnessed by those present.  The spherical object displayed a fluttering energy field of some kind that enveloped the bottom of the sphere.  I’m sure that the energy field was providing the possible antigravity field for the object.   The fluttering energy field provided the only illumination to the spherical object, which was an “extremely” bright orange light, illuminating the lower surface of the sphere.  The top portion of the sphere showed to be dark, probably because the energy field’s light emission could not reflect off  the top surface of the sphere.   There was though, a faint outline of the sphere at the top.   No windows, doors,  protrusions, or protruding appendages were observable on the craft.    Please note that the extreme intensity of the orange light at the bottom of the sphere could have obscured these features. The UFO appeared to be traveling (estimated speed) 30-50 mph, or at a normal street driving speed while it was in the observation viewing window.   The viewing window time (while the object was being viewed) was an estimated 2 minutes in length.  The size of the object as it crossed over our street, which was about three houses up the road, showed to be the size of a penny as viewed at arms length.  The estimated altitude as it crossed over our street showed approximately a 45 degree angle into the air, showed to be approximately the length of a football field high.   There was absolutely no sound during the observation period.   At its closest point to us, it was dead silent.    The object had appeared to have gone in a straight line with no deviation in direction or altitude while being observed.    It disappeared over the houses on our side of the street.  My dad did go down the driveway and observed it continuing its journey to the north until it disappeared over the ho! uses behind us.   Airplanes can be ruled out due to its no noise heard, and hot air balloons can be ruled out due to there being absolutely no breeze or air currents. The UFO flight path had probably crossed over the entire eastern edge of Prescott Valley heading due north.   During our observation period, it was traveling due north.   Interviewing neighbors up and down our street, no one saw the object because they were either in bed, preparing to go to bed, or were up with the blinds closed.   At 10:00 PM, one would have to be very lucky to have seen the object, especially when it made no noise.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,34.65223076923077,-112.29900769230768

At about 2000 hrs, Wed evening 21 Nov 2012, I was going northbound on Pennsylvania/Nicholson, and when I pased Ramsey Ave in Cudahy.  This street is the main street next to Billy Mitchell Field Airport, on the east side of airport.  I looked eastward, over Lake Michigan, and I seen 4 bright lights, in a Triangle form.  There was 1 airplane in front, with it's lights blinking, and right on it's right wing, there was a huge triangle of 3 lights that was a perfect triangle and huge.  The airplane was on the runway path to land from Lake Michigan westbound.  It was about 5 miles out and the triangle was easily huge; and I'd say 2+ miles apart from each corner light.  When I first seen it, I was going northbound and the lights were going on a north-east direction, and about 1 minute later, when I next seen it thru a field, the lights turned west bound; into the landing runway east/west.  I slowed and passed the airport, and did not see the airplane with the blink! ing lights land, but as I looked at the triange of lights, it hovered, then lowered towards the water, and I lost sight of it.  I thought it was a line of planes waiting in line to land, but it was not, and the triangle just stayed the exact same.  As I turned west, I lost sight of it.  Please ask for the Mitchell Field airport radar reports for about 8pm that evening, and look directly east of the airport.  Then look directly east at the edge of Lake Michigan waters, and then look south east...  It seems it came in on a direction from the south east going to the north west, then went directly west, as the airplane was directly in line with the runway...  That is were the craft hovered, and lowered down towards the horizon and water, when I lost sight of it. This was huge and possible larger then 2 mile from point to point light.  I only seen the point of lights on the corners and did not see any lights or craft, but it was 100% solid as the triangle turned directions and decended...  Any aircraft, the lights would not have all turned as one huge piece...  I was in the USAF for more then 10 years, and honestly, never ever in my life seen anything so huge.  I seen the blimp, and even flew on a C10 to the Gulf and let me tell you, this wasn't anything that small.  Thank you.  I wish I would have had a camera, but my cheap phone can not take pictures...

They would move out and away from each other- then merge together again- quickly.  They began merging and then would form a glowing ball of white light, which would grow in size. Then it would break apart and repeat.   I grabbed my phone, and recorded it.  My dogs were unusually silent- they stood still next to me.  Then the last time, it grew to be so bright and huge,  It almost like it knew I was watching or something.

I stopped my coversation with my wife and pointed it out to her and she saw it and was amazed at the colors and its shape. I got up from my patio and walked to the northern corner of our back yard to get a clear look at this what appeared as an object moving on a level flight pattern from the east going west. In the mean time my wife went inside our house to get our son's ages 26, and 25 and our one son's girl friend age 29. In the mean time I stood at in my place in my yard continuing to observe this very bright object that had what appeared as cone shaped or spikes shaped objects projecting out of the center of a cigar shaped center of which the entire object was completely illuminating a pulsating reddish orange aura. As it came completley in front of me it appreared that the center of this object's center cigar shape had a line of white/blue/purplish glowing aura. I must stop here to explain that where we live we are in a flight line for Chicago Midway airport where on a daily basis we must see at least 30 or more commercial jets making their final approach into Midway and are approximately 5 - 6 thousand in altitude. Having seeing these daily for the 12 years we live here, I can differentiate the lights on commercial planes and how they change as they move and literaly pass over our house. This object never changed colors if anything as it moved directly pass me at 5-6 thousand feet in altitue, it clearly became more appearent this was no ordinary airchraft. As stated before, the entire object was totally illuminated and was larger than any plane I have seen in my life and as it passed I waited to hear the sound of jet engine or even possibely the sound of a propellar engine. What I hea! rd was nothing at all and at that time it was completely silent outside. As it moved westward away from me, it looked the same from the back as it did from the front, same colors, shapes, and pulsating aura. For the next few minuites as it began to disappear to the west I noticed all I could could make out of this was a bright red dot. At the time I witnessed this I would estimate that this object was traveling at the same or slightly faster speed of the airchraft that fly over our house daily on their final approach. (Maybe 200 mph).  But as it was at the point where it reached as far west of where  it turned to a red dot, it suddenly moved upward in altitude at a very fast speed and then it was no longer visable. Just at this time I noticed a commercial jet was comming out of the western sky perpandicular to this oject, and that is when the object shot upward out of sight. I am a 49 year old man whom I would decribe as someone who has has much experience with aircraft of many types, including military craft, and I have never seen anything like this before.",2012-09-24T00:00:00,41.6233535483871,-88.21431225806451

On 9-3-12 as I was scanning coastal waters and saw an unusual item that caught my attention.  When I zoomed in to the sea floor, the item had several symmetrical features that peaked my interest.  I made a close-up image capture of the item with Google's snapshot feature and emailed it to myself.

Using my Corel Paint Shop Pro-Photo X-2 software I was able to adjust the satellite image and lighten and darken areas to get a more acceptable image.  I am including the original image I downloaded from Google Earth and the enhanced images so you can see that they are still the same image, just enhanced for clarity.  I will also include an image with the reflective surfaces highlighted in green due to some people having a hard time distinguishing the item from the sea floor.

I am reporting this to as many places as I can and as quick as I can to make sure that the image and knowledge that it is still there is not hushed up.  After eliminating the water surface effect I was able to see that the craft had originally been perched on the edge of the plateau in the upper right of the image. It appears that the edge broke away and the craft then slid to the sea floor.  The halo effect around the craft is due to the displacement of the floor sand and sediment.

Irvine, California. (about 40 miles south of Los Angeles)  Approximately 4:45 pm, warm clear day, bright sunlight, sun was a bit off to the west, and there was no clouds. It is the afternoon, the sun is arcing towards the west, but still quite high in the summer afternoon. I’ll try to present the experience without interpretation first, just as you would experience it, then save my interpretations for the end. While doing the backstroke in my pool, I was looking up at the clear, bright blue sky. There were a few birds, and occasional passing airplanes in the sky. Nearly directly overhead, (just very slightly to the east, but still very substantially overhead), I saw a VERY bright light, fairly large, (compared to the apparent size of commercial aircraft at cruising altitude) or possibly a tight group of lights. It looked very, very bright, like the brightest of stars, only this was visible in the daytime. It also looked quite a bit bigger than any star you see at night. I only mention the word “star” here, to give at least some idea to the reader, as to what caught my eye. It looked stationary. That seemed odd to me, because all aircraft I know of have some motion. I wasn’t quite sure if it was moving or not, so I swam over to the edge of the pool, stood stationary myself, and placed the edge of the roof of my house in my sightline to the object, so as to better determine if it wa! s moving. Comparing it to the tiles of my roof, I could see that it was moving, but VERY slowly. There was no trail, and the lights stayed a brilliant white color. After a couple of minutes, I was so curious about it’s apparent odd size, extreme brightness, and lack of velocity, that I went inside (dripping wet!), and got my Tasco 10x-40x63 zoom binoculars. I tried to look at the object freehand without steadying the binoculars, but the image was too jerky. I tried using a table first, then a chair, but it was still too shaky. I found that the best way was to lie on the pool deck, and look almost straight up. Once I got situated, I again used the “zip focus” center wheel, and focused on the object first without any zoom at all, (no zoom gives a wider field of view, and makes it easier to initially locate an object in the sky). I could clearly see that it was not a single point of light, but rather, a dark tubular craft of some sort, with several extremely bright lights clos! e around it. It looked to be about 6 lights. I initially thoug! ht I was looking at a satellite, with solar panels reflecting the bright sunshine, and I wasn’t alarmed at all. If I tried zooming in all the way, it would get blurry, so I couldn’t zoom all the way. I could only zoom in about 2/3rd of maximum zoom, without it going out of focus. Even though my arms were fairly supported, the image was still somewhat shaky. I kept trying to brace myself better, to get a clear, more stationary image. At times, when I could hold steady, I was able to see the object fairly clearly, or as clear as possible. The lights were so extremely bright, that it made it hard to see the dark body of the craft. As best as I could make out, the body was a long, dark, and seemed to connect to the lights around it.  It looked as if a parking lot light standard had drifted up into the sky, with about 6 lights, connected by a dark body. During this time, the object was slowly but steadily moving across the sky, towards the east.  I got my wife and daughter to come outside and check it out. My wife tried looking through the binoculars, but was unable to locate it through the eyepieces. She’s unfamiliar with using them, and hard to teach. By this time, it had traversed from being directly overhead, (“0” degrees) to about 75 degrees, down towards the neighboring houses’ roofline. It was getting smaller, and farther away as time went by. I had already seen the best view of it that I was ever going to get, so I gave up following it across the sky, and went inside and searched the internet for coo-berating sightings. There are no coo-berating sightings so far. I called the Irvine Police Department, but they had no reports at all, even in a city of over 250,000. Nasa’s website did have a projected orbit path of the International Space Station, that showed it crossing southern California about 5 pm.  Interpretations-  At first, I thought it was a commercial jet aircraft, maybe at 35,000 to 40,000 feet. As we know, even though they may be doing over 500 mph, they appear to move very slowly across the sky, because their great height makes it hard to gauge their velocity. But this object wasn’t even moving fast enough to fit that model. It was either moving much slower than that, or it was “orbiting” at a much greater altitude. From the time I first sighted the object directly overhead, until the time I quit tracking it, it made about a 75 degree arc across the sky. A commercial jet aircraft, at typical altitude and cruising speed, would not take the 9 minutes or so that this object took to traverse that arc, and was visible for. A commercial jet does not fit this model for that, and others reasons, below. Sometimes, a shiny aluminum jet, especially like those used by American Airlines, can turn just right, and if the surfaces are angled right, you can catch a glint of the sun, making the aircraft appear very bright in the sky, even on a bright, sunny day. Only this craft had no typical wings, like you can see on 747s and the like, even at their typical cruising altitudes.  And, this craft was much, much brighter than that. I thought the lights were possibly solar panels, which may reflect the sunlight much better than shiny aluminum.  This object was VERY bright. Just like a star, but you don’t see stars on bright sunny days. And there were several points of light around the dark bodied craft, so a star doesn’t fit the model.  Living close to several airports, I am familiar with what a commercial aircraft looks like, flying at typical 35k-40k feet, 500+ mph. The observed velocity, brightness, apparent altitude, did not fit this model.  The International Space Station was actually my first guess. There are some aspects of the sighting that are congruous with the ISS. These are- A central body, and solar panels surrounding, that may reflect sunlight, and this object seemed to be following an orbit of sorts. And there are aspects of this sighting that are not congruous with the ISS, (and space junk, + dying satellites, for that matter) First off, in my internet investigation, I learned that satellites need to orbit at 17,500 miles per hour to fight gravity, and stay in orbit. This speed generates centrifugal force that combats gravity. If they slow down, their orbit decays. They also orbit at least 60 miles up, above most of the artmosphere. Some orbit at 100 miles up, or 400, or 1200 miles altitude. No satellites orbit within ten miles of the earth, because the atmosphere would burn them up at 17,500 mph, and the atmosphere would slow them down. As a decaying satellite orbit hits the atmosphere at 17,500 mph! , they get hot, and burn up on re-entry. In contrast, this sighting of mine was of an object moving excruciatingly slowly. This fact is completely inconsistent with space junk, the ISS, falling satellites, communications satellites, spy satellites, and it is also inconsistent with geo-synchronous satellites, that are in geo-synchronous orbit.  In fact, all satellites, regardless of whether they are geo-synchronous, or orbiting at 17,500 mph, are completely inconsistent with this sighting. This is because satellites orbit above the atmosphere, and are not visible in the daytime. When the sun lights up the atmosphere, you can’t see the light of stars, nor man-made orbiting satellites. The atmosphere is too bright to allow any viewing of objects like satellites, that orbit 60 miles up, or 400 miles up, and more. The first 10 miles of atmosphere are the thickest, and if you are going to see anything flying with the naked eye, or binoculars, it isn’t going to be outside the first ten miles of atmosphere. The only reason you can see the moon sometimes in the daytime, is because it is so extremely huge, that it allows your eye to perceive its’ presence. It is true, that if you know exactly where to look, you may see an “iridium flare” even in the daytime, where the light of the sun is briefly reflected towards your location, from a passing satellite. This is an extremely brief flash, (and a rather dim one at that), as it is moving at 17,500 mph. This fact is totally inconsistent with my sighting, that lasted about 9 minutes, and was extremely bright. An iridium flare is only visible for the time that the solar panels are angled so as to reflect the sun back to your eye. Because they are moving so fast, and because they don’t rotate to keep the sun focused on you, they only make a very brief, small, dim dash of light. Check ‘em out on YouTube. They aren’t much to look at, and are completely inconsistent with what I saw, which was an extremely bright, and continuous  cluster of lights, that moved extremely slowly, had a dark body, and took about 9 minutes to traverse a 75 degree arc across the sky.  On YouTube, you can see videos of the ISS passing overhead at nighttime. It streaks across the sky very rapidly. Not as fast as a “shooting star”, but much much faster than what I saw. The ISS also appears fairly dim. Somewhat like a small star. Even through my binoculars, the ISS would still look like a dot of light, and you wouldn’t be able to see the degree of detail that I saw, not at all. What else could have a dark body, be surrounded with about 6 lights so bright, they rivaled the sun, make absolutely no noise, stay at the same brightness for 9 minutes, and take 9 minutes to traverse 75 degrees across the sky? Helicopters could arc across the sky like that, but they make a ton of noise, and this didn’t look anything like a helicopter at all, (nor a Harrier jump-jet, or even a group of weather balloons, nor a blimp) Even if you could attach lights as bright as stars on any of those crafts, they still wouldn’t look like what I saw. A group of balloons would not reflect the sun like what I saw. This object had lights so bright, they were like small suns in themselves. The reflection of the sun off of satellite solar panels is the closest earth-borne analogy to the brightness of light that I witnessed. But as stated earlier, satellites are completely incongruous because of altitude and speed, and the fact that you can’t see them in the daytime. But the sun/sola! r panel possibility is closest to explaining the brightness and sheer quantity of light emanating from this craft.  Like I said, it looked like (closest analogy possible coming up right here), a parking lot light standard, (minus the pole, just the light cluster), that floats within the visible atmosphere, with no apparent means of motion, and a dark, central body.  So to wrap up, my sighting is inconsistent with the ISS, space junk, any known satellites, balloons, Harriers, commercial aircraft…I can’t think of anything made by mankind that fits all the criteria. It is definitely an unidentified flying object. Any ideas?",2012-09-24T00:00:00,33.68653500837521,-117.79240477386935

I live in a very populated neighborhood; however, lots of farmland surrounding area.  I first thought this was some sort of remnant from a firework and it appeared to be “on fire”.  It was moving very, very slowly from the southeast sky toward the northern sky.  It literally stopped overhead and hovered for approximately 1 minute and then continued on this northern direction, remaining perfectly horizontal to the ground at the same altitude it first approached.  As I watched it glide across the sky, totally without sound, I kept trying to process what this could be.  I even thought someone must have an awesome remote control toy, until it disappeared in the distance.  During its flight, it would get brighter, then dimmer but was absolutely NOT an airplane or h! elicopter and no other lights or colors----just the steady glowing orange/amber color.  I can only seem to describe it as what the sun against the night sky would look like, only much smaller form.  As I was trying to explain this, another one appeared in the exact location as the first and mimicked the flight pattern exactly as the first, just as the first was almost out of sight range.

But when I noticed the sound was as if it was closer to the ground then most aircraft and the sound of the engine wasnt going away as if the craft was flying away.  So I had noticed this was around for too long I decided to look out the window.  To my amazement this craft was not a plane, it was hovering north-east, it had 4 flashing blue lights flickering in a circle motion with a center white light.  It wasn't flying fast enough to be a jet plane. I went down stairs to get my camera which would have provided a good picture, but the battery was dead.  I really wanted to tell someone, if i could call a number that isnt long distance I would.  The craft slowly traveled north-east and the blue lights disappeared but the white ligh! t remained.  Then 4 white lights flashed very bright all of a sudden in a different timing synced with the other lights flashing.  Once it was out of sight I looked at the sky, I looked at all the stars or what seemed like stars.

They where all at various altitudes ranging from very low to horizon (from my vantage point) to very high altitude. they were glowing red to orange and each one was a different intensity and colour. I noticed them as they were manoeuvring around quite vigorously in the sky. I immediately ran indoors to call my housemate to come look at what was in the sky. We both then went out and witnessed each of the craft move slowly up into the sky and at high altitude seemed to disappear. By 11:00pm the last of the objects faded out and we then thought they were gone. I tried to get picture and video on my cellphone but the camera could barely make them out. I then noticed my housemate had a much better cammera with a really big lens on it. He said he got a few snaps of them. Then suddenly I noticed one of the craft coming direc! tly over our heads at height of about a 1000 meters. It was glowing white but in a very faint fashion. It was clearly a disc-shaped craft and moving as fast as a helicopter would but in COMPLETE SILENCE. As it passed over it appeared to have a smaller glowing orb (spherical shaped) craft come out of the centre of the disc and drop down and move away in a westerly direction. The main (or bigger) craft continued at the same height in an south westerly direction. Again we managed to get some pictures before the object disappeared behind the trees. The formation of the craft where originally to the north of our position (Northcliff looking north towards Midrand area). The disc with the smaller orb like craft where heading in the direction of soweto, the smaller craft after detaching and moving in the same direction then veered westward toward Roodepoort.

It was just over the tree line, no more  than 100 feet above, and it flew directly over my head. It was the size of a house, matte black, spherical, mechanically  silent.

Also crossed great distances in short amount of time; disappeared and reappeare I am reporting this retroactively, I am now 31 years old.  I was a junior in high school at the time of the sighting, I believe I was 16 or 17 at the time.  It was a weeknight.  I was asleep.  My room had a window that faced north on the second story of my parent's house. This window had no blind, or my blind was wide open.  I can't remember which. We lived on the northeast side of town.  In any case, I was awakened from sleep by a bright, flashing light at around 3-4 AM.  It was bright enough to wake me from a dead sleep;  bright enough to pass through my eyelids and awaken me.  At first I thought it was lightning, and shut my eyes to go back to sleep.  The flash happened a couple of more times, yet I never heard any accompanying thunder. This was all probably within a matter of 15 seconds.  Eventually, the light went from a flash to a steady glow.  As if the lightning had changed from a flash to a steady light. That was the point at which I decided I would get out of bed and approach the window, because it didn't seem normal at all.  What I saw next has stuck in my mind over the years.  It was an extremely bright light which w! obbled and pulsated, varying in brightness from dim to bright enough to light up the entire sky as lightning often does. Sometimes it would flash at it did initially when it first awoke me.  It seemed that when it hovered in one place, it was unstable, wobbling from side to side and back to front. I estimated the distance to be many miles, but not more than 10, and the altitude to be in the thousands of feet, but probably no more than 5,000-8,000. At times it would completely go dim, as if it disappeared.   Within one or two seconds of disappearing, it would reappear with a flash of light, literally miles from where it had disappeared.  Scaling at the distance I estimated, it seemed that it could move 5-8 (maybe even 10) miles in approximately a second.  I also observed it doing aerial maneuvers that I have never seen a conventional aircraft perform.  For example, a high speed, lateral movement at what had to be thousands of mph, and then an immediate change of direction in! the opposite direction with no loss of speed.  I also observe! d it mak ing right angle turns at speeds that a reasonable person would find physically impossible for any known or man-made aircraft.  I watched this in awe for a matter of 10 minutes.  I actually had a video camera sitting on the desk in my room, but I was so worried that if I took my eyes off the object for long enough to retrieve the video camera, it may disappear.  I didn't want to take that chance.  Eventually, I ran downstairs to awaken my father because I really wanted him to see it, too.  I wanted to have someone else verify what I was seeing, so I wouldn't think I was insane.  By the time he came back upstairs with me, it was gone.  It probably took me about 2-3 minutes to awaken him and for us both to make it back up to my room.  The next morning, I woke up and went to school as usual.  I was there somewhat early, and ran into a friend of mine who lived a block north and one street west of me.  His house was probably 80 to 100 yards away from mine.  During our small talk, I mentioned that I was pretty tired because I didn't get much sleep the night prior.  However, I didn't tell him why I didn't get much sleep, and I did not mention what I had seen to him.  What happened next gave me the verification that I yearned for when I had awoken my father that night.  He proceeded to tell me that he didn't get much sleep either.  He said that he woke up in the middle of the night to fetch some water from the kitchen.  Having been to his house countless times throughout childhood, I knew that his kitchen window faced the east, and would have been a prime viewing area for the phenomena I had witnessed.  Turns out, it was. He was awake the same time that I was the night before, and had witnessed the same thing I! had witnessed.  Neither of us ever officially reported the sighting to the police, and to this day it is something special that we share in common.  From time to time when we meet up, we talk about it.  I would also like to point out that I come from a family of pilots.  I have flown in private planes and commercial planes since I can remember.  I was raised at airshows, I have seen probably every type of high-performance conventional airplane pushed to the limit by the best of the best, such as the F-18 Blue Angels, and the F-16 Thunderbirds.  I have seen the F-117 in flight, and I have seen the newest Joint Strike Fighter that we have present day.  In short, through both experience and observation, I know what a conventional aircraft can and cannot do.  Obviously, I have somewhat of an understanding of the limits the human body can endure in terms of G force through conversations with my brother and grandfather, who are both pilots, along with knowledge I have picked up ! throughout my life as a result of my interest in fighter jets ! and any other types of airborne military technology. As far as what I saw that night, I don't know what it was, but I know what it wasn't.  I am 100% sure that what my friend and I witnessed that night was something that was not conventional, and probably not man-made.  If it was man-made, it is obviously a well-kept secret, as it probably should be. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Then I noticed that it was much wider than a single tower light.  I turned east on Lake Ida road and was alternately watching the road and looking north (to my left) at the lights. The red light was now rectangular in shape and there was some small areas where there was maybe white light by the red.  Then the Large white source became 4 blinking smaller white lights, like 2 lights each on the wing tips of an airplane. The white lights flew to the south above me and then I couldn't find them. The red light started moving rather rapidly to the east. Then I noticed red sparkles horizontally behind  the red light. The sparkles were like fireworks sparkles.

I had several sightings the summer of 1999. Since I worked the graveyard shift, on my nights off I would lay in my hammock out side as not to disturb my sleeping children.  The 1st night I focused on two very bright stars for at least an hour when off to my right I saw what I thought was a bright satellite approaching those stars. Without changing speed as soon as it had made a perfect triangle with the two stars they began moving with the third object and continued on it's path. Same speed, perfect triangle across the sky until I lost sight of them. I was and still am baffled.  The following week I saw what I believe to be airplanes (since there was a small airport not far off) with their landing lights on coming over the tree tops on a hill about 5 miles away it came straight toward me from the west a couple more miles then made a sharp right turn toward the north. Something an airplane could not have done, also the so called landing lights were still facing me. I watch until it left my sight behind trees. Only seconds later another object on the same path,same size, same lights did the exact same thing followed by a third, fourth and so on. This went on for at least 45 minutes. I lost count of how many there were.  At my parents house 5 miles south of those sightings back when I was a teenager about 1969-70 in the summer time, on a bright clear day my mom called my dad and myself to the front porch and pointed to the north to a very large star (brightest I have ever seen) We watched it as it stayed in the same spot for about 15 minutes and we discussing NEVER seeing a star during the day let alone that bright. All of a sudden it shot straight up at an incredible rate and was gone. It was then we realized it was too close to be a star ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",2012-07-04T00:00:00,47.32144977777777,-122.62237777777777

Neon green orb hovering over neighbor's home for several minutes. It was a late night, approximately 11:00pm-12:00am.  The details have become a bit fuzzy over the years as it was maybe around 1999.  Since then I haven’t really thought too much on it, except for when I see a show about UFOS or my mother and I reminiscence from time to time.  I want to say I was around 14.  I am now 26 years old with a master’s degree as a Physician Assistant Certified in a family practice center and I care for underserved and uninsured patients. We had just gotten back from a family event and it was a cool night, probably late summer but maybe early Fall.  There were four passengers in our truck, myself,  my mother, stepfather and my brother. When we got out of the car I had remarked what a starry night it was.  While looking up, we noticed at least five bright neon colored glowing “orbs”, literally bounding across the sky like a pinball machine would.  There were no trails of light.  These orbs of light had no specific shape but the central region was a more rich color and the outer ring a slight aura.  At first the lights were the size of stars.  I specifically remember a pink orb of light and a green orb of light, but there were other neon colors as well. My mother and I decided to stay outside.  My brother and stepfather entered the house as my little brother was scared and my stepfather didn’t seem very interested. The lights were over our horse pasture.  As we stayed outside to observe, the lights came down closer to the ground and were still bounding about in erratic patterns.  Soon the lights were over the horse pasture, probably about the height a small engine plane would fly. There was no noise.  There were no specific shapes other than the glowing orb. We observed for what seemed like a long time.  The lights started to move across the street.  We went into the woods across the street to observe further.  At the time, none of us had cell phones or a video camera to take any photos with.  We stood in the woods for a long while, maybe 20 minutes.  The woods were on the back side of our neighbor’s house, which also had a horse pasture.  We were on one side of the horse pasture, and their house on the other, no longer than half a football field’s length. The horses were not scared and were calm during all of these events.  After observing for a while, something miraculous happened.  One of the glowing orbs came down quite quickly and hovered above our neighbor’s house for several minutes.  It was a bright green orb with a slightly lighter aura with no discernible shape and no noise.  It was large, and seemed just a bit smaller than their roof, but hard to estimate exactly.  After simply hovering directly above the house, it took off straight into the sky as fast as it came down and all activity in the sky ceased thereafter.  We never had the sense of fear during the experience. After this incident, we never seen the lights again.  We did not report the incident at the time and kept the story within the family. We did not hear any reports from locals.   We did not tell the neighbors about what happened due to fear of them ""thinking we were crazy.""  Everyone was accounted for and safe. I still wonder if we should have told them.  We did not live in a military region or an area frequented by aircraft.  Fremont has only a small private airport.  I would absolutely take a lie detector test and I know my mother would as well.  My brother still doesn’t like to talk about it, as it still scares him, even though he only seen the first half of the event (he is now 23) .  My mother and stepfather divorced, and we have since lost contact with him. In total, this event must have lasted at least 45 minutes-1 hour though I didn't time it.

I am a very amateur photographer and enjoy viewing and photographing wildlife.  We live in a cul-de-sac with a thick pine and hardwood forest behind us. I had purchased my first digital camera in 1998. It was a Olympus D500L.  It had only .85 Megapixel (850K Pixels). The aperture and shutter speed are automatic.  Although small by today's standards the camera took great pictures but digital zoom was very limited.  The camera software allowed the camera to be controlled by a computer.  I wrote a program to allow it to interface with the camera software so I could remotely take pictures in the early morning hours of my backyard and forest behind my workshop.  I had the camera take a picture thru the rear window of my workshop every minute for about two hours every morning beginning well before daylight. Although I didn't get many pictures of wildlife which I theorized later was because of the red LED which flashed on the front of the camera while a picture was being processed.  I think this spooked the wildlife but thinking back it attracted something else. At the time I was taking the pictures I had never heard of BOLs (Balls of Light).  I was however an avid UFO skeptic with an open mind.  On or about December 16, 1999 I was reviewing the pics taken that morning and came across two sequential pics with a bright orange-yellow sphere the size of a soccer ball.  I later assumed it to be a sphere rather than a flat round object turned on its end.   The coloration was uniform and pixelized on its border.  The object was only eight to ten feet from the camera.  The first pic was taken in front of a large pine tree which made it possible to judge the size.  The second pic taken one minute later.  The object had moved about two feet to the right and up about a foot.  My first impression was fireflies (lightning bugs).   I soon discounted this because of the brightness of the object.  Even with the aperture wide open and a slow shutter speed I do not believe the camera would flare the light of the firefly to the size of a soccer ball.  My second theory was that it was a reflection from car headlights on the window of a neighbor leaving for work.  I soon discounted this as no possible reflection could get to the rear window of my shop because it was well behind any other homes in the area.   I finally gave up and deleted the pics thinking the objects were some kind of camera bug being that digital cameras were so new.  (FYI, about 2009 the forest was timbered behind my house.)    A few months after deleting the pics I was reading about crop circles and BOLs.  A shiver went down my spine as I new at that moment from my perspective that I had deleted two very rare photos.  I obtained file retrieval software in order to recall the pics but to no avail.  I did however retrieve exact pics but without the objects. I still have this camera and its successor, the D620L (1.4 MP).  Both are in great working order and hope to set up the camera again in the hope of resolving this mystery.

There was no airplanes, helicopters, hot air ballons ect that could be seen only a very translucent whispy small cloud. I would describe the light as being orangish yellow in color, very intense, and wide. Its hard to estimate the width of the beam but it was easily as wide as any spotlight I've ever seen. The light originated from an elevation of approx 1000 to 1500 ft, again hard to determine exactly.

I believe this event took place in the early Fall of the year 2000 or 2003 (sorry about the gap) at approximately 10:00 pm. My best friend and I had just finished clearing trails in his woods and we were making our way back to his house, crossing a grassy field to get there. Headed towards us we saw what we thought was an airplane at first, especially considering that there is an airport somewhat nearby. This craft had three solid white lights on it, arranged in a wide triangle shape. The lights were not blinking and the craft was completely silent. It seemed to be flying very low, enough so that we certainly would have heard this thing if it was just another passenger airplane. Besides the fact that this craft was completely silent, a couple of things really grabbed our attention. First, we realized that this thing was either jet black or totally transparent between the lights. Realizing that detail was very unsettling. The second thing that really grabbed ! our attention, and the thing that caused us to run towards his house (this whole time we were just standing there watching this thing), was when it changed direction. Up to this point the craft was moving very slowly, as far as we could tell, in a straight line directly toward and over us. This thing seemed to suddenly and completely stop, do a 180 degree turn, and head back in the direction that it came from. There was never a shift in speed, from what I could tell. After that 180 degree turn we were both startled enough to run to the house and pretty much pretend that none of that happened. All of this happened about 9-12 years ago and I've told very few people about the event, probably because I'm afraid of what they'd think of me.  I'm no expert on aircraft but I was in the U.S. Army and I saw my fair share of passenger, fighter, transport/cargo, and unmanned aircraft during my service and never once did I see anything like that. I heard about you last night on Coast to Coast (I work midnights and have nothing to do on my break so, typically, I listen to Coast to Coast) and so I figured I'd file the report.

I had a clear view the entire time of about 20 seconds and it was moving about 3 times faster then the ISS.

I had just started the conversation when he asked me if it was about 10:45 to 11 pm and if was traveling south to north. I told him he was correct and he finished telling me that he and his wife were outside on their patio and saw the same object.  He lives about 12 miles from me and I was glad that I was actually not seeing things.

July 9, 2012 between 10-10:30pm I was sitting at my patio table in our back yard in Allen Park, MI talking on my cell phone. There were a lot of big thick, white clouds in the sky that night and although I couldn’t see the moon it must have been out because the sky was fairly well illuminated.  I could easily see the well-defined edges of the clouds and the deep blue sky from outer space between them. While talking on the phone, my head was leaned back against the back of the chair and I was looking up at the sky.  All of a sudden movement in the sky caught my eye.  There was no noise to cause me to look for this approaching object, like you would do if you heard an approaching plane.  No noise at all.   It was hard to determine just what altitude it was flying at. My guess would be 10-15000 ft., since clouds range from 6500 to 18000 ft.   It was moving from SW to NW at about the same speed as a commercial jet would across the sky. If I’m remembering rightly, there was a large gap between clouds as it moved past me because it didn’t fly through any clouds except at the end of the 20-30 seconds I watched it.  As it moved across the sky I would guess it to have been a size comparable to if you held a penny out 18 inches from your face up toward the sky and closed one eye while looking up toward the sky. It was a perfectly round object.  I don’t believe it was round and flat like the proverbial flying saucer; it appeared to be spherical, like a round ball.  It appeared to have a slightly bluish color and also appeared to be glowing slightly or slightly illumined because when it went into the cloud, just before I lost sight of it, it looked like it was sort of glowing as it moved through the cloud; I was able to see it much longer because of the glow than I would have been able to see a plane that had gone into a cloud. After losing sight of it, I was trying to describe what I had just seen to the person I was talking to on the phone, while at the same time looking around to see if any of my neighbors were out and may have seen it too.  There was no one else outside.  I was still looking all around in the sky, as if I would see something else.  Then about 5 minutes later I saw it again, still in the NW direction it had been moving when I lost sight of it.  This time it was further away than when I had last seen it and looked like it was traveling vertically moving toward the ground still the same speed as before, and still probably 10-15000 ft., just a guess though.  I would guess that it would have been located then somewhere in Dearborn near the Michigan Ave./Telegraph Rd. area. I called our local channel 4 news the next day and asked if there were other reports of anyone seeing it.  The guy said no one else had called in. I am 53 years old and currently work in the telecommunications industry.  I have never seen anything like this before. It was very strange indeed.  I’ve heard about these government drones that supposedly fly around and collect info and/or spy on us.  Maybe it was one of those.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,42.2654,-83.208

This evening I was outside with a neighbor whittling wood for this is a hobby of ours and many like us.  I looked over to see my friend in a awe looking in the sky.  I was startled by his facial expression, it was as if he looking on the the destruction of Gomorrah.  I looked in the direction in the sky my friend was looking and there at the crest of the hill a cigar shaped craft, with strange holes (circle windows maybe, or lights?).  It was a few hundred yards in the air to my best guess, and about a half a mile away.  I turn my to see my neighbor was gone, he was sprinting to his home yelling to me he wanted to get his camera phone. I watched the craft as it descended further away and higher! in the sky.  Two minutes or so had passed my neighbor returned to only find that the craft disappeared to the heavens.   I want to share this experience I had with people who will understand and not look upon me as a leper.  Lets face it the government wants us to adopt the idea that UFOs are fiction.

It was brighter than any other star/planet I have ever seen after years of sky watching. It appeared to turn in place, and I thought for a second it must be a satellite. After about ten seconds it dimmed and began moving south east. As it began moving I immediately noticed another light that was about as far away as the width of the moon was moving with it. The two lights remained at the same distance throughout the rest of the sighting. At first they moved south for about twenty seconds, then turned and headed east. They then turned again and were moving to the north east until I lost sight of them. During the encounter there was no sound. To the east of my location on the Gulf Coast there are active lightning storms and the flashing can sometimes be seen, but above my area the sky is completely clear and silent. The things I saw could not have been stars or planets as they moved across the entire sky within two minutes. They could not have been satellites or other human objects in orbit because they did not maintain a straight course. They could not be planes as they were initially stationary, nor helicopters because they were above jet traffic – which is too high for helicopters to fly.

It was about 6:30 Thanksgiving night, Nov 22.  I had just arrived home and took my dogs into my yard. It was dark by that hour, and there was a bright half moon (more or less).  I happened to look up at the moon and noticed an unusual light in the sky, directly above me (about 90 degrees from ground).  Had I not been looking straight up, I probably would not have noticed it.  There was no sound whatsoever.  My dogs did not seem to notice anything unusual. It was perfectly round, a bright red circle with yellow in the middle, about the size of, maybe, ten stars.  I thought it looked like a cheese wheel--that was the best thing I could think of.  But it was two concentric colors--an outer red ring and a small yellow center, though there was no border nor ""dithering"" between the colors.  It stayed fixed in the sky for a few minutes. It did not move up, down, left, right, near or far. In my mind I ran through the possibilities--I believe in UFOs but I'm scientific.   Not a plane.  Not a helicopter.  Not a satellite, space station, meteor, comet, weather balloon.  I thought that the only scientific thing I could think of would be a nova or supernova--something that had exploded in space and hangs in a fixed position.  It was in one spot long enough that, after observing for a couple of minutes, I ran back into my house and called a friend--the only one I knew for sure would be around.  I asked him to get outside to check it out. It took him about a minute or two (it had already been in the sky for a few mins) and right at that point, it surprisingly started moving,  towards the north/northwest. It did not seem to get higher or lower and didn't move like a plane or copter. At that point, it disappeared! Not because it moved out of site, but it just went dark. There was no cloud cover in the sky. My friend never did see it as he got out there just a few seconds too late.

Once I reached the bottom of the hill, I could see clearly across the Green River Valley, all the way to the West Hill, roughly 5-7 miles away. The sky was clear, crystal clear, and the moon had yet to rise above the eastern horizon( I was driving west.)  Sea-tac International Airport is located about 12 miles north of where I was looking, and it is very common to see the lights of planes taking off and landing at the airport, during all hours of the day and night. When I looked across the valley, I noticed four lights, flying lower than the peak of West Hill. Three of the lights had blinking lights, and from my experience, appeared (and sounded) like helicopters. The 4th light, which they were following, about 200 yards behind, was an incredibly bright, unblinking white/blue light, about the size of a large sized pickup. The heli's followed the object, which remained in complete and clear field of view, for nearly 3o seconds, North along (what I would assume) highway 167.  Then, the object/light turned abruptly due east, and traveled for another 15-20 seconds, before fading away and completely disappearing. I was following, as closely as possible, and could hear the helicopters clearly, but no other noise could be heard from the object.  Once the light disappeared, the helicopters began to fly in a concentric circular pattern, slowly spiraling away from the last location of the light, until the 3 were flying completely around Auburn and South Kent.  Around the same time, I noticed an unusual amount of air traffic over Auburn. I watch the commercial airliners every day and night, and am quite familiar with the lights and flight patters of these aircraft. The unusual air traffic, though, did not have the same characteristics what-so-ever of the normal every day planes. There were no lights on the tail, not the normal ACL lights flashing on the underside or wingtips. The planes appeared to be darker in coolor, and not flying the normal pattern to land at Sea-Tac.

Two of my dogs were sitting together looking skyward so I turned my gaze in the direction they were looking.  As I turned I observed a brilliant tree leaf green strobe of light emitting from an object of in-determinant size and shape because of the intensity of the light.  The light did not appear as search light type of projection but more as a neon sign, contained into a shape similar to the blade of a Roman sword.  The light did not appear to look as an after-burner/reheat exhaust flame would look.  I had 10 years active duty USAF with 4-5 years of them engaged in flight operations of after-burning aircraft a couple of which included arming aircraft in the hammer-heads or taxiways prior to launch; thereby enabling observation of A-B operation at distances as close as 50 feet.  The green light suddenly changed to a yellow/orange color while! maintaining what appeared to be the same structure and size that the green light had.   At the base of the lights, where a darker object appeared to be located, there were smaller spears of light with a shape similar to the larger spear/sword sort of as the leaves at the base of a flower.  As suddenly as the light had changed from green to yellow/orange the yellow light went out and I thought I heard a faint humming sound.  I strained to see any solid object where the lights had been but saw nothing against the dark and overcast sky. As it was an overcast evening with a fairly solid cloud layer at what I would estimate at perhaps 2-3000 feet and the lights were about 20-30 degrees above the horizon and appeared to be well below the cloud layer I would estimate the hypotenuse distance from where I stood to have been 2-3000 feet.  After the light extinguished I remained on the front deck listening and peering into the darkness for 4-5 minutes.  I heard a low hum similar to what a small reciprocating engine aircraft might sound at a considerable distance.  It is possible that a light aircraft was passing over above the cloud layer that I could not see and I simply assumed the sound I was hearing was coming from the object.  Had it not been for the brilliant light spear/sword I might have chalked the incident up to a light aircraft observation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My girlfriend and I were staying at the Flamingo about to watch George Wallace's 10 pm show.  We were right outside the Flamingo facing the strip as she pointed to the sky and asked me what the objects were to the North. I immediately pulled out my camera and what I captured were bright white lights or orbs that would sometimes flash different colors as they hovered in the sky.  These lights spawned from each other creating new lights.  The orbs had the ability to move up and down, left and right all while hovering in the exact same area.  The way in which these objects moved defy the laws of physics.  The orbs seemed to interact with one another intelligently as they formed various and completely random shapes in the sky.  The way these objects behaved was almost as if they were showing off and wanted to be seen.  Sometimes there would be 4 or 5, and other times there were easily 20 or more.  Some of the orbs would dart away from! the group at very high speeds.  Other orbs just seemed to join the group and appear out of no where. At times one or two orbs would hover alone above the group.  A minimum of 2 airplanes flew by these orbs as I captured them on video.  My girlfriend and I , as well as one other couple seemed to be the only people paying attention to this event.  After filming for about 10 minutes we proceeded to watch George Wallace's 10 pm show.

I was driving and we were facing west in the left hand through lane.  There was a moderate cloud cover. While waiting at the stop light my son, who is 17, said something to the effect of, ""Dad, what the heck is that/are those?""   After a few seconds of confusion in trying to locate what he was looking at in the night sky, I observed what he saw.   With due west as the 12 o’clock position, I estimate that a group of objects were at about the 2 o’clock position about 55 to 65 degrees in elevation from the horizon moving from north to south.  Speed was difficult to assess because we didn’t know how far away the objects were - although while I was sitting at the light which couldn’t have been more than 20 seconds, they had traversed from the 2 o’clock position to about the 11 o’clock position in the sky as observed through my windshield. When I first observed the objects I thought they might be fireworks because they seemed to be flickering or pulsing - but then I noted they were moving in unison - although not in a regular formation in the sky.  Then I thought maybe they were lighted, radio-controlled aircraft that I had observed in the past in a field near our home.  But since I knew these planes  moved in a bobbing, irregular manner that did not explain these objects. When they were at the 11 o’clock position I started counting them before the light changed to green.  My recollection was I got up to about a dozen - but my perception was there were even more present - though they were faint.  I think they were at least 15 objects and maybe even up to 30 in the position we were observing them.  The sky was literally peppered with them in portions of that area of the sky.   I perceived the lights to be about the size and brightness of an easily visible star. The amount of sky they occupied would be approximately equivalent to both of one’s hands - or maybe closer to a hand and a half - covering such a section.  The length of the loose formation was greater than its width from what I could see.  I perceived the color of the lights to be a light green - although  my son thought they were more like neon purple.  I thought they were pulsing or blinking in unison at a what I think was a rate of 2-3 pulses per second.  Aaron thought this effect was from them passing in and out of the cloud cover. After the light turned green I caught glimpses of the lights again - although it was difficult to focus on them because I was driving.  Aaron saw them more clearly but we were moving so visual confirmation was difficult to maintain for him as well.  Light pollution didn’t help either.  About a quarter of mile down the road, we turned in behind a school to see if we could still observe the phenomenon but they had apparently disappeared behind the cloud cover or moved too far distant for us to observe them further. I would estimate the total time of the incident to be about one to two minutes from beginning to end of the observation. My son is a student at the local high school and an interested skeptic in such phenomenon.  I am a 49 year old  27 year teacher who has an admittedly avid interest in the topic of UFOs and although I’ve seen some unusual lights in the sky?  None I can’t explain as conventional artificial, meteorological, biological, or astronomical objects - until now.  The only conventional explanation I can think of for these object would be a formation of military helicopters.  They were definitely not airplanes or jets (moving too slowly), birds (unless pigeons have suddenly evolved luminescence in Oklahoma!), balloons, or meteors.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,36.109455879967555,-95.93524541768045

While waiting, observed a couple nearby light and release a pale blue/green Chinese wind lantern . Tracked with binoculars as it drifted to NNE.  Completely dissimilar to the following:  Start:  9:17PM, @8 degrees above Fort Trumbull (about half a mile away at 300 degrees NW) The first hazy orange light emerged, appearing to swerve abruptly from a SE to a NE course, (wind at this time had shifted to the SE).  Floating steadily, it gradually rose to @ 35 degree elevation (below 1,000 feet altitude), then maintained constant speed and altitude as it continued into the NE. Appearance was a quasi Kong Ming “Hero” Chinese sky lantern.  Much larger in size than such lanterns normally are (Corrected estimate from previous one = 10-25 ft diameter) , this cone shaped red/yellow/orange light’s top-most funnel shaped portion shifted erratically from side to side as if buffeted by wind, even though the object’s transit was a smooth, steady floating speed of 45 – 75 mph.  I must emphasize that the wind was blowing from the NW directly into my face.  After 3 minutes this orange oval began to flicker, then winked out at 20 degrees NE (about 3.5 miles away). Using a Lumix SZ15 I tried to zoom in and take burst photos and HD video.  Simultaneously, I attempted to paint the UFO with a green laser, while also observing it through 7X35 binoculars – an obviously frustrating experience.  No apparent response to laser, though all objects remained – for the first time since June – out of the laser’s 2,500 ft range, therefore I was also unable to “paint” any of them.  Some useful photos and video obtained. This UFO was followed by four subsequent UFOs, each appearing from the same location and each transiting almost identically from the NW to the NE.  Each UFO in this sequence appeared only after the previous one had drifted completely away and finally winked out. The final UFO blinked out at 9:35PM.

Background  Since mid-July of 2012, there have been numerous and semi-regular sightings of unidentified “orange balls” of light in the North Myrtle Beach, SC area.  The sightings have been ongoing, as recently as within the past week.  In an effort to witness these anomalous events, the author went to the area in question to observe on October 5, 2012. Two witnesses observed two instances of some anomalous aereal objects, and hereby submit this report. The witnesses conducted a field observation between dusk (approximately 7:30pm) and 10:30pm.  Subsequent to the sightings the witnesses did not discuss what they saw in any detail, preferring to prevent contamination of their individual accounts. Weather/visibility conditions  Clear until 9:30pm, then scattered altocumulus at 10,000' until 10:15pm, then clear. Temperature 77 degrees, Barometric pressure 29.95 in/Hg, Winds South at 12kt. Average amount of haze and ground lights, restricted observation of stars to 4th magnitude. Sighting 1:  Time – 8:35pm Duration of sighting: ~30 seconds Distance from observer:  Unknown Elevation above MSL:  Unknown Heading arc of object:  ~8 to ~10 degrees Azimuth of object:  ~ 15 degrees above horizon constant  Witness 1 Narrative:  I was sitting in a chair on the beach facing east.  I was watching the sky to the south, and turned towards the north and saw a bright reddish-orange light in the sky, with a magnitude of approximately -4.   I alerted Witness 2 to the object, who also observed it.  It traveled from left to right at the same elevation, and after about 15 seconds faded to a small pinpoint of light, with a magnitude of approximately 0.  It traveled toward the right (northeast) and gradually faded away to invisible. I am well versed in astronomical, meteorological, and aviation disciplines, and while the course taken by the object first appeared to be that of a conventional aircraft, I have never seen a configuration of lights of the sort.  There were no strobes (red/white), nor wingtip lights (red/green), and the object simply disappeared. Sighting 2:  Time – 8:42pm Duration of sighting: ~60 seconds Distance from observer:  Unknown Elevation above MSL:  Unknown Heading arc of object:  ~15 to ~20 degrees Azimuth of object:  From  ~ 8 to ~12 degrees above horizon  Witness 1 Narrative:  Alerted to the activity reported in Sighting 1, I concentrated my subsequent observation on the same area.  Seven minutes after the first sighting, I observed a very bright reddish-orange light very low to the horizon, estimate about 8 degrees, low enough to be partially obscured by the roofs of the nearby beach houses.   I again alerted Witness 2 to the object, who also observed it.  The object was rising in elevation to a maximum of approximately 12 degrees above the horizon, in clear view.  It was traveling from right to left, and was observed for approximately one full minute, traversing approximately 20 degree range of heading, and exhibiting similar flight and behavioral characteristics:  very bright, in the order of magnitude of estimated -4 to -6 for the majority of the time of observance, then fading to a clear white pinpoint of light with an estimated magnitude of 0 or 1, and finally disappearing altogether.  While the course taken by the object first appeared to be! that of a conventional aircraft, the lighting presentation was unconventional.  There were no strobes (red/white), nor wingtip lights (red/green), and the object simply disappeared.",2012-10-30T00:00:00,33.83166,-78.65013

As my girlfriend and I were relaxing in our en-suite jacuzzi while on holiday on Koh Samui, Thailand, we saw four orange orbs. It was at night.  The sky was mostly cloudless and black.  The orange orbs were between 10-30 kilometers away.  Four orange orbs rose into the night sky from a northerly direction.  They were each about the size of a pinhead.  They flew in an italicized N-formation.  They rose for several kilometers into the night sky, then moved south a few kilometers, then paused and began to fade until they disappeared. It is possible that they disappeared because they were moving away from us, or that could be how my mind is trying to explain the phenomenon. They could have just winked-out.  Who knows. There were no wing-lights (as on commercial aircraft), and they were silent.  Koh Samui is a popular island destination, and as a result there are quite a few aircraft flying in and out of the island.  Shortly after the orange orbs disappeared, we could hear a commercial plane flying overhead, coming in for a landing. This plane, which came from a southern direction, was noisy with wing-lights.  So it was easy to contrast the two airborne crafts. I had seen a similar event on October 2nd, Tuesday, 2012, on Koh Samui as well.  This time I was walking with my girlfriend down Chaweng Beach.  She didn't see it, and I took notice of it (I keep my eye on the skies), but thought that they could be a natural phenomenon.  I filed this event into the ""remember this"" part of my brain.  There were 3 craft. All were orange orbs.  They formed in a triangular pattern and then faded away as before.  These craft came from the same northerly direction, moved south, then paused and faded-out in the same area in the sky as above. I am an English teacher in Japan.  I am 32 years old.

When I saw it I was shocked, I felt compelled to blink and shake my head a little to make sure I was actually seeing what I was seeing, which I was.  It was flying maybe 60 miles an hour or something like that, again absolutely quiet and in a straight line.  It flew out of site because of the tree line and it was gone.  I know it wasn't a bird or anything else. It was a craft of some sort. I'm thinking it was a military drone or other stealth aircraft from the government. I live in a populated area.

On Saturday, June 16, 2012, as my wife and I went to our car after dinner with friends, our hostess noticed an object in the sky and asked, “Look, what’s that?”  An object appeared SE of Olympia HS at estimated altitude -1500 ft rising to cloud cover I estimate at 4000 ft. where it disappeared into the cloud cover.  A couple of my companions said they saw smaller objects following the large one.  I only observed one object.  The object moved on an apparent straight course that I guess to be from SW near Black Lake to NE disappearing into the cloud cover over Lacey, WA.  I estimate the trajectory to be ENE roughly following the course of Interstate 5.  I estimate the time we observed the object to be between 5 and 10 minutes.  Our host retrieved his binoculars and tried to focus on it just before it went into the cloud cover.  All four of us observed the object at a time none of us marked but I estimate between 8:15 and 8:40 p.m. with good daylight still avai! lable at this latitude.  Olympia winds at that time were from SW @ 8 mph on 6/16/12.   The object’s speed I estimate between 50 and 60 mph.  There was no noticeable wind at ground level.  It moved as if sailing on the wind but appeared faster than the 8mph wind.  It moved smoothly without stopping or any noticeable change of direction or speed.  It appeared to me to slowly ascend as it traveled across the sky that provided a gray background for the sighting.  There was no noticeable noise though the object moved as if powered.  I viewed the object as a larger object with a smaller object or part suspended underneath of about ¼ to ½ the size of it’s larger companion.  They appeared to fly in perfect unison so I viewed them as connected in some manner.  They flew close enough to be seen as one.  I estimate the combined parts to have been 15 to 30 feet in height and 12 to 20 feet in width.  None of our guesses about its identity added up since a helicopter would have made noise and a different shape as would a plane.  An ultralight would also have made motor noise and I would not expect an ultralight to climb into the cloud cover at that altitude.  A runaway bundle of balloons or large runaway Kite is unlikely given the mild wind recorded that day.  I’m curious whether there were any similar sightings this day or if our sighting has been explained.  To us, it was not an identifiable object.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,47.03031595092024,-122.89693098159509

The object never got close enough for us to determine its shape.  We parked on the side of the road and watched as the object moved across the sky and disappeared behind some mountains.

My co-worker was sure she was seeing a mother ship every night around this time when at home, and I was sure she was seeing an illusion created by looking at a bright star through the screen in her window through her binoculars.  We searched for her mother ship, but of course didn’t find it. We turned to leave, and what we saw nearly gave us heart attacks.

They were in, and remained in, a group, but meandered among each other, mostly in a circular motion.  I call them “orbs,” but really they didn’t seem round through and through. The “apparent” size was about the size a dinner plate would appear if you held it out at arm’s length.  What was strange was that our binoculars couldn’t focus on any of them. All we got was fuzzy light when the binoculars were aimed on them.  After a couple of minutes, the group slowly started off toward the west, the direction of the ocean. As it got further away, a V shape took place of the objects, like a flock of ducks would form.  But here’s the peculiar thing. When the formation was quite a ways away, the binoculars could focus in a little better... and I would swear the objects now resembled creatures with wings flapping slowly... almost like winged dragons...   .and I felt our minds were being played with.

I worked at an office complex in cincinnati ohio as a security guard. It was after midnight is all i can remember and i had just stepped outside the front door of the office building when i saw this circular craft almost about tree top leve fly almost over my head in front of me.   It had a big circular white light under the craft which glowed very slowly blinking on and off sort of like a christmas light would.  The UFO was crusing along very slowly and as it got over me i could hear a like a whisper of a humming noise.   Then as it went by i stepped out further to take a look at it as it went by and the thing looked like it saw me and went behind some trees to fly off in a direction it didn't want me to see. I  felt like the craft was trying to avoid me seeing which direction it was heading because i already had seen it.  Anyhow i never reported it because i didn't think i would have my job very long if the company thougt i was a kook.   So years later i wished i had always written downt the time and day but i tried to just forget what i saw. I heard you comment on 55 wkrc radio a few weeks ago and you said if people saw something they should report it because you said you wondered how many people never reported seeing a UFO.  This is all i wanted to say. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)),2012-07-04T00:00:00,39.17450311744155,-84.48136299381886

I decided before going into town I would camp one last night and so I pulled off the main road onto a dirt road and headed in the vicinity of Lake Las Vegas.  Since I was alone I had no time frames to head into Vegas that night.  I ended up in the middle of this marshy dry desert creek bed in my Ford Explorer.   As the nighttime came around I could see the lights of the jet airliners from McCarran Airport trail off towards the East.  As I was looking in a Southerly direction I noticed this star like light getting brighter and brighter as it was headed towards me from the South.  This light was very peculiar as I watched it get brighter and larger at first it looked like a star but after about 10 minutes I could tell this light was entering the atmosphere.   I then noticed that this light broke off into two other lights and they came down towards me in a triangle formation.  Three lights in a perfect triangle formation way above the jet airliner trail path in the distance.  I realized that there was another star coming down the same way as the first and it broke off into 3 lights flying in the same triangle formation.  I watched this for about 20 minutes and it seemed as if these two triangle formations were comprised as of 6 total lights.   They rotated and came closer down towards my way as I was fascinated watching this distinctively from just outside of my SUV. I don’t remember falling asleep after that spectacle but I woke up in the driver’s seat of my white Ford Explorer with my hands gripping on the front steering wheel. After I woke up I felt a little surprised and started the car and left for Las Vegas.  This is the truth to the best of my knowledge and I was not under any influence of alcohol nor drugs during my vacation.

I am posting this 6/29/2012.  I am now 72 and this odd incident happened about six years ago. It was about two in the afternoon (in April or May of 2006 as best I can recall).  The weather was warm, with clear blue sky, no clouds at all. I was alone in my car driving south on Intersate 5 somewhere to the north of Esparto California.  I was doing about 70 mph.  Through my windsheld I suddenly noticed a stationary object dip into view and then right itself, as it righted itself it disappeared in place.  This sighting lasted only about 3 seconds. No lights were visible, and there was no sound, however the edges of the object were ""fuzzed"" and indistinct.  As far as I could tell the object was saucer-shaped, as if two dinner plates on top of each other and separated by a wall between them.  The front of it tilted down approx 15 degrees from horizontal and then immediately tilted back up again and disappeared as it did so.  It was a smooth motion and seemed appropriate to it's size - not a jerky motion.  My impression was that it was a very large object, possibly two football fields in diameter and it seemed to be about 500-1000 off the ground! , no more than that.  It seemed to be about a mile or two distant from me on the west side of the highway.  I had to chuckle because I had the distinct impression that somebody inside had made an error and had to quickly correct the tilt.  It seemed to me a ""cloaking device"" had developed a problem.  A second impression later was that this object was half-in and half-out of this dimension, odd as that may sound, since I have absolutely no experience in either cloaking devices or extra dimensions.  I did not pull over or stop because the object had disappeared completely and all I could see was clear blue sky, although I did keep looking as I passed the area.  As I said, the duration of this sighting was no more than 3 seconds.  As I drove further I thought that maybe it had been just a reflection in my windshield of something inside my car, so I tried to re-create a reflection with no luck.  The object itself seemed to be tan/dark tan colored, I coud see no markings, windows or any detail at that distance.  My car is tan and has a tan interior, so that should be taken into consideration when considering a reflection of some sort.  My own out-loud reaction when I noticed the ""object"" was ""What the hell is that!"".  As soon as I finished those words it was gone or disappeared.  There was no noise or lights associated with the object.  There are large electrical transmission towers in that general area.  I am uncertain that what I saw was anything more than a random reflection in my windshield, but I have this sneaking suspicion it was exactly what it seemed to be.  I've never seen a ""UFO"" before or since, and I'm not really a fan of UFO stuff.  But it wouldn't surprise me if such a thing existed.  But I'm not holding my breath.

I was BBQing on the back patio of my home in North Surrey British Columbia.  I am an avid sky watcher and know the Northern skies fairly well. It was just after sunset. As I walked onto the patio I became immediately aware of what appeared to be a star in the corner of my eye.  I thought to myself, ""that does not belong there"". I turned and looked directly at it.  It looked every bit like an ordinary star.  It was in the northern sky about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It's distance I cannot say, but I had the impression it was quite far away.  I watched it for perhaps ten seconds and then it began to move away from my position in a north easterly direction at about 45 degrees to the horizon. It moved across about 30 degrees of the sky accelerating very quickly until it disappeared. It did not change in size or color.  There was no sound.  Approximately a minute later I looked above me and saw a collection of bright red lights, round, sitting in one spot flashing on and off in a seemingly random fashion.  For some reason, and I do not understand why,  I attributed no significance to the red lights and walked back in the house.  I was, however, quite struck by the star like object.  I am very convinced to this day, and again I do not know why, that the star like object knew I was there and was aware that I was watching it.  My background is quite average.  I am working stiff, a tour bus driver at the time.  I do not drink or do drugs.  I was completely sober and had all my faculties with me at the time.

Hello. For the past few weeks I have seen 3 fireballs in the sky. Every time I would see one it was always between 11:00-11:30pm. Keep in mind I'm looking out my living room window for all these. The first one was a fireball right above our barn ,out the right side of window,and it sat there for about 5 seconds then it zoomed in the sky for about a foot then disappeared. The second fireball was out the left side of our window. I was watching tv and seen a flickering that caught my eye. So I looked out the window and it went from a small dot to a fire ball for about 3 seconds then it zoomed in the sky ,again for about a foot, then disappeared. Each time these things zoom in the sky the fireball almost sparkles. The third fireball was seen out the middle of our window. It was in the middle of the sky and the fireball flashed three times but moved in a downward diagonal for the three flashes then it was gone. It was about a total of ten seconds. All of those sightings happened in about 2-3 weeks time. Then last night 07/10/12 out of the right side of the window above the barn like the first fireball. I seen a sideways oval but all I seen was the outline of lights . It went from oval then to a squished oval then back to oval then it was gone. It never moved. It was in one spot then gone. I forgot to mention that the fireballs were all orange in color and that we live on 40 acres with my parents so I know that what I seen was not anyone's fault. And the oval thing I seen was not a firework because it had no noise and lasted about 7 seconds. Plus my dad would have had to light it in our driveway if it was a firework. He was sleeping at this time. I hope you seriously consider my story considering I have no proof. I'm just concerned for my family. Thank you",2012-08-05T00:00:00,,

It's speed seemed consistent like it was in cruise control.

They appeared to be about the distance a helicopter would fly, but it was difficult to determine.  They could have been much higher.

They do not seem like something meant to ""light a battlefield."" I’m sure many other people saw them.  I just couldn’t take my eyes off them, and did not have my phone handy, so no pictures. BOOOO!

The sky was clear and stars and moon were out, for some reason I was compelled to look at a certain spot of the tree line, that's where I saw the light. At first I was sure it was a star, whitish in color. then it started to move up over the tree line, now I was sure it was an airplane it turned  a reddish color. To my amazement this thing what ever it is started moving in a way I have never seen anything in sky move before.  It would make sharp turns left right up down, but would stay in my view. It remind me of some one playing with a yo-yo in the sky. After watching this thing dance in the sky for five or so minutes.  I ran  into the house got my phone and ran back outside.  I  called and woke up my dad (he lives nearby) watched this light for a few more minutes, dad shows up but the light slowly dipped back behind the tree line.  I'm sure it was still there I just couldn't see it anymore. My dad left he didn't get to see it but I was so excited about what I just saw I couldn't go to sleep so I pulled up a lawn chair and watched the sky.  Around 1:30 am I thought the show was over.. this object (it could have been a meteor) flew across sky,  I never seen one so bright before. 2:00am another bright meteor or whatever it was flew the same path but backwards. Another strange thing, day time birds were up and making a lot of noise. I searched the web all morning trying to find some answer to what I saw.

The atmosphere was clear, with no haze, and it was cloudless. When I got in my car I decided to have a quick smoke before leaving. I happened to glance back in the previously stated direction and was surprised to see 4 orange red lights, near the position of the Moon-Jupiter position, in what looked like a quadrilateral type formation. As I watched the objects appeared to be moving from SSE to NNW direction at a modest speed. The spatial orientation of the lights appeared to change as it moved. As I got out of the car for a closer look it seemed to change to a more 'kite' like orientation with several (3 or 4) new lights of the same color trailing behind like a tail behind the 'kite'. I got back in my car with the idea to get to a drive to a closer vantage point. When I backed up and started forward I tried to locate the formation again through my car window while driving, but could not find it, it appeared to be gone. Total observation time was about 2-2.5 minutes. There was no sound associated with these objects. They were about the same brightness as Jupiter, which was quite bright at this time. As I stated, I've spent some time observing the night skies as an astonomy buff. I've never seen anything quite like this before. I can tell you what I think it was not;  -It was not stars, any planet, or meteors. -It was not satellites passing overhead. -I don't believe it was part of any fireworks display (not like any I've seen). -I don't believe they were airplanes, or helicopters or ballons (not like any I've seen). One possibility I was thinking of was that they might be flares, of the type that military planes drop as part of their defensive apparatus. But I think that flares dropped by planes are white, while these were of an orange red color. I was also thinking of a sub-orbital scientific package launched by rocket from Wallops Island, Va, (base), as I know from experience, depending on the scientific package, these can put on a show in the night sky.   I tried checked the Wallops launch schedule and was not able to find a record of any launches on Nov 22. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was able to partially capture part of the sighting on my camera phone. However, the quality isn't that great due to the fact it was night time, but I have it nonetheless. It was a cool night. No clouds whatsoever were in the sky; no fog, haze or other atmospheric conditions. The time was approximately 2100 hrs., and total duration of the sighting lasted around five to seven minutes. It was traveling from the north-northeast to south-southwest direction.  The object itself was a bright orange fireball-like “sphere.”   I first noticed the object as we were pulling into the driveway of our house. There was only one object and it was completely silent.  Elevation of the object was hard to determine but it was VERY low.  If I had to hazard a guess I would estimate it to only be several hundred feet in the air.

I was anxious to report it to someone, but I had no idea who.  I was listening to Coast to Coast tonight (12/08/12) and one of the news segment guests mentioned ufocenter.com and how there have been a lot of these same sightings of “fireballs” last month.  I jumped on the computer and visited your site and composed this report now.  I'm just glad to finally have some place to report what I saw.

The lights were a very bright yellow and appeared to have the shape of planes or were 'bird-like' in shape. The moved around in a zig zag and spiraling motion, up and down, and then disappeared.  As quickly as those lights disappeared, another three - four lights appeared, moving in the same zig-zag spiraling up and down motion, then disappearing. Suddenly, there were about three more lights, repeating the same motion and movement. The objects made no sound. I quickly attempted to get another family member outside, but could only locate one person.  The family member saw nothing, but while he was standing there, another light flashed across the sky, but was much further away.  Family member did not see the one light, nor any of the other lights. Family member suggested a meteor shower, but the objects were shaped like planes(or birds), were bright yellow, did not flashe across the sky, and they were all the same shape and size.

The light was traveling quickly in a horizontal trajectory, and then began to move upward and slow its pace.  Then a second red light appeared, as well as a third with similar trajectory.

I exclaimed to my friends to observe the object, I really thought it could be a plane crashing. By the time they turned to face the object, it had already disappeared behind one of the houses. I was scared, and they could tell I was scared. I don’t think anyone else saw it, someone said it could have been a shooting star. I think it was too large to be a shooting star. The object came by and went too fast for me to determine how far away it was. The object looked about the size of an airplane when it is closing in for landing. The flash I saw from it was white in color, but there seemed to be flames coming from behind it as it fell down, also white in color. I never heard a crash or anything of the sort and part of the reason I got scared was because I was expecting some sort of noise. I was thinking it could have been a meteor or space junk, but I was unsure if those would make a noise since the object I saw seemed so close and large.

I have seen many UFO’s in Caddo County over the last 9 years however reporting this one is essential because it came through my pasture fence to the ground twenty feet  paced from  the bench I was sitting on.  It is not a reflection of sunlight. This is totally separate from the sunlight and very large and easy to see detail in the photograph. It is a brilliant circular orange UFO with a bright yellow center horizontal and equilateral to the yellow are two additional orange circles. The top was orange raised and triangular.  A vapor of orange trailing behind created a glow.  This was the first photograph. In the second photograph it was hitting the ground dispersing and the yellow center remained intact.

No strobes just solid lights. At approximately 12:15-12:20am I witnessed 3 white lights in a tight triangle formation pointing down. Below the lights there was a smaller solid green light.  There was a slight gap between the white lights and the green.  This was on NC HWY 54 westbound just after exiting from I-40 on the Durham-Chapel Hill line.  The object descended very smoothly without any lateral movement from an approximate altitude of 1000 ft. or so (rough estimation). I lost sight of it once it became obstructed by trees.  As it did so it became one solid white light.  The sighting lasted just under a minute.  The object appeared to be about a mile to my southeast.  At the time of the sighting there was a conventional smaller airplane several thousand feet up to the west-southwest of the object. I am a meteorologist and storm spotter so I am quite familiar with sky observation and explainable phenomena.  This was clearly an object under some form of intelligent control and not weather related.,2012-05-13T00:00:00,35.920853809523805,-79.09161714285715

I was getting ready to go to bed, and as I am an amateur astronomer part of my nightly ritual before I go to bed I look outside my bedroom window and give the skies a visual scan... I do this to see how the sky looks (if it's clear, what the stars look like, etc..)  My bedroom window looks out towards the Northern sky.  Not much of anything too exciting in that part of the sky, but as I looked out at the clear night sky I noticed something that resembled a bright ""star"" flickering/pulsing with many colors towards the North.  It was very bright and it was flickering/pulsing like crazy and changing colors... almost like when you look at a star through a telescope on a night where there is a lot of turbulence in the atmosphere. I immediately knew that this was NOT a star, as there are no stars that shine this brightly in this part of the Northern sky and it wasn't Jupiter or Venus which are at roughly in the West to NorthWestern part of the sky.  It was at about 45 to 50 degrees in elevation in relation to the horizon, and pretty far away.  It's hard to say how far, as it was dark, but if I had to guess I would say it was at least 4 or 5 miles away.  It was about as bright, or maybe slightly brighter, as Jupiter when it's high up in the sky at night, and gain it was flickering/pulsing in many brilliant colors (Red, Blue, Green, White, etc). I stood there at the window watching this strange ""star"" for a few seconds when all of a sudden it started moving to the right (towards the East) very quickly and stopped... and then went back towards the West and stopped.  As soon as I saw this I gasped loudly which startled my wife who was in a sound sleep and woke her up.  It's movement reminded me of a spinning top... in how it spins in place but all of a sudden will change directions... it's an abrupt but fluid movement.  At first I told myself may it was my imagination and it was like an optical illusion where I thought I was motionless while watching this ""star"" but my own slight movements made me think I was seeing movement... but then all of a sudden it went straight up a bit, like it gained altitude and quickly went back down.  At this point I was kind of freaked out!  So I asked my wife to come and look at this and tell me if I was just me imagining things... She came to the window and it was motionless for a few ! seconds agin and as she watched it, BOOM! It started to move quickly from East to West and then back from West to East again!  She gasped as well as she didn't expect it to move like this. I continued to watch this object as it seems be slowly flying away from us towards the North as it continues to make the abrupt but fluid (I know this is a strange way to describe, but it's the only way I can explain it) movements.  It was definitely NOT and airplane or a helicopter, or any sort of conventional aircraft... I am very familiar with aircraft and this object did not have standard navigational lighting like an aircraft would have.  And the abrupt/fluid movements it made cannot possibly be made by a conventional aircraft as we know it.  After watching it for about 5 minutes it got further away and lost it over the roofs of the houses behind my house and couldn't see it any longer. I do not know what this object was, but I can tell you with certainty (due to my many years of experience with the night sky/amateur astronomy and my knowledge of aircraft) that this was something extraordinary.  It wasn't a planet or star, it wasn't a satellite, and most definitely was not a conventional aircraft.  I have no idea what it could have been.  I would really be interested to find out if you received any other reports from New Jersey that corroborate my sighting. Thanks!",2012-05-13T00:00:00,40.6421,-74.82

Beneath the aircraft and to the right of it, below it, I witnessed an egg shaped orb hovering about mid-sky.  I went inside to retrieve my binoculars (10x50 5.5 degrees H-15) and I could plainly see two orbs.  One was black and the other was pink or salmon pink in color. The distance was est. 5 miles down range approx.. acute 45 degrees and maintaining position in mid heaven as we faced West. The black orb suddenly dropped near the ground, rose up and then moved rapidly out of view.  The pink orb or egg shaped ball remained in place.  I gave the binoculars to my wife and she watched for about a minute before the pink orb moved rapidly to the lower left of the lens view, and then wisped very quickly to the right of view (northward) and disappeared out of view over the horizon.  Moments later we both saw no less than five objects that appeared to ! be round balls of light.  These balls of light began making erratic movements apparently with no intention.  Several other translucent objects appeared during this time and had the appearance of round luminous plasma, were pinkish in color, and each one had a notch at one end of them.  They looked like a pie with a piece missing.  At times the larger objects would turn facing us and were at least as large as a quarter or a fifty cent piece by binocular view.  Very plain to see. During this time, there appeared to be a meteor storm (streaks in the sky, a sort of white vapor) except for the fact that the streaks moved or skipped vertically in the sky and seemed to defy physics.  After several hours of watching these orbs of light or saucers, moving all over the sky in different directions and formations, and at varied speeds, at about 1:50 pm. what looked like a plasma orb, translucent and pink in color,floating at high altitude and changing shape, began moving toward our house very slowly at about mid sky. Upon reaching a point about a mile(?) downrange and hovering at about 80 degrees overhead, the object suddenly accelerated and flew directly over our neighborhood at what looked to be about 2,000 feet up. Within 5 minutes we heard the sound of F-14's from the local air base firing up. Moments later Four F-14's took off in the same northward direction as the craft had. The events may not be related, but it did add a lot of suspense to the situation.  Observed this at about 3 pm An object, triangular in shape, inverting itself. Looked like red lava in the middle encased by pink triangle, pulsating. Moved slowly to the east, just overhead , then vanished.  After five hours of watching these objects they eventually thinned out to just two or three random sightings, and then just stopped showing up altogether at about 5 pm. This total display lasted 5 hours, from 12 pm. until 5 pm. We heard no sounds associated to these objects and did not meet any aliens, nor do i personally know any aliens.  This accounting is absolute truth as best as I can describe or understand it.",2012-05-13T00:00:00,33.65789817232376,-112.24664203655352

I immediately told the driver to look, but as he did, the road we were on dipped and the object disappeared beyond trees. It was pennant shaped (almost like a triangle, but with very acute, elongated sides)  Very large, and it appeared to almost be the same color of the sky/clouds, however, I could tell it was an actual object because even from the distance I could make out the solid sides to it.  It was as if it was sitting in the wispy clouds.  It had no lights, but did seem to ""blend"" into the sky, however, it had solid sides and was extremely large from my view point. It was almost as if it created a shadow in the sky around it. It did not move, but looked like it was stationary and just sitting there, not necessarily hovering.   As we kept driving, I was able to pick up on it again, but very slightly, since now we were on a very low road and could barely make it out behind trees. We went to eat, and took the same way home about an hour later, but it was gone by the time we got back to the original spot I first saw it.

I looked over at the passenger seat where I was trying to keep a flower arrangement steady and when I looked forward again, I notice in the upper left quadrant of my vision, a light suspended  across from and above the hospital (which is 8 stories tall) and at first I thought it might be a sodium lamp suspended from a crane atop a building.  Then it occurred to me that there were no other tall buildings in the area. I pulled to the side of the street in someone's driveway so I could let the traffic go around me while I observed the light.  I thought about using my Blackberry to photograph the light, but the Blackberry has terrible low light capabilities.  The light was now to my left and above, at about a 70 degree angle. I was trying to gage its motion to determine what t! he rate of speed might be.  Fort Lauderdale Airport is not far from this location and I thought this might be an aircraft.  However, the light was mor or less drifting and the speed would not have been enough to produce lift for even the smallest aircraft. Upon further observation the light was actually more like a torch, flame colored but fairly steady in intensity.  It did not flicker but the light had the quality of a flame.  I observed the light for about 2 minutes before it rose into the cloud cover and faded.

During the time we waited, we noticed two orange orbs in the night sky facing us that looked to be roughly 10 miles off toward downtown Indianapolis.  The orbs were initially horizontal to one another, and had a slight shimmer.  At first we thought these might be helicopters or a military operation but the orbs were not moving any closer. Rather as we continued observation for the next minute or so, we saw the orb on the right make a sudden dip to a vertical formation.  The orb on top did not change position.  The orb on the bottom switched back to the horizontal formation and the vertical a couple more times. These were fast sharp movements that did not resemble a helicopter.  The orb that moved started to get closed to the other orb and was started to move behind the other orb. At this point, our daughter signaled us and moved her car.  We pulled into the garage, all the while keeping an eye on the orbs until we crossed the threshold into the garage.

I know it was after the year 2003 and before the year 2008.  I was in the parking lot of the shopping mall at Ventura Blvd. and Topanga Canyon.  I was in my car in front of the then PetSmart.  My car was oriented towards the south so I was looking at the hills just south of Ventura Blvd. around Mulholland.  I saw what seemed to be a small black saucer shaped object rise up out of the neighborhood south of Ventura Blvd.  I couldn’t believe my eyes as I watched this object rise quickly into the sky.  I wanted to grab my cell phone and take a picture, but I didn’t want to take my eyes off the object for fear of losing it.  It was a bright blue skied afternoon with a few white fluffy clouds.  I watched intently and looked around a bit to see if anyone else was noticing and saw no one, just a parking a lot with cars.  I kept my eye on the object trying to figure out if it was a balloon or what.  It did not look like a balloon.  It quickly rose and then I could see it way up and glistening against a cloud.  The western sun must have caught it and it was shining now, not black.  That is it.  I have never even told any friends about this.  I don’t know what I saw, but it was surely strange and seemed to be what I have heard others describe. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As the lights got closer to us from  45deg angle to overhead they changed to amber and it appeared to grow in size. I could see the amber lights recesed into a round fixture and they were now about the size of a dime held at arms length.

We watched it until the trees blocked the view. It was silent, no humm no airplane. We did not speak for about a minute. Just awed at what we witnessed that night.

There were no ""beams"" with them.  There were about six of them, and they were each about a foot in diameter.  They weren't in a round formation, as you would expect from a searchlight.

The event was seeded in my mind because things happening around the time was a life changing exprence, as a close friend was terminaly ill and me and another friend was going to see him on what was his last time out with what we call over here, the lads.  The friend I was with at the time was first to notice the fireball his reaction was, (tell me I carnt see that) as I looked up I confirmed I could see what I he could see. We both stood there stareing at this thing for quite some time around 4-5 minites. A bright orange glow just hovering in the sky to us it looked to us about the size of a coin. I drive a truck at night and I am fimiliar with chinese laterns, metor falls and such so it was unusual. After the time lapsed it shot off from a hovering position to great speed to the east. My friend I was with at the time has a job high up in local government and I broke into conversation about the event only to be told abruptly,  I dont want to talk about it.  Some months later the same thing was caught on a mobile camera in the same town it was on the local news (Shirebrook ufo) and it could still be on youtube.  If  I could add a few other events around the same time the dates a fuzzy because I wittnessed two other events in the same time, a few months part.  Before the above I was coming home from the local pizza house around 5pm Febuary sunset and as per usual in England it was overcast grey skys I was looking up for some reason don’t know why but there was a break in the clouds in that break was what I can only describe as two missshapen Z very bright glowing pink hovering in a semetrical position I sat on a wall watched them till the clouds covered them, then went home. Never seen anything like it before or after. Could be explained by flares used by the millitary but I think not.  After the above in the summer I took out the binocillors to look at chem trails in the sky and seen a object with straight edges and ends, high up in the sky at what height Im unsure but I would suggest the same as a plane would travel 30,000ft but if that’s correct the object would have had great length but only the width of a 737 the length would have been x10 of a 737 after watching the object for some time quite some time because my arms started to ache I just shook my head and went in the house and told the wife. For that time in my life it just seemed the norm.  Saddly as I mentioned I drive a truck at night my window screen is 7.5ft in length about 4ft high Ive seen nothing in the last 4 years apart from metor showers and shooting stars, chinese laterns.  I am 53 years old next birthday and quite accomplished in life own properites and comfortable with all aspects of it, My explanation for these events is the state of mind I was researching most of what Alex Jones talks about on his show and it took me down a rabbit hole and to topics which ranges from ancient civilations to secret societies and much more, all I craved for was knowledge I felt enlightened and wanted more like a drug addict would want there next fix. Sceptics would argue that yes it was my state of mind, a over active imagination but saddly its not, I want to be a sceptic but I can not.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,,

UFO Report  First of all, I would like to state that I have been infatuated with the skies since my earliest memories. I am intelligent enough to differentiate between all standard aircraft (i.e. commercial jets, helicopters, Cessna’s), satellites, and explainable natural phenomena (i.e. meteor showers). The reason I am writing this report at this time is because I listen to the radio show “Coast to Coast AM” with George Noory. Mr. Peter Davenport was a guest on the late evening of June 20th 2012. He stated to a caller during the show that it was his Christmas wish that everyone with a legitimate story turn in a report regardless of when it happened. On a warm evening approximately four years ago my friend, girlfriend, and I were in my backyard enjoying the evening and talking. I noticed and pointed out a solid red light that I determined was moving abnormally fast for any standard aircraft that I have witnessed. As soon as both my friend and girlfriend both noticed the object that I was pointing out, the object instantly switched trajectory from a “southeast to northwest” line of flight to a vertical ascension which was very quick. When this happened everybody cried out “whoaaaa” because it was so startling. All of a sudden the light came to a complete stop in its ascension. We all confirmed with each other that we were witnessing the same thing.  As one could imagine we were very excited! The object started a violently fast descension straight toward the ground and disappeared well before it would have impacted the ground.

On this night I noticed the craft moving at a very common speed in comparison to Earth aircraft. This craft was triangle in shape.  This object had absolutely no sound and was moving in one direction from North-west direction to a South-East direction. This object was at a height of a private passenger plane. It was so apparent in the sky in contrast to the background of the night that my girlfriend had no problem recognizing the craft immediately when I pointed out to her. The glow on the bottom side of the craft had what I would only describe as a “dusk” orange on the bottom side of the craft. The shape can best described as a stealth bomber.

He has regretted not having reported the sighting previously and I wanted to make sure that the event was recorded on his behalf.  He says that his biggest regret to this day is that he wishes that he had yelled out so that all of the teachers and kids on the field could have seen it.   However, he was afraid that he would have gotten in trouble for calling out at the time. Fishburne Military School is located in the Shenandoah valley of Virginia, within the city limits of Waynesborough.   Text of Report: ""While on the drill field during my junior year, I noticed a silver (metallic) saucer-shaped craft flying from just outside the city limits to DuPont which it circled at least two times at a very slow rate of speed (about the speed of a Piper Cub - which is what I thought it was at first).  It was at low altitude (about half the elevation of the mountains that surround town) which I would estimate to be 2000 feet or so.  We were approximately 1/2 mile from the object at the closest point and we heard no sound from the object.   After circling DuPont twice the saucer turned on it side at a 90 degree angle and shot over the mountain at a tremendous speed.  It left so quickly that all we saw was a flash.   I had whispered to the other members of my squad which contained 9 members, and I believe most, if not all of them witnessed the ufo."" ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the gentleman who witnessed the object, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and sincere in his description of the event.  His recollection of the circumstances of the sighting seemed to us to be crystal clear.  We believe that the witness is an exceptionally qualified observer.  PD))",,,

It was dusk but enough light in the western sky to see the profile of the Olympic mountain range.  I was in my back yard which faced west. Most of the sky was dark, the weather was clear as it often is in the Northwest this time of the year. A light suddenly appeared to drop out of the southeastern sky.  It seemed to be more intense than the brighest star.  The light arched down toward the horizon in the southern sky travelled west, then toward the northwest as it stayed low (about 15deg above the horizion).  It then passed behind a local  batch of fir trees, about 6 blocks away.  It came into view again from behind the trees at the same altitude and then it passed over the local hills (Cougar Mt & the hills above Eastgate) eventually moving towards the city of Seattle, passing under or  level with a rising full moon.  The intensity did not seen to change as it moved further away.  It seemed to turn slightly north and finally disappeared from my sight behind local terrain to the northwest of me.  No object was seen, just the light, which was very bright and white, with a very constant intensity.  There were no green or red colors assiciated with it.  It appeared to move much faster than any airplane and there was absolutly no sound.  Any jet powered airplane could have been easily heard as the evening was quiet and the object appeared to be within a mile or two at the nearest part of its flight path.  It moved at quite a high speed and it covered at least 25 to 40 miles inside of one minute.  The light was not a reflection off the object, the object was definately the source.

I was 6 yrs. old. It was the frist time my mother let me go anywhere without her there, but was ok because my brother and sister was there to watch me.  We were on the beach , on the point between Penetang and Midland. Right on the water.  We had a fire on that beach that was quit large. The boys all had to go to the washroom , so we walked away from the fire , along the beach to where it was dark and the girls could not see.  We were all doing our thing and one of the older boys said whats that and pointed to the sky.  There was a light coming across the sky from Penatang across over to Port Mcnickel.  My brother said I guess thats sputnic.  For thats the only thing up there. Well all the boys finished what thay were doing and went back to the girls, for thats were they wanted to be. I was 6 yrs. old and afraid of the dark but I did not care.  This light so cought me in a way I was fixaitted. I wondered if there was a neither one so I looked along the line were I t! hought it came from . I saw nothing.  I started to scan the skys. I saw the same light come down from outer space then turn to a lateral line. to follow the frist one.I could still see the frist one.  At this point I did not realize the inportance of this. Kids are cureyiss and I looked for anouther one.  Wow , there was anouther one and anouther one.  Four in total.  They were equely spaced apart, almost like they were atached but they were to far apart for that . They got to a point were they  floated over snake island and at that point they were at the closeset point to me.  I could see clearly.  My vison was perfit, the night was without clouds, and they were kinda close. They looked disc shaped. Now this is when the last one slowed from the rest. Almost to a stop. I felt a , I want to say pressure, but could not smell or see anything. There was somthing hitting me .This lasted for about 5 seconds then stopped. I felt when it stopped. Then the craft cought up to the rest and went over the horison and out of sight. After I could not see them anymore I realized I was all alone in the dark and ran back to the fire and my family. My brother pulled his attention away from the girls enough to ask me how many light I saw, because he new were I was and what I was doing. I told him I saw 4 lights. I later in life figured out that they must have painted me with somthing so they could find me again. And they did. This was the frist event that I had. Did not know enough to make inportance of this . Being a little boy new to life I thought that this was normal and not much was said or asked of it  ever again . But I remembered every detail for the rest of my life. I was not ! afraid at all. In retrospect, I think that these beings look for anything different and investagate that. I just want to say that wile I was watching this it all gave me the inpression that thay felt that they were now home and could finly relaxe. My brother is now deceast along with his freinds.

I am writing this report because what I saw needs to be documented.  I have recounted the event to several people in casual setting without any sufficient explanation. I was unaware of such a place that I could record what I saw, that’s why I have never formally submitted what I saw. In 2007 I lived in Southern California in a town called Irvine. It’s a crowded city with lots of modern city development and is a “well off” expensive place to live. I was separated from my significant other and spent a lot of time waiting to pick up my daughter from her mother’s house so I would hang around different places until we could meet for me to pick her up. It was while waiting for my daughter one evening at a local park that I saw this UFO. Irvine has a park called “Colonel Bill Barber” park that is very well kept and has beautiful walking paths, tennis courts, and softball fields and playgrounds. I was walking between 9:00 and 10: PM at night in the summer time at a location on the walking path that was elevated 30 feet above the rest of the park. The walking path comes to a memorial on a hill where commemorative placards and a U.S. flag are displayed. From this point you can look out over the north side of the park with tennis courts to the right. The hill was not so high as to be able to see over the privacy netting of the tennis courts. While standing on this hill and facing north my attention was drawn to something out of the corner of my right eye. This area is well lit with amber colored lights on the parking lot and bright lights on the tennis courts. Some distance south of the tennis courts but within the boundary of the park two yellow orbs rotating in a counter clock wise rotation (as on the face of a clock) caught my eye. I stared at them in amazement and disbelief. They rotated keeping seemingly equal spacing from each other and constant rotational speed as these two yellow orbs moved from my right to left across in front and just above where I was standing. They gradually accelerated from the point where I first noticed them to the point just in front and to the left of me where they began to climb in altitude and vanish. The total distance the orbs traveled while I could see them was around 300ft and less than 100ft off the ground. I was feeling like I had just witnessed two spirits at play maybe! fascinated with the movements of the tennis ball at night? The orbs were moving with machine like precision so I also wondered if I had witnessed some type of energy from an engine source on some type of space craft. I also tried to reason if I was hallucinating?  There was no sound that I could remember other than the sound of tennis racquets striking tennis balls and the noise of cars and traffic on the nearby roads. I believe in extra terrestrial life. What I saw was unlike anything I have ever heard anyone describe except for sightings of colored orbs that have random movements.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,33.68653500837521,-117.79240477386935

To begin, this area had been visited, by UFOs, a few times prior to my eye witness account. A group of high school friends and myself had planned a “jam” at one of the musicians house, about 7 miles from the city of Bedford, VA.  He had been working on his house for a few years, and was ready to break it in with a full-on jam.  We were told, by the owner, that he recently saw a strange light near the top of the mountain, in a small clearing near the top.  (There are no roads that anyone could drive to reach this location).  He also had seen a UFO at the base of the mountain, on the road that leads to his driveway, in a large pasture, maybe only 100 yards away, but didn’t like telling people about the experience. As we drove up his mostly rocky driveway, and I saw a light where he had been telling us about.  We didn’t really say anything, just unloaded our equipment, set up, and began to play some music.  Maybe 30-40 minutes passed and the power went off in the whole house, right in the middle of a song. We froze and didn’t make a sound.  It was pitch dark in the room.  The owner scrambled and found a flashlight so we could see and set our instruments down, then he just yelled out, “we have to go now”!   I noticed he was holding a shotgun.  We starting running to the cars, but all of us jumped in one vehicle.  I was shoved in the back seat in the middle so I missed the fly-over. Now, this is the part where everyone was in survival mode and frantic at the same time. I am usually the driver in all situations, because I like being in charge, but not this time.  The next memory I have is being back in Lynchburg, and getting dropped off at my parents house.  That’s it! No memory of the ride, nothing.  I have a great visual memory when it comes to driving. The event only lasted a few minutes. Recently, this year, 2012, I confronted two of my friends that were there, and the stories are a little different.  One friend that I still play music with, did see the fly-over, but not I.  One other person, the owner, remembers nothing now of the event but still remembers the other times he has seen lights on the mountain, and flying around the mountain making no sound.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,37.3211,-79.5274

At around 3:00 am at  XXXXX SW 39th Terrace, Miami, Florida 33175.    On November 16th 1975, I was awake and looking out the window in my bedroom at the sky.   As I was scanning, and looking for different stars, I saw about 12 lights moving around each other.  Then the lights grouped into pairs of two, and went into different directions.  Two of the lights began to fly into the direction of my area, and then they began to come down and as they descended the light they emitted changed color.  As near as I can remember, they started out as white light, then red, then orange, then yellow, then blue. I lost site of one of them, but one came over the yard in back of my house, between my house and the neighbor’s house.  The light was very blue and everything seemed bathed in that light. It was a craft that was mostly teardrop shaped. It had lights in the front and on top and it kept dipping slightly in the front, as it hovered there.  There was a sound, but I cannot explain it.  I have never heard it before or since.

My Mother had turned on the radio and we heard the news man tell about a police officer in Dade land who reported a UFO. I have never spoken of this to anyone else, and was afraid to report it.  I did not want to look crazy.  I have never forgotten it though, and lately saw footage of similar lights on a tv show.  It prompted me, and I have now made a report of my incident.

During the summer of 1996 or 1997, I was stargazing in Las Cruces, New Mexico and about 25 yards away from my house a red dot the size of a large star materialized from out of nowhere (in front of the Las Cruces Sun News building) and grew to approximately 8 inches in diameter.  The red plasma-like ball immediately approached me by bouncing up and down towards me in a zig zag motion.  It hovered in front of our tree, maybe 8 to 12 feet above ground, and was completely silent.   I stood up and watched it as it hovered, and yelled for my mom who was in the house (the front door was wide open).  I initially felt calm, but the more I processed the event the more I felt scared and started to panic.  As soon as my mom came outside and I ran inside the house because I was too scared to stay outside(I was a teenager at the time).   After about two minutes, I went back outside to see if it was still there and then watched it bounce away in the same way it approached our house.   It then faded away by gradually getting smaller and disappearing (it didn't fly away, it just disappeared/faded into the blackness of the night).   Although I was not college educated then, I am now, and have never seen anything like it since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",2012-11-19T00:00:00,32.32767214076246,-106.75489560117302

We parked at the baseball field and watched the light amazed at it.  The mountain it was above it is impossible to go up it without being on an 4-wheeler.  We watched the light and it started to move and change colors, it changed blue, green, orange, yellow, purple and white and every color in between.  All of a sudden it zipped towards us and vanished. 2 days later I was on my way back from the hospital and I took the same road to get home and I saw a light on the mountain, and it was changing colors just like it was the few nights before. About a week later on the other mountain that intersects with the mountain in which the original light was see it looked as if there was spot lights shining up in the sky.

On that day we were coming home around 7.00 p.m. and on top of the mountain we saw a red light moving here and there.  So we stopped and watched it for a while.  I was with my parents and brother, and we called my grandparents and aunt also.  That light became yellow, green, blue and orange time to time. it went up into the sky so fast and came back.  This happend several times and we went inside after watching this for about 1/2 an hour. The next day morning my brother was watching the mountain since it was school holidays, and he shouted aroung 9.00 a.m. in the morning.  We ran there and we saw 5 strange creatures moving on top of the mountain. We have seen people there earlier as tiny dots but these creatures were about 8-12 feet tall. Since we have been there earlier we compared them with the trees there.  We couldn't see their faces clearly but they were not human for sure.  They were much more taller than humans. After about 20-30 minutes they went around the mountain which is impossible for humans because that part of the mountain has only huge rocks.  According to our knowledge there was only one way to climb that mountain. This mountain is visible to everyone because it was the biggest mountain in Gampola.

There is a patch of woods behind the restaurant about 100 feet across the rear parking lot that goes back about 75-100 feet to houses and apartments. I started to hear a strange buzzing and brought it to my friends attention, we then saw 3 dim lights that appeared to be attached to an object  starting from top left in a diagonal line to bottom right and moved from left to right.  The bottom of the object was about 4 feet above the ground and the top of it was about 12-15 feet above the ground.  It looked as though it were ghosting through the trees as it was in the thick of them about 20 feet from the edge of the parking lot.  We stood dumbfounded as it moved through the woods until it disappeared and the thick fog with it.  I w! as excited and said ""holy &@!? Did you guys see that?  It was a UFO!"" 4 of the group were speechless but the looks on their faces said i was crazy and the 2 others who were preparing to enter the marines laughed and agreed that it was a helicopter.  The topic was quickly dropped and they resumed having fun.  I am convinced to this day it was not a helicopter as at that distance it would have been very loud and it was about as loud as the traffic going by on the road in front of the restaurant and a helicopter can't fly in the woods below the tree line.  Also the fact that it stopped us dead in the middle of what we were doing to stand still and silent as we watched.

As the object moved it suddenly faded out to one fifteenth its starting brightness and then disappeared slightly right of the constellation Scorpius.   The second object did almost the exact same thing, appearing around Scorpius, bright and pulsing, then faded out in almost the exact location of the first object.  Both objects seemed very far away from Earth, and also seemed to move very slowly.   We had very good visibility at the whole sky because there isn't much in the way of lights out on the back road areas of Stonington.

Me and my son in law went outside to sit on our back deck when we noticed a strange red glowing infrared light coming from the back of my woods.  We stared at it for about 15 seconds trying to figure out what it was since we have no homes behind our little bit of woods.  All that’s behind them is a field of power lines that run for miles.  We were thinking maybe its an animal of some sort looking at us when all of the sudden we hear a very strange but loud noise coming from that area. We instantly in fear ran in the house.  The first thing I did was run to get my  flash light to shine in the back of my yard. It took me several seconds to grab it and go back outside.  As I shined it to the area where the light and noise was coming from.  We didn’t see anything so I figured what I saw needed no flashlight so I turned it off in hopes we could see the light when all of the sudden right behind the trees we were facing we saw these intense lights radiating through our tops of the tree line coming into a visible view for us to see.  It was a small craft with very bright red a white lights flashing around it in a circular motion.  This object was laying low right along our tree and power lines as it moved off out of our sight. There was no noise at all coming from it.  It just flew away in a sort of slow quiet motion.  It was flying so low that it could stay below the tree tops in the field we were facing where our view was limited.   As soon as it was out of our sight we ran down the road to look down the field in hopes we could still see it but it was gone. There was no time at all to even catch it on camera..  We were not expecting to see this since we originally thought it was something else in the woods and couldn’t believe my eyes. I’m 100% confident that I saw a UFO. The next day we went out to the area where we saw this strange light coming from and there is an imprint in the tall grass.  The grass is smashed down as if something was presse! d on it. This confirmed to me that what we saw in the sky was ! first si tting in my yard.  I’m frightened by this  and never in my life experienced anything like this.  I feel I needed to report this bizarre incident in fear this craft could come back.  Why was it in my back yard?  Creepy!,2012-08-05T00:00:00,41.7932,-81.0578

Three smaller lights made an inverted triangle starting from the center of the object, descending. Smaller lights flashed Blue to Red.  The Object did not move for twenty minutes, used tree line, large pine and water tower as sight guides.  Object would waver towards the last 10 minutes, not sure if it was actually moving of eye fatigue.  To the right of the object was a smaller light, flashing red.  This object did move. Shot a 10 minute HD film. Both objects did not show up well on HD film -- propped the camera up on my sill.  Will be getting a tripod for the SLR/HD and trying again.

They were like all in a line traveling the same direction.  They appeared to be coming from the southwest traveling north.  I thought that we were being attacked or something because they kind of looked like missels traveling through the sky.  All of a sudden they all disappeared in the same spot.  We don’t know if they went behind clouds or just disappeared.  I am 53 years old and I have never seen anything like this before.   We were all startled and after they were gone I went inside and called the news station and asked them if there had been any other reports and they said no at least not yet.  I also tried several times to call the air traffic control to see if they picked up anything on their radar but they never answered the phone.   My neighbors son also took pictures of the event with his cell phone and has them posted on Facebook.  When he enlarges the photos they look like a red slender fiery object.

Soon after we realized the entire sky full of light as we thought they were just stars starting moving pretty quickly across the sky as we were all in disbelief. We would say there was about 40 to 50 of the lights in the sky moving in a formation.   I tired to take pictures and a video but it was too faint and was not able to get anything worth anything.  After about 4 to 5 minutes we could not see the lights. It was amazing none of us have ever seen of heard of anything like this.

The sun was almost finished setting, and the sky was mostly clear. As I was looking up into the sky, which I regularly do when dog-walking, I noticed a ""star"" that was as bright as Venus, but in a different location. Venus, at that time of night, is almost directly due East. This ""light"" was on a south-southwest path in the sky...looking up, it was also about 70-75 degrees above the horizon. At first I thought it was coming towards me, and that the ""big light"" was the headlights of a jet.  Then I realized that it was going AWAY from me, and that the quality of the light coming from it was different to that of a jet headlight...more like it was lit from within.  With this understanding, the dog and I stopped in our front yard...I watched. As I looked on, the ""light object"" dimmed a bit, then, SPLIT INTO 3 separate smaller objects. Each one, though not as bright as the original, was also a ""ball of light."" As soon as they were clearly separated from one another, they took off in 3 different directions...1 took a more southerly route, 1 went straight forward for a second then shot straight UP, and the third one banked sharply to the right (my right) and headed on a north-northwest trajectory.  The time that elapsed between separation and all 3 being no longer visible was about 15-20 seconds.

Approximately 10:00 PM on November 23, 2012 in Warwick, NY. I went outside to get something from my car.  I looked up at the sky and noticed that it was very clear and there were a lot of stars.  I was in the driveway facing the east, looking up at the area of the sky not too far above the horizon.  My eyes scanned over two bright stars and I noticed 4 small white lights-like a dim cluster- between the stars.  I scanned over it quickly and in the split seconds after my eyes passed over the 4 small lights it registered in my mind that the cluster appeared to be moving and that it must be a plane since I was looking towards New York City and there was always air traffic above Warwick(I don't live there, I was visiting there).  Those thoughts took place in about 1 or 2 seconds as I returned my focus to the 4 lights.  The lights were moving in unison as part of a single object. Initially they appeared to be a square but they rotated slightly as they moved over my head across the sky so as to look more like a diamond shape. At the moment I focused my eyes on the lights they moved quickly, ‘out’ from between the two bright stars-headed west, directly over my head at such an astonishing speed and in a way that reminded me of a water bug sliding/skimming across water.  The 4 lights increased their speed as they sped up across the sky and moved mostly in a straight line but ‘slid’ a bit off the straight line course so there were slight curves in its course and that is what made me think of a water bug.  As it moved it dawned on me that no aircraft I know of could accelerate with such speed and at the point I was thinking that, it accelerated more and simply disappeared-blip, gone!  That entire sighting lasted no more than 10 or 15 seconds from the point when I looked up, noticed the moving lights and then watched them zip over my head and vanish.  My eyes were trained on them the whole time they moved and my head followed them easily as they went overhead.  The lights moved in unison and fluidly, like it was sliding rather than flying.  I also had the sense that the thing ‘reacted’ to me seeing it, like it had been 'spotted,"" largely because it happened so fast and it zipped away the moment that I focused my eyes on it. It happened so fast and I stood out there for a few minutes considering what just happened and wondering if my eyes had played a trick on me. I focused on other objects to see if anything atmospheric (cold night air on my eyeballs making them water?) might make them ‘appear’ to move.  It did not happen with any other object. I looked around for other moving objects and I saw a jet and noticed that its lights were not at all like what I had seen.  I went inside and told my family and then went on-line to investigate what the stars were where I first noticed the object.  They were two bright stars that make up the center portion of Orion.",2012-12-20T00:00:00,41.2639,-74.3634

Thursday, 11/23/2012 05:00pm Around a quarter to five in the evening I went out to feed my horse.  After feeding her I walked over to her water trough to clean out the debris.  I’m hearing a lot of birds chirping overhead so I look up and notice a very long fairly thick flock of birds flying from the NE to west, south. Very big long line, I keep looking straight up to see what kind of birds they were. Looked like a couple different small species.  I kept watching for what seemed like around 10 minutes.  The end of the flock was flying further to the north curving south.  That is when I saw the craft. Much larger than the birds, it was cylindrical, about 3 times larger around and a little bit longer than a large jet at a similar altitude.  I noticed that there was a lack of a wing profile, that’s when it got more of my attention. It was moving slightly faster than a large jet at a similar altitude.  I noticed a lack of any contrail, no signs of exhaust or smoke and no sound.   Then it started to shimmer, (the sh! immer seemed to be divided down the center by a dark equal sized line), under the whole vehicle sort of like a sun reflection but most definitely a glowing shimmering red, orange light. Then I heard a deep quick thud, almost a pop, and it was gone. The impression I got was that it cloaked. The last part was like watching special effects in a movie.

The size from my perspective looked like it was about the size of car. The speed that it moved at was faster than any plane or helicopter that we have around here. It’s a rural community and although we have an airport there isn’t that much traffic and the light was moving horizontally, and if it was a plane it would have ! been moving vertically (over my house) because the airport is on the other side of town behind my house. So it wasn’t a plane. I went outside to see if I could see the path that it followed but it was gone, it’s trajectory was an upward angle so it would be odd if was a meteor.

There is a municipal airport on the north side of the city, so low-flying small aircraft are a very common sight.  If the light had been white, I wouldn't have given it a second look, assuming that it was just a small plane that had taken off from the airfield. Although its color seemed unusual, it behaved like other low-flying aircraft I've seen at night, proceeding in a steady, straight line, moving north to south, right over the neighborhood I was passing through.  I stopped running and watched it, expecting to see wing lights blinking, that the orange light was just so much brighter that it obscured them.  Although the orange light seemed to very slightly pulse a few times, there were no other colored lights, nothing blinking. I watched it silently pass overhead, turning myself around to face south, until it was obscured by nearby trees.  The entire 'sighting"" lasted approximately one minute.  I continued on my run. Less than 5 minutes later, as I still ran north, I saw another bright orange light, again coming from the north and moving south!  I stopped immediately to watch it, and it looked and behaved almost exactly as the first one I'd seen.  It also seemed as though it could've been a low-flying, single-engine airplane with orange headlights on.  It seemed to follow the exact same path as the first light, and also made no sound whatsoever. The only difference this time was that, when it was directly overhead, the strength of the light started fading.  It dimmed very rapidly as it continued to move until I could no longer see it.  It reminded me of watching a satellite passing overhead on a clear night, as it moves in a perfectly straight line, and then slowly gets dimmer and dimmer until it is no longer visible.  Maybe the first light also did this, but I could not see it because of the trees. It was a beautiful chilly night, with little to no breeze, and a crystal clear, cloudless sky full of stars: a perfect night for a run, and it turned out to be a very memorable run!",2012-09-24T00:00:00,44.54856202531645,-89.52476202531645

It was a quiet and clear night and these craft were silent making no engine noise. Had this been a plane or helicopter at that altitude they would have been close enough to hear engine or propeller noise. I stopped to watch because it was strange how they were staying in place. I watched for about a minute when the object on the right began moving down and to the right of the other objects.  It moved a good distance away before it came to a stop and hovered in that spot.  They other two objects stayed in the same general location but would move around each other always keeping the same distance apart from one another.

I am not absolutely certain of the date in which I experienced this sighting. Although I do know for certain that it occurred in the summer of 2009. The following is absolute fact, and has convinced me that we are not alone in the universe. 	While driving westbound on Illinois Route 148 from Mt. Vernon, Illinois; about two miles before reaching Waltonville, an inner voice spoke to me. “Look up if you want to see us,” crossed my mind. An unseen female voice was speaking within my male body, and seemed to not be coming from my own mind. I immediately leaned over the steering wheel, looking upward through the windshield. Seeing nothing unusual I thought to myself,”I don’t see anything.” Immediately a response came from that internal female voice,”Keep looking.” I again focused harder on the same area of sky and I could barely make out a large grouping of silver, circular shaped objects flying at high altitude. 	Upon seeing the objects I pulled the vehicle over to the shoulder of the highway, in order to more safely view the objects. I would estimate the objects’ altitude at approximately 40,000 feet. The altitude was of the height that if it were any greater, the objects would have been undetectable by the naked eye. They seemed to be flying in a group; some coming together into small groupings and flying around each other. I watched for a minute or so and they drifted out of view. What I saw could not have been balloons, because balloons don’t speak to people telepathically.

Soon, the light turned in direction and sped away very quickly, continuing to dim untill the object was unseeable.  After the profound incident, we were buzzing. We layed on the beach and stared at the sky. My wife and I felt very serene, but we felt as if energy was pulsing between us as we layed in the sand holding hands. Eventually, she dosed off to sleep.  What happed next will leave an idellable impression on me.  I stared directly ahead of me at a small patch of clouds blocking the stars when suddenly a craft shook into view in front of the cloud (or it came out of them). But the ship actually shook vilently side to side for about a second untill my eyes could focus on it. Then it decended somewhat quickly and directly towards me (I was so captivated I hardly tried to wake my wife).  The craft was more arrowhead shaped than triangle. It was solid and contained three unblinking red lights (one in each corner) and a single, slightly larger white light in the very center. It made absolutely no sound.  The craft slowed more as it approached the beach and it flew directly overhead of us. The scale was hard to judge, but it encompassed my whole view as i looked directly above me. It seemed to be either the size of a large passenger jet (in length) at about two hundred feet or possibly very large at an unkown altitude.  The craft continued in-land at an increadibly slow pace, and i watched it as it passed over the beach houses and continued out of the line of sight. (Being away from the resorts made altitude estimation difficult)  I regret not reporting this earlier, but the details are so vivid to me, I think about the incident often. I have no fear attached to the incident, strictly awe and wonder. Plus, I wish to contribute to the collective knowledge of the topic.

Pleasant, SC Shape: Disk Duration:45 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/090/S90264.html,"3-4 disk shaped craft, pale lit, moving slowly and silently at low altitude in nearly a straight line. At some time between about 21:30 and 23:00, August 19, 2009 in Mount Pleasant, SC, I was standing alone on a third story deck/porch, smoking a cigarette.  I was facing roughly southeast, toward the Atlantic Ocean, which was approximately 5-6 miles away. At first I saw some faint movement ahead of me in the sky that caught my eye.  They appeared to be a few different objects, at about a one o'clock position in the sky from my point of view.  At first I thought it was a flock of large white birds (egrets or heron, I thought) illuminated by street lights from the ground because they didn't appear to be self illuminated, nor bright, for that matter.  It was not uncommon to see either species flying at night, but what occurred to me was that I'd never seen them fly in flocks together, so I kept watching to figure out what they were. They were moving in what appeared to be a straight line and as they got closer, I realized the motion they made was sporadic, not like the motion of birds flapping their wings in a somewhat rhythmic pattern.  I realized they weren't birds at this point, but I still couldn't make out exactly what they were.  As they got closer, I realized that they were definitely not birds or any common man made aircraft.  They were moving slowly toward me, travelling in a straight line from approximately south to north.  I realized when they got close enough, that there were three disk-shaped craft, travelling at what appeared to be a low altitude and they were completely silent.  That fact probably made the biggest impression on me, that they made no noise whatsoever.  And the fact that they appeared to be flying at a low altitude suggested they weren't very large craft at all.  They were flying close to each other but not in a uniform formation like military aircraft do. In fact, their posit! ion relative to each other changed slightly from the time I first noticed them to the last glimpse I got of them.  They were illuminated on the bottom by a very pale bluish white light, not very bright at all, which appeared to come from within the craft themselves.  This was the only illumination coming from the craft (on the bottoms), there were no lights on top, so that they almost appeared to be flat.  The illumination didn't light up the entire bottom of each craft at once either, but sort of danced around slowly and in a seemingly random way around the bottom surface of each one, lighting only portions of the bottom surface of each craft at a time.  The only reason I could tell they were a disk shape was when the illumination would reach the edge of the craft, I could see a distinctly circular shaped edge.  When the areas on the bottom of the craft weren't lit, I couldn't really see anything at all, because the unlit areas of the objects and the sky were both very dark. They continued roughly in my direction, then were obstructed for a few seconds by a pine tree, then passed overhead to my left, in an unobstructed area between the tree branches and the side of the building I was standing in for about another two or three seconds (I realized there were four craft at this point) and they passed beyond the roof and were no longer visible.  I'd gotten a good enough look at them to determine that they simply could not have been anything other than UFOs, at least nothing that I know of.  I'd never seen anything like that before or since.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,,

On March 3, 2010, at approximately 7:40 pm, I stepped out on the patio to have a cigarette. I was facing south when I stepped through the door and turned to the east to reach for the pack of cigarettes setting on the table. As I was lighting the cigarette I noticed a light in the sky, about a mile away and about a 1,000 feet in the air.  At first glimpse, I thought it was an airplane headed for Sky Harbor, which is about 20 miles to the west of us. My first thought was that it was coming in awfully low. Then a second light appeared and I wondered where this second plane had come from. I had not seen it approach. A moment later, it occurred to me that they were not planes, the color of the lights was wrong. Instead of being white, they were a soft yellowish amber, similar to the street lights around us ( the street lights were not on at this time).  By the time this thought cleared my mind a third light appeared. Then a forth and a fifth. Though they were aligned in a line, it was not a straight line.  Astounded by what I was seeing, I called my daughter-in-law outside to take a look. That is when the lights began to disappear, first one, then the other four according to the order in which they appeared. They did not fade or twinkle out, they simple were gone, as though someone had flipped a light switch.  My daughter-in-law and I watched this sequence of lights appearing and disappearing four more times. So I cannot say if we saw 5 or 25 lights. But I can say that they were individual. They were not connected to each other or a craft of some sort. The sky was clear and still light enough that we could see that there was nothing else in the sky. No planes, helicopters, or any other air craft. There were no kites or balloons either. And I can say without doubt that they were not flares being dropped as there was nothing there to drop them. Just as they were not fireworks being shot off from the ground. There were no tell tale trails of smoke. And there was no sound.  The whole incident took less than a minute, so even if I had the presence of mind to grab a camera, there was no time to take pictures. I immediately reported the event to MUFON. Two hours later a black helicopter appeared flying about half a mile south of us. It flew in from the west (from Luke perhaps) then came north to circle the EXACT spot the lights had appeared in before it flew off to the south.  I learned later from MUFON that these lights were seen 30 miles southeast of us only five minutes after we witnessed them.  I know these lights were not nuts and bolts objects. In fact, I got the distinct impress while watching these lights that they were alive and popping in and out of our dimension. My personal belief is that they were not ETs but Angels.  As I stated before, I did report this event to MUFON. But when I heard you speak on Coast to Coast I thought you should be aware of my sighting as well. And too, I am interested in hearing what you think I saw.   Thank you.",2012-07-04T00:00:00,33.42126454293629,-111.772797322253

Just then i'd called out to a friend of my .  Who was inside my house to come check this out .

This event happened July 4th, 2011, after sunset.  Although, I’m unsure of the exact time, it was around 10:15 PM CDT.  There was still plenty of light in the North Dakota evening sky. The sky was still blue and there was some scattered stratus clouds at an estimated 20,000-25,000 feet to my SE. The clouds were normal white with grey shadowed areas.  The visibility was unlimited. The temperature was around 75 F and the wind was light.   I hold a commercial pilots license and a BA. My state of mind was good; I was alert, well rested and completely sober. I was wearing my glasses which bring my vision to 20/15 – 20/10.  I have a small loss of hearing at 50Hz left ear. I was standing on my driveway looking to the north at a few fireworks going off in the valley.  I noticed a reddish/orange glowing orb appearing to rise into the sky at about the same area of the fireworks.  At first I thought it was part of the display and continued to watch expecting a firework burst.  The object continued in my direction getting brighter and moving horizontal rather than vertical. It had been coming from the same direction as Minot Air Force Base.  I concluded that it was traveling from the horizon rather than ascending vertically as I first thought.  It was not Fireworks. I kept my eyes fixed on the object as it almost passed over my house and a little to the east.  It was solid flaming orange with a slight elongated oval, and very bright, much, much brighter than ISS and moving much faster than an airliner at altitude.  It was traveling to the SSE at 160 to 170 degrees. It was close enough to hear any noise created by jet engines or sonic booms but it was completely silent.  I kept on watching it as it moved through the cloud deck and into blue sky.  It seemed to accelerate as it moved further southeast and I estimated it was at 20,000 to 25,000 feet and well above Mach 1. It disappeared into the clouds further south.  It didn’t leave any condensation trails and moved in a straight line.  I want to emphasize that the object was extremely fast moving and was silent. I’ve witnessed SR-71s making high speed passes and a Space shuttle launch along with B2 fly over’s and myriads of other military aircraft in-flight along with other celestial events.!  This thing topped them all.  Spooky stuff for sure. About 10-20 minutes later I saw another orange object almost due north. It appeared to be climbing to the NW at a steep rate of climb. It was smaller in size but orange like the other one. I could not determine its distance but, Runway 29 at the M.A.F.B. would be on that heading. I ran inside my house to get my camera and field glasses and when I returned 30 seconds later it was gone. Earlier that year in March I was outside on my driveway in the middle of the night (3 AM) getting some fresh air.  I looked to the east and saw a solid orange object in the sky moving at about the speed of a small 4 seat airplane. It seemed to be just lumbering along and I watched for awhile thinking this was the atmosphere playing tricks on me because of its solid bright orange appearance. Later, I looked on-line to see if it was the space station and found out it wasn’t ISS or any other satellite or orbiting debris.",2012-11-19T00:00:00,48.188894318181816,-101.33489034090908

It was a little after 12 midnight and I was driving home from a friend’s house.   My friend was fast asleep in the passenger seat and I was about 10 minutes away from being in the downtown area of Belchertown where I lived.  We were driving along, I had the radio on listening to some music and I was still very much awake, even after a long day.   All of a sudden, on the passenger side of my car, the woods light up like a football stadium.  The light was a bright harsh light beaming through the trees in all direction, but not above the tree tops.  The next thing I know my car went dead.   All the lights in the dashboard, headlights, radio, GPS, engine everything.  It almost seemed like my car had a catastrophic failure.  My friend abruptly woke up and asked “What ((deleted)) just happened?”  I said I don’t know man there’s something going on in the woods.  I thought it was the military or something at first but it all seemed like something out of a Sci-Fi movie.   I was travelling the speed limit, which I do believe is 50 MPH on that stretch of road.  I quickly thought to slam on my breaks, as I couldn’t see a thing.   I coasted for maybe another 45 seconds to a minute down the road. As I was coasting, my car all of a sudden came back to life. Still coasting, still in gear (I never touched the ignition or put it in neutral) my engine came back to life, headlights and everything. When I looked at my dashboard clock, it had reset itself, as did my GPS.  I reached my house a few minutes later and my friend got in his car and drove home. A few days later I contacted my friend and asked him what he had seen and he bluntly stated “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Which brings me to why I’m posting a year later… I brought the incident up a week ago, and he told me exactly what I had seen. He was skeptical to admit the situation a y! ear ago, and finally decided “it wasn’t all in our heads.” I’v! e always believed in the extraterrestrial, and now he does too… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

The trouble call was that the two tracks had a short for several miles. This was unusual because to do this it would cause four circuits to go bad at the same time.   Each circuit running through the track has its own back up batteries and it is unheard of for all four to short at same time.   I got on the track with my high rail truck and headed west  inspecting the track as I went.  About half way I noticed a flash of light coming at me at a high speed.  At first I thought meteor.  It startled me and I slammed on my brakes.  By the time I stopped  a blue light hovered about 20 ft away from the front of my truck.  I tried to back up and it shot to the rear of my truck forcing me to stop and go forward again.  It  then shot in front of my truck again. I stopped again  the craft then hovered around my truck making  quick moves right to left.  This lasted several minutes.  I finally got my wits back and  took several pictures with my cell phone.  Shortly after I started taking pictures it shot off to the south at high speed and was gone.  I have the ability to monitor the shorts on the track with my laptop in real time.  Within minutes of the craft leaving the shorts went away.  I cleared the trouble ticket  as problem cleared on its own.  Later I told my supervisor and manager and showed them the pictures.,2012-11-19T00:00:00,48.218393939393934,-103.70169999999999

My friend and I were walking around in North Berkeley a little before sunset. She said, ""what's that in the sky?"" I glanced and said ""its just a plane.""  She wasn't so sure, and after only a few seconds we both knew it was no plane. The object was moving too slowly to be a plane and was seemingly at a much lower altitude than a plane. It seemed to change speed, slowing down as it got closer to us.  It was quite low, hard to say exactly but perhaps only a couple thousand feet or less. At one point the object stopped and then began receding.  It had become larger as it got closer to us, then got smaller very rapidly.  It receded to the size of a star, then smaller, then disappeared.  The impression I got from this movement was that it shot off directly into space at an extreme velocity. It didn't shoot across the sky, but seemingly outward. The object was reddish orange.  It's hue changed subtly over the course of the sighting.  It was orb-shaped, ovular or circular but the ""fireball"" description may be appropriate as well, since it glowed and seemed to give off a dim radiance. Why I am convinced it was not a normal craft: -changed speed -changed direction -appeared much larger than an airplane -shaped like a ball or energy or orb (fireball) -appeared to glow with a deep red radiance, not merely reflect sunlight as some planes do around sunset.

Next about an hour into it there were clouds moving to the east farly fast during this period i could see a few bigger triangle shaped ships and many small ones. Once the clouds move to the east fully clearing the sky and i could see these big dimond shaped ships, it looked like they were triangle shaped ships attaching to the bigger dimond shaped ones, and had small ones moving in and out of the main ship.  saw atleast 10 bigger ships moving tword one another, and then sundly the stop and all the ship started to move at the same speed at this time they were going back to the west. While this was going on the clouds stop moving to the east and started moving to the west.i could still fully see the ships moving to the west.there was a tringle ship that disengaged from the main one and then rotated counter clock wise and took off. the small ships were still what looked like going in and out of some thing. I could see the out line of a diomond ship didnt see much of it but the outline. so about an hour and a half into it there a cloud about to cover up but then stopped and some how was kinda moving in a circle. i saw these three black dots in the sky that went behind a small cloud and the the cloud fadded away.

At one point when the clouds were over us  we saw this ship that looked like a glass circle going very fast through the sky. The reson why i think that they attached to one main one is that i could see perfect tringles and there all were moving at the same speed.  We saw many ships that would just take off and couldnt see nothing but a small light moving accross the whole sky. At the start of it they were not moving at the same speed they all were scattered and moving in weird ways with smaller ones zipping every where. the whole night i could not see any of the stars that are normaly here at this time and did not see the big dipper once.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,39.100835139760406,-94.56447929264118

Weather conditions were clear, no moonlight, starts could be seen.    While walking east, I saw a red ball of light with an orange colored center go straight up, to approximately 500 to 700 AGL.  The red and orange colors were blended.  The light did have a pulsing action, about one pulse per every second or two.  At first, I thought it was a firework, but there were no dissipating lights going outward as a firework would go off and dissipate.  This light had come towards me, approximately the same altitude, again 500 to 700 AGL, and was about ½ to 1 mile away.  The light slowed down, and whoever was flying it, had definite control over its course, speed, and altitude.  I thought for a minute, maybe it was an unmanned balloon, but a balloon would drift, and again, this had definite controlled movements.  As I continued walking my dogs because they were now pulling me to come along, I pointed to my dog,! look up, but of course, they are dogs, whatever, lets go.  As I continued to move forward, this light gained altitude, about a 500 fpm climb, nothing drastic, and headed on its way south to south-westbound.  When I looked over my shoulder, it was on that course, about 3000 feet or so higher, on its merry way.  Within a few minutes, I checked my phone for the time, which was 12:38am.  I was not scared, it was quite intriguing to me.  I specifically put in the pilot details, because that is what I am.   I hold an ATP certificate with 6600 hrs, and am a good judge of how high or fast an aircraft is going, or its direction, just like any other experienced pilot.

I knew immediately that it was not conventional aircraft as it was a very bright fireball in the shape of a standing bowling pin with all the light contained inside as if it were a see through balloon. It made no noise at all.It even maneuvered as if it was floating along the wind currents a few times but was traveling a fast pace just the speed of a normal aircraft that would fly over though this object was not on any normal path I've seen the regular planes take before.  I jumped outside and ran out to the middle of the yard and watched it coming over to my left. I sprang to the back door and yelled to the wife ""Come here quick....hurry NOW!!!""   She looked out and I had just turned off the outside light also to get a better visual on this object. She cried out…""What is that?""   And she came outside in the cold to look closer at it and we both watched it travel off until it disappeared either into clouds or some other way.  This whole episode was about three minutes and no more. She said it looked like fire emitting from the object but I missed that running to an open spot to see it better. We both were exhilarated at this sight and we could not wait to share it with neighbors and our grown children who live elsewhere. That's all there is but I'm telling you it was not an airplane or helicopter or blimp or something like experimental craft or rotor or glider or hot air craft. It was bright as a star and quite large. Very freaky to behold and glad the wife could witness this event as it would have been very hard to deal with trying to explain to her what I encountered as I am a close encounter survivor from 1987 and she does not enjoy what she calls an obsession of mine when it comes to UFOs. This for me was a Christmas gift!

Rare White Light of Unknown Origin with Pulse/Strobe/Ovalblanket,Dulles,VA,2012-12-30T06:39:00,flash,0.5 seconds,"Occurred : 12/30/2012 06:39  (Entered as : 12/30/12 06:39) Reported: 12/30/2012 5:02:38 AM 05:02 Posted: 2/4/2013 Location: Dulles (Fairfax/Loudon), VA Shape: Flash Duration:0.5 seconds",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/095/S95603.html,"Rare White Light of Unknown Origin with Pulse/Strobe/Ovalblanket On Sunday, December 30, 2012, at 06:39am EST, in Dulles, Virginia (within 2 miles of Dulles International Airport, ‘Dulles Discovery’ building, and Air and Space Museum) a ‘massive’ light strobe/flash was spotted.  Upon a windy, cloudy (but not covered) sky, straight above the witness’ head (very steep angle), happened the event, lasting no more than 0.5 seconds, but no less than 0.12 seconds. The anomaly was unlikely a form of lightning, due to the duration, size, and shape. The ‘light’, which again was a massive strobe, could be described as; oval or circle or rectangle (or even square) (to match a best description of its top-down (or ground-to-air view, bird’s eye from the ground, etc.)).  The SIZE description as; massive, football field (much larger – 3 to 4 times this size or even larger).  The size of the entire light portion of the ‘craft’ (the defined shape, most notably ‘rectangle’/futbol field with a ‘central sun’ or ‘focus point’ (seemingly the witness’ location, but at a height of only about 60-100 feet above) low in the clouds (clouds fast moving, ‘focus point’ occulted by the cloud cover, although cloud cover not total – moon waning, shining in the west). Also notable about the consciousness of the witness – the awareness at the time of “Indians”.  Not “India” such as Kashmir, but of the Native American Indian.  The ‘awareness’, ‘ESP’, ‘tele’, etc. was certainly ‘dulled’ at the time of the event, but included subconscious notable features; Indians, Redskins, Native American Indian, American Dream, American Spirit, American Spirit (cigarette) (natural tobacco), Football Field, Redskins vs. Cowboys, Star (5 points), Cube Form (RGIII, (playoff)), Washington Post, holiday time, new year (time for exposure for anomalies).  The subconscious ‘timing’ of these events is believed by the witness to be ‘data’ supporting the timing of the sighting, and the importance in the witness’ own life (spiritual). It could also be reported and fit a description that a “flying wing” (but massive in size and silent in sound) was moving at a very fast speed, engaged a light on/off (or simply sped up [down] and then up, and the light was never ‘off’).  Contrary to the physics of the last descriptive sentence (flying down, then up, with light on), the witness’ account does not recall ‘vertical’ movement, but ‘horizontal’ movement from North (but ‘starting’ just South of the Airport), travelling Southeast (or travelling in a vertical direction, but ‘the light’ expanding towards the Southeast (probably only an apparency of the witness’ viewpoint) (also, the ‘light’ was centralized like a candle flame is, only the light expanded – so it is unique that movement was also sensed).  It can also be said that ‘lack of movement’ had caused a dizzying ‘need’ or ‘deception’ of movement, in which the witness may or may not have seen, but the ‘elapsed time’ of the light/strobe anomaly seemed more ‘still! ’. Nevertheless of the movement, the flash/ball/oval/field/rectangle blanketing WAS seen and realized, with almost definite ‘source’ to the light, pinpointed near/above witness’ location. Finally, it can be noted that the witness believes it is possible for the “craft” to belong to mankind, but if so, secret/not public knowledge.  It is doubtful, from the witness’ consideration, that the “craft” (if in reality, a craft composed of matter, as explained above) is of primitive technologies (such as publicly known U.S. Military technologies).

Ongoing incident witnessed by 3 people numerous times.  What appears to be a star perhaps but the color of a yellow diamond.  This is how I can differentiate them immediately from bright white stars around them.  You have to keep your eyes on them for 30 seconds or so but they always move. Left to right and versa, up and down versa.  Some nights like last night Monday I told my Dad to drive up to the lake ( Pinery ) and I was immediately able to spot this one as it was rapidly changing colors faster the my eyes and brain could process.  I have hawk eyes, have always looked at the night sky since a child, but if you we're to glance at these for a second or so they would appear to be just another star a yellowish tinted star unless they are doing their light show which seems to be later in the evening. When I sit on the dock at night their always seems to be one pretty much straight ahead but elevated in the sky. Up and left from Orion's Belt. I am very familiar with Aircraft, Military and otherwise and this is nothing we have even keeping in mind they hid Stealth from us for over 30 years, SR 71 etc. This object even in its basic of aerobatic moves has got to be moving in excess of 5,000 M.P.H. In my opinion. And when it is done ( toying ) with you or whatever they are up to it takes off at no predetermined flight path at least nothing that makes any sense and they move. Conservatively I would say in the 10,000 M.P.H. or more. Last night the one thing that seemed different is that they almost seemed to have an additional much smaller circular light on the structure as well but a seventh to tenth of the object in question. I have been  observing these for months, I reside in the Pinery. This has been almost nightly with one always being about vertical over my house. Can't seem to gauge size or distance but erratic moves can be seen by my Father who doesn't have the eyesight he used to. Nothing Government and not a high powered laser ! because they would need to have an end to the beam for it to s! hine and be visible? I look for these ( guys ) every night and seem to have gotten a method to finding one in about 20 seconds or less now that I know what I am looking for. Also have footage but from I phone that I was able to set at angle and press record so I feel given the opportunity to enlarge this video it could shed some light pun intended on what the heck is going on. Also aircraft in vicinity all over and not on glide slope to D.I.A. Have also seen and heard F-16 Falcons from Buckley being scrambled with afterburner just under Mach 1 having no effect on the flight characteristics of these U.F.O.'s. Very awesome more than slightly disconcerting. Hope they are friendly because something tells me my .40 cal might best be best suited to use against myself in lieu of going for a ride! But than again if I could be assured of no anal probing what a ride that would be until your blood started boiling. I'm also sure of more than 3 and possibly smaller barely visible smaller ships. ! The 3 main ones always seem to be in pretty much the same place in sky not exact, when you line them up with a star you know it's no satellite and if you look hard enough you I can find many more in further reaches of sky. I always knew since a kid. Had that feeling or encounter? This vilifies my certainty of existence.",2013-02-04T00:00:00,39.49737606837607,-104.76592193732195

Adams reflection on lake I was visiting Takhlakh Lake near Mt. Adams in southern Washington and was inspired to take some photos of the lake from its eastern shore around 9 A.M. Around that time there were several people walking their dogs and a man painting the lake on the nearby shore.   After taking several pictures of the mountain, I felt compelled to photograph its reflection on the lake. When I returned home several days later, I noticed a dark chevron-shaped object in that photo (sumbitted to NUFORC).  It appears to be banked on its side and located above the treetops in front of the mountain. When magnified, the object appears to have two red areas located bilaterally near the front and a blue area just behind them.  While I took that particular photo there was no sound of aircraft. I had been looking at my camera’s LCD viewfinder from a distance and didn’t see anything flying. I was interested in visiting the Mt. Adams vicinity because I had heard it described as an energy vortex with elevated numbers of UFO sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  Mystery solved!  The source of the report looked at other photos, and the object is a log, sticking out of the water, which created a very interesting mirrored-image, somewhat similar in appearance to a B-2 bomber.

September 8, 2012, 12:25pm, Waxahachie, TX, Weather was sunny and breezy, as a cold front was approaching, bringing temperatures from the 100’s to the 80’s, and there was not a cloud in the sky. As I was driving, I observed what appeared at first to be a group of birds, regrouping the way geese do sometimes, but these birds appeared to be white, which didn’t seem right for geese.  Curious, because it was the wrong time of day when you typically would see this type of bird activity, and secondly, wondering what type of migratory bird it could be, I pulled into a parking lot to stop and get a better look. I now realized whatever I was seeing was definitely not birds.  The images kept appearing and disappearing, making it difficult for my son who was with me, to see them at first, but then he saw them too. The prominent shape seemed to be two large groups of small white objects, and they seemed to be moving, swirling almost in a rolling manner, but fairly stationary as a group,  before they would fade and disappear out of sight and then reappear at intervals that were about a minute or so apart.  As they faded in and out, it was apparent that the collective object was moving horizontally in the sky. The two groups overlapped slightly, with one higher and to the left of the other.  The images continued to disappear and reappear.  At one point, the shape was distinctly different, suggesting the outline of a semi-sphere or maybe the bottom section of a boat, with a curved and upward shape that also seemed to be formed from the same type of white objects, also swirling and moving.  As the images were far off in the distance, up in the sky, it was difficult to tell if the objects within the masses were moving, or if they were part of a larger object that was moving or rolling in the sky.  It was a bright sunny day, so it was difficult to tell if the objects were something white, or perhaps lights.   We continued to watch, for about 10 minutes before we saw a plane approaching the general vicinity of the object(s), and once the plane seemed to almost be to it, the object disappeared and we did not see it reappearing again after that.

One was clearly in the lead, the other three lights moved behind at some distance. They appeared to be moving directly over the flight path for the Columbus (CMH) airport's approach, however, they stayed at the same height.  As the moved across the sky, the three that trailed the leader moved in different formations.  At first they had no distinct pattern.  Then they drifted to align in a straght line eventually forming a near perfect triangle. Winds were from the west at 5 miles per hour, these were traversing the sky at a much faster rate - totally silent, not quite the speed of the many jets I see and hear taking off and landing each day. The lights did not flash or flicker, akin to the ""chinese lantern"" effect I've seen described in other reports.  Quite bright, as if drifting across the sky (except for the various formations of the trailing three) until they faded into a hazy cloud layer. I called the police, the dispatcher had no other reports of the sighting roughly ten minutes later.  The lights left no trail but were very unique. I'm a fairly sane individual who enjoys watching the skies for meteors and space station sightings and can name several of the galaxies formations and objects upon sight.  This was unlike any of those.  They did not reflect, but produced their own light in a shade similar to sodium street lights with a bit more red, somewhat pinkish tint.

I went to take my dog out to pee. This just happened, and I am upset that I was alone because no one will believe this.  Case in point when I ran in to tell my husband, and he came out to see there was nothing and he thinks I'm insane.  But I know what I saw. I was looking up at the redwoods like I usually do.  I was spacing out while my dog roamed around sniffing.  I noticed a weird whistle? Which at 2 AM in the woods where I live is very unusual.  So I tensed and was getting to call my dog back in fear that there was some crazy person (we've had drifters show up on the property before) lurking about. Then I noticed that it sounded like a whistle mixed in with some kind of radio station.  I know this is weird but I thought it sounded like rock music and a human whistle combined. I then just looked up.  I don't know why. And there was a plane. Not that unusual and I was about to look away to go inside away from the sound. But then the sound stopped.  And the plane started moving weird. It was going in a circle.  And so I thought it might be a helicopter as they've been known to make runs looking for illegal weed farms up here. But it wasn't.  And I don't know how to describe the pattern of flight, but it was not a helicopter. It went sort of wobbly.  Then to the side.  Then to the other side. Making a sort of exaggerated oval pattern.  But it was still moving forward. This is going to sound insane, but I feel like it noticed me watching it because it stopped its weird flying and just hovered for a few seconds. Then I noticed a second smaller one off in the distance- also flying towards my general direction.  And a sense of fear hit me that I have never felt before.  I have been attacked on the subway, and I didn't feel fear as strongly as this. I screamed for the dog and ran inside.  I woke my husband and he went outside to smoke a cigarette. I followed him out there and there was nothing. After he made fun of me I decided to type this while this was fresh in my mind and submit it to whatever sites for logging this sort of thing I could find. Whatever it is did not seem friendly, or I was too scared and that shut down my thinking.

UFO= Un-identified Flying Object I heard about you guys on Coast to Coast AM, so I have decided to share my story.  My story differs from most on Coast to Coast in one way: lights.  I live about 40 miles north of Vandenburg Air Force base.  They are the western United States site for launching satelites.  I dont exactly remeber the dates when this experience occured so the day might be a little off.  Vandenburg was supposed to launch a missle at 9:30 PM on the night in question.  I enjoy watching the missles launch so I always try to observe them.  The night was clear and there was no wind or moon shining.  A perfect night for a missle launch.  I was sitting on my back porch, which looks south, waiting to watch the event.  10:15 rolls around and still no launch.  They usually run late.  So, being stubborn and having wonderful weather, I stick around and start going through constellations in the night sky.  At this point I had been looking at the night sky for a while.  From the north an obj! ect, cloaked, flies by at an alarming rate headed south.  The only reason the object caught my eye is that it blacked out the stars behind it.  There were no lights.  It came into my view and was gone in less than five seconds.  My story tells of a UFO with no lights.  Im sure a rare sighting.  If I had to guess the shape, I would say a diamond shape or that of the Batman Logo.  It flew incredibly quick and directly toward VAFB.  There were no sounds related to the object and the speed itself should have created some sound.  I could not estimate at the size since it was hard to see it but would guess the speed being somewhere near 600 MPH. It was there and gone.  I would estimate the size to be about the size of a twin engine airplane, maybe 50 feet across.  The thing that makes me wonder is that Vandenberg did not launch the missle that night due to ""weather delays.""  It was delayed for two days after and launched early morning.  You want a background?  I am a wa! rehouse specialist for a local company.  I have a diploma with! some co llege, mostly geology and history.  I have passed psyche exams for jobs with law enforcement but havent passed backgrounds.

I dont know and could really careless as long as my paycheck is cashed.  I feel that if ET's were going to visit us, they would treat it like a military operation.  Lights out!

I observed a steady point of light looking south from Chaco Canyon north of Fajada Butte. I thought it was a star at first because it didn't appear to be moving, then a planet because it wasn't twinkling and it was so bright, then a plane or helicopter when I noticed that it was moving slowly from my vantage point. I have seen many satelites and knew it was not one because of its brightness, low position on the horizon and that it appeared to be coming closer to my location as I kept watching. It appeared to be about 3-5 miles away at an altitude of between 600-1000 feet.  I did not see any blinking lights on it that would signify a known flying object and the light was steady and bright (brighter than any stars in the sky). The object came to within 2 miles I would guess continuing east and north towards me until it shot off towards the sky in an upper southwest direction at a speed that was so fast that if I had blinked I would have thought it disappeared.  Before I saw the object shoot off at an incredible speed, the only man made object I thought it could have been was a helicopter due to it's low altitude and slow speed. This occasion is extremely rare considering the remoteness of the location (Navajo Reservation) and proximity to nearest town (at least 50 miles) or known military base (Kirkland AFB 170-200 miles away.) I have never seen an aircraft at low altitude from Chaco Canyon in nearly a year of residence. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

In April of 2011 I was leaving a friends house in rural North East Texas.  I came to the end of his road, and was about to merge onto F.M. 1840 to head back to my apartment.  I looked to the left looking for traffic, and looked up into the sky.  There was something making a contrail in the sky, and I looked at it for a few seconds wondering if it was going to be a contrail, or a chemtrail. Whatever it was, was very high up, and, as such, I could not make out what it was.  As I watched it it broke apart.  For a moment I thought something bad had happened, and I was witnessing a plane breaking apart, and crashing.  Instead of crashing it, for lack of a better term, did a maneuver.  It was like it broke apart, and two of the units did this cork-screw maneuver.  It went from one solid unit flying across the sky to three units flying across the sky. Now the one contrail became three parallel contrails racing across the sky.  I didn't have my camera on me, so I put it in first gear, and raced home.  I'm surprised that I didn't run off the road, as I keep an eye on the sky watching the three craft race across the sky leaving contrails in their wake. As I got to my apartment the craft were disappearing from the sky, and by the time I ran upstairs, found my camera, and got back down stairs they were gone from my field of view.  I took several photos of the contrails from my apartment parking lot, but the sun had sunk so low, and directly in the path of where the craft separated from one to three, so you can't really see the maneuver. I didn't know where to send my photos at the time, so I posted them on a military forum.  I wanted to see if some military guys knew if this was a standard military aircraft maneuver, but I didn't get any constructive feedback.  I am emailing them to you as soon as I finish this.

This theory was very quickly debunked.  As an example, if held at arm’s length the size of the 'fireballs' were approximately the size of a golf ball.  Each object was noiseless, brightly illuminated by an intense orange/yellow glow and had a dark orange and red aura.  There were small black square shapes (assumed to be small windows) equally spaced around the top sections, underside there was a central 'slow pulsating' red globe.  They moved steadily (in an unwavering boxed formation) against a South East wind.  Their actual speed and height was difficult to estimate and as an example they seemed to be moving slightly faster than a conventional civilian air! craft and any type of wind carried balloon or kite.  The night sky was cloudless, spotted with identifiable stars. Usual commercial air traffic moving to and from Malta was clearly distinguishable.

This is a wide-open area with a great view of the night sky.  It was mostly cloudy with no stars visible.  Sunset was an hour before at 7:20 PM EDT.  As soon as we stopped, we noticed what we thought was a low flying helicopter approaching from north to south heading directly toward us with what appeared to be a bright deep orange light shining from it. It was close being only about 150 to 250 feet high (twice as high as a tall tree) and about 200 yards in front of us traveling very slow.  The closer it approached, the more we realized that it wasn’t normal.  For a moment we both thought it was a helicopter or a small plane that was on fire and about to crash. What we had first thought was a light turned out to be more of an intense deep orange glow that encompassed the entire roundish obje! ct and changed hues so that it resembled a fire.  It made no sound at all. It was a very quiet evening and we made a point to listen closely.  The object was definitely about the same size as a helicopter. I signaled at it for about 15 seconds with a flashlight until it was about 50 yards in front of us (alarmingly close), still at about 150-250 feet high.  It then made a sharp 90 degree turn and moved rapidly out of sight toward the east.   The whole event lasted about 90 seconds with about 85 seconds of approaching toward us and about 5 seconds moving quickly away from us.

My husband was looking that way when he said, ""What is that orange light?""   I looked over and saw this incredible intense bright orange light moving fairly slowly towards us. I went inside and asked our boarder to come outside and have a look.  We both returned outside in time to see this orange light suddenly veer very sharply to the left and fly very quickly upwards where it just disappeared. As soon as that light had climbed upwards, two further bright orange lights followed the exact same path as the single light.  Then as before, as soon as these lights climbed, two more followed the same path.  As before, they climbed and two more followed the same path.  Finally, as these ones climbed, one more single bright orange light followed the same path before climbing and moving very fast away. These lights were consistent; they did not flicker at all.  They were fairly close yet there was no noise at all.  The night was beautiful, very clear with no cloud.  The airport is not in the direction of the lights and as we live on the flight path, we know where the planes come in.  They come in directly over us or from the west to the east and at a low altitude. These lights were fairly low when the first came into sight but they were traveling from north to south before heading west.  I can hear planes very clearing when they come in. They were not flares, flares act in a totally different way, plus ((name deleted--husband)) knows what flares look like. Also, the sea is to the east of us. They were not Chinese lanterns.  If they were, the lights would have been flickering even slightly.  Also, they all would have turned to the west at the same time if they wind had blown them.  These lights followed each other exactly. They were not weather balloons as we do not have them here in Napier. I got my camera and put it on video and aimed it at the lights. I looked at the screen but couldn’t see anything on it so I stopped filming.  It wasn’t until two weeks or so later when I downloaded photos onto the computer, I saw I had actually got one of the lights on video. Unfortunately, as I thought I wasn’t getting anything, there is not much film of it.  Still, it does show one orange light which looks nothing like a plane. They were sort of round and very large.  The way, in which they veered sharply, it was impossible for one of our aircraft to have made that turn, only a fighter plane could have turned that way.  Again, if they were fighter planes, the noise would have been heard but it was silent. My husband called the police and was told other people had also reported the lights.  A few days later, the police called again and told us, the lights were not flares or lanterns and they had no idea what they were. My husband is 45 and a digger and bobcat driver, very down to earth type of man. I am 47 and don’t work due to having Fibromyalgia. Our boarder has since moved out.

There had to be at ! least several dozen objects as described herein in this sighting. I turned off my car radio and wound down my window to hear the helicopter rotors but was very surprised to hear absolutely no noise at all.  The objects were flying low enough to observe that they appeared to have an opaque base with a somewhat conical orange light located above the base.  If not helicopters, I thought they could possibly be balloons, but I cannot figure out how they all would have been lighted in exactly the same manner and flying in formations.   I have never seen anything like this and am very confused about what these strange lights could have been.",2012-08-05T00:00:00,40.3817,-79.7893

Caught out of the corner of my eye a bright object coming over the horizon (I was facing south).  It was bright orange with a red spot behind it.  Very large and bright, moving slow, rising at a 30 degree angle or so.  Seemed to stop and then turn toward us, which is toward the left (eastwardly) then started heading back toward the horizon.  Once it started turning the light started dimming quickly, and completely went out before reaching the horizon.  The lights were solid, no flashing and the red disappeared light disappeared at the turning point.   This lasted for about 1 minute.  Once lights disappeared the neighbor’s horse went silent.  The sky was clear and hadn’t noticed any stars yet.  Probably about 9:30pm.  The horizon is not far from us, about two miles. We sit out quite often and watch the sky.

The lights kept a uniform distance from each other and moved in tandem.  Just as I thought we were getting closer to them they started going north and disappeared or left the sky.

Flat shoelace like object changing into ball shape. It looked like a star but too bright and changing colors; thought maybe it was a star.  I was facing south, object was west of the moon and south of Orion's belt to start at the end it had moved at least 90 degrees WNW. You could tell it was changing from green-blue hues. I called my wife out (non-believer at this point) and she brought her camera (studio quality).  We took tons of photos and when zoomed in you can tell it is a long straight object changing from purple, green, white, blue, turquoise, and different shades of those. During our duration outside taking pictures we had watched it with the naked eye changing from a flat line to a ball or orb shape. It moved around  in a zig-zaging and making what seamed to be horseshoes. also we had noticed something come out of it only because it would blink red and disappear going north (you can only see this when it is flashing hard to capture in a picture). Upon further review of these photos we noticed the object started straight and from picture to picture you can see it change into almost a crooked T, to the shape of a italicized F into a ball (our eyes scene what we thought was a tail, we think the picture of the F shape).  The pictures made it seam almost like we photographed a LED rope being wiggled until the F shape..  That made it mind blowing It would go way out of distance (atmosphere?) and come back flatten out and be in a different area. The strangest thing happened after our adrenaline was flowing like mad men:  the pictures from tonight that was had been going through on the camera somehow were erased between pulling the SD from camera to computer.   We are truly baffled because we took another picture after seeing they'd be deleted and it saved, none of the settings had been tampered with nor was the card full.  Are we the only ones who this has happened too..   Did we take too many pictures and they ""magically"" get erased..?    Please tell me someone has scene this flat object same colors, we are positive of what we have scene no possibility it was an air craft or jet.  We are by an airport and know what an airplane looks like.  This was truly a mind blowing and almost life altering even to know what we have seen was real.   You believe me..
