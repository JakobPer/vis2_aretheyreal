Although it may seem relatively insignificant to many, I experienced what I deemed to be a very unusual sighting in the sky, somewhat near the foothills at about 3:17 p.m. this afternoon. I will send a photo of the same--the details appear more clearly on my iphone, from which I took the attached photograph.  Please allow me to explain what occured so that you may have an opportunity to both preview the photograph as well as understand the nature of the surrounding events because the photograph alone (even from my perspective) appears to be relatively neutral and insignificant.  I have attempted to gain a clear picture, with details that I sent from my iphone to my email and when zooming in to view details of the photo, they were very blurry.  When I zoom in on my cell phone, the details are crisp and clear, just as I am able to view the actual license plates of the cars that are in the foreground of the picture on my iphone, in the photo off the computer, the details become quite blurry.  I would be happy to send my iphone photo somehow to someone else's iphone in order to prove this point.  Please let me know because the evidence on the computerized photo is alm! ost impossible to discern. This afternoon was a fairly clear day and there were only a few, small clouds in the sky. I was driving south on Wadsworth Blvd, just south of Belleview in Littleton.  Prior to reaching the light at the interesection of Belleview and Wadsworth(from almost as far south as Cross Drive intersects Wadsworth), I noted that there seemed to be, what I thought was a plane 'hanging' in the sky.  It was approximately north by northwest, towards the mountains, at about 11 o'clock (position-wise, from where I was driving in the left hand lane, as I approached and prepared to turn west/left on Belleview).  I didn't think alot about it but I did think it was a bit unusual because of the following features:  it appeared to have only a very, small, faint trail, different from what I typically see from a large plane; the faint trail was absolutely vertical in nature; it seemed to hang in the sky, without moving; further, it was perfectly round and bright, right to the edges of its shape, as if the sun were either directly casting its light on it or the brightness was emanating from the object itself. As a result, I kept on looking at it because it didn't seem quite right. I knew that I would be stopping to turn at Belleview and I thought that I would have a better look at it when I stopped.  As soon as I stopped in the turn lane and at the very moment that I was looking at it, another bright object, absolutely identical to the first one, suddenly appeared to the right and about (4 o'clock, by location, relative to the first object) and within eyesight of the other(not being able to estimate distance, but easily just a few miles from the first one). At that moment, since I was stopped, I thought I would grab my phone and take a photo of these two, bright objects.  The second object had no 'tail' whatsoever, it just seemed to appear out of nowhere and I was a bit flabbergasted at this.  I instantly took a photo and the instant that I lowered my camera, the right-most object disappeared entirely and then, while I was looking at the other object, it disappeared right before my ! eyes.  I was stunned.  There was no trace of the object at all. What was more astounding was the fact that the sky was quite clear...no clouds in the immediate vicinity and absolutely no 'trails' of a flying object did I perceive.  To my eyes, the sky appeared completely clear. I turned the corner and pulled into the parking lot to see what had come out on my camera.  To my dismay, it looked like an ordinary photo and nothing out of the ordinary seemed to appear.  When I magnified my photo, however, I was stunned again, because, there are TWO sets of two parallel lines that appear to trail westward(to the left) of the photo.  The one set appears more clearly, but the other set is barely visible (below the traffic lights).  This would coincide with the fact that I saw the higher object stay in the sky longer and the lower object disappeared instantly upon me taking the photo. What is clearly shown on the photo are the double lines that streak off to the left. This is my story. I have no proof or reason to share anything like this other than I am both completely perplexed and even a bit upset about what I saw today.  It was as if both the objects that I saw were either descending in a vertical fashion and/or hanging there in the sky(which is what it appeared to be, to my eyes) and then, they both suddenly, one, moments before the other, moved off westward at such an amazing speed that my eyes were unable to visualize their rapid movement in that direction.  I actually saw the one disappear in front of my eyes, but I did not visually observe the actual movement that my camera was able to capture.  I kept looking back at the sky because I couldn't believe that an object so bright and obvious, could just disappear without any trace.  The photo shows two sets of parallel lines streaking off to the left but nothing more.  I have attached the initial photo and then, I attached the photo, with circles around the lines that I noted when I enla! rged the photo on my iphone. I thank you for your consideration and I just felt that I had to record this event as accurately as possible. I know that many unusual events have been recorded over the years by many individuals but this was a first for me and I felt it important to share.  I am also very curious to know if anyone else saw anything out of the ordinary at the time.  On my actual iphone, I was able to see the license plates of the cars which were in front of me.  That's why I say that this photo, when enlarged here on my computer, only gives a fuzzy appearance of things, as well as the previously noted streaks that came out on the original photo.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,39.56792218259629,-105.0102302425107

We were on the 6th floor of the 10 story hotel with all rooms facing west towards the ocean.  Outside our room was a 10 foot long balcony. We had slept most of the day, had a very late dinner and then a bath (no drinking or drugs were involved).  Both of us are veterinary professionals that work at an emergency clinic, oftentimes working long hours overnight, and are accustomed to being up late. It was about 2:45 am when we decided to get to bed.  I decided that I would take one last look at the ocean before going to sleep.  It was raining, blustery and cold.  The sea’s waves were crashing.  As I stepped onto the balcony, I looked out west and saw a very elongated teardrop-looking object hovering in the air approximately 10-15 feet from the end of our balcony.  The night was dark, but the hotel had spotlights extending onto the beach.  This object appeared very dark-colored (maybe gray or black), about 12 inches long with a very rounded ""front"" end and a very sharp, long ""tail"".  It also had a wide stripe of a faint greenish-yellow about 1/3 of the way from the tip of its nose.  There was a black circle (approximately 2 inches in diameter) in the middle of the stripe.  It made no noise, had no lights on it, nor did it have any mechanical moving parts. It hovered briefly in one spot, and then turned 90 degrees to face me.  It then turned again to its original sideways position, still hovering in one spot.  Next, the object (still in its sideways position looking like an elongated teardrop), began to move vertically in a very straight line up 10 feet, then down 20 feet, then up 5 feet, down 2 feet, and then up 20 feet, each time before moving up and down pausing at its original hover spot.  It then flew northeast over the hotel building.  All of this happened within 25-30 seconds.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,44.9435,-123.9487

I knew it was not a plane, since it was so bright, like a planet, with the sun shining on it.  The light was pure and non-fluctuating.  It was moving at such a speed, that I was able to run into the house, grab some binoculars and get back out to look at it.  It had moved about 20 degrees across the sky.  When I focused on it, I was looking for the typical wing light that are on a plane.  I did not see any, just the pure white object moving through the sky.  I did not have any time to get my 800 power spotting scope to look at it. There was no sound associated with the object.  Planes that usually fly this route leave an audible sound trail.

My family and I were visiting my wife’s family in Wardsboro, Vermont, from our home in New Hampshire for the extended 4th of July weekend.  I was standing outside their front door with my Father in law at approximately 10:45pm.   Through a ‘V’ in the tree line (looking towards Mt Snow’s direction) we both saw a large bright white orb appear and move very slowly across the sky from left to right.  It was about 30 feet above the tree line and below the clouds. It appeared to be maybe 20 feet in diameter (best guess) and glowed pure white.   As we watched it we started trying to determine what it was.  Our first guess was fireworks as it was the day after the 4th but there was no flare to the light it just shined a solid white like a super bright LED lantern.  It also seemed to move too slowly to be a firework or an aircraft and there was no sound at all. As Wardsboro is in a Valley usually you can hear things such as thunder and planes louder than you normally would bu! t this was pure silence.  After about 5 seconds it approached a low dim star and it disappeared by quickly fading. My father in law and I continued to ask each other what it was we just saw.  As we were discussing it we saw another identical white orb appear in the same spot the first one did and it also moved at the same speed, direction and path and disappeared where the original one had.   After the second orb faded we could no longer see the dim star that was in the direction they were heading.  After researching online there is a chance what we saw may have been ball lightning however I am not sure that they appear in pairs like that.  I have also read that ball lightning cracks loudly when it disappears and we experienced silence throughout this. The only other detail I would add is during the first orb's travel I felt an odd 'fluttering' sensation in my back.  Their front light was on and there were large flying insects around it so I assumed it was a large flying insect that was flying into my back or had gotten under the back of my t-shirt for a minute but it almost felt like a mild spasm.  I was reaching around to brush my back as I didn't want to take my eyes off what I was seeing.  I am not assuming this has anything to do with what we saw I just want to make sure this is a full accounting.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,43.0204,-72.8116

I had just locked eyes on it while coming out of a curve in the road when she did this.  It was huge and by that it looked to be several miles long in mass and length if it were in our lower atmosphere!  If it were higher in the upper heavens then it could even span beyond miles!  There is no telling how far up it was or how big it really was.  Measuring from the top of the car's rear view mirror to the middle of the windshield is how much space it took up of that area and it looked as high up there in space as the stars look among the constellations as I lunged forward to see it better.  It tilted downward as if it were dipping and just vaporized right before our eyes but left a fa! int flash of light orange yellowish glow in an oblong design along it's outer perimeter between the bottom and middle lights.   She had been looking at it and trying to figure just what it was while talking on her cell phone which she immediately told her sister she had to hang up and then it disappeared in a second from her hanging up the phone. I saw it clearly for no more than perhaps only two to three seconds tops. She saw it maybe seven to eight seconds also.  But boy is it etched into my mind!  It reminded me of how the triangle craft in Arizona looked that made UFO history.  But this one dwarfed that image. And it was slanted sideways at an angle.  It was super massive. This is happening during a near full moon on a clear starry night.  There were no clouds or obstructions for it to disappear in or behind. It startled us very much and we were so relieved it disappeared as it scared us good! The wife commented how glad she was that it was now gone.  We rode home looking out t! he windshield fervently and methodically paying close attentio! n to the skies. I actually veered of the road once and she being a woman of no nonsense would usually get on to me about watching where I'm going but she was too mesmerized at gazing out the window that it did not phase her much which trust me is highly unusual behavior for her! We slowly rode home watching the heavens.  When we got home a bright light came over the trees from the woods near our home as I was talking to my son on the phone about that massive UFO as I stood outside in the backyard. I was still watching the skies because of the earlier observation. This was perhaps twenty minutes later at 9:34 pm. I opened the back door and called for the wife to please come see this strange light. She came outside and we both agreed it might just be a plane as it was on the path planes usually come up over the woods from. But I noted there was no noise and the light was going too fast for an airplane or even a jet. She said... ""That s just a plane""...&#12288; but it reminded me of an encounter we reported on your site just after Christmas about a fireball we encountered up close because it was unusually bright and commanded attention. As it rose higher into the airspace it was dazzling bright then instantly dimmed away like a vacuum tube does when the power is turned off and simply ! disappeared right before our eyes just like that last fireball did we had saw right after Christmas. The sky was clear and the bright moon was lighting everything up and there was no place for that craft to hide behind or cloud to absorb into. I've seen planes disappear like that before and wonder what causes that effect but this was totally different in the way the largeness of the craft was becoming and the brightness it was emitting. Well she exclaimed...""That's two UFO encounters in less than a half hour's time!""  My son was listening to all of this happening on the phone so he is an audio witness.  I'm reporting this out of great concern and if anyone reading this account had seen this very frightening event then you would be thinking like I am that it has nothing to do with earthly technologies and it certainly is nothing the military has hiding in the hangers.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,34.5521,-77.9068

I did get a follow up call and explained in depth the encounter. The rains we have had has made the area very flood riddled and the sod mushy.

Long Duration UFO Sightings:  On June 24, 2013, I was at my friend “Carol’s” house on Sanibel Island – a barrier island just off the coast of Ft. Myers Florida, USA.   Her house is on Clam Bayou, toward the northern half of the island, and is about a half of a mile from the Gulf of Mexico.   What I herein describe is based on notes I had written up the next day after this initial sighting, and several days following, in addition to what “Carol” and a MUFON friend later told me what I was  describing to them, “blow by blow,” on the telephone for a total of just over 2 hours   At approximately 10:15 p.m., we were on the second floor balcony, which faces west and is about 20 feet above the ground and about 25 feet above sea level.  Our eye level was just under 26 feet above sea level.  We saw toward the west an amber light just “blink on.”  Then about 2 minutes later, another amber light came on to the right/north of the first one (see drawing).  These lights were about the size of a finger nail at arm's length, and they were about two fingers held together apart – they were horizontal to each other.  We could not make out any type of a craft, only the lights.  The lights were “solid,” which is to say that they were not like turn signal lights on a car. The sky was heavily overcast and there was no moonlight.  It rained late that afternoon, but there was no drizzle when this was happening. We watched the two lights drift together very slowly toward the north for 10 to 15 minutes at the most.  By approximately 10:25, they had drifted behind some trees in the bayou.  The trees are about 50 feet high at the most.  The lights were just below treetop level.  Carol and I both guess that the lights were no more than a few hundred feet above the water. Shortly after we lost sight of the lights I drove exactly 2 miles (8 minutes) to where I live on Blind Pass, Captiva Island.  From a deck on the water behind my house I saw the same two lights again, just over the top of the railing on the south side of the bridge that connects the two islands.  My eye level on the deck is about 11 feet above sea level.  From my vantage point I estimate that the lights were two to no more than 500 hundred above the water; carol and I figured the same thing from her house. Based on my second initial sighting over the south end of the bridge, I triangulated where the lights initially were using Google Earth.  The lights were 1.53 miles away from Carol’s house,. 2.16 miles from my house, and 1.03 miles out from the beach.  I can send “need to know” people my Google Map drawings provide they agree in writing not to disclose where I and “carol” live. I called Carol shortly after I got home at 10: 41 to tell her what I was seeing, and stayed on the phone with her nonstop for an hour and 21 minutes.  I could not remember very well the next day exactly what I was telling her for such a long time; my memory is pretty poor to begin with, and the high anxiety I was experiencing likely compounded the problem.  In addition to that, I’m an early, early bird, and am usually asleep by 9 or 9:30, which may have affected my memory too.  Nonetheless, I saw what I saw and  Carol filled me in a lot on what I herein describe.  Unfortunately, carol, at 71 years of age, doesn’t have the best of memories either. I watched what appeared to be the same two amber lights for a while before a third light, of the same color and intensity appeared to the right of the first two.  They remained pretty much stationary but individual ones seemed to change a bit in intensity.  After another while they started drifting slowly to the north (to my right, and also drifted a bit higher in the sky.  Then a forth, same-type light came on.  When the lights came on they came they did not just “switch” on, but came on more like turning on a light with a dimmer switch.  These lights were horizontal to each other, but I seem to remember that they were not in a perfectly straight line.  The lights continued to drift slowly to the north, but did seem to become a bit dimmer, so maybe they were moving further away from me and more drifted more to the northwest and out to sea. After quite some time watching them from the deck on the water behind my house, I walked about 200 yards directly west of me to the beach.  I immediately saw the ones I’d seen on the bayside.  They were definitely very, very slowly drifting from the south of me to northwest (my left to right) and then just hung there for pretty much the rest of the time, about 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon.  I’d guess that they were no more than 3 or four miles away from me. Then another two lights of the same color and intensity came on to the right of the existing ones, for a total of six.  I had a 6-volt flashlight with me and I started flashing them, and I clearly remember Carol yelling at me on the phone (and she remembers this clearly too) not to do that -  and she was very, very frightened for me.  Whether it was me flashing my light on and off or not, the lights DID go on and off, one or two at a time. Then I started flashing an “SOS” at them – three long, three short, three long.  Although I did not get the same SOS back, the lights continued to go on and off.  Then a 7th one ""came on"" just a tad, maybe a finger-width at arms length, above the six, toward the middle, and it was a solid white but not overly bright, and just a tad brighter than the others, about the size of your thumb nail at arms length.  I then remember getting VERY frightened and started shaking and told Carol I was going back home, which I did, even though the lights were still there, hanging to the SSW off of where I was. When I left the beach the lights were still all together in a ""group,"" in a fairly straight line that was as wide as the fingertips on your d held just a tiny bit apart. It was overcast with no wind, and I never heard a sound from them.   At the time I remember thinking that they could not have been all that far way, and as I stated before, my initial sighting of them when I first got home from Carol’s my triangulation showed that they were just over two miles away. During this time the grouping of the lights would change, but not a lot - I could never make out an actual craft, and don’t ask me why I never took a photo with my phone, or got my camera at home. When I got back home I could not see the lights over the bridge, so they had indeed drifted northward during this time.  Despite Carol telling me not to go back to the beach, the scientist in me just had to take one more look, as this was what I thought was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I remember clearly that when I got back to the beach the lights were still there and in about the same place, but I swear on my mom’s grave that I saw a “being” standing on, or floating a tad above, the boulders that comprised the north jetty at Blind Pass.  The rocks were about 200 yards to the north of me and the figure was about ¼ of the way in from the end (see photos).  As best I can remember the figure was very tall – maybe 10 to 12 feet, and it was grayish, according to my very clear memory of it.  What is odd in my recollection of it, is that as a silhouette in front of an overcast sky that was light enough to easily see and differentiate between the Gulf, the rocks sky, it should have been black.  There was a definite head, kinda square-cut shoulders, and recalling it as I now write, it seems that it was wearing some kind of a robe, because of both the wideness of the figure from the shoulders going down to the rocks, and because I could not make out any legs, even ! thought I seem to have thought there should have been. This is where I really have no recall of exactly what happened next – it was just pass midnight, the latest I’d stayed up in probably 8 months due to back surgery and pain meds I have to take.  Carol told me the following day that I had described the figure to her (and that it was really, really scaring her), and that I had flashed my flashlight at it while telling here that “they were benevolent and that there was nothing to worry about.”  Just how in the world I ever came up with that is totally beyond me, because in my known-to-others belief, any aliens who are kidnapping and abusing us humans can’t be all that benevolent as many claim.  She then said that I said that I thought the figure was coming toward me, that I got really scared and hid in some bushes, and that I got lost somehow until I figured out where I was.  I was on the phone with her all the while (thank God), so I doubt I got abducted. I do remember telling her (which she corroborated) that I had finally had had enough of what I was seeing and that I was going home to lock my doors and turn all my lights on, which I did.  Again, from my bayside vantage point I did not see any of the lights when I got home.  I hung up talking to carol at 12:13 a.m. according to my phone log. For whatever reason, I went back outside behind my house on Blind pass at around 12:55 a.m., and saw the lights over top of the bridge again.  This time I called my MUFON friend “Tom” and woke him up to tell him that “honest to God Tom,” I am right now looking straight at some UFO’s.  Tom later told me that I was describing to him for 43 minutes pretty much what I had told Carol I was seeing – that I was going from the bayside to the beach and was flashing my flash light at the lights and that they seemed to be responding, and that I had again seen the bright white light come on for a while just above the amber lights.  Tom also said that toward the end I told him I was looking at the tall being on top of the jetty, and left the beach to come home just after that,  He said I sounded really frightened all the while I was talking to him. Finally, I have to be perfectly honest and say that I had taken some extra pain medication that evening/night to deal with my back problems, and that they may very will have affected what I was saying on the phone to my friends, as my friend Tom suggested to me, but I do not believe that the pain meds effected my judgment in what I was seeing in any way.  Although I’m a marine biologist, I’m first and foremost a scientist.  As per the title of that UFO documentary, I know what I saw – and would be most willing to take a lie detector test or whatever.  I would love to go under hypnosis to find out what was really going on, especially with that figure on the jetty I saw – so if there is anyone out there who reads this report and is near the Ft. Myers FL area or who would like to come out to our beautiful little Island, just let me know. NOTE – Since that Monday night, I and four other shark fishing friends had two UFO sightings of a different type of “craft,” and saw for about 15 minutes a very strange glow, about the shape and size of that last little bit of sun right before it dips below the horizon, just over the Gulf horizon (the horizon is 7 miles out, and we figured the light was emanating from 10+miles out).  We all figured that whatever was producing the light had to be absolutely huge (following Wednesday night starting at 9 pm).  We had two other sightings that night, and I had sightings of other types of UFO’s the following four nights.  Since that time it’s been raining just about nonstop.  I will write up the other reports as soon as time allows, and will submit them too.  Quick update:  I saw the same two amber UFO’s described above (or something almost exactly the same), plus an orange-red one, approximately 6 to 7 miles due north of where Carol and I saw the other ones (no, they were not fireworks).  Report coming soon.  The time frame of all of these sightings so far is about the same – from just as the sky is getting totally dark, to 10 to 10:30 p.m. Follow up reports:  Wednesday 5/26/13  Sighting #1 - I and four other shark fishing friends were on the beach on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, close to the rock jetty on Blind Pass.  At 9:10 p.m., with just a little bit of light left in the sky, we saw an off-white light traveling from north to south (traveling from our right, facing the gulf of Mexico, to our left).  The object was about the size of Venus when it is full, but much dimmer, and was about 60 degrees above the horizon over the Gulf of Mexico.  It was traveling about two times the speed of a jet liner, but was only about 3/5ths the height.  It was not a satellite, which I’ve seen at least 100 of. We first saw it to the north, about 35 degrees to the right of us.  It took about a minute or so to reach straight out in front of us, and which point it started going on and off, but not in a strobe fashion.  Each on-and-off took about one half a second.  It took another minute or so reach the same degree south of us as it was to the north of us, when it just blinked out.  I was watching it through 10X42 binoculars and it appeared a little bit orangish. Sighting # 2 -  near the had two UFO sightings of a different type of “craft,” and saw for about 15 minutes a very strange glow, about the shape and size of that last little bit of sun right before it dips below the horizon, just over the Gulf horizon (the horizon is 7 miles out, and we figured the light was emanating from 10+miles out).

Then when my vision focused in on the object I noticed it was about 10 or so dimly lit white lights shaped in almost like an arrow formation.  There was a water tower in which the draft flew right over that I was able to use to compare the size of the craft.  The craft seemed to be significantly higher than the water tower but was still much larger in size.  At first it did not hit me how fast the object was moving but after realizing how quickly it moved from over top of me to the horizon I come to the conclusion that it was most definitely moving faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. The fact that I would take the time out of my day to fill this report speaks for itself of how confident I am that I just witnessed something extremely odd flying in the night sky.

What I thought were half a dozen lights turned into dozens and dozens if not a hundred or more as they continued to travel in the same direction in formations of 2 or 3 to as many as 5 or 6. There appeared to be two different types at least based on the size of the glowing orbs in relation to each other.  Too, a couple times I noticed smaller glowing balls of fire ""shoot out"" or zoom away from the larger orbs.  The slow moving herd of glowing balls of red/orange light may have had escorts of some kind, because I noticed two or three orbs moving faster than the others by themselves, not part of any of the larger formations.  I don't know for sure when they actually started flying by as I feel I walked in to the halfway point of a massive caravan, but it lasted until nearly 8:43pm.  Tried for pictures and video, but my phone wasn't up to the task. My family also witnessed the event, as did one coworker I texted to make sure he saw the stuff Im always yammering about.  I would be surprised if you weren't flooded with reports of this event and expect it to make the local news.  I feel the sheer volume of ""craft"" lumps it in with some of the larger sightings you hear about in Mexico or Arizona.  Dozens and dozens if not a hundred or more.

The tree was about twenty or thirty feet near us.  At this point, only I had seen the two lights. Calling my boyfriend's attention to it, the blue light beamed from between the tree's leaves, then dimmed to original brightness.  It moved perfectly backward, out from the tree, blue light still on the left side/white light on the right, to where it was in our view. We were in total awe as the white light grew blinding and the blue light changed into a powerful green and the (object, craft) seemed to come directly AT us. After glowing at a spotlight brightness, the craft backed away from us, dimming,and quickly hovered to the west behind another tree.  The lights magically turned softer and red.

We headed out onto the lake at approx. 19:40. I then moved my boat from Safety Island towards the North shore close to the East end of Celina.  The other boat was still heading West towards us when we arrived at the North shore as they had left the dock sometime after us.  My father called my brother to find out where we were and proceeded to tell us that he saw something in the sky towards the South shore at approx. 21:00.  We looked and immediately saw it directly South of Celina over the South Shore.  This would have been roughly a mile from my position, but we had a clear view over the lake.  The object started out as a ball of orangish light.  It appeared to drop some type flares every 2 or 3 seconds, lasting about 30 seconds. The flares appeared as if the kind that comes out of a roman candle.  Then the object would speed up and it looked as if there were two afterburners on each side and a large flame coming out of the backside of each on.  The flames coming out were very long.  The flames would go away, and the object would go back into just one light, dropping the flares again. This happened several times. One time the object started to change colors. I had my IPod and was able to catch the object with the flames visible and also when it was changing colors. I also took multiple pictures, however being that it was an IPod, completely dark and the distance, it is not the greatest quality. But you can incredibly see the ball change colors and throw the jet trails. Also, the object stayed in maybe a quarter mile area, did not come any closer or farther, and flew very tight, spinning and turning patterns. Could this have been UAV?  Possibly. I have no way to know.  I do have video and photographic evidence.  I searched the internet, but not find any postings or information! about this happening.  The entire event lasted around twenty minutes and the light just disappeared.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,40.5345,-84.6289

What I thought was weird is that it did not came from the atmosphere, it started to light up around the average altitude the airplanes were flying through.  Another thing was it did not have a contrail most shooting stars have when they are burning through the atmosphere.  Which I though was odd. I really believed it was going to hit the ocean due to how close it got.  At about 1000-2000 feet right before it would've made contact with earth it disappeared.

I looked to the east and saw the light again this time traveling very fast speeding to the north west along with all of the airplanes or jets traveling with it well behind heading roughly in the same direction this time there was many more planes or jets then there was the first time i had seen it.  it went out of sight very quickly this time within a minute and all the planes did to. then the sky was clear and i didn't see more then one or two planes in the next half hr. which was probably normal traffic,2013-11-11T00:00:00,43.1295,-71.1199

There was a bank of bright red, blue and green lights on the craft.  There were approximately 6-8 lights, all arranged in a horizontal configuration with a slight triangular positioning.  It passed slow from North to South and slowly banked to the North. Approximately at a height of 700-1500 feet high. While watching it proceed to the North, I noticed a second craft with similar lights, stationary to the East.  The first seemed to be approaching the second.  I opened the window and there was no noise I could discern from either.  I went for my camera, changed the lense and headed outside.  By the time I got outside, both were gone, but a singular white light had begun approaching from the distant North.  I waited and it was identified as a normal commercial Jet.  The lighting was not similar to the previous two. Two years ago I saw and reported on another site a very large, translucent triangular craft moving from the South to the North in this same area over our home...so I keep my eyes open. Our home is just North of the new NSA center in Lehi, and there is a nearby Helicopter base so I am familiar with the distinct differences in the types of Aircraft that overfly this route.

At approximately 6:15PM on August 23, 2013 my wife and I were traveling South along N 11 Mile Corner Road.  We were traveling at 55 - 60 mph and had just passed the intersection of N 11 Mile Corner Road and E. Kleck Rd..  It was daylight and the sun was above the horizon and West. We were and remain unable to identify a large shape we saw moving through the sky at that time. Initially, I noticed a large shape to my 10 o'clock at 15-20 degrees off the horizon.  It was about three quarters of a mile distant and was moving East to West, parallel to Highway 287 and perpendicular to our direction of travel.  I was about to dismiss the shape as a flock of birds until shimmering and/or reflected light caught my eye.  I noted the shape undulated and flowed as would a flock of birds, but there were no birds visible in or around the shape.  The shape was translucent with a diffuse edge. I could see sky through the shape.  I commented to my wife, ""What is that?"" as I slowed the vehicle.  My wife acknowledged seeing the shape and expressed curiosity as I continued to drive. We observed for about 10 seconds before it disappeared behind some trees:  Long enough to capture our interest but not long enough to get at the iPhone to document the event.  The shape reappeared and changed direction.  We observed the shape a second time for less than 5 seconds before it seemingly blended into the background and disappeared. Shortly after initially sighting the shape, it passed behind a water tower located West of N 11 Mile Corner Road. The tower is about 60 feet in height. We were roughly a half mile from the tower as the shape passed beyond it. The shape was roughly 3 times the height of the tower with a length to height ratio of about 4 to 1. An absolute size for the shape is difficult to estimate as the shape was some distance beyond the tower. The object made no sound that we could detect. The shape had no markings and appeared to be under its own power.  The overall geometry was rectangular.  It narrowed slightly at West end. Corners were poorly defined and slightly rounded.  The shape was thin, almost ribbon-like.  My wife remarked it resembled a transparent advertising banner that moved like a flock of birds as it reflected sunlight and shimmered.  However, it lacked a tow plane or any notable form of propulsion.  Within several seconds of passing behind the water tower the shape banked toward the ground and disappeared behind a growth of trees.  It emerged several seconds later having changed direction.  The shape was heading South at this point.  We lost sight within a few seconds of its reappearance as the it simply blended into the background.  I am a scientist by education (biochemist) and formally trained to observe.  I cannot explain what I saw. It was large. It moved under its own power.  It radiated and/or reflected light. It did not seem to belong in its surroundings.  It did not resemble any traditional flying object that I know of.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

The reports are well written, and the witness seems sincere, although we would be surprised if all of the sightings are about authentic UFOs, i.e. alien spacecraft.  We cannot be certain, however.  PD)) SOME CONCLUSIONS FROM THE PAST 27 SIGHTINGS I AND OTHERS HAVE HAD ON SANIBEL AND CAPTIVA ISLANDS, FLORIDA, OVER AN EIGHT WEEK PERIOD FROM JUNE 24 TO AUGUST 20, 2013  Based on what I and friends have witnessed I believe that:  1.	There has to be some reason that all these UFOs, and especially the “city on the horizon” glows, are in this particular area.  OR are they elsewhere along the coastline of SW Florida? 2.	I have a strong feeling that there may very well be some kind of underwater base in the area, especially in light of the sightings of the past 5 nights or so.  It makes sense because one would think that they have to be coming from somewhere, and underwater is as good a place as anywhere else, again considering strong evidence pointing in this direction. 3.	Amber, orange, and red “fireballs” are one and the same, and change colors for yet unknown reasons – they have been the predominant UFOs of the 7 different types have seen 4.	fireballs I've seen are directly associated with both single-light and multiple light strobe “flashers 5.	fireballs I've seen are closely associated with goldish-white elongated football shaped UFOs 6.	UGOs (Unidentified Glowing Objects) were directly associated with amber “fireball” UFOs at times, which changed color to orange and then red, just before one of them “dropped” a strobing object down to the ground or water. 7.	Other UGOs seen out on the Gulf of Mexico have been seen mostly in association with fireballs, except for once. 8.	Most UGO sightings have been at specific locations, but one did move to another area once 9.	Since my first sighting on June 24, 2013, I’ve been out sky watching 39 nights out of the 56 nights available to date (8/18/13) – 69.5 percent of the available time. 10.	UFOs and associated phenomenon have been sighted on nearly 70 percent of our outings!  That’s 27 sightings in 39 nights!! And on most of these nights, way more than a single UFO or other object were seen.  One report I’ve listed was from a man on nearby Cape Coral who described exactly what I and others have seen. 11.	Of the 38 times I or others have been out, we have had 27 sightings, which is 68% of the time. 12.	I have missed going out 18 of the available 56 nights, which is 32% of the available time. 13.	There have been 9 to 9.5 hours of darkness per night during the past 8 weeks, and I’ve primarily been out only 2 or so hours per night on average, 22 percent of the time.  What’s happening the other 80 percent of the time? 14.	It appears that the “action” has moved from where it started 2 months ago at my friends house on Sanibel Island, two miles to the south of me, to some 7 miles north off of the uninhabited island of Cayo Costa. 15.	Finally, if the right kinds of cameras were set up to view the area all night long, or if I could get some volunteers our here for a better than 50:50 chance of seeing something, then there would be a reasonable chance of figuring out what is really going on our here.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

During the evening of June 22, 2013, at about 8:45pm my sister and I along with my 13-year-old niece took our golf cart out for a ride in the resort area of Bay Creek, located in Cape Charles, Virginia.   We have a vacation home in the area and they were visiting for two nights.  The resort has two 18-hole golf courses and we went for a ride for about an hour enjoying the full moon, beautiful water on the golf courses and the views of the shores of the Chesapeake Bay.   We were hoping to see the Strawberry Moon and noticed the area was very quiet except for the frogs and pond and forest creatures that were quite loud. After about an hour, our golf cart ran out of its electrical charge leaving us stranded near the clubhouse.  Without cell phones we went to the clubhouse, now closed, at about 10:20pm and asked to use the phone to call my husband or daughter who were at our beach home.  When neither answered, we decided to walk home, about 2 miles.  The evening was beautiful and it was extremely quiet as we headed towards home.  We only passed 2 cars, both police vehicles and 4 people as we walked.  We crossed over Mason Avenue into the small town of Cape Charles from the golf area and headed north on Nectarine Street passing the Catholic Church on our left and commenting that the lights were on.   At that moment we heard a rumble of thunder and started to laugh about how not only had we ran out of the charge on our golf cart and had to walk home, but now we were about to get rained upon.  We walked another block and turned right onto Madison Avenue.  At the corner of Nectarine Street and Madison Avenue my sister noticed lights in the sky that were “shaped like a rollercoaster.” She asked me what I thought they were and I said “Fireworks?” “Well maybe they are planes from Norfolk- they have a military base there.”  I did not see those lights.  At this point we heard a second rumble of thunder. I quickly looked up and saw 12 distinct orangeish-yellow glowing lights in a perfect line.  The spacing between them was perfect and they appeared to be moving as one, towards us as if to land together.  They were hovering and completely silent.   We all started to run towards them and truly were captivated and curious, not at all frightened.   At this time I felt like I was running in slow motion.  We did not take our eyes off the sky for the entire duration. The pattern slowly changed into one perfect circle, and then within a couple of seconds two flying saucer shaped objects, almost as if half the lights formed one object and the other half formed the second.   The objects still were soundless and hovering but the lights were dimmed and I saw what looked like the outline of a flying saucer.  In fact I said, “Oh my God, it’s a flying saucer”, with my eyes focused on the one on the right.  We continued to run until we reached Fig Street during which time the lights changed again, this time into 4 groups of three lights each perfectly shaped into the outline of a triangle.  The lights were glowing and light yellowish orange but very clear and distinct to easily see with the naked eye. The objects changed again into 4 groups of three lights but this time four straight lines of three lights, all in a straight row with perfect spacing in between. At this point, wanting to get a better look, we ran about 30 yards north on Fig Street towards our neighborhood and stopped at a house with a clearing and watched as each light slowly faded and disappeared in a random pattern with one remaining that flickered on and off two or three times.  At that point we noticed the rosy glow around the moon, which we thought was the Strawberry Moon, we were looking for.  The sighting took place over a thick grove of trees, which has a large field behind it, close to Route 13 North.  During the entire experience one truck passed us and we saw no one.  The entire experience seemed to last longer than the likely 7-8 minutes and I felt like everything was in slow motion.    I think the sighting was from about 10:47pm-10:55pm  We arrived back home at 11:17pm to find my husband and daughter sleeping.  We got in the car and drove straight to the police station and pounded on the door hoping they could explain what we had seen and also wondering if anyone else had reported it.  No one answered the door. We then looked up UFO sightings and found your website and called in a report. The next morning my husband drove with me to the police station and again no one answered the door.   We also drove near the forest of trees and the field behind it to see if anything was there and there was nothing. I have never witnessed anything like this before and am uneducated and uninformed about UFO’s and sightings like this.  Besides ET, I’ve never watched a movie about UFO’s. I would very much like to have an explanation or help understanding what we witnessed.  My 13-year-old niece thought another country was invading or attacking us.  I thought perhaps there was some sort of secret mission involving our military and my sister was certain of what she saw and had no explanation.   The perfect symmetry of the lights, the formations of the shapes and the silence of the experience was startling as was my emotional response of utter intrigue rather than fear or anxiety.   What started out as a light-hearted golf cart ride in the moonlight ended up as a rare and somewhat unsettling experience.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,37.2542,-75.9602

I was driving my vehicle on 67 North towards the Mapleview exit at approximately 6:45 am on 10/17/13.  The sun had not risen above the horizon yet and the sky was getting light.   There are two mountains directly east of there about 50 miles away with a “valley” in between.  I saw a spot in the sky that was as bright as the sun but was only “aspirin” size in the sky. I didn't know what it was but knew it wasn't a star or plane as stars and planes are not that bright from that distance.  It was like a little piece of the sun in the early morning sky.  As I sat at the stoplight, I watched the light in the sky slowly move in a northerly direction by noticing how it moved with a stationary object, a tree, as my focal point.  Then all of a sudden a second and third light appeared. One of the lights was sort of elongated, almost like a shooting star with a tail but not.  It seemed kind of stationary, but I also got the feeling it was moving in a southerly direction. The third light was a little bigger than the first light and appeared like it was moving in a northerly direction.  As traffic started moving, I tried to keep watch.  The lights stayed for a few moments and then all of them disappeared.  As I continued up the hill on 67 North, I saw one of the lights had come back.  I then traveled too far to see it anymore and don’t know how long it stayed there. When I arrived at work in Poway, I watched the area periodically from a second story window, but the sun had risen by then and it was too bright.  I didn't see them again.  As I drove to work the following morning, I looked for the lights but they were not there. On 10/19/13, we went to dinner with our neighbors and I mentioned the incident to them.  My neighbor told me that on 10/17/13 she was stopped at the stoplight before getting on the freeway, and was giving some money to the panhandler standing there.

The light is brighter than the planet Venus at its brightest and bigger in diameter.   The light object begins to dim then three other lights to the left of it appeared.  They were small and dim.  A total of four lights all together.   From left to right the colors are a dim white, a dim red, a dim orange and a dim white(the brightest light) that.  A few seconds later the farthest light became bright again as before.   The other lights were not noticeable when the bright light would be at its brightest.  Then it would dim and then get bright again for about three more times.   Then at around 18:31 the far right brightest light dimmed down and was in sync with the other lights.  All the lights begun to flash two to three times then all lights went dark.  The witness waited five minutes and the lights did not reappear.  The witness goes back inside the witnesses work.  Five minutes later the witness goes outside again to check if the lights were anywhere but could not be seen. The city the where the witness viewed the light object from is Monrovia, CA.  The area where the Light Objects or Light Spheres was seen is in the San Gabriel Mountains in the area four to eight miles north of Azusa, CA.  The heading from Monrovia would be North-North East.   From the witness point of view, the object was well above the top of the mountains.  The time frame when the Light Objects seen is 18:28 to 18:31.

It was a very clear night, and I was looking at the stars as I walked.  My attention went to my dog for a minute or two when we reached the empty lot, and then I glanced back up at the sky.  Upon looking up at the sky, I was somewhat taken back by the amount of bright lights in the sky.  It took me a minute to try to interpret what I was looking at, because there was no easy explanation for what it could be.  There were at least eight bright red lights in the sky. The bright red lights were at a 45º angle to the West of me.  They were well above the mountains, so I knew that it was not any structure.  Additionally, the lights were not moving in relation to each other, nor were they moving in unison.  They were very bright red lights that suddenly appeared, and were remaining motionless in the sky.  There may have been more than eight, but when I got over the surprise of seeing them and began to count, there were eight.  Right after I counted the lights, one of the two top most lights, dimmed slightly, then came back to its original brightness, and then went out.  For a moment, there seemed to be a very dim white light where the red light had been… then nothing. I ran back to my house, about a half block away, and looked for my binoculars.  By the time I found them and ran out to the back of my house, there were only five lights left in the sky.  In looking at them through the binoculars, I could still only see the lights, rather than what they were attached to.  My girlfriend quickly put on warm clothing to go outside, and by the time she got out there, she was able to see two of the lights that were left.  I then decided to try to video record the lights, and ran back into my house for the camera.  By the time I got back with the camera, all of the lights were gone. Within minutes, I called the non-emergency police number asking if anyone else had seen, and reported, the lights.  While still on the phone with the dispatcher, a police officer called me asking what I had seen.  The officer told me that a woman across town had also seen the lights, and had also gotten pictures and video of them.  He said that what the other witness had seen, were five “copper colored” lights in the sky. After talking with the police, my girlfriend and I went back out to the vacant lot to see if there were any more lights in the sky.  There were no more unusual lights, but there were several jets in the sky going back and forth in the area that the bright red lights had been in.  I spoke to another police officer the next morning, and he told me that he had seen two military jets flying together in that area of the sky that morning. This is the approximate positions of the bright red lights, in relation to themselves, that I saw: *   *   *    * *   *    *    *  They all seemed to be paired up, with a uniform distance between them, with the exception that one of the four in the middle group was a little farther away from its “wing man”.  The lights began disappearing from the top down, and within a few minutes of the last bright red light disappearing, there were jets in the sky going back and forth.  From the time I first saw the lights, to when the last one disappeared, was about seven to ten minutes.  I am presently attempting to contact the other witness in order to triangulate, to determine the distance and location of the lights.  It appeared that they were over a wilderness area, which I would like to investigate. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally serious-minded.

Extremely fast moving triangular craft with white spheres observed over Huntington Beach.  ((NUFORC Note:  Pilot report.

The high school is located in Huntington Beach, California at the GPS coordinates (N 33 40.678, W 118 00.179).  I had just finished my run and was sitting on the edge of the track while my friend finished her laps.  There were no other people present.  I was listening to my MP3 player with earbuds, but the music volume was not loud.  As I was stretching from my workout, I looked up to the sky.  Nearly directly above my head at about 70 degrees altitude from the southwestern horizon, I instantly focused on a triangular shaped object traveling at a very quick pace toward the northeast.  I quickly ascertained that the object was a craft of some sort and not birds flying in formation because at each point of the triangle was a large white sphere.  The spheres and craft traveled in perfect coordination as if it was part of one solid structure.  Its altitude was low enough that I could also see defined lines on the the leading edges and also on what I would assume was the aft edge since its orientation was flying in the direction of one of the triangle's converging points.  From what I could see, I would estimate it to be a near perfect equilateral triangle.  The spheres were large enough that they extended beyond the triangle's points.  In other words, it appeared that they were not contained within the inside of the triangle, but perhaps attached to the points.  I was not able to determine if the middle area of the triangle was solid because the color was indistinguishable from the dark sky above.  The spheres did not appear to be self illuminated and there were no position marker, navigation, strobe, landing, beacon, or other lights visible.  The stadium lights were not in operation around the football field.  Consequently, the area where we were located in the stadium was quite dark.  If it were not for the mercury lights of the parking lot at the Seacliff Shopping Center across the street to the north and the baseball fields to the south, I'm not sure I could have seen the object as clearly as I did.  I felt as if any illumination I was see! ing was coming from the lights across the street.  Our location was shadowed from the direct lights in the parking lot because of the bleachers.  However, it seemed that the craft was low enough, yet still well above the height of the stadium that the underside of the spheres were reflecting the parking lot lights.  As noted previously, I did have my MP3 playing, but the volume was very low and I could not hear any sounds from the craft as it passed overhead.  One thought that occurred to me was if it were possible that this craft were constructed of some sort of lighter-than-air balloon, perhaps three weather balloons attached to a rigid frame to hold them in perfect formation.  I very quickly dismissed this theory however when the object tracked from where I was sitting, to an area to the northeast I estimate to be between 3/4 mile to just over 1 mile away.  It covered this distance in under 5 seconds.  Conservative calculations place it traveling somewhere between 500-800 mph.  There was no perceptible wind so I would dismiss any light object simply floating in the air and carried by the current, especially at such an incredible rate of speed.  I also estimate the altitude to be 700 ft. MSL or lower (calculations explained below).  There were no visible clouds in the sky except for a! faint, marine haze in the northeast section of my view.  As are most high school stadiums, the bleacher structures are built on both sides of the field, but there is no seating at the end-zones.  There is a sizable wall and gates around the whole stadium.  However, I was far enough away from the wall where I was sitting that I had a fairly unobstructed view of the horizon just to to the right of the northern bleachers.  At this angle, when the craft passed overhead, I saw it briefly pass through part of a hazy cloud.  It was such a thin and wispy cloud that I could see it move around the form of the craft, but not obstruct it from view completely.  This was about three seconds after first viewing the object.  The object continued along a straight trajectory, not descending or climbing from what I could determine.  At approximately 5 seconds, the triangle had traveled far enough away that it faded from view.  More than likely, it did not accelerate or actually disappear, but the fade was the result of the same marine haze and excessiv! e ambien t lighting from the commercial lighting described above.  Approximately one and a half minutes after the sighting, my friend had rounded the track to where I was sitting and I excitedly told her that I thought I had just witnessed a UFO.  She quickly replied that she had seen the object as well.  She began to tell me what she had witnessed.  Even though we were both wanted to share details, I asked her to wait until she could write down her account, so as to try and avoid contaminating either one of our memories.  At that point, I returned to where I had placed a backpack and I retrieved my cell phone.  I called my father who lives in another state to tell him about the incredible sighting and see if he could assist in gathering current weather data from the Internet.  My outgoing call was logged at 9:27 pm (0427 Zulu).  About three minutes into the call, I looked into the sky at about the same point where I had first sighted the triangular object.  Suddenly, I caught caught sight of two more objects traveling at about the same spe! ed, but on a 180 degree reverse heading from where the triangle was spotted.  In effect, they appeared they were returning along the same vector (altitude, heading, and speed) as the first object, but they were shaped differently.  Lacking a better way to describe them, they appeared to me to have the shape of fighter jets, but they were completely white in color and flying in such tight formation that they were almost touching each other (one slightly ahead of the other).  I assumed they were either slightly smaller in size than the triangular object or higher in altitude.  It was difficult to estimate, but the two of them combined were about 2/3 the size of the triangle.  I would best describe them as having a defined nose section (such as a fighter jet) and then swept back, short wings with a broader tail section (where the horizontal tail section would be on a conventional plane).  To be accurate, I am not quite sure about the overall silhouette as this was only one qui! ck impression and they were more difficult to see than the fir! st objec t.  They most certainly did however appear to have wings of some sort and a defined nose section.  I again quickly dismissed the possibility of birds or objects carried by the wind because of their speed and lack of wing motion. As with the triangle, there were no lights observed on either one of the craft and they did not appear to be illuminated, but perhaps reflecting city lights on their undersides.  Unlike the triangle, I did note that they did appear to be uniformly solid in color (white) and not transparent or colored the same as the sky.  The disappeared over the tops of the high school buildings to the southwest, in the direction of the ocean.  Because of the time of the phone call, I estimated this sighting to be at approximately 9:30 pm with a duration of less than 4 seconds. At the time of this second sighting, I no longer had my MP3 playing, nor did I have the earbuds in my ears.  There was no perceptible sound detected from the two craft or anywhere in the sky.  I pointed out the objects to my friend who was now standing about 20 feet or so away.  She confirmed my description of them.  I promptly ended the phone call and attempted to turn on my smartphone's video recorder.  I had the recorder ready in case anything else should appear, but knowing the low-light filming capabilities of my phone, I was certain it was pointless to hope to capture such dim images on the device.  Shortly after, I took a compass reading from an application on my phone and we packed up our belongings in order to quickly get to a computer where I could gather more information. My friend's description of the first object differed slightly from mine.  She first spotted the craft as she was rounding the track on the northeast side.  The track is oriented lengthwise from east to west.  Consequently, she looked up just at the last few seconds it was fading from view, but appears to perhaps have seen it longer than I did before it completely faded.  Her perspective of apparent motion and speed were also different because it had already passed from overhead and was distancing itself when she caught sight of it.  As recorded in her own words:  ""I saw a strange object that caught my attention while running.  It was in the formation of a triangle, but it seemed to have several objects that were forming that triangle.  It wasn't very high, definitely not a plane, it was not illuminated.  Initially I thought it might be a flock of birds, but it was a triangle shape not a V shape and the objects were much bigger than birds and it would have taken several birds to make the triangle as big as it was.  It was almost as if they looked like styrofoam Dixie cups clustered inside the triangle.  The object didn't hover to a stop, but it was slow moving and then it disappeared completely out of sight.  I looked beyond the clouds and there was nothing.""   Witnesses:  At this time, there are only two known witnesses to this event- myself and the female friend who was running with me at the track. Regarding my background, I am a 35 year old television host and producer living in Orange County, California.  I do host a popular reality and investigation-based cable television show that among other phenomena, explores reports of UFO activity.  I have spoken on the UFO subject at several UFO conferences and am known for taking a neutral and skeptical approach to investigating UFO events.  In the 20 plus years of researching the UFO phenomenon and within the several years of working on our show, I have become quite familiar with most misidentifications of birds, balloons, conventional aircraft, remote control craft, and hoaxes.  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Sociology with certifications in Criminology and Corrections.  My previous careers include working for several years in criminal and national security investigations at both the state level and as a federal law enforcement agent.  I formerly held a Top Secret security level clearance which is eligible for reactivation.! I have held a current FAA Private Pilot's license since 1995 and have piloted small single engine planes in the general vicinity of the sighting.  Consequently, I'm familiar with FAA Federal Air Regulations regarding aircraft lighting requirements and the use of airspace within the Huntington Beach area.  I'm familiar with the basic capabilities of commercial and military aircraft known to the public.  My friend is a 32 year old female also living in Orange County, California.  She formerly was employed in banking compliance where her duties required monitoring and investigating reports of fraud.  She stated she has never before seen unexplained objects such as were witnessed.  Although she has a passing interest in the UFO phenomenon, she has not studied it and considers herself skeptical to unexplained events.  Weather Conditions:  I obtained current weather information from aviationweather.gov.  The nearest airports to my location are John Wayne Orange County (KSNA) and Los Alamitos Army Airfield (KSLI).  Los Alamitos was exactly 8.3 miles to the northwest from my location and SNA was 7.65 miles to the east.  Accepting that there would be slight differences in the temperatures and winds between the two airports, I wanted a good average.  Fountain Valley which is 3 miles to the northeast also had reported information, but not the detailed cloud heights like aviation reports.  At 9:29 pm (0427 Zulu), Fountain Valley was reporting a temperature of 64 deg. F. with a dewpoint of 56 deg.  Relative humidity was 75% with winds out the the south southwest at 8 mph. Barometric pressure of 29.83 inches and visibility of greater than 10 miles.  Orange County Airport (SNA) reported in a Terminal Area Forecast (TAF) at 0453 Zulu (a little over 30 minutes after the event) that the wind was out of 250 degrees at 3 knots.  Visibility was greater than 10 statute miles.  Temperature was 67 deg. F. with dewpoint of 50 deg. and relative humidity of 55%.  Barometric pressure was 29.82 inches.  The cloud ceiling was broken at 25,000 feet AGL.  Within the next 4 hours at 0900 Zulu, the forecast was expecting a few clouds at 700 feet AGL.  At Los Alamitos, the conditions were relatively the same.  It was forecast that starting at 0400 Zulu (9:00 pm) the winds were variable at 6 knots with 6 or more miles visibility with clear skies.  According to the US Naval Observatory, the Moon was in the waning crescent phase (36% visible) but it was not seen in the sky at my location.  The moonrise was not to take place until 2:46 am on Saturday.  This eliminated it as a possible light source for the reflecting light coming off the spheres.  Trajectory, Altitude, and Size Estimates:  I measured the trajectory heading to be 39 or 40 degrees from magnetic north.  Using aeronautical sectional charts, the plotted course placed the object traveling nearly perpendicular to the Pacific Coastline.  The beach is less than a mile from where I observed the craft.  Every indication from its speed made me believe that it had entered over land from the ocean.  If the heading is extended in both directions, it crosses directly over Catalina Island and continues down a corridor between two sides of a National Defense Operating Area where aircraft are warned of military training.  If the heading is followed to the northeast, it continues directly over Corona and then Riverside Airport, which is in the general vicinity of March Air Force Base.  As I'm familiar with the marine layer that often passes over the area when I fly planes, I judged the height of the object to be less than 1,000 feet.  This was supported by the fact that the haze was clearly detailed and visible when it obscured part of the craft as it sped by.  The weather forecast in the nearby area had also expected a few clouds at 700 feet.  Using the assumed altitude and comparing the angular size of a known object, I was able to arrive at a rough estimate.  The known object I compared size to was the Moon.  Because the Moon was not visible in the sky at the time, I measured it at a later time and used its known distance and size to arrive at the unknown object's size.  My best estimate is that the object was no larger than 25 feet in length from the front point to the aft edge.  Conclusions and Speculations:  I feel comfortable categorizing this event as a UFO sighting in the literal sense of the term- the craft is still an Unidentified Flying Object.  As with most UFO cases, I find it easier to determine what it was not, rather than what it was.  As stated previously, I feel I have satisfactorily eliminated any possibility that the craft was a lighter-than-air balloon or floating object carried by the wind.  Weather reports indicated that at most, winds were no more than 8 mph and generally from the west or southwest.  Wind direction corresponded to roughly the same direction the triangular object was heading, but not at all to the direction the two smaller objects were traveling.  If any relationship exists between the two sightings, which would seem logical, then the second sighting has objects flying directly into the wind and would therefore indicate self-propulsion.  Any discussion of wind driven objects is quite ridiculous in my opinion once the relative speed of the craft! is taken into account.  Nothing short of the most severe hurricane or tornado could push an object to travel even half the speed of what we observed.  The objects were not birds.  As discussed previously, both my friend and I were certain we witnessed a triangular object.  In my case, I saw 3 spheres as part of a rigid triangle with defined edges.  She also saw a triangle with a defined outline and states that she saw several more spheres within the shape.  I also know a little more about birds and flight behavior than the average person as I'm a licensed falconer.  The craft was not a hang glider, nor was it an object towed by another aircraft.  Banner towing companies will often fly banner advertisements over the beach during the day, but there were no aircraft in the immediate area and no sounds of a plane.  I'm also hang gliding certified and I know of no hang gliding operations in the area.  Again, the speed of the craft also precludes either one of theses explanations.  Finally, the thought of some type of remote controlled plane or multi-rotor copter was a consideration.  Although some remote controlled craft can reach extreme speeds, I find it very unlikely that anything hobby or law enforcement related could travel at such a rate.  Additionally, as I know from filming with an aerial remote control copter, anyone flying such a device out of line-of-site would require doing so by onboard cameras and video transmission or via completely autonomous flight.  The equipment needed to fly POV in the dark, would be tremendously expensive.  Similarly, it's an extremely costly and dangerous maneuver to fly by programmed waypoints without visual reference.  Doing so over a very populated area known to have police helicopters and other aircraft does not make sense.  The military comes to mind as the only organization with drone capability even remotely close to what we witnessed.  However, at 700 feet altitude and at such a tremendous speed, I would ! expect to hear significant sounds of a fuel propulsion system.  The craft in both sightings were completely silent.  I have no way of confirming whether the craft were piloted or remotely operated.  It seems appropriate to declare however that their propulsion system is unconventional as belonging to any publicly known commercial or military craft.  Although delta wing craft have been manufactured by the military, the lack of noise at the estimated speed and altitude is unexplainable by conventional means.

On Friday, May 3rd, 2013 at approximately 21:45 hrs, while traveling westbound on Hwy-20 between the cities of Sedro Wooley and Burlington in Skagit county, WA, I witnessed three unidentified flying objects traveling south-by-southeast over the east end of Burlington proper.   In addition to myself and my companion - in whose truck we were traveling at the time - the event was witnessed by several other people. 	About 1 mile west of District Line Rd we looked up and witnessed three large amber/orange orbs overhead at about 15 degrees to the right of our due-west heading on Hwy-20, moving right-to-left on a straight and level course and approaching the roadway about 1/4 mile ahead of us. Rather than appearing as merely radiant ""light balls"" without definable edges or borders, like one might expect a bare, bright bulb to appear at a distance at night, these objects had an appearance more like that of a translucent sphere, like a ping-pong ball, that was being intensely illuminated from within. While the light emanating from these orbs was indeed bright enough to somewhat obfuscate the object within, they were still recognizable as appearing solid and spheroid. In addition, the intensity of the illumination seemed to slowly, rhythmically, and very briefly dip very slightly, or negatively ""pulse,"" at a frequency of approximately once every second, though not in sync! with one another. This was not a sharp, sudden dip, but a smooth, analog change, again, very brief. We immediately pulled over to better observe this phenomenon and were quickly joined at the side of the road by several other witnesses who had also pulled to the shoulder and exited their respective vehicles. The objects were moderately large - to scale: about the size of one's thumbnail when held at arm's length - and were arranged in a scalene triangular pattern with the two objects that were closest to one another - the span between them approximately equal to the width of three fingers held at arm's length - leading the group, and the single remaining object trailing at approximately 4-5 that distance behind the first two. All three objects were at approximately 400-500 feet and were moving relatively slowly at about 35-45 kts. The objects maintained their heading, speed, and relative position until they were almost directly over Hwy-20, at which time the trailing orb q! uickly accelerated to a rate of travel roughly 2.5-3 times tha! t of it' s original speed, without changing its heading, until it was approximately the same distance away from each of the two leading orbs that they were apart from one another, and resumed its original speed, pacing its two fellows and forming a rough isosceles triangle. The three objects then continued to travel together, remaining equidistant and still on the same heading, until they were approximately 20-25 degrees to the left of Hwy-20, (or 340-345 degrees to our original, due-west heading) at which time the trailing orb again began to move relative to the two leading objects, this time in a slow arc to the right (westerly), while ascending slightly, in a standard-rate, or ""two minute"" turn, and at about 45 degrees into this turn began to quickly grow dimmer until at about 60 degrees into the turn, while still moving, it vanished completely. The remaining two ""leading"" objects continued on for only a moment more - maybe 3-5 seconds - before the westmost orb! began its own apparent standard-rate turn, this time to the left, while maintaining its speed and elevation, which brought it in a swinging arc behind its fellow, until at approximately 50-55 degrees into the turn it again resumed straight and level flight, this time traveling almost exactly due east. It continued on this heading until it was almost due south of our position at the side of the road (or about 270-275 degrees to our original, due-west heading) at which time it also began to quickly dim in intensity until it, too, vanished. The remaining orb, which did not deviate from it's speed or heading during the entire event, continued on its south-by-southeast track for approximately 5-10 more seconds until it, too, dimmed and vanished, though it seemed to do so at about twice the rate of its fellows. The entire event was about 60-75 seconds in duration. 	It bears mentioning at this point that when the latter two orbs dimmed and vanished they were at a position in the sky where, from our vantage, they were moderately back-lit by the ""skyglow"" illuminating the night sky directly above the city of Mt. Vernon, WA, which at that moment was behind, and in line with, the position of the objects we were viewing. The net effect of this was to provide enough light value contrast to easily silhouette any unilluminated objects of that size, and there was none. The objects seemed to not only dim and cease emanating light, but to in fact disappear altogether. I feel fairly confident in this assessment as several onlookers, including myself, commented that we could clearly see much smaller, finer objects silhouetted, such as the telephone and power cables and small tree limbs in the same viewing field. I would also state at this point that I was in combatant naval aviation for years and have had extensive aircraft and attitude r! ecognition training, and as such I am confident that what I saw was not an aircraft in the traditional sense: There was no evidence of red or green right-of-way lighting, nor was there any anti-collision strobes or navigation lighting visible. There was also no sound whatsoever discernible above the ambient ground traffic noise. Several attempts were made by my companion and others to photograph the objects, albeit with less-than-ideal cell phone cameras, and while other lights and heavenly bodies were evident in the resulting photographs, no one could get a shot of the objects in question. I am not qualified to speculate as to why this was, though it did seem strange that such large and brightly lit targets were not visible to the cameras. Several minutes later two fast moving aircraft approached from the southwest at approximately 1k-1.2k ft and entered the airspace above Burlington, WA, and after having overflown the town split in a ""Y"" commenced large, half-rate turns in their respective CW and CCW circles over the township and surrounding county.  They continued to circle overhead for 12-15 minutes and then turned to the southwest and departed the area. It was speculated that these may have been EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft dispatched from NAS Whidbey Is., WA, located in Oak Harbor, WA, several minutes to the southwest by air.  But again, this is only speculation as identification of specific aircraft at that altitude at night with the naked eye is nearly impossible.",2013-05-15T00:00:00,48.5323,-122.3184

As I was driving an early AM paper route this morning, I noticed in the Eastern sky a large, bright silver-white light strobing in an alternating pattern with a single red light.  The red light, oriented to the South of the craft, would flash first, followed about ¼ second later by the white light.  The red light was flashing about once per second.  The craft at first was moving in a Northward direction, then after a few minutes, it began to move southward. I noted that there was no sound, and the craft seemed very low in the sky, maybe 3,000- 5,000 ft.   I am not a good judge of altitude, but it occurred to me that had it been a plane, it would have been making a landing approach to be that low or close.  Also, had it been a helicopter, I would most definitely have heard the chopping propeller sound since it was so close.  There was never any jet or chopper noise, and I had my window rolled down completely in the vehicle. As I proceeded southward along my route, moving from the Keyport region, into Brownsville/Illahee, I was able to periodically track the motion of the object at certain points where the view to the East allowed.  It continued gliding slowly in both directions (North for a few minutes, then South, always remaining to my East out over the Puget Sound.)  At one point during the sighting, I noticed that it appeared to have changed orientation and I could see three solid bright white/silver lights in a line, (maybe facing toward me, rather than parallel to me.)  I thought that it might be a triangular shape and that the three lights denoted the tips.  The middle light seemed to be a little brighter or larger, maybe due to being closer from my perspective.   The entire sighting took place over a period of 20-30 minutes between about 2:45 AM and 3:15 AM.

At approx 03:00am on May 04 2013 while walking around the backside of our property (top of Wedekind rd. & McCarran blvd in Reno, Nevada), a slight (yet rather noticeable) motion within my periphery had grabbed my attention.  I turned to look up toward the south end of town. At about 20*deg above average horizon there was an object moving upward at a slight arc from the east.  The object traveled at a speed of approx 2+*deg per/second across the sky towards the west/s.west direction.  This is quite a bit faster than any satellite I would usually see at this hour. The size of the object if compared to a satellite (without assuming any equal distance in orbit, but merely by observable perspective) would be like comparing the sharpened tip of a pencil (satellite) with the eraser of a pencil (object) held at arms length.  The shape was of an oval, but lacked a solidly defined edge entirely. The object could have been dismissed entirely as a massive satellite ( perhaps the I.S.S. on re-entry?) or even a commercial airliner below 20,000ft.  Instead of completing an arc across the sky, it abruptly changed it's course ¾ the way and dropped downward, as if it just suddenly fell from the sky (in a very fast & controlled manner). The whole time this was being witnessed I had this very strange feeling that this object had become very aware that it was being watched, I felt this most intensely just before it fell towards the earth, as if offended by my staring at it.  However, the disturbing part had to be the way it was illuminated (or lack of illumination).  It was a VERY dark orange/pink color. It seemed as if it absorbed it's light from its surroundings, almost like some kind of parasitic negative image, or maybe like a black-hole. It glowed.... yet, it didn't.  It's surface was like a soft dark rubberized orange/pink haze... it glowed like it it was lit by some distant black-light tube.  But I swear it consumed the surrounding light like a vampire.

Girlfriend and I were driving down RT 115 (Tandberg Trail), slowly approaching an accident cleanup/line crew work scene and upon leaving the slowed down zone noticed 2 glowing objects in the sky- perfectly described by a previous poster as Oriental Floating Candle Light shapes or small circular hot air balloon baskets (with no balloons!).   We pulled over to get a better view and take some pictures and a video with my phone. After pulling over and eliminating the radio noise listened carefully and only heard car traffic- no sound at all came from the two shapes. As I was recording the first 2 shapes another similar one came overhead.  These objects were at Helicopter flying height- no more than 1,000 - 3,000 feet in the air.  I can only assume 6' x 6' - 10' x 10' in size. They were glowing bright as if like a flame or as if they were lit up from the sun, but the sun was far too gone past the horizon to possibly shine light on an object that close to the ground. They quickly moved across the road and towards the tree line and further, as they approaching that range (closer to the sun's downed direction) they became dark from yellow to orange/red then to black- and before disappearing rapidly out of sight they were pitch black in the darkening blue sky. After many years of working around helicopters and witnessing many types of aircraft in my life I have never seen an object that fits anything near the description of what I saw- and apparently as I've read in the Maine sighting log- several people have seen exactly what I have over the past few years...",2013-05-15T00:00:00,,

It was a massive, massive ""globe"" in the sky and it was moving slowly down, and changed directions a few times in a 90 degree turn which no man made machine could do.  I'd say it had to be at least the size of a football field if not several football fields.  The glow from it was intense white light and seem to have a glow around it.  It wasn't just moving down like a meteor or anything, it was flying with power, changing directions, down, up, left, and right.  It wasn't too far above the high clouds.  I'm a believer now!  It wasn't from this planet!  I made some videos of it and posted them to Youtube.  Sorry about the shakiness of them, they were taken holding my cell phone, and I was also drunk off my ass at the time.  I googled it and another guy has a Youtube video up as well so it was real as i wasn't the only one who got a video of it!  Here are the links to my Youtube page. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTzej49FrII   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juCTxhcaVvM   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbpDu029NTU   It would be nice if someone can tell me what the heck was it?! ((FOUR ADDENDA FROM WITNESS)) 1  It's not a hoax or the moon.  I took the video and saw it for myself as well as my mother.   The thing was moving.  The moon doesn't move.  The moon is also not that bright.  It also moved in 90  degree angles.   It was real.  I saw it. 2.  LOL.  No.  This might be what  you do for a living but it's not that big a deal to us.  I just sent you the report and video because you are the first one that popped up on Google and I thought someone interested in that stuff might like to see it.  Mom is almost 80 with Diabetes complications.  She comes out onto the balcony I think in video #3 and you can hear her getting angry because the cement floor is cold and at me.  You can hear her comment on it for yourself in the video.  I was a bit drunk at the time so excuse my commentary in the videos.  Whatever it was, it was real and very large and definitely moving in different directions.  I think in video #4 or #5 on my Youtube channel you can see it disappear completely and then come back.  The moon doesn't disappear last time I checked.  I only had my cell phone and I guess did a crappy job of filming it.  I'll see if it returns tonight and do a better job.  I'm not a nut job and don't chase UFO's.  I saw something in the sky that wasn't from this planet or some secret craft that no-one is telling anyone about and took some videos.  3.  I'm on Orcas Island looking south.  It was about at 2 Oclock in the sky so would be over San Juan Island, but a lot further out  It was a very clear night.  Clearest I've seen in a very long time.  A few clouds drifting which you see on the videos.  I talked with some of the local stores and showed the video on my phone and they didn't see anything.  I sent an email to Seattle King 5 news and Fox News.  The local convenient store owner said, yes it was a strange looking clear night that we haven't had in a long time.    I Googled it and this guy posted pretty much the same thing I saw.  He says it was in the Seattle area which is about 40 miles maybe by air? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1nqxyEAJ9M&feature=youtube_gdata But, his Youtube is full of UFO stuff.  So, I'm skeptical.  But, it was in the same night.  Could he be a UFO buff and just happen to see the same thing as me?  I don't know.  It's not possible I'm the only one.  My god, it was the biggest brightest light in the sky that should have not been there and was moving for 30 minutes in directions that stuff doesn't do.  Nothing does that!  There have to be others who saw it. I'm watching the sky tonight right now.  About an hour from last nights time.  It's a little cloudy now.  No where as clear as last night.  No sign of a moon.  I've started to question, could I have been that drunk and it was the moon and the clouds made it look like it was moving?  I still say no.  Mom says no.  I should have made the camera steady so it could prove the movement.  Tonight will be the proof.  The moon only moves so much from night to night and so in an hour I will see if there is a moon up there close to the same spot.   Thanks 4.  Yep it was the moon.  I'm apparently the biggest dumb ass in history!  I guess the clouds made it look like it was moving.  My apologies. ((END",2013-11-20T00:00:00,48.6576,-122.8119

The night sky was clear of clouds and I was able to see the stars.   I was just watching them before I fell asleep and I noticed that one of them was flashing.  I stand up and walk to my window and it was still flashing.   So I squint my eyes and it comes into view, the object seemed to be moving towards me, it was flashing white and red, erratic flashing that was and hard for me to get an exact eye on it.   I couldn’t make out if it was one object or multiple, so I ran downstairs grabbed my binoculars.  When I came back up to look, the binoculars didn’t help any (too far away and made it fuzzy) so I went back to observing it.    By this time I was able to make out a shape, it was triangular and the lights were no longer erratic and presented with three sided white and red blinking one in the middle. But then they began flashing again, but red light only.  They began rotating clockwise making what I can only describe as a star shape design up and down the length of the object.  As it flashed up and down one end it moved on to the next making a five sided design that looked like a star.  By then it had stopped moving forward and stayed in the same spot for over an hour doing the star light display.   I tried taking a video with my phone but my adrenaline was pumping hard making my hand so unsteady that I gave up after 10 seconds.  When I look at the video you can see the red lights but it’s blurry and at the time I was convinced it was too far away for me to take video of least of all with a camera phone so I stopped.  I was so shocked by what I was seeing that I was googling on my phone trying to see if there was a radio tower nearby (there’s not) because I’ve only been living here for over a year and wanted to determine if there was a rational explanation for what I was seeing.   While I always believed in UFO’s I never imagined I would be seeing one from inside my bedroom!   I will keep my eyes out and document better if I’m lucky enough to see one again!

There was a mild to moderate overcast at that time which did make it difficult to see the object clearly.  The object itself illuminated the overcast clouds as it passed, you could see that the object was glowing white (almost with a welding light's intensity) with a bluish aura.  There was no tail of light or streaking as is common with comets.   The shape of the light was egg-like with more defined indentions.

They traveled in the same direction as the first, and disappeared almost in the same area as the first.  Each red ball disappeared slightly apart from the others. From our angle, it appeared to be a ball of fire, not huge, smaller than an observable plane.

September 22, 2013 UFO Over Albuquerque, NM   This morning at around 0600 my husband and I were walking in a park near our house.  On the way there we noticed a bright, white light in the eastern sky which appeared to be stationary over the mountains.  We thought the light would be gone quickly but it remained in the sky for about 2 hours or more. We called a local radio station to report it and the man who answered said he saw it too this morning but it looked red (most likely due to the sunrise).  He thought it was a planet but it was too large to be Venus or any other planet or star.  It was about one tenth the size of the moon seen in the Western sky. As we watched the object appeared to move higher in the sky but without much lateral motion. When we started our walk we talked to some balloonists who were getting ready to launch and they had been watching it for some time as well and said they didn’t know what it was but suspected it was a weather balloon. There were four balloons that launched in the park and they quickly moved north and out of sight, but the object over the mountains remained where it was without much movement up down or to either side. When we got home we looked at the object with binoculars of 30-50x and it appeared to be spherical, extremely brightly lit (since the sun was behind the mountains and hence behind the object).  It looked like the inside of a led flashlight with little brightly lit circles inside. Many at least three other people at the park saw the light but we did not get their names.  We took a photo with our camera phone which will be e-mailed to you but it was indistinct and showed no detail.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,35.10348122192273,-106.61247515723271

Staring at it we noticed it moving slightly to the west or southwest direction, then all of a sudden it accelerated drastically and pulled a very tight 180 degree turn.   Further observation of this UFO it continued to move left to right and in circles while slowing down and speeding up randomly.  It would also dim and brighten back up at times during all this.  That was 11/2/2013 and was visible once dark.   The next night (11/3/2013) we observe the same UFO doing the same sporadic behaviors in the same area of the sky.

There were a string of orange lights over the ocean traveling south from Laguna Beach towards Dana Point.  The lights were bright at first, a dark orange, definitely not “whitish” like stars or aircraft lights and moved slowly, almost gliding in a non-unison formation.  It sort of resembled someone letting go of balloons with candles in them.  The first time I saw them I actually thought maybe it was some sort of air balloon thing.

We decided to park the car and go look at these lights which were so intriguing. We got out and walked to the end of the street, there we saw the lights, they were normal, white lights, they were stacked vertically but not in a tight way, it was slanted and it didn't look aligned. They moved from what seemed so far away to closer in what seemed like no time at all. They just sort of, hovered over.  The light became a little bit bigger and we tried to figure out what it was.  Then the other witness cried out ""there's something between them""  I didn't understand what she meant.  I looked and the light closest to the ground was now dripping, like a hot metal or something.  It didn't seem like a beam or anything but it was kind of illuminated.   At this point the witness was hysterical and went inside and was almost begging me to.  I eventually got the witness out again, where the light looked like they had faded a little, possibly getting farther away again. Then we just observed the lights, it didn't last long, the wits was texting and took her eyes off of the lights, I saw a shooting star that was so close, we mever ever see ones this close it was amazing.  It took all of my attention away from the light for a quick second.  And that's all they needed.  I instantly looked back and they were gone.  Completely gone.  I was freaking out.

I was out in my apartment parking lot walking my dog so he could go potty, when I looked to my right, and noticed two Fiery orange spheres floating through the air side by side.  To my right (due south) was a line of pine trees perpendicular to me, and behind that a financial office and doctors office.  Beyond that even further was 53rd street as appears in the map I am sending you.  The objects, as I don’t know what else to call them were about the size of a small car.  They were evenly spaced at 50 feet apart and were directly side  by side.  These objects were to my right moving to my left, from due south on a due north heading and literally flew right over my head. At this hour of the night, there was no prevailing wind of any kind it was still. The cloud ceiling was approximately 500 feet with heavy overcast.  These objects were no more a couple hundred feet high if that.  They literally moved right over top of my at this low altitude, moved no more than 200-300 feet farther to my left before moving straight up in the the cloud base and disappearing. No sooner than this happened, did ANOTHER pair do exactly the same thing. In total, I witnessed four pairs of these objects take exactly the same flight path, in pairs, with exactly the same spacing between them and same altitude, everything.  At this time, the street lights in my apartment went black, and my cell phone SHUT ITSELF OFF.  This is NOT something that has happened before, and unnerved me greatly.  These objects were the size of a small car and were radiating orange light, they were VERY bright, spherical in appearance, and were casting shadows in the parking lot.  It didn’t just unnerve me, it unnerved my dog as well who was whimpering and wanting to go back in the apartment. I did not fill out a report of this initially because I did not think anyone would believe me.  Simply put I thought I was the only one who saw this, and had no pictures because of the odd behavior of my phone and the lights in the lot. The reason I have chosen to write this now is because I saw an identical object again on August 23rd 2013 at exactly 10:09pm CST.  I know the exact time because I was able to get three pictures of the object this time which was alone, and coming from the same direction and general area as last time but veered away from me and up in the clouds at what I estimate was a half mile this time.  When I spotted this object, again out for a walk with my dog, it was approximately 30 degrees off the horizon from me and the size of my thumbnail  with my arm held at arms length.  Again, there was wind this time but the wind was a easterly wind and this object was headed right for me moving north, until it made a turn and headed west, heading directly INTO the wind.  The wind speed was 6-7 mph as I measured it after this sighting with a Kestrel wind meter. I am forwarding you the three photographs I managed to capture of this object as well.   The photos were captured using a Samsung Galaxy S2 Cellular telephone with the flash feature turned off. It is the model 727I phone, with an 8 megapixel camera.  I do not use any other mode than the normal one, or any aftermarket camera apps.  The images I am sending you were displayed in Microsoft office picture viewer and the brightness enhanced and size blown up.  No other edits were made and I can and will send you copies of the originals upon your request in their unaltered form.  I used the railing of my deck to steady my hand in the hopes of getting some decent pictures. These sightings took place in northeastern davenport iowa, near the mt joy airport, which is a small regional airport with minimal traffic and a small national guard rotary wing unit stationed there as well.  No Nat’l Guard traffic was in the air that I know of.  There were other aircraft in the air during both sightings.

The first object was witnessed by my employer and I while in our parking lot.  Noticing an orange glowing light in the night sky, we guessed at possibilities such as a helicopter with a searchlight, or a flare.  She briefly thought she heard a muffled helicopter type sound, but we were standing near an outside AC unit which also produces a hum.  We then took notice that outside of the orange light, we could make out no other lights on the object, which moved with what seemed like a controlled ""floating"" similar to that of a helicopter.  The brightness of the color varied but was always orange as it moved basically parallel and a few hundred feet above the tree line, until eventually disappearing.   Ruling out the flare theory, and assuming we had seen a helicopter equipped with searchlight, the darkness, or our angle of viewing causing the odd appearance, my employer leaves.  Three more fellow employees walk outside and as I'm filling them in, one points to what appears to be two, new, similar objects.  We watched for what I'd guess was around 15 minutes as they took a like path as that of the first object, but at various points seemed touch each other, fly in loose formation and be linked or connected(think one towing the other).

My mother joined me moments later for a smoke and we talked while gazing at stars and hunting satellites.   We hadn't been out long when we heard what sounded to be a very distant jet engine but became a low rumbling roar and I could feel the vibrations as I stood gazing skyward.  The UFO appeared mere moments later and was due south from my position and flew West to East.   The craft was approximately no more than half a mile away and was easily bigger than my house and seemed to defy gravity by moving so slow.   The event lasted no more than 20 seconds as the object soon disappeared behind the trees but I saw two very large yellow/white lights ! (one on the crafts nose, the other on the left wing) and at what looked to be at the heart of the ship was a large red light and the three said lights gave of a unwavering glow.   I assume that the right wing would also have had a yellow/white light and this vehicle matches several descriptions I have read previously.  My mother saw less of the craft than I did but she is still astute that it was unnatural.   I felt compelled to post this as this is my second encounter with an UFO. Less than ten years ago, and not but roughly ten miles from where I currently reside, a very slow and low flying, triangular craft black in color flew over my house and my family and I assumed it was a B-2 spirit but there were supposedly only 20 made.  The craft from that summer night in my youth had many lights on the bottom and was only a couple hundred feet over the tree tops.   A B-2 bomber's slowest flying speed is 140, right?

The object(s) was pretty big in size and the tail was fairly long. The location where I noticed it was around the border of the cities San Jose, Los Gatos, Campbell.  On US Highway 85 I was traveling on the north bound side of 85 but was actually going from Southeast to Northwest.  I first noticed the light either above or just to the left of highway 85.  I watched for as long as I could, glancing at traffic (making sure I don't get in a wreck).  I lost it before it could travel over the hills in Los Gatos/Saratoga.  Total time I saw it was probably around 5 seconds, maybe less. The object was high enough in the sky/atmosphere that if it were to land it would have done so in the Pacific Ocean.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,37.3388420218894,-121.88970568836406

However the light was moving North/East, it was not blinking but stayed the same blue/white color.   Because of the movement we watched the disk-shaped object for several seconds.  Then we saw an airplane with flashing lights moving to the South/West a distance from the disk.  The disk seemed to stop for a second or two and then started moving in a South/West direction as if following the airplane.  It didn’t seem to make a turn as an airplane would but just stopped and started in the opposite direction.   It tracked the airplane behind and slightly to the right for quite a distance across the sky.  Then it started climbing, getting higher and higher, until disappearing out of sight.  It is hard to judge the size of the object, but from our perspective the blinking lights of the airplane would compare to the end of a pencil but the disk would compare to the eraser of a pencil, it was quite large.  We watched the object for approximately 5 minutes, heard no noise until the airplane moved overhead with the disk tracking it.  Don’t know what it was but thought it odd that it seemed to be tracking the airplane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I see aircraft all the time, and an occasional shooting star.  One night, I clearly saw a meteor.  I know when I'm looking at a planet.  I've seen the ISS pass by before, and I've seen satellites, as well.  That's my sky-watching background. Tonight was the first time I could ever say without a doubt that I saw an object that I had absolutely no idea what I'd just seen. It was coming from the West.  At first, I thought it was a really bright star, but then I noticed it was moving to the East.  It grew bigger, and brighter, and headed right towards the moon.  I'd say it moved from ~35 degrees up to a maximum of 60 or so.  The moon was at ~65-75.   When it passed between me and the moon, appearing a few degrees below it, I saw the contrail.  Whatever it was, it was in the atmosphere. When I saw that, I thought it might be a meteor or something else burning up, but it didn't look like it was on fire, or diminishing at all.   Honestly, I was expecting the trajectory to bend downward at any second and see it ""pop"" or ""fizzle.""  But it just kept going. It did look a little like one of those large airplane lights that are usually in the center of commercial airliners, but there were no accompanying flashing lights, or even steady smaller lights, which I always see on commercial airliners.  It was just a steady, yellowish ball of light with a con trail, and the trail didn't resemble any meteor trail I've ever seen. There's an airport just North of the city, so I see a lot of low-flying jetliners going in for landings.  This was absolutely not one of those. It was much larger than any planet, shooting star, meteor or aircraft light I've ever seen. It also made absolutely no sound. As it continued straight in the direction it was heading, I tried to get my phone's camera on it, but the light from the moon was too much.  I could only watch it as it kept a steady course towards the Eastern horizon. When it was barely visible to me, I turned back to the West, looking where it had come from, and saw 3 aircraft crisscrossing the sky at low altitudes relative to what I usually see out there, and flying routes I don't usually see. I like to post meteor sightings to see if anyone else saw what I saw.  I didn't believe it was a meteor, so I googled a short description of what I saw, and ufocenter.com was the first site returned.  So, I decided to post it here and hope someone else might have seen it too.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,38.04475955882353,-78.53657691176471

There was a tree in the center of my vision that covered most of my vision but in the corner of my left eye I saw what I thought to be a shooting star, so I immediately focused on it.  The moment I focused I noticed it was an orange dot pretty much, it went straight like a shooting star but then it did a really wide curve at a very fast speed.  Almost immediately after that it was gone.  I posted to Facebook asking if anyone else had seen it and it turned out someone I hold to their word had seen it too.   Throughout the night I have gone out and stared around the same spot and seen nothing.  But I know shooting stars, satellites, airplanes, and this wasn't one of them.  Planes follow a course and it's very unlikely you will see it turn suddenly or even come close to turning how fast that did.  Shooting stars burn bright and move quick and dissapear in a straight fashion.  Satellites are pretty tiny lit up dots that you watch move slowly and count for points against your brother when sleeping outside with no tent. I've waited many years to finally get a glimpse of something and I believe tonight was that night. Take it or leave it.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,44.9901,-123.0262

My husband called me to come outside to the back yard.  Every day and into the night he has an hourly smoke on the back porch, so he is very familiar with the skies and flight paths ect.   Anyway, he pointed out a stationary UFO which had blue and white or very light yellow flashing lights around the perimeter.  It was about 10 miles away in the south and 400 feet above us.  It was hovering above a forested hill and was there for at least two minutes. Within 4 seconds it was over us.  There was a VERY bright white light underneath and you could barely see the blues on the edges anymore due to its location to us.  However, the smaller lights around the large white one almost seemed recessed as it flew above us.  The back lights were more distinct in their outline.  ((Husband's name deleted)) believed it to be triangular in shape.  He had been outside in the dark longer so his eyes were able to see edges better than mine. It was difficult to determine size due to the fact that we could not see the elevation.  However, given the following perhaps you could make a calculation of how high it was:  Our property is 150 feet long, so looking up from underneath the UFO, it was covering at least 75 feet of the property and the probably 35 feet of the 45 foot width of the property.  It seemed to come directly from the mountain south of us which is a good 400 feet or more above us and 10 miles away from us.   It moved south to north and its acceleration was not uniform as it was stationary over the mountain and then was upon us in 4 seconds (so 10 miles in 4 seconds), it slowed when directly over us, it didn’t hover but it slowed enough for us to get a good look and be able to agree on a uniform description.  It accelerated again, however it was slower than a jet but much faster than a small plane or copter.  I have emailed a crude drawing but it is accurate. I cannot emphasis enough how large the center light was in proportion to the vehicle and how white and brilliant the light was, it was amazing.  If we had stared at the light itself for any time we would have been blinded by it. At 18:35pm my husband witnessed another similar object move to the Northwest and he only saw it's edges which were also rimmed with lights.  This moved so fast that he could not yell for me to come and see it.

It was too large, low in the sky and bright to be a star or planet.  And it wasn't moving so we knew it wasn't a plane.   As we drove closer to the light it became apparent it was a large, diamond shaped black object hovering over an area to our left (maybe as far off as over Childs street or closer over the Bryant Woods nature park area).   I pulled the car over right behind Lakeridge Jr. High and we turned around in our seats and watched the craft for about 3 minutes as it just floated/hovered in the same spot.  Then it started moving and flew over Lakeridge Jr. High.  It went behind a tree line and we couldn't see it anymore. My daughter doesn't want to talk about this and is scared which is why I'm even following up on this.  I'm not scared but I want to know if anyone else saw the craft.  Strangely no one else was out walking in our neighborhood (which is usually busy with foot traffic and people jogging or walking their dogs--even on dark, winter night).  I remarked to my daughter that ""great, no other cars are driving now and no one else is out"" so we didn't see anyone else that saw what we saw.   The whole thing was weird.

My experience happened many years ago.  It was either 1956 or 1957.  I’ve never shared this with anyone except my parents who were tangentially involved and a couple people over the years that were very close to me.  I heard of you on the Coast to Coast radio program.  I don’t know if my experience parallels any others that may have been reported to you or not.  Hopefully my experience may be a small piece of relative useful information to you and your work. When I was a young lad my parents and I spent our summer vacations with close friends.  They had a daughter, who I’ll call Linda, who was about two years older than me.  They had a cottage on a small lake in Massachusetts.  We lived in Connecticut.  The experience occurred in August of 1956 or 1957. One evening our parents decided they needed a couple things at the grocery store and beer.  The liquor store closed at 8:00 PM which was about a 20 minute drive from the cottage.  Linda and I accompanied her father.  We arrived at the liquor store just before it closed.  Linda’s father went in to buy the beer and came right out, within three or four minutes.  From there we went to the store which was only about ½ mile away.  The three of us went into the store and then started back to the cottage.  It was probably about 8:20 when we left the store. The road into the cottage was one lane and gravel and wound through thick woods.  To the best of my memory, it was probably about 5 miles from the main road into the cottage.  When we entered the gravel road, it was quite dark.  About 2 miles into the woodsy we were suddenly surrounded by a blinding, extremely bright metallic light. Back in those days almost everyone had a chemistry set.  My cousin and I used to ignite magnesium which burned with an intense silvery glow.  That’s the closest I can describe the light that surrounded us.  Anyhow, Linda’s father slammed on the brakes and Linda and I were propelled into the dash board (there were no seat belts then).  I remember Linda’s father uttering an expletive.  Then, as fast as the light appeared….. it disappeared…… no more than a couple seconds.  We did not see anything other than the light. We sat there for a few seconds blinking our eyes and then continued on our way.  When we pulled into the cottage, my parents, Linda’s mother and several neighbors were outside.  When the car stopped someone in a very distressed tone exclaimed, “Where the Hell were you?”  Linda’s father said, what do you mean where were we”?  We went to the store.  As I stated, we left the store around 8:20.  It would take about 20 to 25 minutes to return.  It was nearly 10:00 PM. That year was my last at the lake and I didn’t see Linda again until about ten years later.  I had graduated from college, and my mother had passed away.  Linda and her husband were having an outdoor barbecue at her house to celebrate her parents’ anniversary and my father asked me if I would like to attend with him.  I said I would.  I was looking forward to seeing Linda again.  When we arrived at her home I immediately looked for her.  When we saw each other, the first words out of both our mouths were, “Do you remember the night……?”  My father passed the following year and I never saw Linda again.  I’ll never forget that night and I’ve never had any kind of a similar encounter or experience since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

An airplane flew really close to the object, passed it, and when it was way ahead, the light darted at the plane.  This happened twice. Well I kept watching playing with my flash light and the light started moving my way. It came closer until it was above my head.  The object was shaped like a triangle, with a light on each corner. It made no noise -- none. It scared me so bad I ran to the neighbors house and pretended I was just visiting.  I didn't tell them what I had seen because I was afraid they would think I was crazy.

The date was the same as I write this.  November 13th, 2013.  It was approximately 4:15 PM and the sun was setting.  It was still very light outside even though the sun just started to set.  I was on my way to my grandmothers apartment same as I do almost every week to help her out with sme household stuff and just to talk and visit.  Normally I would have used public transportation to get there completely however due to construction I had to walk the last had mile there.  Her apartment building is right across from Lake Michigan, I don't feel comfortable being anymore specific.  As I was walking down the street I looked out over the lake like usual to enjoy the view.  As I was looking I noticed as usual some planes going over.  Then, I saw this white object very close to the moon.  It drew my attention because it made no sound and had no exhaust trail behind it.  As I began to look closer I noticed it had no wings, or appeared not too.  This made me think it was one of those new ""drones"" police departments are using to monitor their districts.  So, I wanted to get a better look.  I hurried across the street to get a better view.  When I did I saw another pitch white cylinder shaped object also close to the moon moving in the sky.  I felt mesmerized.  I couldn't stop staring.  Once I saw th both I knew they were drones or planes or anything I've ever seen.  I couldn't look away.  I heard cars driving by past me but everything felt like it slowed down.  I experience a surge of fear and adrenaline.  I stared at them moving slowly towards each other.  The moon seemed to be in the middle point between them.  When they got close to the moon they just disappeared.  I was staring right at them and instantly, they were just gone.  I was in disbelief.  I ran back and forth, looking all around trying to see where they could have gone.  I couldn't see them anywhere.  I felt, strange.  I have no idea how to describe it.  After that I just sat on a bench and stared out onto the lake and the sky hoping they'd come back for about 20 minutes but they never did.  I know that what I saw had to be a UFO.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,43.051744026104416,-87.95998544176706

Peter, 6 of us were watching the sunset at 17:35 on 11/13/13 my wife pointed out to me and said there's another one of those things like we seen last year!  It was a shiny disc/wing object flying over Lake Havasu from the S.E. traveling toward the West.  The Sun had not set but it disappeared behind the Western desert mountains.  The object was flying in the jet stream 35,000 to 40,000 feet in elevation.  One of the six people said it's just a jetliner (Lake Havasu is in a fly over pattern for aircraft flying to and from Phoenix, AZ. to L.A. and S.F.) I quickly quipped if that object is an aircraft why isn't leaving a contrail (hot white exhaust smoke hitting the cold air) like the other jets (there was four other aircraft in the area all four flying to the West as the object was) and why doesn't this object have strobe lights on like the other four aircraft in the area.  Another comment was maybe it's a star and I quickly pointed out the planet Venus, which was ! visible in the West and told them that Venus was the brightest light in the night sky for a star or planet and this object was 3 times brighter than Venus.  Another quipped it's just one of those U.S. Marine Fighter Jets going on a bombing run out in the Mojave Desert.  I am very familiar with the Marine Air Wing out of Yuma, AZ. (I'm a Ex Marine) and there flying F-35B and I've observed that they stay out of the commerical aircraft space when flying out on there bombing runs.  They fly half that distance in height and they always have just white strobe lights on.  Plus these objects were much larger than a fighter jet.  Someone else quipped it must be something out of Area 51 which is about 200 miles N.W. of us.  15 minutes later a second object flew over in the same flight path as the first.  The only difference in this aircraft from the prior one was it was more of a orange color that I assume was coming from the sunset.  I would like to note that I seen the same type object last year (I didn't report it until now) as it was flying behind and! overtook and flew between 2 jet airliners that were flying beside each other with or about 3 miles in between the 2 jetliners.  And again this aircraft didn't leave a contrail like the other two jets were leaving!  My wife and I witnessed both these sightings this year and last.

It was bright white at the center, yellow around the center and orange on the outside.  It was traveling from southwest to northeast.  It wasn't falling thru the sky, it appeared to be gaining in altitude.  It made no noise.   There were at least a couple hundred people there waiting for the fireworks to begin.  You could hear other people saying ""look at that""  So I know we weren't the only ones who seen it.   As an avid photographer I had my camera ready to photograph the fireworks and was able to get 2 pictures of the object. I have a Canon T3i rebel camera with a 55mm-250mm zoom lens and was able to get a fairly clear photo of the object.   My girlfriend had been frightened by what we saw when we were observing it.  It traveled in a fairly straight path across the sky appearing to slighty gain altitude as it crossed overhead.  It traveled about three quarters across the sky above before it just disappeared.  About 15-20 minutes later a comercial plane passed over the field seemingly in the exact same path and at the same speed as the glowing object.  The plane had the traditional noise associated with a plane and flew until it was so small you couldn't see it anymore, farther than the object that passed before it but it was visably much less bright.   Once I was home and examined the photos I took, one had obvious shaking distortion to the object.   The other was clear and you could make out a longer cylindrical solid object in the center of the glow. Clearly nothing like any othe flying craft I had witnessed or anyone I've shown the photo to.

We were sitting, facing south when I caught in my eye, from the southeast, a light coming towards us high up in the sky.  I didn’t think anything as our neighborhood is in the flight path of our local airport.   There had obviously been lights all evening however, this light didn’t have any blinking lights coming from it so I knew it wasn’t an airplane or helicopter.  I then looked away for a few seconds and when I looked back it appeared brighter and bigger than before.   I then took my eyes off it again and I looked towards the west where I saw another light that looked just like this one, this other light had a blinking light though.   So I looked back at the unusual light and right as I tried to tell my son to look, the light started to dim fast until it fully faded a! way and left a small ball of fog behind.   I kept my eye on that area to see if I could possibly spot anything else and was unsuccessful. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

On the Fourth of July, I was on my second floor deck, watching the fireworks begin, looking W/NW.  The sun had set, but there was still an orange glow to the western clouds.  Far to the west, I saw a dark gray object hovering just under the cloud line.   I stepped inside to retrieve a pair of binoculars that I keep hanging inside the door.  I sighted the object through the binoculars, and it was moving east at a slow pace, coming right towards me.  It was very far away, so it is difficult to estimate its size, but I would say it was just a little smaller than a mid-sized plane.   It was silent, had no running lights, and no exhaust.  As it came closer, perhaps a mile or two away, it started to bank to it's left, or North.   As it banked, I could clearly see that it was saucer shaped in front, but the back end was flat; what a dime would look like if one clipped off about an eighth of it.  I followed it with the binoculars until it disappeared past the tree line.

UFO Sighting on Whidbey Island On the 4th of July, shortly after the sun settled over the horizon, 6 to 8 glowing orange orbs or fire balls flew slowly overhead and then exited south east at what appeared to be supersonic speeds.   They first appeared west of Mutiny Bay on Whidbey Island, Washington and then travelled parallel to the western portion of  Mutiny Bay beach.  Unlike jet aircraft, the orbs did not make a sound.  The first one took off and accelerated to over 30 to 40 thousand feet or more in a matter of a few seconds until it was no longer visible.   A few minutes later five or six more followed in the same path, at semi-equal distance from one another, and again (one after the other) ascended to 30 to 40 thousand feet in the same direction - until no longer visible.  The last one appeared a few minutes later, separate from the cluster of 5 or 6, and again was traveling in a south east direction.  But about Parallel to our observation point the orb shot straight up at an accent that made it disa! ppear from view in a matter of seconds, perhaps close to a minute. My best guess is that the orbs were 20 to 30 feet in diameter and that they first appeared at about 1,000 feet in altitude.  They were a bright orange with a fiery like appearance. Being the 4th of July celebration, many people were on the beach at Whidbey’s Mutiny Bay during the orb display and must have also seen the phenomena.     Shortly after the sighting, and directly east,  someone set off a chain of luminaries with candles under paper sacks; which floated in an easterly direction and ended flight several hundred yards from their launch site.   This should not be confused with the orb sightings and the visuals and distances traveled are not remotely close to one another.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,48.0175,-122.4707

I'm not sure the exact time as the fireworks started about 21:00 hours and continued for most of the night but my best estimate would be somewhere around 22:00-23:00 hours. As we watched the fireworks over the city we both noticed three lights moving around about 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  Their distance from us was hard to judge but my impression was that it was a good distance away &gt;4 miles.  The lights seemed to fade in and out of sight in order from three to one then three again.   The three lights maintained what seemed an equal distance from each other at all times.  A perfect formation in a triangular shape.  If the lights were on the corners of a flat triangular shape then the flat plane of that object looked to be twisting and rolling slowly but the lights remained visible.  The size of the lights were much larger than any of the surrounding fireworks which made them stand out more and the color was the light yellow of a typical street light as I recall.,2013-07-14T00:00:00,39.74512637220715,-104.95934593826682

It was totally unmoving, except for the blinking.  The stars were moving as they normally do.  Then I saw little clouds pass behind this thing over the hills so I knew it must have been right above the river.  It started to blink with a slightly different speed and then it dropped straight down and then straight over to the right.  Then the light went out.

It was a very blue sky crisp clear day, almost no clouds. It lasted for 2 to 3 minutes & mostly stayed in one spot only drifting to the right very slightly. It seemed very big as we saw other planes cross the same area throughout the day & ones that were lower to the ground you could make out in good detail.  So we do not believe there was any mistaking this ball of light for a plane or anything else. Every 8-10 seconds the light would either blink out & disappear instantly then blink back in or fade to smaller then blink out completely then a couple seconds later blink right back into view.  2-3 minutes of this fading/blinking in & out & after the last disappearance it didn't come back, it just seemed to vanish & we didn't see it anymore that day.  It almost seemed like a solid object but it was so bright white it was hard to decipher any distinct edges.   On examination of video that we took, to the lower right side of the object there seemed to be a much smaller round object floating with it & zoomed out along with it as it disappeared.  But was not visible throughout the entire video, just a few second here & there. ((NUFORC Note:  Video shows a white colored object appearing, and then disappearing, as the witness indicates above.

As soon as we walked outside, I noticed a reddish/amber light in the northwestern sky.  The light was so bright that I mentioned it to my girlfriend and said something to the effect of “I wonder if that’s Mars or Venus so bright tonight?”  We both stopped to look at the object and we both noticed that it was moving.  We kept our eyes on it as we walked another 50 feet or so.  The light moved from our northwest to our southeast.  We both stopped walking, and I remarked at how bright the object was, but that it didn’t have any blinking lights on it (the kind I normally would associate with an aircraft).   As the object was flying in the southeast horizon, we clearly began to see red flare-like objects coming from the bright amber lighted craft.  The objects were glowing red, similar to the color and intensity of a roadside flare.  We saw approximately nine (9) of these “flares” come from the craft over a span of three (3) to five (5) minutes.  At least one of these flares broke apart into two independent “flares”.  We watched them fall downward under trees obscured our view of them.  They were still lit/glowing as they disappeared from our view. After the last of these “flares”, the bright amber craft simply and suddenly “winked out” and disappeared from the sky.  It did not slowly fade away, nor did we see it fly away.  It was simply visible one moment, then gone the next.  It may be worth mentioning that we could not hear any jet or propeller noise from the craft. We felt that what we had seen was odd enough that we contacted the San Diego Sheriff’s Department, and described what we saw to them.  The SDSO connected us to the Northwest Region of the FAA.  I spoke with a lady named Karen who conferenced in a man named Charlie from San Diego Tracon (sp?).  Charlie was unaware of anything that should be dropping flares over San Diego County.  Karen suggested that I contact the UFO Center.  I spoke with Mr. Davenport who asked us to write a description of what we saw while the details were still fresh in our minds.  Mr. Davenport asked that we contact the National Weather Service for wind speed information.  We called the San Diego office of the National Weather Service, but could not reach a live person. I hereby attest that everything I have said in this statement is the complete truth.

The location of the site was right by the shore of the lake. 	It was about one o'clock in the morning and I was the last one there and had been by myself for around thirty minutes. It was my responsibility that night to let no one drive back home while intoxicated and make sure the camp site was in good shape when we were done.  As a result of my duties that night I was completely sober and had not been drinking or using any drugs. 	Right after I loaded the last bag of trash in the back of my truck I had this strange urge to look at the lake.  The best way to describe that feeling  was as if I had been day dreaming.  There was nothing unusual going on out on then all of the sudden there was a bright glowing light under  the water.  At this particular distance I could tell exactly how large the circle was but it was big. 	The shape was circular and had a light green/yellowish glow with occasional pulsating reed and blue lights.  I starred at it dumbfounded as it was moving slowly under the water from one side of the lake to the opposite side.  The object moved from one side and back to the other two or three times for about five minutes then it stopped almost near the center of the lake.  The object glowed brighter and brighter than shot straight out of the water and into the sky. 	After that I turned around and ran as fast as I could to my truck.

There were two very attractive woman and one very tall man that was at least ten feet high.  All of them had blonde hair that was almost white and blue eyes. 	They did not say anything to me directly but I heard one of the the woman's voice in my head. I know your probably thinking that I am crazy but it did happen.  She said, ""(my name) please do not be afraid.  You have an important role to play if you would like to help us."" I said out loud in a shaky voice ""okay but I don't know how?""

I finished smoking and turned to walk back in but it caught my eye again only this time it was a little higher threw the tree.  I really didnt want to be too curious knowin i had to get up at 600 to go to work but I had to see what it was because i knew a plane should have already been past it was just moving too slow.  I walked to the end of my porch and could see it threw the very end of the branches it appeared to be movin but i just told my self it was probably a breeze moving the leafs.  I focused on several different leafs and none of them were moving.  I went out to my shed and proped myself agianst it and lined the object up with the corner of the building and saw then it was moving without a dout.So i went in grabbed my long range rifle with a very high quality scope and bipod because it looked like a very bright star it was just too big.to be a star.  When i set the rifle up and zoomed in as far as i could.  When i looked at it threw the scope i could see it wasnt a star a all. I could see a clear shape of the object and what really stood out was 3 short black lines about 1/4 the way up on the craft from the bottom.  It was saucer shaped up to these lines and domed shape above them.  The color would be light i guess i have never seen anything like it in my life the whole object was bright white like it was being illuminated from the inside.  That's the only way i know how to describe it.  I cant explain how the three black lines were stood out so much on something that bright.  I guess the eye relief on the scope really helped.  I could see the  object was moving almost like a car would if u popped the clutch.  Then it would stabilize and not move any then do the same thing looked very deliberate but not like u would think anything functioning correctly would. It would move west every time.  And through the scope it sometimes would fall out of the recital like a stalled plane would do. I went and woke my wife she watched it awhile then became concerned and wouldn't come back out. It was very very high. I watched it for about a hour moving sporadically but still maintaining its westerly course. Then it stopped and im not sure if it turned or what but it looked like a cube just kind of all of a sudden. It stayed like this for probably ten min and never move inch. I was beginning to wonder what was going on i thought i was loosing it but a very light purple cloud formed under the cube i guess it had to be exhaust. I guess it rotated or something but i could see the original shape once more only the upper part of the craft was very light purple color. It kept movin westward very verly slow then just vanished. there wasnt a cloud in the sky and i never saw it agian. I dont understand what all i saw but the movements were too deliberate to be natural. The light it was putting off was ve! ry very bright i cant understand how the whole object was that bright. To the naked eye it looked like a huge very bright star but that scope told me a different story and i wish i could comprehend what i saw. Thats the best i know how to explain it never seen anything similar in my life. It is what it is.  What that is. Heck if I know.,2013-08-30T00:00:00,36.4948,-86.5969

I also must note that the skies are extremely quiet tonight and I have only observed one other plane from my position coming in for a landing throughout this incident. I noticed what appeared to be a brightly flashing star in a spot that I had not noticed one before in the ESE sky over Boston.  I watched it, could not discern any movement, but noticed that it appeared to be flashing erratically with multicolored lights. Whatever it is, it is very high up.  About 20 minutes later I looked back up (I had not moved from my seat) and noticed that it had moved about a foot in my view across the sky.  I was able to compare it to a junction on a power line which is in the foreground of my sight. At this point I alerted my boyfriend who is equally stumped.  I checked the ISS position which is currently over the Carribean.  I checked Weatherbug.com for visible satellites over this area and found none. I've lived here and watched these skies my whole life. Planes that high up appear to move slower, but not that slow!  Currentl,y it is still moving at a barely noticeable pace toward the south. It is most definitely one of the brightest things in the sky, as I am in a very urban area with plenty of glow from the city, but can still make it out fairly easy.  It also seems to get brighter and flash quicker at times, before slowing down and twinkling steadily.

It was about 45 degrees elevation, fairly close to Saturn. As I watched the object, it slowly decreased in brightness until it was invisible.  I thought, that's cool, I just saw a meteor that must have been headed straight towards me because it left no trail at all.  Then less than a minute later, it showed up again a little farther North.  But this time I watched as it gradually and evenly increased from invisible to a tiny pinprick of light, then to it's full brightness and back again to invisible.

I told her to look up to where I guessed it would show up again, and sure enough, after about 10 seconds, it appeared again - exactly like the previous two times.  I had her run inside to get my binoculars, and while she was gone, it appeared one last time before it disappeared from view. At its maximum brightness, the object was much brighter than any object in the sky - brighter even than Jupiter at its maximum brightest.  The object appeared to be travelling  North from around Saturn towards Ursa Major and was completely silent.  Also, it seemed to be travelling significantly higher and/or slower than commercial airplanes normally fly.  The color of the light was always brilliant white when visible.

This morning, at approximately 4:25am CDT, I stepped out of my house to place things in my car.  I noticed the warm night air and full moon to my right and looked around enjoying the nice calm morning.  It was before daybreak and was still very dark. Just then I noticed a peculiar light in the sky to my left that had come into view from over the treetops in that direction.  I expected this to be a small plane due to the low altitude of less than 1000 feet.  This is not uncommon for my area.  However, I then noticed the light from this object were of a solid tubular pattern and there were no blinking lights and absolutely no sound.  Low flying small airplanes and military helicopters are common sights near my home as are higher altitude commercial aircraft.  I have even seen the International Space Station in the sky before.  This light was from none of these. I slowly walked toward my garage while observing the light object the whole way.  I stopped outside my garage and observed the object slowly moving across the sky.  I reached inside the garage to turn on the outside garage lights to alert the object that I was there. It slowly continued across the sky with no change in speed.  I quickly went inside my garage to put the items I was holding in my car and went to grab my sunglasses to see if I could see more detail with them on.  I stepped out of my now open garage door to look back at the object and it was gone.  I could no longer find it anywhere in the sky. I am utterly confused by the object I saw this morning.  I am a very rational and logical thinking person. But I can not explain what I saw this morning. I checked out the International Space Station site to see the location of it. At the time it was over the South Pacific. What I saw was low flying and couldn't have been it or any other commercial aircraft.  I am completely stumped regarding what I saw this morning.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,37.456399999999995,-86.3093

I had my cruise control set at 60m.ph, radio turned off, and windows partially down.   Around the zorn avenue exit, right outside of downtown Louisville.  I noticed about a half a mile ahead of me and on the other side of the highway, a object above the tree line. (TREE LINE RUNS DOWN BOTH SIDES OF ENTIRE HIGHWAY)   My first thought was wow that helicopter, plane is flying low.  Thats when the cruise control came off and i slowed to around 45m.p.h.  The object started moving across the highway, at a northwestern fashion.  This object was about 200 feet above the ground, about the size of a mini van or large car, and made no noise.  What made me notice this object was the lights, it had a series of bright green and extremely vivid colored lights on the bottom or belly in a V shape or triangl! e.  With the green lights at the corners.  There was also one red light in the middle that pulsed slowly, almost like a heartbeat.    I watched this thing fly directly over top of my car.  Looking through my windshield and up over my steering wheel, i noticed the silouette only because of the close by downtown city lights.  The object had round edges   almost like a football but wider, that made up the entire craft.  It was really strange,  the whole time i couldn't see the object only the lights, but they were so bright i dont understand how they didnt light up any part of this object, they should have, but this was black or cloaked is best described.  I continued to watch as it flew over and past me above the tree line on my side of highway.  I was able to see this object from the front, from its side, and from its rear.  No other lights were on this object at all, and living by Louisville you know what planes, helicopters, commercial and even some military aircraft look an! d sound like.  F.A.A requires all aircraft to use a red light ! on one s ide or wing, a green on the other and a white flashing light at the rear.  This object had only  lights on the bottom, nowhere else.   This is by far probably the strangest thing ive ever seen, and would really love to know what it was.   It wasnt a helicopter, it wasnt a plane, it wasnt a toy or R.c because it was too big, and think to myself would military be flying some drone or black ops over a highway with bright green lights, it doesnt make sense to me.

Another guy has pulled over and he is staring at them and I ask him what they are, and he says he has no idea but a few minutes prior another group of them appeared and then winked out. As I'm watching I notice the wind against me is out of the East but these lights are moving Northeast kind of into the wind, at least crossing into the direction of the wind but all seem to be unaffected.  No noise, silent.  With the very bright moon I look for smoke, or for balloons, I can't make anything out.  They move relatively quickly across the sky moving maybe 1 mile in 2 minutes.   Again moving from right to left as I look south towards Milton Dam from Rt. 7.  The lights pass over Milton Dam, over Lake Arrowhead towards the wind turbines on Georgia Mountain.  With the cluster of 12-15 red lights they are spread out but still in a group if that makes sense.  They all wink out in the same general area, but not all at once. Three more lights appear from behind the same hill/mountain and move in similar fashion, same direction and wink out of two minutes.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,44.6398,-73.1104

The weather at the time was low fog but not very thick at all as the stars were still clearly visible, just enough so that you could see it in the headlights of cars.  There was no wind that I noticed. It was still dusk, and most stars and planets were not very bright yet.  Immediately I thought they were aircraft, as float planes and helicopters frequently fly low over the area, only the latter at night. There is also a naval base in the area and sea kings and search and rescue helicopters sometimes fly relatively low over my house. I then noticed however that there were no running or strobe lights of any kind and the lights were too orange to be landing lights.  They were too bright for stars or planets at that time of night, but not overly bright, like Venus or Jupiter in the middle of the night.  The lights moved at a moderate pace, certainly something that would be typical for an aircraft.  The two were fairly close together at the start, sort of in a diagonal top to bottom orientation. but then they proceeded to turn around each other so that they switched positions, and were then much closer together at the end of the process.  The bottom one then faded out and disappeared from view, followed by the top one 10 or so seconds later, as it desc! ended.  This whole sighting lasted approximately 40 seconds to just over a minute at most although its hard to say exactly.  During the time i tried to film with my phone camera but nothing would show up on my screen.  (My phone camera does not work well in low light and the lights were relatively faint compared to the streetlights on my street). I then ran inside to tell a family member what I saw.  They came outside with my and I pointed to the area where they appeared.  A short time later, another light, that looked exactly the same rose from the horizon over my house.  It was more shimmering than the first two, and was lower in the sky and slower.  It quickly flickered and went out, my relative commenting that it looked like a Chinese lantern.  I feel as though the third one could easily be that, but the first two were much stranger looking.  It may be worth mentioning that between the two sightings there were some flashes in the sky much higher up it seemed, like the strobe light of a high flying jet, but only 2 or 3 flashes and not at regular intervals like would be expected, they were much further apart. I waited outside for another 5 min but saw nothing further. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Dear Sir,   Many years ago I saw an inexplicable sight whilst walking home late one night on the western outskirts of Norwich, Norfolk, England. Taking a shortcut through a deserted industrial estate (via Morgan Way, to cross Francis Way in order to reach Richmond Road where I lived.) something made me look up, I had not been aware of any sound or movement to attract my attention. It was a windy night with low cloud that revealed night sky only patchily.  The visible stars were quite bright and the wind somewhere between north and North West.  This particular area was often frequented by the Fokker Friendships of Air UK on final approach for Norwich Airport, so, I was fully aware of what such air traffic looked and sounded like. What I saw on this occasion was quite startling; a huge black triangular shape that hung motionless and silent above me.  I could not determine the actual extent of the shape as the rear end was obscured by the clouds, but it appeared to be at about the level that I judged the cloud tops to be, probably not much above 200-300 feet/                 Its shape was clearly defined because it obscured the stars within its outline                                               At the time I recall endeavouring to make an estimate of its size but due to the obfuscation of the cloud I never saw its full extent; but my judgement of what I could see made me decide that the whole thing would have been bigger than a football pitch. I heard no sound, that I recall, but this may have been due to the wind which was quite strong and caused a slight roar in my ears anyway.  I stood and watched the shape for some time but it showed no sign of movement and there were, certainly, no lights showing anywhere on it. My thought at the time surmised that this had to be some new secret device that someone was trying out. I had the uncomfortable feeling that I was being watched.  What brought it back to mind was the discovery, in an item on SETI and UFOs, on a DVD of the remake of ‘The day the Earth stood still.’ that such a sight had been seen in other areas of the UK, although others reported lights on and from the object. This was the first time I had ever heard of these sightings. (I have no TV which might explain my missing news of such events.) I searched on the internet and very quickly discovered the details including the information that this had been named the ‘Cosford Incident’.  I checked with the friends, that I had been visiting that evening, and they recalled that I had told them of my sighting but could not recall the date, which I knew had to be before March 1994 because that was when I had moved away from the Costessey area. Having noted the date of the Cosford Incident (31 March 1993) I endeavoured to make enquiries to see if I can get a weather report for that area on the night in question to see if it matches my experience in order to determine if I saw it on the same night.                                                                                                                 I also attempted to discover what TV shows had been broadcast that same evening to determine if they were items seen at my friend’s home before my sighting. I had no success in these.  I attempted to report my experience to BM BUFORA in London having found their site on line but my letter was returned due to it no longer existing there. Now, having discovered your address on the web, I thought it may be of interest to you.  Another little known incident, that occurred during WW2, was reported by an ex ATS radar operator to a writer which he used as a basis for a new book ‘The F&#369;hrer’s folly’.

The vehical appeared to be matt black with no external engines and maneuvered in total silence.From the rear of the vehical a round soft white glow was visible from each wing,which would appear to be the propulsion system  .The glow was a soft white similar to a florescent bulb in a kitchen or bathroom, but had the appearance of some form of energy or plasma.  There was a red flashing or strobe light on the left front of the vehical and a green one on the right.  The pulse width of the flashes were much slower than a man made vehical and the colors were off or different from our reds and greens.   At a glance and from a distance ,the vehical would appear to be just another airplane in the night sky,but seeing it up close and personal is a totally different experience.  This vessel moved in total silence,at treetop level at approximately ten mph ground speed.  I observed the object until it went behind the ridge to my south and was no longer visible.  I immediately went outside with bin! oculars in hand hopeing to see this vessel again.I new that I ! had just witnessed something very special that to me was a great priviledge and most likely a once in a lifetime thing.I stayed outside scanning the ridge hopeing to see the object once more.After waitng for about five minutes,sure enough,it reappeared but at a much greater distance over the southeastern part of the ridge.I new it was the same vehical from the soft glowing fields of enery emitting from the wings of the craft.The vehical began to accelerate toward the east at an unbelievable speed and was out of sight in less than a second.Due to this sighting,I have been watching the night skys for five years now,hopeing to catch a glimpse of any extraterrestrial vehical that may be traveling through the night sky.I will always remember this event,and now I know.Some of you might ask,why did I wait five years to post this information.As most of you well know,the subject of UFOs is a very sensitive area.For that reason,I made the decision to keep this information to myself.I sometimes listen to coast to coast and recently heard of a report of a triangle shaped vehical in total silence over a residence in Bristol, Tn, which is ten minutes east of my location.  After hearing this,I decided to post this information.  From my understanding,the Bristol Tn event took place in the late evening or night hours of August 30,2013.I have been checking this website daily for an update, in hopes of reading this report.I would like to thank everyone involvled in the developement and creation of UFORC, which has given me the opportunity to post this wonderful and truely amazing experience.

I woke up to a strange light on my chest and began to faint right when I woke up.  Looking at the footboard there were three figures that I knew were solid real physical in the realm life forms.  When I woke up I ran to the backyard and looked at the sky and there it was.  	A black pyramid floating in the sky was moving very slow as in the form of flying and floating since it didn’t zip through the sky I watched it until it floated over the horizon then I ran into the house and went to my room listening to the sound of silence.  Nothing made noise and it had seemed that the entire planet was asleep until I realized that it was sneaking over the horizon with the sounds of screams breaking out and the pyramid deflecting the sounds until it was quiet.  In my room hoping I was unnoticed a running transparent life form wrestled with me until I was able to grab a knife and fought until it ran away.  	I was injured when I went to stab it and I lost control of the knife and it got lodged in my kneecap.  Bandaging my wound I went to the front yard without waking anyone up in my house since I hoped that my house was under their radar and being the witness of a probable vessel had just passed by there was no compromising my family since I don’t know how well the recovery would have been.  Opening the front door I witnessed a red helicopter pulling a rope up and then it flew away.   Moving back into the house my parents walked up to me looked at me and said I needed to go to the hospital since I looked crazy to them however I didn’t want to tell them what had just happened since something could and possibly would have caused harm.  At the hospital I was given a pill which put me to sleep and I decline to openly speak to people about it since I believe there is a reason to respectfully remain silent until a professional approaches to prove the floating black pyramid exists.

Triangle one got aggressive and shot at the white ball one until it left. I was watching TV show and my son played video games in his room.  I don’t know if this matters, but it’s what prompted me to see go outside so I need to tell you that I am a spiritual medium (a person who can interact with spirits from other dimensions). I heard a voice say go to the back door and not to turn on the porch light. I thought it was an odd request, but nothing surprises me in my profession.  My home backs up to a side street, but there are no street lights anywhere near so it’s very dark at night.  I stepped onto my back patio and everything seemed unusually quiet for our neighborhood.  There were no dogs barking around me or anything.  I could see the stars and moon clearly.  There were no clouds around us either. In the distance I could see what looked like a white ball thing moving around.  My son asked me what I was doing and decided to stay outside with me watching as I pointed out the white ball object moving around in the sky.  I saw something similar a few summers ago when I was sitting outside by my fire-pit late at night. My son pointed straight up and I saw something larger hovering over our house. It was dark and larger, resembled a triangle.  It had an orange light on the bottom so I thought maybe it was a helicopter or airplane.  The object moved vertically which I thought was really strange.  What caught my attention was that it did not make any noise.  It was completely silent so I knew it wasn’t a plane or helicopter.  It was fairly high above our house, but as we stood and watched it came closer and we could clearly see an orange flame on the bottom and that’s when I realized this thing was larger than I thought. There were two people walking behind my house who didn’t know we were outside. I heard one ask the other what that was in the sky.  As they passed I heard a man say “I don’t know!”   My son grabbed my camera and we tried to get a photo but I couldn’t zoom in enough to really make out anything. It was blurry so I stopped trying to photograph it. My 15 year old son said it looked like something out of Star Wars.  We watched it for 20 minutes and the white ball thing was still there moving closer when suddenly a red light like you would see from Star Wars shot out of the darker object towards the white ball thing! My son and I were really freaked out as a few more shots were fired.  I felt like we were witnessing UFO’s fighting one another.  The white ball thing zipped out of sight after that. The dark object hovered for another 20 minutes and we could not take our eyes off it after seeing that. It moved up and down very slow similar to how hot air balloons move.  Then it floated up so far it was completely out of our sight. My son kept asking me what that was. I told him it had to be a UFO.  We were both so excited and amazed by what we saw that we couldn’t go to bed.  My son must have been scared because he wouldn’t sleep in his room alone for the next few nights.  I admit that once I comprehended what we witnessed I was very unnerved by it.  I felt vulnerable like this thing was going to come get me or something.  It takes a lot to freak me out since I talk to spirits for a living. Then maybe from my fear of seeing this I had a dream that I was in an alien ship naked with some type of helmet on my head, and my arms were being restrained.  There were wires or tubes hooked all over my body.  I became aware and started yelling for them to let me go.  I couldn’t really remember much of anything else. I question to this day if that was just a dream.  I really hope so. My parents live exactly one mile from me.  I did not mention anything about the UFO to anyone.  My parents started telling me that when they were diving home a week ago on Thursday night they saw something weird in the sky.  I asked what time. It was the same time we were outside watching!  That makes three other people besides me in our family and two strangers that witnessed this thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Then, the white lights turned back to red lights, and faded into one red blinking light with the blue solid light.  Slightly moving a bit north, the red light would fade black, then reappear.   This repeated over randomly in the Western horizon for about 40 mins.  One, and two red blinking lights with the solid blue light.  Sometimes, the lights were vertical to each to each other.

We were pretty much south and out of city lighting.  He was driving.  I was in the front passenger seat.  It was 6:09pm CST.  The sun had set long ago, I believe at 4:31pm CST.  Sky was completely dark.  I could see a few stars.  The wind was fairly calm. I looked out my side window and saw two large brilliant yellowish-gold orbs with bright white edges in the sky to the southwest at about my two o’clock position.  They were almost completely round with an ever so slight elliptical shape.  They were side-by-side with space between them equal to about twice each of their size.  I thought someone was shining lights up in the sky or something reflecting but there was no illumination path from anywhere on the ground.   Suddenly, an identical third one appeared in line to the south of the first two; again, with space from the first two equal to about two times its size.  I thought someone had sent up lit candle balloons but I hadn’t seen anything ascend upwards.   I hadn’t taken my eyes off the first two when the third appeared.  These three appeared to hover in line in the sky then move ever so slightly to the north in unison, then back again, and then start to move around independently within what appeared to be yards of each other.   They returned to their original in-line places and suddenly another one appeared to the south of the trio but this one stopped about three spaces away.  Then another appeared to the south of the fourth one, stopping one space away.   The lights went out on the fourth and then back on.  All were the same color, shape, and size.  All five appeared to be lined up parallel to highway BR13.   The first three orbs started darting around changing places and returned to their original line-up within a matter of maybe four seconds while the other two also darted around and returned to their places.   Suddenly the first three lit orbs moved quickly, what appeared to be a few yards, to the northwest; I could see the first one then change direction and quickly arch up then down and dart off fast to the west and disappear as the lights went out on the second and third.  During this time, the fourth and fifth lit orbs suddenly moved, what appeared to be a few yards, to the south then the f! ifth quickly arched up then down and continued on, darting off! fast to the south while the lights went out on the fourth one.  With that, they were gone. When I first saw the first three orbs I commented on it to my son.  He was able to see the fourth and fifth through the front window. From start to finish, this all occurred within about 1.5 minutes.  Because it was dark, it is difficult to estimate the size of the orbs and their exact location above the ground.  I believe they had been hovering approximately over County Rd BB between S. Lincoln Ave and highway BR13. We drove perhaps another mile and turned around, driving back to the area as I wanted to double check if there was anything at all in the area that could have reflected some type of golden colored moving lights.  I saw none.  I also checked the small local airport to the north of this area finding it was quiet and not all lit up. We continued south then turning east at a nearby intersection.  At this point we were about 1/2 mile from where we had seen the orbs.  It’s about nine minutes later.  Using the cell phone, I called my husband to let him know what had just happened.  The phone was silent as usual for its connection moment and then there was no ringing sound.  I have been using cell phones since 1994.  Instead of a ringing, what I heard was something I had never heard before on a cell phone or anywhere else for that matter.  There were all sorts of treble clef blubb and blibb sounds going up, down, and swirling around at the same time.   That’s the best I can describe it although I can audibly reproduce it fairly well.  The sound did not stop.  I said “hello” twice just to be safe.  My son looked at me; I handed him the phone and he heard it, also saying “hello”.  The sound continued.  He disconnected the phone.  He had also never heard these sounds before.   I waited about 20 seconds and called! my husband again.  The call went through to him. Our family if familiar with star gazing, observing satellites, etc. We've seen unusual things before at home or when driving but nothing involving several orbs at once.",2013-11-20T00:00:00,44.6271,-90.1981

We lost track of it for a second as it passed over our roof, and just as it did we turned right from Wallace to Maple we caught sight of it again.  It was right outside the passenger side, where I was sitting, almost directly above us and very low.  I could see it perfectly. It was a triangular craft with three bright white lights, one at each point.  They were sunk in a bit, like pot lights, and there was one small red light that was barely visible just behind one of the white lights (toward the inside).  The light pollution from the city lit up the bottom of the craft.  I could see it's shape so well that I could see the bevelled edges and the details on the bottom. The strangest part for me was how smooth and fast it moved.  In a matter of 1-2 minutes – the time it took us to turn onto Maple and the then turn onto the Westmorland Street Bridge – it went from being directly over us and clearly visible to being so far away it only appeared to be a single light in the distance.  The path it seemed to be travelling was roughly NW to SE (I saw it come from the Brookside area and lost sight of it over the river out Lincoln way).",2013-11-20T00:00:00,45.85845371702638,-66.63156282973621

A couple friends and I (3 people total) decided to climb up Green Mountain to view all of Denver’s fireworks for the 4th. We could see all of Denver from about Alameda North.   At about 9:40 PM (21:40) we saw 6-8 really bright lights traveling in an oval pattern in the sky.  Using our geographical reference, they looked to be above Arvada or Westminster.  They were moving quicker and more fluid like than any other aircraft I had observed.   The circling oval pattern abruptly stopped after about 10 - 20 seconds.  Now only 4 lights remained and they quickly shuffled around each other in their own unique oval shaped patterns. After about 5 seconds of this the lights reduced down to three in which they formed a triangle in the sky. The lights then began to weave in and out of each other, yet always returning back to the original triangle shape.  The sharp degree turns that these crafts would turn at was remarkable; they could flip a direct 180 degree turn at a really high velocity as if momentum was not a factor.   This triangular light pattern lasted for about 20 seconds until 2 suddenly disappeared as if flying north at a really fast speed.   The last light remained for a while longer, the departure of this light was observed as if it were shrinking in size and dimming in luminescence to blend with the city street lights until we could see it no longer.  We potentially considered this last beam of light to have landed as it sunk to blend in with the city lights.   All three individuals can vet for what they saw on the mountain that day, and we all agree that these air crafts were far more advanced than anything we have seen in the skies before.  It was a very inspiring and beautiful spectacle we were graced with.",2013-07-14T00:00:00,39.74054676258993,-105.26999208633094

When we reached mile marker 36, the passenger in my car exclaimed “what is that?” I had to lean down to see the objects out the passenger window.

The objects were not moving, but hovering in that position as you could see planes to the north with obvious jet trails.  We were able to quickly pull over at a rest area (Southbound Pacific Junction Rest Area on I-29) and found a clear area where we could video the objects.  Within the first two minutes of seeing these objects they moved from a triangle to a straight line – the point of the triangle staying stationary while the other two rotated and moved to form the line.  As they were doing this, they only signs of motion were the changes in position.  We filmed and watched them for a little more than five minutes after we pulled over.  They then moved from a straight line to a more arced line, again the top point never moving position as the other two moved into position.  The objects did get a bit fainter towards the end of the time we were watching them, but hovered steadily.  We then saw a plane approaching from the south.  As we watched this plane approach closer we were shocked as the instant the plane entered the video frame, the objects disappeared.  No flashing or fading, just completely disappearing like a switch was flipped.  We continued to watch the area for approximately five minutes and nothing reappeared. NOTE:  In the video, you will hear us discussing a fourth object that remained after the other three disappeared.  We did determine after the fact that this was a star; however we could find no celestial reason for the other three objects.",2013-10-14T00:00:00,41.243651578947365,-95.79313315789473

The orb looked bright orange, was approx 6 times bigger than a star and appeared to be coming closer to us. It was so bright it lit up the water between the Toronto Island, the airport and the shoreline with a bright orange glow.   There was no chance this could have been a flare or a lantern of some kind, it was too bright.  The top of the orb appeared to be emitting a smoke trail.  This is why we exited the building, because I thought it was a meteor of some kind.   Upon reaching the outdoors we could no longer see anything in the sky so we returned indoors after 20 minutes.  When we came back to the window, nothing was in the sky, so I began to research other similar sightings on the Internet, when all of the sudden, it flickered back on like a flashlight.

At approximately 6:58 pm, to my right in the western sky at about 40 degrees off the horizon, I noticed 3 very bright white/amber colored lights in a perfect triangle in the sky. My initial thought was it is too early to see planets or stars, what is that.  I continued to look at this perfect triangle in the sky for about 30 seconds.  As I looked back to the Northwest clearly saw a commercial aircraft with the vapor trail. The aircraft with the vapor trail was not as bright or the same color as the 3 lights forming the Triangle. I looked back at the lights forming the Triangle and the bottom right light began to move down and to my right creating a triangle with the right side being longer, there was no sign of movement or vapor trail. At that time I said to my business partner who was driving, “What is that”?  She leaned over and looked out my window and one of us said, “We need to film this.”   During this time and our conversation the lights have moved into a straight vertical line, again with no vapor trail.  As we were searching for a place to pull over, I began filming on my IPhone 5S while we were driving and the lights moved into a wide arch over the horizon.   Around mile marker 37 on I29 South we saw rest stop ahead pulled over it took a moment to get the lights to appear in frame on my phone screen.

I will keep it short and sweet.  I was driving home when I noticed what I thought must be the planets aligning.  Four lights in the sky that for all intents and purposes looked like stars, only their size and brightness was highly unusual.  Visual, they were the size of small basketballs as seen by the naked eye.  I'm no astronomer, but I don't think 4 planets are that visibly big and so close to each other in the sky.  It seems like there'd be an announcement of the event, anyways.  The lights were arranged almost like an upside-down Big Dipper, or a triangle composed of four lights.  What really convinced me that this was some special type of craft was the fact that when I stopped moving, I noticed that the lights did not move at all.   Shortly after they dissipated.   There were many planes in the sky for reference to the size of these objects as well, and they were like flies compared to birds.  I wonder if anyone saw this as well?  It was amazingly bright ! and I couldn't help but have my attention snared.   Sorry, no pictures.

The  orange dots were low in the sky and not in any uniform formation.  I immediately called my mother and she in turn called a friend. All 3 of us saw the same same thing from 3 different locations within Sacramento , CA. I have been going over all of the possibilities in my head as to what t this could have been. h Te sun had already set and there was no sunset after glow.  We do have an airport, but even if it was planes lining up to land, they would be moving and not that close together. Maybe it was Chinese lanterns for a soltice celebration?  Did our local military drop flares from an aircraft?? One of the orange dots actually started to ""fall to the ground.  It turned white in color and stopped falling and hovered in place. All of the other orange dots stayed in place.  One of the dots had 2 smaller dots that moved erratically around it in very close proximity.  When I finally got work I could no longer see the dots in the sky.  On my way to work, I had to make a turn onto another street going southbound and that is when I lost sight of the dots.  My mother and her friend both kept watching them. I saw a helicopter, possibly local law enforcement or the news, travel at a high rate of speed towards the dots.  My mothers friend said she saw a plane approach the dots and they just went away. I don't know if they flew off or just vanished.  I will try to get clarification. Here are some final thoughts: I drive a sports car, which means it sits very low and the windshield has a limited view.  These dots were not that high up, but not ground level either.  My mothers friend lives near the Capital City Freeway (business 80] and Cal Expo. This means there is a lot of light pollution, and these things were very visible in the sky to her.  I have looked online at the local news sites, nothing is mentioned.  I even looked at the airport website, no mention of any major events that would require 20 planes to be in the area.  There were about 6 planes that landed in the time frame this took place.  I don't know where else to look for answers. I am trying to be logical, but this just baffles me.  If it was actual alien UFOs, awesome, if not, then ok, but what was it?  Curiosity is killing this cat. Thank you for your time and energy.

They were NOT stars We were driving south on Hwy P, returning to Jackson from West Bend, WI.  It is quite dark on Hwy P, therefore the stars in the sky are more visible than they are in a more lighted area. My son pointed a group of lights in the sky that appeared to be flashing and floating slightly.  I am not at all a believer in UFO's or aliens, but this spooked me out.  If it were just one or two floating flashes of light, I would have assumed it was an airplane or two...but this was not the case.  There were multiple flashes of light. We looked west, towards the Town of Hartford.  In that direction, I counted more than 20 flashes of light that appeared to be moving.  There was an obvious difference between the stars are these entities of light. I have no idea what they were, but they were spread across the sky and moving.  The stars were stationary in comparison. As we approached our home, there were a few Jackson Police officers along with a Washington County Sheriff who had pulled over a man who apparently been drinking.  I asked one of the officers if she had a moment as I was driving by.  She said yes, so I pulled my car over.  She came over and my children and I got out and began explaining what we saw.  By that time, the westward sky was blocked by trees, and the officer dismissed the handful of lights that were eastward as airplanes.  I could see she was not going to believe the story we were telling about the multiple lights west of us.  I then just asked if she knew of any military exercises in the area.  She replied that she knew of none. With that, we left and went home. My sons and I were having a hard time shaking what we had just seen.  It was NOT normal.

I looked up to the sky to my right over the tree line and saw lights in the sky.   At first I thought it was an airplane because we have Albany International airport not too far away.  As I got closer I thought I can't be an airplane because it was stationary and low to the ground the object was maybe 50 feet above the tree line.   My next thought was it must be a helicopter but as I got closer to the object I knew it was not a helicopter by its shape and the fact it was making no noise.   I stopped my car in the middle of the road and through a gap in the trees I could make out the object.  It had sky-blue lights on the ends of its wings and four lights underneath alternating red and white.  The lights gave off an illumination that was different from a light on a regular airplane, they were almost glowing but not like spotlights.   The object was small like the size of a car.  Its wings were shaped like bananas or like a three-dimensional triangle which were divided symmetrically by a similar shape on top of the center of the craft.  Underneath the craft were two protruding geometrical shapes that looked like rudders on an airplane but these pointed towards the ground.   After I stopped my car, the object hovered for a few seconds then very smoothly like a balloon floating through the air began to fly away from me deeper into the nature preserve.  The shape of the craft, the fact that it was in a location not easly accessible by people, its relation to the tree line, the way it glided through the sky, and the fact it made no sounds lead me to believe it was a ufo.   I tried to follow the object by roads surrounding the preserve but to no avail.  I have to say I'm a believer of ufo sightings I just never thought I would be privy to one.  I immediately went home and tried to draw the object I saw to the ! best of my abilities.   I am a male in my early thirties and am always aware of my surroundings.  I know a thing or two about planes and this was not a plane.  There is Knolls Atomic Power laboratory near by and who knows what they're doing in those facilities.  The object I saw was unique and like nothing I have seen before.   I had a camera phone but by the time I got over the awe the object was pulling away and I didn't have a good angle.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,,

My grandmother told me countless stories of her own that took place in that town.  Although I didn't have my own experiences until my mid twenties.  Near my house, the Saugatuck Reservoir stretches miles of road all the way down to Wilton CT.  Towards the end of high school, my friends and I would marvel at the lights that were over the woods and reservoir.  They would move in and out of the tree line at a place called devils den, then emerge in plain view to hover in groups, sometimes as many as six.  I remember seeing these lights constantly after we discovered them, as soon as it got dark they were always there. When I was 24, I moved back home for a couple months and totally forgot about the strange lights.  I never really knew what to make of them and don't believe in anything paranormal, so I dismissed them entirely.  Until one night when I was getting ready to watch a monday night football game with my friend and girlfriend.  I was placing an order for pizza on the phone, when my friend became fascinated with an on old dusty tin can loaded with change sitting on my shelf.  It had been there for years.  I looked at him, then at the can and noticed it was shaking and emitting almost a humming noise.  While I was placing the order on the phone, both him and my girlfriend got closer to the object and it got louder. Sure enough, my friend reached out to touch it and it flew across the room. Total elapsed time was about a minute.  Considering we were grown adults, we did not panic.  I kept saying it was a mouse or something, my friend kept joking that it was a ghost.  Needless to say, we coul! dn't do anything about it so we went to get our food. When we got back, all of us began our ascent up the stairs when the door to my room suddenly opened seemingly for us. That spooked us down the stairs right away. I was the first to laugh, telling them that the door was most likely not properly closed and the motion of going up the old stair case jarred it free. My friend was adamant he saw the knob move, but I told him that has happened before and he calmed down. Old house, old door, no big deal. My friend stayed to eat, but left soon after claiming he was tired. About an hour later, I was lying on my bed watching the game, adjacent to a window that gave me a pretty good view of the sky. All of the sudden, a jet like object came into my peripheral. I looked over and saw it moving slowly, I was in the middle of pointing this object out to my girlfriend when it quickly went directly over my house, no more than 20 yards above the roof. Instantly, I ran outside and saw nothing. It was absolutely silent. I knew it couldn't have b! een a jet or helicopter, but I convinced myself it was. The weeks after were strange. Doors kept opening, and I saw a figure constantly. The only way I can describe him was a silhouette of Abraham Lincoln. Tall, skinny and what looked like a top hat. I don't know what the hell that experIence was, but I moved out soon after that. My mother still lives in that house and started to tell me she has had experiences that she claims could only be 'ghosts', even though she never believed in that stuff just years ago. I have since moved away, first to Newtown in 2011 when I had a similar experience that I reported to this site. For reasons unrelated to this activity, I am now in PA. and have not experienced any new activity in two years. I returned to visit my family for a couple days. I never made sense of those experiences, but years later, I remain curious. I went back to the spot where I remember seeing those lights all the time, and sure enough they were there. Hovering, moving back and forth between the woods of devils den and wilton. There was a very recent ufo report in wilton from dozens of residents that was reported in their police log. I have no idea what any of this stuff is or how it gets investigated, but I would tell any curious ufo hunter to go down to the Saugatuck reservoir in Redding on a clear night, for some reason I remember them being more animate on full moons, and watch the lights towards Wilton. A handful of times me and a friend saw them closer, below the tree line on Dayton road, the road alongside the entrance of devils den. Although I have been down that road many nights and the occurrence is rare. Try to make sense of it if you can, but I'm glad to be far away from the area.",2013-07-03T00:00:00,41.3022,-73.3883

As I was standing in my driveway with my dog for the last time before bed I noticed a strange light in the sky.  I am on the flight path between Chicago and Atlanta and see planes all the time but this ""plane"" was very low and caught my attention as it moved silently across the sky over my home. After a few moments of watching it I noticed that there was no red, white, or green light.  Nor was there any blinking of the light.  Also, as it moved from north to overhead and on south there was no change in the shape of the light I could see.  In other words there was no mass...like a wing, tail, body...moving between me and any of the light.  The circular flower-like shape of the light never changed in any way. I decided this was something unusual and that I needed to make a picture.  I ran, as fast as I could, into the house to grab my camera, a distance of about 20 feet and then back out.  By the time I returned to the driveway it had gone behind one small cloud.  I turned on my digital camera but kept getting a ""picture error"" code.  I had to turn it on and off several times before I could get it to work.   When the object came out where I could see it again it was far enough away--and the streetlight was between it and me--so I could not get a picture.  Then it was just gone.  I though, oh well...missed it, and turned to go back in the house when I noticed another one crossing the sky behind my home!   I took off at a fast walk toward the back to get away from the streetlight and my front porch light to get a better picture.  As I walked back past the house I saw about three more.  The motion sensor triggered the back porch light so had to keep walking to the back corner of the house.  By the time I got there I could see five or six of these lights just a above the walnut trees...straight up!   I could also hear police sirens from the time I began my walk from the front coming from the north-northeast.  I did not think anything about that as it is not uncommon with a main road running east/west just about a mile north of my house.  The sirens stopped shortly after I turned the corner of the house.  I have to wonder if they were seeing what I was about to see as it was coming from the same direction. When I turned the back corner of the house and looked to the north-northeast there was a whole line of them.  Not a straight line--but kind of like you would see helicopters in a war movie.  The first thought I had was ""invasion"".  There must have been at least 15-20 of these things altogether and they passed right over me without one sound.  Absolute silence!  Not even the siren was blaring anymore.  Total and absolute silence!   I moved into the shadow behind my house and began making pictures. As many as I could get.  I was shaking and my heart was pounding so some are shaky but I propped the camera on a birdhouse attached to a tree and got a good one of the line coming toward me.    I stayed in the shadows until they were all gone because I was afraid they would see me...they were that close.  I was able to get about 20 pictures before they moved south out of sight behind trees.  It couldn't have taken more than 5 minutes for the last one to move from the northern horizon to the south far enough that I couldn't see them any more. About 5 minutes later I was on the phone with a friend who lives south telling him to look for them (he never saw them) when I saw the last one.  It was low on the horizon to the east and I could only see it as it passed the area at the end of the street at the intersection I was standing on. The area I live in is on high ground between the White river and another river that feeds into it from Morse Reservoir Northeast of Indianapolis, IN.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,40.06087881355933,-85.99161652542372

I grabbed my binoculars and could see a disk shape and under it 4 red lights in a diamond shape that changed colors from red to white or yellow and the lights moved in different formations it started to moved slowly almost over my house going south then slowly back to the spot I first seen it which was north west.  It was right above the path of planes that leave LAX that usually fly in the path over my house I wondered if any of the planes spotted it but the UFO was very high that you can easily lose it in the blue sky.  It stood hovering for 26 minutes I went inside to grab my phone camera and came back to look at it but some clouds rolled in and I could not see it any! more.

I went to my daughters room which is down the hall (10 feet), where her curtains were open and I saw what appeared to be a round object.

The white lights were very bright and flashed much more quickly then these two lights.  I could see a structure to this craft and it appeared to be round.  Due to the darkness the detail could not be made. Going back to the lights, the best way to explain the position of the lights is by showing them in a lower case ""t"".  One red light was at the top, the other at the bottom, while the two white lights were one on each side of the arms of the ""t"".

In the past week or so, I have seen either a C-17 or C-5 flying north of where I live, but they were MUCH higher then this craft, at approximately 20,000 feet.  I waited some time to see if one would fly back around again, and none have.  The nearest AFB is Andrews in MD, while Langley is south east. I know without a doubt that it was not a helicopter. This was much, much bigger. Quantico, Stafford are within 20 minutes of my house while Shannon is within 10.  Neither Shannon or Stafford could support any large aircraft.

We set up a couple of camping chairs on the edge of the road so that we could look at the night sky to the north east and have a conversation. At about 19:30 I turned my gaze to the north and saw a white light in the sky at about 10:00 above the horizon.  The light was moving slowly from north to south and appeared to be both below and in some clouds that peppered the otherwise clear sky.  The light was soft white with no blinking running lights and did not have the bright glare of an airplane headlight.  It looked similar to a satellite but was about 3 to 5 times larger.  There was no sound. If one were to hold their arm out and spread their fingers to about 4 inches, that would be the distance this object travelled.  It then faded out at the end and disappeared.  From our vantage point this object was moving more towards us than away. A couple of minutes later I looked at the same location and saw a light that looked exactly the same but this time it was headed at a 90 degree angle from where the first one was seen to fade out and this one went about the same distance from east to west and faded out as well. At about 20:00 my attention again was drawn to this location in the sky and another white light was moving very slowly from east to west again seeming to be in the clouds and not above them.  This one was seen for a longer duration of 3 minutes where the others were viewed for just under a minute each.  This 3rd light disappeared into the clouds and my friend G*** said it should be coming out of the clouds at a break in them at any moment.

I have had sightings, strange happenings, extremely bad relationships, and various other abnormal occurrences in the past. I am 59 years old, of Irish descent with assorted physical ailments. I come from a military family, with my maternal grandfather having possible ties to CIA and other extraordinary facts about him. Since the beginning of July 2013, we have had more obvious signs that something is going on while we sleep. My boyfriend is adamantly against any of the theories I have about what is going on, but that could be his mind control. My mind control (for lack of a better term) seems to be fracturing. On the morning of July 1, 2013 I woke up feeling more exhausted than usual. While going to the restroom, I noticed a triangular shaped (series of dots) bruise on my thigh, just above the right knee. Thinking that it was curious to have that shape there, I took pictures of my leg. I will email those to you along with other pictures referenced later. About a week later, I had one on my other leg, same shape and same size, and was more toward the inside of my thigh, but I didn’t take pictures of that one. I wake up with various bruising and that sort of thing, but never think that much about it. These things are coming to be more frequent and definitely more blatant. On the morning of August 18, 2013, I woke up to having a very bloodshot (left) eye. I am emailing pictures of that as well. It feels like I have something in my eye, even after it has appeared to heal. I also had small bruises and a strange series of puncture holes in a crescent shape on the top of my left thigh (adding pictures).  Last year, I can’t give you a date, but sometime before September 2012, I woke up to a feeling like there was something in my left ear. My boyfriend has looked in the ear, but doesn’t see anything.It still bothers me sometimes. I find it more than coincidental that this is my left thigh (crescent shaped puncture wound), left ear and left eye. I have not been to a doctor for several reasons. I don’t have insurance, I don’t like doctors, and I am afraid of what they might think and what ! they will do to me. On Sunday, August 31, 2013, one of our American Bulldogs who sleeps in our bedroom woke us up at about 4 am in a panic. She is 110 lbs. and was attempting to hide behind the nightstand, and panting. We took her to the emergency vet, and they have found nothing wrong with her. We are in the process of running more tests to rule out physical problems. That is when I decided to do more research, look for investigators, support groups, etc. Whatever has been happening, is now affecting my animals, and that is not okay. They cannot speak for themselves and I have no memories of anything, so I need to find out. I am very determined to do so, I am finding it difficult to find anyone locally… If you can help, I would so appreciate it.

The location is rural southern Illinois within two miles of the Indiana state line.  The time is 9:30 PM, within a few minutes of accuracy.  I am 16yrs. of age; having become a licensed driver a couple of months previous, and with permission had borrowed my mother’s car to visit girlfriends in a nearby town across the Indiana line.  I was subject to a 10:00 PM curfew, so I departed my friend’s home at about 9:20 knowing that the journey would take approximately 20 minutes to my home.  It was a mild summer evening of clear skies and slender crescent moon.  As there are no towns of any size within 70 miles, the sky was studded with stars.  The night was so beautiful I decided to put the top down on my mother’s convertible and take the old state road through the agriculture fields and drive leisurely rather the new divided highway which ran parallel about a mile away.  I knew there was little likelihood of encountering other traffic as this stretch of road was mainly used by farm equipment during the day. The terrain in this area is very flat, and I would be traversing through about 8 miles of crop fields of mainly corn, wheat, and melons.  There are many small creeks, which meander and crisscross through these fields.  When the fields were originally cleared for crops, ribbons of trees and shrubs along the creek edges, and sometimes just to divide fields in general were left intact.  None of these trees would be considered “giant”, the tallest in the range of 60 feet. After crossing the state line from Indiana and making a left turn on the farming road heading due west, I almost immediately saw a very large, bright glowing below the tree line just beyond the second creek crossing on the left.  My first thought was that it must be a large piece of farm equipment such as a combine, but I immediately dismissed this as it was too late for planting, and way too early for harvest, the corn being about one to two feet in height.  The light was so large and so startling that I reduced my speed to a crawl, turned off the headlights & radio.  This didn’t seem dangerous as I saw no traffic in either direction, and the light was definitely over a field and not something on the road. I continued to proceed at a snails pace until I passed the second ribbon of trees along a creekbed and was directly in view of the light.  At this point I pulled over to the shoulder and parked.  I exited the car in a state of utter amazement & astonishment.  Hovering motionless and soundless about 25 feet in front of me and about 25 feet above the corn was an object.  It was glowing over its entire surface with diffuse white light.  The light was bright, but not so bright that it was painful to stare at, and clearly visible through the light was a silver metal craft that appeared to be elliptical in shape.  The field it was hovering over was approximately the size of a football field and this object was covering more than half of it. I walked to the other side of the road nearer to the object and as well a bit down the road to be sure my estimation of the shape and dimensions were accurate, and to see if I could discern any thing like windows or doors or markings, but I could not.  At this point I was wishing another car would come along, as I knew that no one would believe me if I told about it.  After a few minutes of captivated astonishment, I began to question myself as to whether I had the courage to walk into the field directly under it.  Intense curiosity was overtaking me, but I decided that walking under it might not be a good idea.  I then had the thought that I was trembling, probably in fear, which caused me to actually pay attention to my body, and realized that I was not really afraid, nor was I trembling.  The actual feeling in my body was as if every atom was slightly vibrating. After a few more minutes I decided to throw caution to the wind walk into the field.  Just as I reached the corn and the edge of the craft, it began to rise slowly and smoothly and silently.  When it reached and cleared the top of the trees, it accelerated and climbed rapidly in a southerly direction.  Within 3 to 4 seconds it was no longer visible.  As it departed it emitted a spray of multicolored sparkling particles that drifted down on top of the corn and dissipated.  At this point I was grateful that I wasn’t directly under when it departed.  I suspected those sparkling particles might have been dangerous/hazardous to my health and well being. I got back in the car and sat there a few more minutes in awe at what I had witnessed, and realized that I would probably never tell my family, friends, or anyone about this experience.  The entire event lasted approximately 15 minutes.  Prior to this experience I had heard of UFO sightings but in typical teenage fashion of the day I thought they were mainly reported by uneducated people who lived in trailer parks and wore tin foil hats.  My main concerns at the time centered about clothes, hair, make-up & boys. It sounds like this is the end of the experience, but it isn’t.  My mother’s car at the time was late model 50’s and had neither a clock nor seatbelts.  I knew what time I had departed my friend’s house (9:20 PM) and despite the time spent on the event on the way home, I expected to still be on time for my curfew at 10:00 PM.  When I arrived home and glanced at the kitchen clock upon entering, I received a profound shock.  Something was wrong with time!  I was not missing time, but apparently had gained time.  I had arrived home in less than five minutes after departing my friends’ house.  I immediately checked this clock against others in the house and against TV programming and it appeared accurate.  I phoned my friend the following day to verify what time I had left her house.  To this day I cannot reconcile these facts.",,,

Two hours of time lost during the encounter. Statement of 6/1/13:  This encounter occurred during the month of May, 1987.  I lived in McPherson, Kansas.  My parents lived in Salina, Kansas.  My husband was a sheriff’s deputy and worked the 4-12 shift.   On Friday or Saturday evenings, I would leave our home early in the evening and take my two daughters, aged 4 and 5 months old, and drive to Salina to visit with my parents for the evening.  I always left my parents home at 10:00 in the evening, and always called my mother when I and the children returned home so she knew we were safe and off the highway.   It was a 30 minute drive from Salina to McPherson on the highway.  Lindsborg is 14 miles from Salina, halfway back to McPherson.  As I approached Lindsborg’s lights on my right hand side,  I glanced back at my sleeping 4 year old and also at my infant daughter asleep in her carrier in the front seat of my car.  I could see the sodium lights of the rest area, called “Stuckey’s” about a mile ahead and to my right off the highway.   I became aware that I! saw something outside of my driver side window.  I looked up in the sky.  Around 500 feet up, across the double highway a solid black shape was ‘hanging’ in the air.  I recall there was a red light, a green light and a white light and they were in the corners of the object.  I determined it was a black triangle shaped object.  It was totally silent, not moving, just hanging there, blotting out the stars and clouds in the night sky.  I rolled down my window to listen, but there was no sound except my tires on the pavement. I thought, “I should stop for a moment to see what this is.”  I remember pulling over to the side of the road on the highway.  There were cars across the grassy center on the opposite side of the highway also stopping.  One car behind me was also pulling over.  I looked over at my sleeping daughter in the front seat, and opened my car door.  I had my right hand on the steering wheel, my left hand on the top of my open door pulling myself up out of the car.  My left foot was on the road of the highway, my right still on the floo! rboard o f my car.  I looked up and this triangle shape was just THERE.  Hanging.   Silent with three soft lights barely shining.  My car tires bumped up over the raised part of our driveway and I parked my car.  I took my 4 year old into the house and put her in her bed.  I returned to the car and got my 5 month old daughter and the diaper bag out of the front seat.  I set her, in her carrier, down on the couch in the living room and was surprised to see headlights turn into our driveway and flash across our kitchen window.  My husband, a sheriff’s deputy, burst into the front door, both angry and worried.  “Where have you been?” he demanded. I was rather surprised but told him, “I just left mothers…what are you doing home so early?” “EARLY?” he shouted, “It’s midnight!  Your mother has been going crazy calling the department, saying you must have had a wreck, I have half the department out looking in the ditches for you!”  I was stunned.  I looked at the clock on the stove, it said, ‘ 12:05’.  I said that was impossible, that I had JUST left there 35 minutes ago.  How could it be after midnight?   I told him what I had seen in the sky and when he calmed down a bit, he called information and got the name of the Salina Air Base and handed me the phone.  I dialed the number and a nice young man answered and I after explaining about the triangle shaped ‘plane’  I asked him if the Army was testing any new aircraft over the highway between Salina and Lindsborg.  He said he was not sure, but he would transfer me to someone that could answer my questions.   Another man got on the phone and identified himself as a Colonel.  He was very nice at first, questioning me about who was with me when I saw this shape, what time it happened and more general questions.  He then turned cold.  “What is your name, ma'am?  What is your address?”  I put my hand over the phone and whispered  to my husband, “He wants my name and address..”  My husband took the phone out of my hand and hung up.  He said, “They want to know who you are and where you live for a reason..”  This was long before the days of caller I.D. and cell phones, being 1987. After that experience, I began to develop a fear of the nighttime.  I would go in the car at night, but years went by and I continued to lean forward and search through the windshield for “something.”  I had a very disturbing auditory experience for years, a low heavy ‘droning’ cycling in and out, I told my husband for years, while holding my ears, “Don’t you HEAR that? It’s driving me crazy!”  It sounded like a very large piece of machinery, with a very large engine droning on and on, from very far away.  I watched the night sky constantly, and avoided as much as possible going out after dark.  I found a place on my right arm, on the back, right above the elbow – there was something sharp and stabbing in my arm.  I would squeeze this area and feel something very sharp deep in the skin.  I had it for years.  During this time, I would have auditory experiences – if I stubbed my toe or bumped my shin, a hot ‘zip of electricity’ would run along the back of my head from one ear to the other and a robotic mechanical voice could be heard only by me.  “The small toe is injured.”  “The right leg is injured.”  Always this mechanical, emotionless voice.  I thought I was going crazy. I had a total hysterectomy in February of 1997.  From the time I had the hysterectomy, the voice, when ever I was injured, stopped.  I continued to notice the sharp object on the back of my arm and determined to remove whatever it was, got a needle and began digging on my arm.  As I am not left handed and it was on the back of my right arm, this was awkward and not very successful.  My husband knew about this sharp object and encouraged me to try to remove it.  After considerable digging and squeezing, a piece of razor thin white ‘plastic’ came out of my arm.  It was approximately one inch long and came to a dagger point.  I showed my husband the object and he told me to save it.  That was in 1999.  I regret I cannot remember what I did with this object.  My mind conveniently ‘forgot’ whether I saved it or discarded it. This is my story.  My husband is now a Chief of Police and will verify under oath all that I have related.  I am quite willing to undergo hypnosis or lie detector to verify my claim. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2013-06-02T00:00:00,38.3769,-97.7037

My exexcitedly told me o step outside.   Looking up there were 25 or more balls of blue gold red and green lights that were just above the trees.  It lit up the ground around like it was a full moon out even though there was not.  There was no structure nor sound and they moved very very slowly..  They looked  like roman candle balls and the same intnse glow.  We scooped up my daughter and hopped into the truck me in my fuzzy footed jammies even. We tore out of the field and went to next farm over.  The neighbors were were teaching barrel racing and said it must be a satelite that exploded and entered the earths atmoshere.  We were still freaked out because this is not an everyday occurance. arriving in the city of osawatomie we saw charlie the cop getting into his squad car and told him what we wittnessed.  He too had sen the same and reports were coming in from community.  Baffled and no ! answers after about an hour we pulled through the gate protecting the 100 acres where we lived.  Of into the distance to the north like heading to Olathe we could only see a trail about mile or so wide of orange sparks trailing behind the light balls path.   A few months went and one night in Olathe at friends house we were dinking and talking when the same sighting was seen by the other 2 females were were hanging out with.  They had witnessed the sighting too but they were in Lenexa at the arrowhead Apt. Pool/clubhouse.  They thought they were tripping and just seeing the same trip.  They had heard leter after their sighting it was a satellite and the pixals that were the balls of light we had all seen and reports of it seen all the way to canada. .   I do not know what it was.  Never heard anything about it til they told their story and nothing ever after that.   I was wondering did anyone else ever see anything like it as well around the same time frame?

I was taken from my bedroom by two tall beings that had human features and qualities. They took me aboard their craft gave me a tour of three floors explaining through mind non verbal communication what each are was for and their final discussion with me was events that were coming.  Showing me by a virtual reality show of their future response to events coming to our planet and our people.  I did not understand at that time that it was not coming then, I thought it was.  They did in no way harm me and in fact were very gentle, kind and loving, I was in no way afraid of them or ever felt threaten by them at all.  In fact I felt they were very much concerned for me and our planet.  They explained that they would be removing animals from our planet in order for life to continue. In 1974 I was  moving from PA. to CA. towing a trailer with the assistance of my brother I was 19 and he was 17 at that time.  Somewhere in the middle of farm country of OHIO at 3 am my brother was driving and I was awakened by his screaming my name.  The ford pinto I owned at the time was going on and off, all the lights engine and radio. Then all of a sudden it totally died.  Lights, radio engine completely shut down. We got a flashlight out of the glove box and got out lifted the hood to see what we could see, naive as  neither of us had a clue what we could do.  I suggested we get back in the car and what until morning and perhaps hitchhike to any near town as we were about 35 miles from any town.  So we just curled up to go to sleep and then there was a small red light that went flying over the nearby farm field in a flash. About 5 minutes later my car came back on radio, lights and engine started right back up.  Because everything had shut down we had not turned anything off so it just came right back on. From that day to the day I sold it I never had this ever occur again or any electrical problems. In 77 or 78 when Close Encounters of the Third Kind the movie came out my brother called me from calif to tell me to go see this movie without telling me why. And there in the movie was exactly what occurred to us.  I was never one who was someone who read any science fiction stories.  I may have been a Star Trek fan and I have always been a believer in all things are possible. But I was never one who was looking for these kind of encounters or interactions. I was recently living in Montana and had 4-5 encounters there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",2013-06-02T00:00:00,32.78722907702984,-117.14026773074254

When I had a bright Flash of light hit me at the corner of my left eye, and at first I thought it was a Camera flash, but who would have a camera in broad daylight using a flash when the sun was so bright?  But when I looked up to where the flash came from, it was the Sun bouncing off something, and I turned to my left, and It was ONE ""huge silver disk!""  It was just hovering there in the sky,as the sun was shinning on the Disk. It was ""Tilted"" there straight towards us. The Silver Disk was so low, it could not be more than 300 hundred foot off the water. I could see the swirls on the Silver Disk like it was polished! I told my wife to look up at that Hug Disk the sun bouncing off of. We could not believe how large It was, and we have seen many sightings out over the ocean, but never anything that low. It was Hovering just to the left of our Pontoon boat. With the sun on the disk, It was so bright, it was hard to look at it for long at a time, but yet it j! ust drawed you to look at it. We were in disbelief of such a l! arge Sil ver round disk and it was atleast 20 ft deep. The Silver Disk was to the South of us, and no more than a quarter of a mile from us, and tilted right down toward us in our boat like it was watching us. But there was no sound coming from it, or I would have heard It. I have never seen anything do what this Disk done so close to the water while it sit there tilted up for atleast 10 minutes. It was atleast a Hundred feet wide, if not more, and we did not know what to do. There were no markings, no windows that I could see. But it was only one big bright and shinny ""Soild"" Hug silver Round Disk. After it sit there for awhile, then It slowly turned up right to a level view, and it moved backwards away from us, but we could still see it. Then it moved back to the front of us like it was like focused on us. Should we leave, because we have heard people talk about being taken by some kind of a ship! Then it moved again, and it turned towards the North to North West, and the! disk vanished! I could not understand what it was doing here, or why this Disk seem to stay right with us. but we have seen a lot Large lights out over the ocean before, that I have in another Description.  We never seen any other planes out there at that time in the sky. It was amazing that it would not have any sound from the size it. I knew that we had seen a real UFO! It was kinda like you had to keep your eyes on it, as if it was trying to tell us something, or watching us. But the more I thought about it, and there was no dought we had a large ""Silver Disk"", staying real close and I was concerned! What was it doing out here almost right on top of us, and I wish we knew what these things want, and why was it following us so close out in the ocean in Broad day light? We see most of the sightings at night, because of the lights. There were other boats in the ocean, and we never saw it go near them. It was strange, and alittle worrysome. I just wish we had a ca! mera, so I would have a picture to look at, but I will never f! orget wh at it looked like! I will keep a camera with us from now on! We did not catch any good fish that day, but I Did get Something Big, like I never saw before, It was a UFO Sightng! I am a Christian, and I know our God made the ""Heavens & The Earth"", but he also said there will be ""Sights & Wonders"", We are told that there are God's Angels, and the devils angels that are fighting all around us for our Souls! Our Bodies are all Earthly until we are saved by the Grace of God, and he fills us with his Holy Spirit, and that changes our bodies to ""Spiritual"", and we have God's Spirit always in our Heart & in our Soul & it's like a Arrmor of defense! But unsaved Souls are ""Earthly""! God says that No ""Earthly"" Flesh & Blood shall enter the gates of Heaven. I know God made it all, but we still live in a Sinful world, and the Devil is always out in full force to make those that are not saved his. We are all Sinners, But the difference is ! Trusting in God, and having Faith Always in our Lord. If God be with us, then who can be against us? I am so Blessed to have God on my side, and Pray that others allow him into their hearts, so they will know true unconditional Love!  I will draw something up as close as possible and send it US Mail ASAP! Thanks, God Bless,",2013-06-02T00:00:00,33.5603,-79.0441

Four of them in a square (two vertically on top of two others) and then one floating below. They did not seem to be moving fast but they seem to move out of the square formation and were moving east slowly.  They really looked like Chinese lanterns but I have never seen anyone release one of those off of our coast before.  The thing that was so odd was how vivid their orange glowing characteristics were when compared to an airplane that was nearby.  There is also an international airport within a couple miles, however, these orbs were not any plane that we have ever seen before.  Anyhow, eventually we drove beyond a tree line where we could not see them anymore but they got really small as the seemed to be heading east.

We had cloud cover this morning, so I lost them after about 10 seconds when they flew over the clouds in the western sky (judging the cloud height is how I perceived initially that they were as high as a satellite, along with the speed and consistency). I had the impression of a formation of crafts as opposed to it being one craft or even two with one being the small lead craft and the second consisting of a triangle shaped craft.  If either of these were the case, it would have been enormous in scale.  If they were single crafts, the distance between them would have been vast – enough to see inconsistencies in either speed or distance between the crafts.  I have just never seen anything like it.

My first report, which was two hours in duration, was filed on 7/6/2013, with MUFON, and then with the Center.  I will file the other reports, in addition to yet another sighting a friend and I had last night. SUMMARY - I was on the beach on the south end of Captiva Island when at 9:51 p.m.  I saw two solid amber lights of the exact color of the 6 that I watched for just over 2 hours on June 24.   At about 10:05, a third redish-orange light came on above the first two (I just reported on those 2 hour sightings of up to six amber and one white UFOs starting with key words “Long duration UFO Sightings” with maps).   The lights went out at 10:12.  The lights went on and off as if on a dimmer switch.  At 10:36 a nearly blinding white light appeared just west of due north over the gulf of Mexico, just above a cloud layer that was on the horizon.   The white light slowly came on like on a dimmer switch and appeared to be at least 5 miles away.  The duration of the white light sighting was about 1 minute.   I am a marine biologist, 60 years old, and a scientist first. These lights were exactly due north of me, just off horizontal of each other, and about a 3 finger-width-at-arm-distance apart from each other.  The lights were initially about the width of a hand at arms length (9 degrees above my eye level horizon) above a tree line, then slowly drifted apart about 2 hand-widths and then drifted down to just treetop level.   The trees (Australian Pines) are about 70 feet high and approximately 3.5 football-field-lengths away from where I was standing that night.   The treetops are 4 degrees above my eye level horizon.  I used a “speed square” and a yard stick to measure degrees (see attached photos).  My eye level is 5 feet 6 inches.  Using this simple device one with mathematical background should be able to figure out what the actual height of a craft/light is.     The beach I was standing on is about four feet above sea level.  I estimate that whatever it was that was making the lights was approximately 7 to 8 miles distant, and at the high! est point they were a guesstimated 6,000 feet in the air; at the lowest about 3,000 feet or less. There were fireworks at the beach at North Captiva Island 8 miles to the north of me.  What I saw WAS NOT fireworks, as I’ve seen these lights before with a friend.  And because of their downward and left to right movements, I most seriously doubt they were “Chinese lanterns.”   I watched them at times with 10X42 binoculars, but could not discern a craft.  During the first five to six minutes first the object on the right turned off – as if on a dimmer switch – then the one to the left turned off.   After about 30 seconds the both came back on and slowly drifted down to tree top level – they were also moving left and right at least 10 degrees. And then both went off again.  A couple of minutes later they both slowly came on at the same height they were initially.  Then a third red-orange light came on to the right and just above the other two craft.  For some reason I thought that they were observing the fireworks, which were going off about a hand width to the left of them, and at least two hand-widths below them.   The last I saw before the lights went of for the duration of when I was observing them (another 45 minutes….of getting chewed up by no-see-ums), they appeared to be drifting to my left, going lower, and toward the fireworks.  The fireworks were over by 10:15 or so.  Shortly after the main lights went off I observed, for the fourth time since June 25, what I call a “flasher,” in exactly the same area where I saw the lights.  I will describe “flashers” in my next reports.   I saw, “out of the corner of my eye,” (exactly in the same fashion one would find the 7 sisters, which are a tad too dim to see directly), straight ahead of me and in the same area the first lights were, a brief, dim, “strobe flash.”   I already had learned to train my binocs on such areas, and saw, well, a flasher, which comprises a rapid series of strobe-like flashes which are about a quarter or just less the duration of a normal strobe light flash, take up pretty much the entire view+ a tad of my 10X 42 field glasses.  Like I said, they are just a tad too dim to see with the naked eye, except for the initial flash, which one would think is eye trickery. I got lucky again this time because I had some practice in spotting them before in binoculars, and watched them for maybe a 10 full seconds (actually a long time to hold them centered in binocs), before I lost them from view.   I do not know if it they just “blinked out,” and I could not find them again in my binocs – again, a difficult thing to do because they both take up the entire viewing field, and can’t be seen easily with the naked eye unless you are lucky enough to see the out of the “corner of your eye” and know how to immediately train your binocs on them. At 10:36, about a half hour after the fireworks were over, a relatively dim white light “came on” like one would slowly turn on a dimmer switch, and after about 30 seconds became from just a tad of light to “blindingly” bright, like it was very rapidly – very rapidly – coming straight at me.  I got VERY frighten when it was at it’s brightest, like it was no more than 20 feet in front of me, and was in the process of turning to the right and running like hell, when it immediately dimmed down and disappeared.  The whole event lasted no more that a minute.  I had been, from the start of this event, flashing my 6-volt “lantern” at the objects from the beginning, including “SOS” signals, just like I did in my first report.   I think I stayed at the beach for a while longer after the brightest light came on, but I’m not really sure as of this writing two days later.  End of report.

I had just walked inside when she called in and said there is something unusual outside that I should see.  I quickly made my way out and we both beheld two small, fiery looking, reddish orange lights in the sky, progressing slowly from the north to the south.  As they traveled in the sky at about a 2 o’clock position toward the east from our position, their speed did not noticeably vary, nor did their distance from one another.  From our vantage point they appeared about 4-6 times the size of a large star.  There was no noise associated with their movement, and their lights did not flicker, blink, or change color.  As they progressed south, both lights rather swiftly and almost simultaneously faded out.  They did not visibly travel beyond the horizon or behind some object. Almost immediately after the first two disappeared, two more arose or appeared from the same spot toward the northern horizon, and began drifting at the same speed and route as the first two.  They looked nearly identical to the first two and traveled at about the same speed, and were otherwise indistinguishable from the first pair.  Once these disappeared as the first two, two new objects appeared just as the first two sets and proceeded in all manners as those first two sets until they too disappeared in the same way. Given the duration of the events, the clear view we had, and that we were naturally looking into the sky because the town’s 4th of July fireworks display had just ended, we presumed that many other people had seen this sight too.

They had stopped to refresh their supply, so I looked up into the sky and caught a glimpse of something that glowed super bright.  At first I thought it was a star, because of how bright it was and because it was a circular object.  The object was bright orange mixed w/ a little red.  I stared at it for maybe two minutes and looked at the other stars around it and realized that it was a great deal bigger than the other objects around it.   I looked back at the object and saw it had changed colors.  I swear to God Almighty the thing was purple when I looked at it again.  I stood there in amazement just looking at it, wondering what on God’s green Earth it could be.   I looked away for a second or two to find my binoculars, w! hich I usually keep in my room to watch birds and such.  I didn’t see them, so I looked back at the object (it had turned back to orange by this point), and it began to move east-northeast towards the beach.

Passed right above us! In the summer of early 90s I was around 10 years old and my cousin was around 8 or 9 (ages are not exact but more or less) we used to sleep over at each other's houses and stay late at night outside in the yards usually doing kid stuff like making small fires and such.  One night he spent the night at my house and it mustve been around 2am or 3am when we went to the front gate which was about 5 feet away from the street and we saw a formation of silent, flying triangles floating slowly (I would guess about 5 mph) parallel right above the street (north to south).  I remember them flying slightly above a light pole (maybe 100 – 150 feet or so?) and slowly passed right in front of us.  They were so close to us.  Imagine standing by a light pole and have flying triangles fly slowly above the light pole passing you. When we saw them we froze and our eyes got locked on these crafts.  Like we were mesmerized by them.  All we could do was stare at them as they slowly passed us.  As soon as they passed us and were out of our line of sight we snapped out of it and both looked at each other with eyes wide open like we couldn’t believe what we just saw. From what I remember, the triangles themselves were in the formation of a bigger triangle, for example, 3 triangles in the bottom, 2 triangles above, and 1 triangle at the top.  They were forming a big triangle, and each triangle was about the size of a minivan.  They flew completely silent.  As a kid my first thought was they were made out of paper, because they flew so close to us and were completely silent, absolutely no noise.  In a neighborhood where almost every other neighbor has dogs any thing out of the ordinary would have 1 dog barking, then 2 then 3 then before you know it dogs can be heard on the other side of the neighborhood barking in the the background.  And this night not 1 single dog barked. I have a feeling this craft had some kind of psychological device that prevented us from reacting because even if we would’ve had a camera in our hands ready to snap a picture we wouldn’t of reacted.  We just got captured by the sight of these crafts and all we could do is keep our eyes locked on to them and trained on them until they  disappeared. The other weird thing is after that night, me and my cousin did not have a single conversation about what we saw.  On top of that we never told anyone.  I never told my parents, friends or anyone and neither did he.   Soon after my cousin moved to Minnesota and for about 10 more years we never even discussed it.  Until one night I was talking to my wife and my other cousin (she was the sister of the cousin I saw the ufos with) and I talked about it to them for the first time.  It was weird because I talked to them like it happened yesterday, it wasn’t something that I had forgotten, or something that I just remembered, it was something that I knew all along what happened but for some reason did not tell anyone.  So I mentioned to them what happened and such and of course they didn’t believe me, so I called up my cousin and just so very casual he described the same event.  My gf and my cousin that was there with me didn’t believe us and thought we had preplanned the conversation. Sometimes at night I still look up at the stars and wonder what it was and where it came from. I wish I could see something like that again.  And to this day when I talk to my cousin on the phone we still talk about what we saw and dwell on it.

A sighting which would have gone unreported probably, but for hearing about the sightings in Austin Texas tonight on Coast to Coast AM. Perhaps the following is a useful inclusion, depending on whether it fits in with other reported sightings.  My usual trip outside to view satellites in our backyard included an odd event tonight. I lay down on the garden long chair, as has been a usual thing this Summer and which also blocks out a street light by doing so (yard fence in the way). At 20:40 I saw what looked 100% like a satellite, crossing above me heading North to South. Brightness, movement speed etc were perfectly normal. It moved overhead and down, to approximately 35 degrees above the horizon. It then stopped, completely stopped its travel and sat in the sky motionless to the eye. The luminance was exactly the same for the next full 1 minute as when it had been travelling. Then, still without moving, it slowly faded in brightness til fully disappearing, taking approximately 20 seconds to do so.  I mention the experience, because Austin Texas is only a few degrees from due South of us here in Oklahoma and usual satellite orbits can place their viewing to many hundreds of miles away. The stopping has never been witnessed before, though fading can happen sometimes depending on viewing time after sunset. I'm well versed in satellite spotting, with a favourite being the ancient Atlas Centaur 2, using www.satview.org to determine viewing time. Regarding recognising aircraft, I have extensive experience of aircraft identification over my 44 years, with many years of R/C aircraft building and having lived on the flightpath to Manchester Airport in England before moving to the USA.  Clouds moved in over the next few minutes after the event and i've been unable to view the sky for the rest of the evening.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,35.68955111111111,-95.35847407407408

November 5, 2013, UFO Sighting At approximately 19:22 hours,  I was on the roof of the employee garage, headed to move my car (while I was on break) and grab a notebook for work.  As I walked toward my car, which was on the far end of the roof, I looked up and noticed something moving toward my direction in the sky.  At first it wasn't clear what it was.  As it approached, I noticed that it was moving rather quickly, and as it started to pass over me I noticed the shape. It was a triangular shaped craft, with dim orange-ish lights at each of the three points, and was dark in color (black?) as it matched the night sky.  I turned my body and followed the craft as it passed nearly directly over me.  I managed to shoot my arm out and measure the size with my thumb; the rear two lights were visible from both sides of my thumb.  The craft seemed to move in a straight line toward a North Easterly direction (From San Francisco toward the Sacramento area).  It took about 10-12 seconds to pass from when I first noticed it.  I didn't have time to get my phone camera on to take a shot, but I did call my co-worker and told her what I saw. My heart was racing and I was trying to comprehend what I had just seen. It hit me that there was no sound from the craft. In fact, the area was rather quiet, and the wind was pretty calm.  There was no strobe light on the craft, and the dim orange colored lights were solid and didn't flash or blink.  It also struck me at how fast the craft was moving while not making a sound. I’m not going to assume that this was an alien spacecraft based off of what I saw. I know there are new stealth craft being tested and there are several military bases in the area. But the size, speed, and lack of sound have me puzzled.  I've lived near military bases all my life and have seen many different types of aircraft. I have several friends who are pilots and have been up close and personal with many modern and WWII era aircraft.  I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like this before. Note: I returned to my car, to retrieve the notebook I forgot, after I moved it closer to my department.  I noticed a Cessna type aircraft fly almost directly over me (not as direct as the UFO did), but in a different direction than the UFO, and noticed several things:  The speed of the UFO was at least three times as fast as the Cessna type craft.  Stretching my thumb out at arm’s length again, I noticed the wingspan just barely cleared either side of my thumb, but the UFO was more than twice the altitude of the Cessna type craft.  There was a distinct sound from the engine of the Cessna type craft as it passed over me, which the UFO made no sound at all as it passed.  The Cessna type craft had strobes and marker lights (red and green on either wing), and I could see a dim light from the cabin (it was lit up pretty well).  I could tell that the Cessna type craft was white, whereas the UFO blended in with the sky, except for the orange lights.",2013-11-11T00:00:00,38.11715994764398,-122.22782198952879

It was a starlight night with some puffy large clouds scattered about.   Soon as I stepped into my yard, out of the corner of my eye, I caught two bright objects in the eastern sky.  I looked up and saw two glowing orange orbs that appeared to be about the height of low commercial airplanes.  I initially thought they might be satellites or bright planets.  However, they were too bright and two low and were moving across the sky to the west, much like propelled aircraft.  The more my friend and I studied them the more we couldn't figure out what they were.  We actually laughed that maybe we were witnessing UFOs. We thought the objects might be small airplanes but there was no sound or blinking lights. They seemed to be moving far too fast to be hot air balloons.  They traveled too smoothly and quickly to be helicopters. We were really mystified as we couldn't conventionally describe what we were looking at. When this pair of orange glowing balls made their way to the west, originating in a straight line formation behind them - came 5 more. My friend counted a total of 7.  I thought one of the last ones seemed to veer toward us ever briefly.  However, they all seemed to follow along one after the other on the same trajectory across the sky.  Staring at one of them, I thought there was a certain dynamic flickering light in the center of the orb, almost like a steady upright flame.  However, it seemed different than a normal fire, yet similar in an odd way.  At this point, I was mesmerized by how serene they appeared, and also awestruck.  When I initially saw the 5 additional objects that followed the original 2, I was momentarily nervous about what we were looking at.  However, as I continued to study them as they arced across the! sky fro m east to west, they seemed harmless and serene.  The objects appeared to move slowly, but after they left completely, I gather they must have been traveling at a faster velocity than a commercial airplane to cover the sky in such a short amount of time.  Watching them leave, I was filled with wonder and fascination.  My friend and I agreed we couldn't conventionally explain what we had just seen and that we had never seen anything like this in the night sky before.  The objects disappeared one after the other into the western sky.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,,

At first I thought they were lanterns being sent into the air but quickly realized that was not the case as they would move in formation in pairs of two - three and then a line of fireballs behind those three that shaped a triangle.  They did not ever break formation except to break apart into smaller groups but stayed the same distance from each other.   There are absolutely no roads where these objects were flying.   I tried to get picture but none would show the balls just blackness.  I can however vividly recall every formation and movement compared to my view of the mountain ranges and stationary street lights that I can see at night so I can recreated in pictures their movements if needed.

We live in the country on the southside of Des Moines, 1 mile from the city limits.  I spotted the formation out my bedroom window.  All lights were equally placed in the sky.  They were in a vertical pattern, perfect exact smooth motion.  They all appeared almost instantly in the sky.   My picture window is floor to ceiling in my bedroom, and we have a wonderful view.  I have lived here for over twenty years and have never seen anything like it.  I grabbed my camera ran outside and the lights made absolutely no noise.  They moved so precise.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  I called my husband to come and watch.  He was also shocked and amazed.  The lights stayed in order, then as they moved from west to east, they moved somewhat northeast and disappeared.  There were seven lights in the first group and then two lights came a few seconds later, but moved much quicker in the! same direction.  One light followed.  All of these had the same appearance.  Round and orange/red. These were not airplanes, they were not helicopters.  No sound came from them.  They were here one minute and gone the next.  It was really amazing. They were in a stair step pattern and formed triangles.  We were standing on our deck just south of Des Moines.  We were looking north towards the city.  I tried recording the last orange/red light but my camera was not very good.  The images are unclear.  If we see anything further, I will try to capture an image with a better recording device. We checked the internet on YouTube and it appears that someone in Des Moines posted some lights that were over Des Moines the end of July 2013.

They looked at first flat, which is why I assumed they were birds, but they were too high in the sky, and there was no wing-flapping at all.  They were moving, changing different formations, from four in a square, with three opposite, and sometimes triangles, and lines.  At this point, they appeared more round, and I thought maybe they were balloons. However, at one point, one broke away from the other six, and flew northeast.  Then a few moments later, a second one did the same thing.  A third one seemed to begin to do this, but it stopped and stayed closer to the other four.  The remaining four continued to make different formations, mostly staying in a square pattern, and slowly moved in a NE direction.   Then, the three that had broken away, began to come back, in a straight line, parallel to the four in a square formation, and they all moved NE.  Then they vanished.

It was last Saturday, 10/19/2013 at approximately 8:45 PM, I was leaving my mom's home in north east Orlando area (College Park).  I was facing her reminding her to lock up when I turned to walk down the driveway to my car, I saw 2 boxes of orange/reddish light looking like fire coming toward me.  They were coming from the north east sky between the two homes across the street.  They appeared to be almost floating toward me with no sound, and no movement other than straight forward movement when the first object began heading south west and the second object appeared to reach the same point and follow it.    I was telling my mom what I saw, and when I turned to point out where I saw them first, there appeared another orange box coming from the same area with another seen following it.   They both changed direction at the same place the first two did and moved south west.  I watched them until they got smaller and smaller and when I turned back to where they had come from, there was another headed toward me, with one behind it.  Again they moved to approximately the same area and turned toward the south west.   I got into my car and moved to the end of the road and watched 2 more boxes of fire looking light moving across the sky towards the south west following the others.  I saw, in approximately 10-15 minutes of time, 4 groups of orange/red boxes in sets of 2... all originating from the same area and moving off to the south west toward the city of Orlando. To my naked eye, they appeared to be boxes of fire, they did not glow, but seemed to radiate color, almost iridescent looking.  My first thought when I saw them was perhaps hot air balloons, but it was night, I saw nothing above the boxes, and they made no sound.  I then thought perhaps paper lanterns, but they each followed the first one, and appeared to move in the same pattern.  They also were in groups of two.   As I saw the first one come toward me, I could see another smaller following it, and when the first one headed in the south west direction, the following one was still coming forward and getting bigger until it headed south west and followed the first.  Then about 2-3 minutes later another group of 2 was seen.  Prior to this sighting at approx 7:30 PM, I had heard several deep booms like fireworks being set off somewhere.  I went out at that time and saw nothing, it was partially cloudy that night and I figured the cloud cover had accentuated the fireworks from the Disney area and that was what I heard.   I am not sure that this had anything to do with this sighting or not, but thought it should be mentioned.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,28.519246697974758,-81.35409597886704

I live and work on a horse farm.  I went out of my apartment  at approximately 8:10pm.  It was raining slightly, so the clouds were low.  Something caught my eye and I looked toward the river, which is west, and then I saw the shapes racing through the clouds on the horizon. Initially, I just stood there, shocked.  I went to my co-workers residence and made him come out. The spheres were moving very quickly, back and forth on the horizon. The higher sphere didn't move as much or as quickly as the lower sphere.  They must've been quite large, but we never saw anything but the reflected light in the clouds.  The lower sphere was looping up and around under the higher sphere. The higher sphere stopped occasionally, but the lower one never stopped. I heard the truck then, at the end of the driveway, and we went to get the horses.  I drove to the road because I was afraid, and when the driver got out, he was shaken and said the spheres had been almost on top of his truck for the last 2 miles.  The driver said at one point, he had to lean forward and look up out of his windshield (he drove a tractor trailer) to see them.  The entire time we were talking, the spheres continued to move on the horizon.  We then noticed trails of light reaching from the objects to the ground, that moved from place to place.  My co-worker videotaped the spheres with his phone, and on the tape the spheres don't show, just tiny red and yellow twinkling lights. The truck left;  we went to work, periodically checking on the spheres, which were still there. At about 9:10pm I walked out of the barn and looked west, the spheres were still there, but the light they made in the clouds was dimmer, as of they were moving away.  Something else caught my eye just then coming from northwest in the sky.  Four bright orange lights moving in an ""L"" formation toward where I was.   I called out and my co-worker came out to look.  I thought they might be helicopters so I shut off the tractor and the aircrafts were completely silent.

Immediately after emerging from the Boston tunnels, headed Westbound on I-90, I saw a constant stationary illumination, circular and white, directly ahead of us.  Too large and too early in the day to be a star, I pointed it out to my husband, who was driving.  We joked about it, but I kept watching.  Heading due-west, I realized it was moving North and South, but there was no smoke trail.  As soon as I opened my mouth to mention it to my husband, he exclaimed, “It’s moving!”  Very soon after, it seemed to stop moving North-South, but the light got smaller and smaller until it disappeared from sight. Minutes later, we were passing over a body of water by a Framingham exit.  The reflection looked orange, so I looked up, expecting to see sunset starting.  Instead, the sky was bright blue and clear of clouds, except for one, which was directly ahead of us.  It was neon orange in color, a vertical ellipse in shape, about 40 azimuth from the horizon, about 10 azimuth in height.  I joked in less technical terms that it looked like female genitalia. I do a lot of sky gazing, I’ve never seen a cloud like this, my jaw was in my chest, eyes trained on it.  I remarked that it looked like it was glowing brighter, and the constantly white UFO reappeared at the very top of the elliptical cloud, growing from pinpoint in size to the same size as we had originally seen it.  The cloud dissipated within seconds, from the top down, looking more purple as it dissipated.  There was a bright white flash at the very top of the UFO, and a few seconds later it seemed to momentarily change from white to a faint green, but I don’t remember if this was before or after the cloud dissipated. It was difficult to gauge if the UFO was moving or hovering after that, due to the winding roads. It fell out of sight a few times when we dropped in altitude, (particularly Westbound on I/84). The diameter of the illumination was consistent until we neared the Hartford, Connecticut area, when it seemed to grow larger, and appeared to be hovering South of Hartford. We lost sight of it when we exited in New Britain, Connecticut, and we couldn’t see it at our final destination.",2013-12-02T00:00:00,42.3416629506008,-71.06563371161549

We take her home as much as we can {it seems to help her condition}   While I was taking out the garbage during a clean up process I noticed a very bright large white star in the west south-west sky, it was very beautiful.  I stared at it for a moment and then looked further to the west and gazed at a tiny star twinkling and then further west north-west an orange star began to appear it reminded me of the moon that every now and again turns yellow orange {you know}.   Peering through the trees out at the horizon the orange star was moving – “ oh well jet airliner   As it drifted higher like the ember from a fire another orange star began to appear, I was certain that the Columbus Air Force Base was conducting drills.  As the two orange lights rose slowly from the horizon-I was waiting for a familiar aerial sound-wop, wop, wop, but there was no sound and then another orange light appeared in the same area of orientation and began to rise into sky. As I stood there I certainly did not want to make a complete fool out of myself while another orange light began to rise.  My hopes were very anxious and high that a sonic boom or a popping sound would become proof that it was Columbus doing their thing. Only seconds had passed from the first light  to the fourth.   I turned and opened the kitchen door and called out to my wife and said honey come here and look at this and she I immediately came to where I was standing and said “WOW “its beautiful! What is it?”  Then another orange sphere begin to rise from the same location as all the others came from.    As we peered through the trees my wife said I bet we can see them better in the front yard so we went to the front yard and the view was a little better as the orange lights were rising higher and were heading due north and then another orange sphere began to appear from the same area of orientation and then another and then another it was like a roman candle in a slow m! otion rotation pattern.   Somewhere higher than the others in a drift pattern you would expect the embers of a fire swirling in the wind.  My wife said “there is no sound maybe its those balloons they put candles in and release on a wish!   OK I was starting to buy into the idea and suddenly all the lights became in alignment shaped like a v or as my wife put it – like a row of geese but the alignment was moving due north and the point of the shape was pointing south.   They began quickly to disappear and my wife ran inside the house to get a camera to possibly photograph them.  There were only 3 light left – 1 alone and 2 together.  These images were sent to you and now there is a written recording of our memory. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

A small bi winged yellow airplane flew over my house and we looked up at it as it was very very low. After it passed we saw a very small shiny object very high in the sky. It would not be visible for a few seconds, then visible again. At first I thought it was an airplane and the sun was reflecting off it. It didn't appear to move. I next thought well it's flying towards us or away from us and it just appears that it's not moving. Got my astronomy binoculars out and was able to see it better. I put my elbows on the back of my boat that was in my driveway to get a steady look at it. I made sure a branch from the tree in my front yard was in the view with some leafs so I would have some kind of reference if it was moving or not. It didn't appear to move for the first ten seconds. The suddenly it dropped straight down, then straight back up to it's original position. I thought maybe I was shaking the binoculars. So I blinked my eyes for a second made sure I was steady and focus on it again through the binoculars. It was steady and I saw it move to the right super fast then back to it's original position. Then it shot down and back up again. All along I had these leafs on the branch of the tree in sight to make sure I wasn't moving my hands/arms. The leafs were steady in sight. Immediately after this quick movement I started looking with my bare eyes again and a jetliner with a contrail had just passed th! rough the same path as the object. The plane was slightly higher if not at the same altitude as the object. I  got the sense they were somewhat close to each other in the same part of the sky.  I thought at first wow I wonder if the wake of the plane made it shoot down like that. Thinking the wind from the plane forced it down like again maybe it’s a balloon of some sort. Then I realized that didn’t make sense because I also saw it shoot right and then back to the left again after that. In the binoculars the object was irregular shaped oval, almost a long rectangle but rounded. The middle was sort of like a pound sign. Two lines across, two lines vertical and the space in between was blue sky. So it wasn't solid everywhere.  When you looked at it, it fluctuated in blurriness like it some kind of magnetic field around it. It was very hard to see hard edges or lines. But you could still make it out. I would have thought it was some huge animal balloon like configuration if it wasn't for the rapid movements it made. Plus the size of it was huge considering how high it was.  It was pretty hard to see with the huge binoculars I was using so it had to be really high up and it was close to the same size of an airplane in the same binoculars at what appears to be the same altitude. Around 1:50pm it just disappeared. It came back a few minutes later until 1:55pm when it was just gone forever.  I witness this with one of my brother in laws. I had him draw on paper what he saw and I was able to confirm it was very similar to what I saw. So with your naked eye you could only see it when it was bright which is why I thought it was reflecting the sun on and off. But once you started looking at it through the binoculars it was always a constant brightness. Glowing white, florescent light kind of look to it.",2013-09-09T00:00:00,42.3677,-88.1497

On August 22rd, 2013 I was in my basement when my four year old son came down to inform me there was a star outside. I thought it odd, and went upstairs to check it out. When I came upstairs, my wife was at the window telling me to look outside and that there might be a ufo outside. I grabbed my Nikon p500 camera and went outside to look, and there was in fact something on the horizon, possibly 1000ft in the air, and a few thousand yards away. I turned my camera on, zoomed in with a 36x zoom, and my camera was set on auto mode and the long exposure setting kicked in.  The picture turned out horrible.  I attempted to take another photo and while I was looking at it in the viewfinder, it disappeared before my eyes. I went inside, and my family was on edge. I said some words to my family and then called some people to tell them what I saw.  I was on the phone with a friend from work when I heard my wife tell me, ""... you have to come here and see this."" I went outside and looked on the horizon where I saw the ufo before and couldn't see anything.  My wife told me to look to my left and I did. My heart sank, my adrenaline kicked in and I became scared.  A stones throw away, about 20ft off the ground was a floating ball of fire flying between me and the street light, following the path of the street.  I could see every single detail on this thing and it looked like this.  In the center was a perfect circle maybe the size of a half dollar coin and this circle was bright orange. Radiating from the center circle was a larger spherical aura that almost looked like the mist you see when looking directly at an atomizer spray bottle (like on a Windex bottle set to mist) except that it was fire.  Around this larger sphere were flames that went upwards, just like if you were looking at a camp fire.  The flames were fire red/orange and it moved through the air very very slowly, about 1-3mph.  The total size of it was about the size of a basketball, perhaps slightly larger.  It was 100% silent. As this thing moved the fire trailed behind it.  I prayed to Jesus Christ to protect us and this thing did a 90 degree turn, and left.  It slowly ascended, southbound, over perhaps a 2000 meter distance, climbing to maybe 500-1000ft, then it disappeared.  I tried to take photos of this object when it was up close, but I was shaking very badly.  My photos look like trash, but they are the real deal.  I still have the originals on my camera if needed.  I also took a video, and unfortunately it too is shaky, but it's there for what it's worth.  These things are real, but I'm telling you the truth: they are not what the world thinks they are. Having seen this thing up close, I can tell you they are very real, alive and subject to Jesus Christ. They appear and disappear at will, and It is likely that they are demonic and deliberately deceiving the world.  Don't fall for it. If you read this, you were warned and without excuse.  Repent, confess the Lord Jesus Christ with your mouth and believe in your heart that God raised him from the grave and you will be saved.

I had just passed my neighbor's house who had the United States flag placed on the house.  I recall seeing the flag moving in the breeze & then everything began to quiver around me.   The next thing I remember was looking up at the UFO.  I believe I was taken right when the quivering took place & returned when I looked up & saw the UFO.  I think they wanted me to see them.  It's been 8 years since this happening.  Some time after this event I also had a different experience, which involved a close encounter with a being.  I had lost track of time & the dogs wanted out.  I got as far as the end of my driveway & saw a small being in a white space suite & helmet across the street.  It was on the side of my neighbor's house.  I froze, dogs didn't bark.  I immediately turned around! & went back to my house & got a flashlight.  I looked at the time & it was about 1:40 am.  When I returned to the end of the driveway the being was gone.  The being was about the size of a 8-10 year old child.  The white suite had bulbous arms an also bulbous legs on the upper part.  I saw no face,  I guess it had it's back toward me.  I no longer walk my dogs after dark.  These happenings have haunted me ever since.  There are times I wish there was a support group for people like me who have had UFO related experiences.

I can only report the following.  I've attached the Oct '06 Ruidoso News article (Alto, NM, is just north of Ruidoso) for your reference and as a refresher to me, as I'd forgotten the month.  It was the night of Sunday August 6th, in the wee hours, so the article is correct in siting August 7th.   It is my (""Alto resident"") friend in the article that saw it ""over the Ranches of Sonterra"" and my cabin* which was near the theater.  She mentioned it at lunch the following day.  It's not mentioned and might not be useful to you, but I bumped into a fellow ROS neighbor of mine immediately after hearing about this ufo over my cabin over lunch.   I don't know what possessed me to mention it to my neighbor (I guess I was excited) but she said a friend of hers had just mentioned seeing a craft over residential Ruidoso.  This friend had been on a late night dog walk and saw what appeared to be a lit structure on their narrow, dense, tree lined street.   At first glance, they thought it was new construction with lights on, then realized a structure was not possible there.  My neighbor said they took a second look and saw an overhead door close.  That's all I know about that siting, and don't know if it was even reported.  The local paper told us they waiting until October to post the article, until they 'had room' and after they'd heard from Holloman AFB. Oh, and the article is cut off in the 1st column on the 2nd page.  The omitted line read something like ""....from as far away as Phoenix."" *PS:  For the sake of full disclosure, I experienced contact in June 2009, 3 months before I sold this very cabin; loud humming craft overhead, greys in my bedroom and all.  Not relevant to August 2006 and I did not report that either, but I can personally report no strange dreams or contact or anything unusual on the night of August 6th 2006.  Hope this helps.

On or about the spring morning of April 15, 2010, I was taking a walk in my yard around my 3.5 acre lake.  About 20 feet from the shoreline I found a decomposing fish.  I didn't really give it any thought and I certainly did not want my dogs to find it, start eating it and get sick so I picked it up and tossed it into the woods. Several days passed.  Again I took an early morning stroll around the lake checking on the spawn.  Odd as it may be, I came upon another fish (a largemouth bass) in much the same condition as the one I found earlier that week and only a few feet away from the first.  Having NEVER seen such an incident in the 42 years since building that lake, I was compelled to take a better look at this fish. 	Upon closer inspection I saw that there were several parts of the fish missing.  The area behind the anal fin was gone and looking closer it appeared the entrails were also missing.  Some bones could be seen in that open area but it seemed the spine was no longer there.  There was also a hole to the right of the spiny dorsal fin that also allowed viewing the area that was missing behind the anal fin since it was now ""gutless.""  The bony plate around both eyes which meets the operculum was gone as well as both eyes were cleanly missing.  The tissue that separates the pelvic fins and running to the underside of the mouth was there, However, the tissue from the pelvic fins up to the pectoral fins was gone allowing a straight-through view to the other side of the fish as well as a view through to the hole above the anal fin. None of this seemed to be the work of a predator - of any kind.  I've seen the work of predators and this certainly was not.  Since 1972, when the lakes were built, I have seen only two fish ""belly up"" in this lake; two largemouth bass.  One had tried to eat the other.  Being both the same size, both fish perished, one stuck firmly in the mouth of the other.  But I have never seen any fish twenty feet off shore, especially not in this condition. But what struck me as being truly odd was the hole next to the spiny dorsal fin.  It was perfectly round.  A 5/8"" (15.95mm) perfectly round hole!  Fascinating!  No predator can make that hole.  Not with that kind of precision.  I researched the possibilities everywhere.  Even my local Pennsylvania Fish Commission and Game Commission could not attest to any predator being capable of making such a perfectly round hole like this one.  But somehow, somewhere I recalled some literature that mentioned a hole of this size (also perfectly round) being common on many cattle and other animal mutilations. So I contacted Linda Moulton Howe, told her my story and she was more than taken in with this tale.  She never heard of a fish mutilation in thirty years of research.  This was news to her and she was interested in taking this further.  I sent her the pictures I had taken from various angles which peaked her interest further.  What she needed to know was there any evidence of thermal damage around the edge of the hole, such as would be made by a laser or something that would produce a high degree of heat.  I was now on a quest to find someone (with credentials) who would be willing to perform such tests and provide an affidavit with the results.  I tried dozens upon dozens of colleges, universities, fisheries and independent laboratories to take my case of the mutilated fish.  Not a single person was willing to join me in the search for this critical evidence. So, Mr. Davenport, there you have it.  This can possibly be the first case of a mutilated fish in the realm of ""high strangeness"" as Linda would say.  Then I learned you obtained a degree in fish biology and genetics.  Why hadn't I known that before?  I've followed your career for many years. I've listened to you on Coast for years, first with Art, now with George.  I wrestled with the thought of asking you for your help in this matter for months.  Everyone else turned me down for two reasons I've learned; 1) When they learned it might have something (or anything) to do with an extraterrestrial presence and 2) Because their salaries came from the universities, laboratories or wherever, they did not want their name on an affidavit stating the results they would find fearing a loss of their job. Now I ask the same of you.  Would you be willing to become involved in this matter or even discuss it with me?  As much as I hate to admit failure, I may have to tell Linda I've come to the end of the road, so to speak.  The long road I have traveled no longer has a fork, instead a large red stop sign may be staring back at me. Thank you for taking the time to read this, I greatly appreciate it.

When I lived in Knoxville, TN in 2010, my husband, best friend and I were walking closer and closer to the river during the 4th. of July festivities in World's Fair Park to get a better look at the fireworks.  We kept walking and walking and walking until we got up to a neighborhood right next to the river, and we couldn't walk any further.  There were a whole bunch of people sitting on their front porches, sitting in their front lawns.....etc watching the fireworks.  There was a middle-aged man on the sidewalk with a pet boa constructer, my 19 year old friend was wearing a cute, white sun dress, and she (being the daring type of person that she is) asked the man if she could touch it.  It weighed about 70 lbs, and she was tiny herself, so I was very surprised and completely distracted when the man said, ""Sure,"" and instead, draped the gigantic snake over her shoulders, and she was totally freaking out.  I was kind of giggling and no longer paying attention to the sky and the fireworks when I suddenly noticed everybody walking out into the streets like they were mesmerized or something.  I didn't understand what could've been so wonderful about the fireworks, because I was getting bored with them and paying attention to my friend's nervous reaction.   I suddenly turned to my husband iand asked what the big deal was to notice that he was in a daze staring at the skies as well.  He pointed and said, ""Look"" while still partially in a trance.  I looked up, and there was this small, but distinctive, ball of a red-orange light that looked like it was far in the distance and getting bigger and bigger as it seemed to be quickly approaching.  I felt like I was dreaming but looked around to realize that everyone else was still looking at it too, which made me realize that it wasn't even close to my imagination!  As I looked back up again, I noticed that it was gigantic. Granted I di! dn't have my prescription glasses on at the time, but to me,  it somewha t resembled a small planet or something, and it seemed like it was so close that I thought that it was going to hit us.  Instead, it seemed as if it was hovering a little bit higher than a high helicopter right in front of everyone in the neighborhood, but over the water.   It hovered over there for a long matter of seconds, and suddenly (out of nowhere), it quickly darted off almost directly right and disappeared in a split second almost as if it never was really there.  Once again, I thought that I was imagining it, and realized that everyone was still standing around looking up at the sky for a couple of seconds after it disappeared. I mentioned that I wished that my son was there to see it as soon as I came to, and I looked back at my friend who still had the snake draped over her as if the snake was barely even phasing her anymore until she 'came to' again, and finally asked the guy to get the snake off of her.",2013-06-02T00:00:00,35.96156134085213,-83.98011528822055

It is because of those reports that I did not report this during the incident.  However, I have seen pictures of this type of UFO on the previous UFO images. I kept trying to convince myself that this had something to do with the UFO balloon boy, but I went inside for a moment to check something, this took about 20 seconds, and when I came back outside to view it again it was nowhere to be found.  Even though, I had a full view of its location in the sky. I thought at that point this was a hoax.  What convinced me that this was a real UFO, was that at 18:20, I counted 12 fighter jets flying in a direct pattern from the direction of Buckley AFB to the location where the UFO was hovering.  I know they were fighter jets because they flew directly over the apartment complex that I live in.  We have never had any sort of air craft fly directly overhead here before this incident and we have not had any air craft fly over since then.  The air craft flew directly to the location where the UFO was located.  The last 10 fighters continued on past the area and the first 2 approached the location and flew in circles at the exact location for a few minutes before continuing on with the original flight path.

It was a cold late fall day.  Myself and 3 friends were along with me when we decided to go to the lake front (Lake Michigan). The 4 of us were strolling casually along the coast that evening.  As we progressed further down a lake front pier we collectively noticed an unusually bright.  Since the lake front is closed after 10pm and it was now around 1am our first thought is it being some form of authority,  police, coast gaurd etc. We soon realized that was not the case.  All of us agreed that this exceptional light was moving our direction(west) from the east.  East of us was Lake Michigan.  So our thought is still optimistic, that being, as if it were a boat or some other everyday regularity.  We all can not let this light go, we continue to stare in its direction. Within about a minute, the light gained significant ground growing closer in distance to us.  At this time we were able to tell that this light was not on the water but, in the air.  It took a moment to take its airborne presence in. 1. because from this location on the lake we frequently seen air craft heading south toward Mitchell International airport and 2. because of the low level and quietness. Another sign that allowed us to realize that this was airborne was in its approach toward us it passed over the rock walls which I believe is for a wave/wake break for sailors and ships. At my estimate the rock walls are about 300 yards from shore and about 150 yards from our position on the pier. So, this quite airborne light is about 100 yards out from us and its light becomes much more intense.   With it becoming more clear that the light is attached to something greater behind it 2 of my friends become hysterical and begin to cry and emotions become rather powerful and overwhelming. I have stood my ground thus far when the light begings to angle itself toward the ground/water.  It is at about a 45° angle(the light) and close enough for me to be able to reach it with a stone or tennis ball toss.  The brilliant light is seemingly piercing the filthy water in this area to a depth of about 6ft. and approaching the tips of my toes. The light comes to about an inch before my toes and turns its ""high beem"" off.  Within a matter of 10 seconds the ship accelerated and was out of view. While taking in all of what had just happened and calming down we begin to notice a set of lights following the same path coming towards us again. This time,  I reach for my phone and begin to use my camara.  That craft is still well out above the water but I start to take pictures anyway to try to gather as much as I can. The flash may have caught the attention of the craft because as I clicked more pictures and more flashes it seemed to quicken its pace in our direction. As this craft got closer it became clear it was not the same one in which we had just seen because this one was easily 10x as large with a set of lights across the bottom(yellow/whiteish)  and 3 larger lights on top(red/green/red) that appeared to be incased in glass or another see-through material. I would guess its length to be around 200ft. This craft slowly pan across our view at about 60ft out and 60ft up.  It was the most strange structure.  It looked as if it were made of old oil barrels and not in a slick uniform shape,  more jagged and off balance.  It had unique looking hieroglyphs written on the barrells. The hieroglyphic text did not show up in any of the photos.  All together I took around 110 photos which i shared with people.  I e-mailed a few photos to one of my co witnesses which I believe she still possess today.  Within 24 hours all 110 photos were erased/disappeard from my phone....not one of my other personal photos of friends and the such were missing from my phones photo gallery.  Olny the ones I took that night. We were just 4 friends in our early 20s....no professional background. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Hi, I do not know what I saw last night, but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  It was something unnatural, not of this world. I went out with my dog on a leash to wait for my boyfriend in  his driveway, which is relatively long.   We live in an area of rattlesnakes, so I did not want to venture into the area of the driveway that was not illuminated by the yard lights.   At the end of the driveway, I saw I could only make out was a person wearing a white shirt, yet this “person” lacked 3d perspective.  It was sort of a flat presence, sort of like a big plastic bag being flung into the air and blowing in the wind, yet it was not moving, it was still. I still could not figure out what this was.  Happened very quickly – maybe a one-minute time span.  My dog also alerted, and he was also aware there was something at the end of the driveway.  Well, whatever it was appeared to sort of bend over and though I could see now eyes or anything, I got the distinct impression that it was at that time this object became aware of me.  There was no mistaken that it had “seen” me, perceived me, it knew of my presence.   Again, not through any senses that such as we have here on earth. I am getting chills just retelling it, it was so eerie.  I was moving a bit closer and sort of trying to adjust my eyes to focus, when all of a sudden, it jetted off.  I use the term “jetted” because that is what it did.  From a standstill position to what seemed the speed of a car racing by at 100 mph.  It was gone, across the street and into the brush. When my boyfriend got home, I explained to him what I had seen. Well, he offered explanations, but none was satisfactory as I experienced it and I felt in my core it was something unnatural.  Well, unnatural to this earth.  Since last night, I have been second-guessing myself, but the point remains, I saw what I saw.  It is the nature of whatever beast this is to make you thing you were being delusional, imagining things, etc. At any rate, do you have any insight into what this could have been and perhaps tell me if other people have had similar experiences?

Think “floating.”  I do not believe in extra-terrestrial life, let alone visitation, so I am searching for a scientific explanation.

My family and I had just finished our fireworks and were returning to my backyard to make S'mores. I stoked the fire and started walking east towards my wood pile when I noticed 2 (Incandescent) looking lights heading west bound and low on the horizon(15-25 degrees, just below the cloud ceiling.   At first I thought they were helicopters, yet I heard no rotor wash.  The 2 craft continued heading west towards me, when I summoned family.   As the craft approached we thought at first Japanese Lanterns because the lights changed from incandescent white to orange with a vibrant red corona around the object that looked like flames on the top.   The objects were now close enough (1-2 miles away and just below tree top level),to easily define them as spheres or orbs.  At first sight they were golf ball size as they came closer there size increased to softball size at the closest.  The 2 craft then stopped and hovered momentarily.  One craft then went 90 degrees and headed nort! h at a steady pace towards the city of Enumclaw, where then, it suddenly blinked out.   The 1 remaining craft still hovering then changed its elevation going straight up to tree top level and then moved 90 degrees to the south for a short distance then heading back on the exact same course where it stopped at the same altitude and location it started from.   The craft then started again to raise up, and I decided to take my l.e.d. flashlight and signal the craft and get some kind of response.  I immediately commenced flashing out a series of three flashes then two flashes followed by a 5 second break and then started the sequence again.  The craft flashed back the exact same series and commenced raising in altitude, this time making a 90 degree left followed by stopping at the same location and then heading 90 degrees right.   The craft started getting smaller and began fading out when at tree top level on craft appeared out of thin air and came towards us then from right behind tha! t craft or from within, a second craft appeared then a third.   2 of the craft broke to the south of the lead craft into an angled formation like one side of a triangle.

I got out of the car, opened up the back to retrieve some blankets, and for some reason or another felt compelled to look up at the sky. I first saw a single red/orange sphere (or fire ball is the best I can describe it)high up in the sky, slowly gliding from my left to the right.   The sphere first went at a relatively slow pace (hovering in place for a few seconds at a time then slowly gliding again).   Then, after about a minute, it suddenly became immensely bright (to the point that it almost hurt my eyes) and seemed to become bigger.   The sphere then flew from right to left to right again, and then zipped at an impressive speed across the night sky.   As the object was zipping across the sky, I suddenly noticed that there was a second (identical) red/orange sphere beside of it (though it seemed to be at a slightly lower altitude beneath the other light).  Shortly after I saw the second sphere, they both zipped across the sky and out of my view. I am not sure if the second sphere had been there during the entirety of my ""encounter"" with the spheres, as I was so taken with the first one that I spotted.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it.  So, I cannot say for sure if the second sphere appeared only when the first zipped across the sky, or if it had been hovering in that place the whole time.

From start to finish the distance traveled was about equal to 4 feet between outstretched arms. This occurred a little after sundown. I don't remember the exact time. Sunset was at 8:28 . The light resembled a road flare from a distance.  Red and roundish in shape. We only saw the light and not the object creating the illumination.  The light itself was too large to be a plane side-marker at the perceived distance.  There were no other lights around the main one.  The shade of red was not the deep red of a an aircraft marker but a softer shade and unblinking though atmospheric conditions caused the light to modulate somewhat.  A tiny white light took the place of the red light toward the end of our viewing and as it traveled this light faded out.  We heard no noises coming from the object.

It has quite a bit of electronics on the summit - TV and radio  transmitting towers, microwave repeaters, etc. I noticed a ‘star’ start to drop straight out of the sky straight down on top of Shasta Bally.   As it came closer to Shasta Bally is got bigger and brighter then is stopped and hovered over the mountain - it was about the size of a silver dollar sitting over the mountain and it was an extremely bright white light illuminating the mountain. It hovered there approx. 30 seconds and then moved to the right then back where it had been and then back (to the west) dropping down behind the mountain (which really illuminated the mountain even more) before it shot up and out of sight leaving a tracer line as it disappeared into the sky. This is not the first sighting there have been at least 6 in the past 5 months with 2 ( 2-3 weeks ago) in one night.  One was a bright white light and the other was a bright red light.  I saw them within 10 minutes of each other.  Before the sighting on July 4th they only hovered for a few seconds before darting off leaving a tracer line and disappearing into the sky.  Their  hovering size was not as large and bright as the one on the 4th. I saw another on Friday night 7/5/13 which acted like the others - didn’t stay very long before leaving. I go outside to smoke several times at night so what are the odds - I’ve seen so many?   The number of visitations per night must be astronomical.

For several months I’ve been seeing objects in the sky over Neillsville. At first I thought it was a star, then I noticed that it is a combination of white, red, and green lights. When observed through a small set of binoculars, you can get better details of the lights. When viewed through a stronger set of binoculars, it appears to look like a disco ball that is comprised of either squares, or triangles. It pulsates, and changes color from white, to green, to red, to purple. Some friends feel that they are UFOs, some friends feel they are communication satellites. Most satellites traverse the sky in a geosynchronous orbit from what I understand. These objects are for the most part stationary.  They usually are in the same place each night but they do change position slightly. I’ve been told that communication satellites are stationary. These move occasionally.  One night I watched them for about an hour, and the one I was watching eventually moved off into the distance. I’ve heard that Neillsville is a hot spot for UFOS because for the magnetic polarity that is part of the glacial formations around the area. There is a bombing range located in Pittsville that is about an hour away, so it could be part of that. There are now about 12-15 of them that appear every night. What I cannot figure out is, if they are UFOS, why are they appearing every night, and what would 12-15 UFOS see in Neillsville?  On the other side, why would a communication satellite look like a pulsating disco ball that changes color, and why would you need 12-15 of them over a city with a population of about 2,500 in the middle of Amish farm country?  I’ve lived here for about 14 years and never saw them till this Spring and now they seem to be a constant in the sky. I’d love any input and opinions.",2013-09-30T00:00:00,44.5601,-90.6708

The moon was barely visible and was to the left of the object, both visible through the low level cloud cover.  This object did not follow a typical flight pattern for this area and was much too high in the atmosphere to be a conventional aircraft.  I looked like a typical movie style meteor entering the atmosphere but moved very slowly and didn’t dart through the sky as I have seen other meteors do in the past.  I tracked it as it moved across the sky for about 10-15 minutes and would wait as disappeared behind clouds and reappeared through openings and I was able to judge where it would re-emerge due to its very linear trajectory.  This was a distinct, large fireball with a dark mass towards the front and a bright yellow/orange tail trailing behind!  It that did not leave any contrails.  I would be very shocked if no one else in Northern Virginia saw this object.  It could have just been a large meteor but I thought I would write to you and report it anyway.

I was facing due North at 00 Degrees Azimuth & out of the corner of my right eye I looked up and saw a large Orange Ball-Shaped Object moving at a slow speed toward the 00 Degrees Azimuth.  I walked to my right to get better look outside of the branches of a large tree & saw 2 more Orange Spheres in  line with the 3rd.  They were moving rather slowly, like a Gaggle of Helicopters would travel, approximately 500 feet  Above Ground Level.	 		At the time, the Moon had risen to about 135!

On August 24th, 2013, we were anchored out in Worton Creek, which is on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay, about half way between the Bay Bridge and the C&D Canal.  At about 9pm (+/- 30 min), I poured a glass of wine and had just sat down on the transom to watch an unbelievably clear sky – I have never, ever seen it this clear in Maryland.  I was facing west.   After about 10 minutes, I noticed a light appear from over my left shoulder, heading east to west.  At first I assumed it was a helicopter, because it was traveling at the altitude and speed that most helicopters seem to travel at.  The light was rather bright, roundish and mostly red in the center and some yellows and maybe greens at the edges.  My best guess is that it was about 200 yards to my left and 300-400 feet up – it’s difficult to judge distance at night, especially with a bright light, and if my distance guess is correct, it was perhaps 50-80 feet in diameter. As this object moved westward, a second one appeared same description, and maybe 100 yards behind.  Then a few seconds later a third one, but this one was farther back, maybe three times the separation of the first two.  All three traveled westward in a straight line formation at the same speed.   After about a minute, the second one moved out of formation to the left and picked up speed.  He passed the leader, still heading in the same westward direction, and then when he was well in front of the leader, his light flickered, or wavered, then perhaps half a second later it flickered and dimmed and was gone.  The original ‘leader’ continued on for another second and when he reached the spot where the other one  changed, his light also wavered, and then flickered and dimmed and was gone.   They really have my attention now.  I watched the third guy intently as he continued west and when he reached the area where the other two were, he did the same.  The light wavered, half a second later it flickered and dimmed and was gone. When the objects disappeared, it was like they flew into an invisible wall of grey jello, or maybe like on Star Trek, when the ship goes to warp drive.  A silly description, but that’s what it reminded me of.    I jumped up and grabbed my binoculars to search the area I had last seen them but there was nothing there. Nothing.  Also, I failed to mention that they were silent.  The wind was blowing at maybe 5 kts so there were no interfering noises that would have covered up the sound of their engines.  Other than the obvious fiery light and the disappearing act, the thing that most caught my attention was that there was absolutely someone at the helm, they weren’t just things floating by.",2013-08-30T00:00:00,39.3048,-76.0912

To begin, described below is a brief scenario we three have endured silently for years now. For my wife, and our son... all of us diligent witnesses to aerial oddities. My wife first noticed what appeared to be a single, irregularly large, star or similarly bright object due west, possibly one thousand feet in the sky.  Approximately four discernible colors were observed, while rapidly darting south and west across the sky. Originating location, to be more precise, could be approximated somewhere between Commerce and Sulphur Springs on HWY 11.  The first object was stationary on the horizon from our location near the Lake Sulphur Springs public boat slip sitting on FM 2285. Once observed for approximately fifteen minutes, the initial object appeared to wobble gently on it's axis, then began a pattern of moments, with extreme precision, positioning itself in a variety of geometric shapes. After reaching a stationary formation again, still in the same general location, the colors began pulsing between red, blue, and an indistinguishable yellow/white/orange glow.  The object shot northerly toward what I imagine is around Commerce.  At this moment two additional lights faded into view as if they were perhaps cloaked in the current position.  The three lights simultaneously and in succession appeared to resume formation with the primary object performing the same sort of initial choreographed maneuvers. After two to three minutes one object faded out of view while the two others still danced in almost direct view of the soft glow of, again, what I suspect to be, the city of Commerce. The additional two lights moved approximately thirty to fifty yards back and forth from their northerly position south, then back again.  After performing this maneuver for several moments, these two objects reached a fixed location and appeared to be pulsating. While fading in and out of the aforementioned color scheme, both objects together, dimmed and faded out of view. Almost directly overhead, more northerly, a single light faded into view but appeared as an ethereal looking soft white ... Similar to a star, but discernible by the naked eye.  The object was travelling at a high rate of speed, heading from an approximated due north to the East, toward the Texarkana area.  Upon reaching this easterly position, two additional lights intercepted the object and took a triangular formation. We all watched as these objects pulsed various lights, primarily red and blue, then upon settling on a fixed location, somewhere around three times the rate of speed most airplanes travel across the sky, either shoot out of visibility...  Upward...  Not toward the horizon, or disappeared out of view entirely. Again visually scanning the northern sky, we saw what appeared to be a somewhat irregularly bright star. Hovering in a fixed position, glowing white, the object emanated a reddish orange glow then exhibited a red burst three to give times it's original size and disappeared from view. These are frequent sightings for the three of us. We are healthy, educated, and responsible members of society. Our child, family, and occasional family friends have also witnessed these baffling lights. Typically, we have seen these lights first noticeable across our western horizon just after sunset, immediately following the colors of twilight fading to dark. Animals in the area will typically begin stirring, coyotes howl, dogs bark aggressively, birds and insects such as cicadas cease to make noise... all immediate prior to a sighting nearby. There have been well over ten obviously distinguishable lights sighted moving faster than any common aircraft, just tonight. How this has not made the local news is beyond me.  I am former US Army Ranger, law enforcement, and definitely keen on protecting our anonymity.  Perhaps similarly security conscious individuals or those with a respect for their own public reputations viewing this type of anomaly can speak to the ""why"" of the matter. Words, and especially our attempted video or photo documentation, do no justice to the events I am poorly attempting to describe. Similar occurrences in this area (google search) are recorded as far back as the 1940s. I hope that one day this may be of some benefit... to someone. Good luck.

The objects appeared to be under intelligent control.  When I first saw the objects they were moving at a high rate of speed.  After approximately 30 seconds they appeared to slow down.  The objects traveled together for approximately 1 minutes when one of the objects disappeared from sight.  It just appeared to vanish from sight. The lone remaining object appeared to slow down considerably, stop and then alter course.  The object stopped for approximately 10 seconds before altering its course.  The new vector was south by southwest.  After altering course the object appeared to pick up speed rather quickly and began ascending.  The object was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon when I lost sight of it.  I thought that was unusual experience and I turned my gaze back to the west. I noticed the second object was once again visible and appeared once again to be bright orange.  The object was still silent and had no running lights whatsoever.  Once the object re-appeared I tracked it’s flight path.  The object appeared to follow the identical flight path of the first object.  The object also had the exact same flight characteristics of the original object.  The second object appeared to slow down considerably, stop and then alter course.  The object stopped for approximately 10 seconds before altering its course.  The new vector was south by southwest.  After altering course the object appeared to pick up speed rather quickly and began ascending.  The object was approximately 60 degrees above the horizon when I lost sight of it.

Shortly after 10 pm tonight from my back porch, I witnessed a very strange object in the sky about a half mile to a mile away and about a half mile up.  I screamed for my wife to bring the camera.  She had to look for it and just grabbed her phone instead.  She took three photos but it took her 30 seconds to get her Iphone5 and by this time the object had moved well away.  Initially, the object was close enough to see the periphery, which clearly appeared to be rectangular with a giant white-orange flame inside that filled most of the rectangle shape but the flame did not extend beyond the well-defined rectangular borders.  For how bright the light inside the rectangle was, I was surprised to not see much of a halo of light around it.   My first impression was that it was just a large hot air balloon because I heard what I thought was the sound of propane fuel burning.  I absolutely did not hear a intermittent propeller type sound.  It was definitely more of ! a low steady dull rumble sound.  I had a clear view of most of the horizon.  The object moved from left to right across it, at first very slowly then amazingly as fast as a jet airplane or faster.  It moved all the way across the sky easily in less than one minute. The object also without question was ascending rapidly.  It was moving east to southeast in direction in mostly clear skies at the time. The long axis of the rectangle seemed perpendicular to the ground at all times even though the pictures seem otherwise (my wife must have slanted the camera in her rapid response).  The pictures revealed almost a figure eight light source.  However, in person, the object looked very bright to the naked eye with a giant, uniform flame burning upwards, much like a gigantic lantern in the sky.

It was the final day before summer break for my colleagues and I (teachers). We had a  bbq get together at work on June 28, 2013 at 1 PM.  We were sitting outside in the school courtyard as it was a nice and sunny day.  I was having a conversation with one of my colleagues, when I looked up towards the sun.  The sun was actually being blocked by the side brick wall of our building.  Right beside the sun, there was a silver sphere. It was quite small as it was very high up in the sky.  My colleague asked me what the heck I was looking at, and I pointed it to him. He saw it too.  I couldn't detect any motion at the time.  I got up and showed another colleague who was in the middle of a conversation with a few others.  She saw it.  Next thing I new everyone was looking up into the sky, with one hand up blocking the sun, and were all seeing this silver dot in the sky.  I ran into the building to get my phone and turn on the Skywalk app to see if it was Venus or possibly t! he ISS. I came back after about 20 seconds and the object was now to the left of the sun (it was to the right when i first saw it).  It still was not moving fast whatsoever. In fact, I thought it wasn't moving at all, and that's why I went to grab my phone...as I thought maybe I was looking at Venus (which would have blown me away seeing it in the day).  I checked Skywalk and it showed what was up there, but since the object moved, it certainly wasn't going to be Venus.  At this point my colleagues were concluding it was the ISS.  I explained that the ISS likely wouldn't be visible right next to the sun, and moves much much faster than this object and would be long gone by now. I would say the entire ordeal was about 4 or 5 minutes long.  Soon people lost interest and the bbq party continued and it was no longer visible. There is the chance that this was a weather balloon, but I have no way of knowing.  I just am not one to jump to major conclusions, but it was neat to see people's reactions and I was happy that I had between 20-30 people with me l ooking at the object at the time.

I have photographs of lights that were symmetrical to each other, can see the layout of the lights! Night was very clear sky and were were having my Mom/Dad annual Halloween event that includes hay ride / spook house for their church.  My wife had went back to our house which is a wrap around porch style house.  I went to look for her and as I walked up she casually said check out the UFO I have been watching.  Before I explain the details I will tell you this.  I live under the north west corridor flight path for hartsfield international airport in Atlanta.  I have witnessed these planes all of my life and you always here their jet engines as they pass by.  We also have dobbins air force base but 95% of the time these fly really low, not sure if its a requirement since commercial traffic is on approach through our area.  That being said I know visual distance of a plane and something higher.  It is very rare to see a plane at full altitude here because it would be random event and flight path would have to take it directly over our house.  I am also an en! gineer by trade.  Back to UFO.  There were 3 distinct lights in a triangle format.  I watched it move (was traveling north west to south east) for about 5 min.  I had just received my new note 3 phone from work, so pulled it out because it was the only photo device I had close at this time.  I zoomed in as far as I could get and took pictures.  The bad thing is, by the time I took the picture the leading light had disappeared.  It was not a cloud it simply turned off.  My pictures show the other 2 lights.  We saw another distant object that my wife had been monitoring for 30 min. It seemed to be far away about a foot above the tree line as far as our vision dimensions are concerned.  Trees were about 50 feet away and are about 35 feet tall.  It stayed stationary and I thought maybe it was a star or possibly something easily explainable.  It was very bright and after seeing it for 10 min it was gone.  The stationary one didn't excite me that much, it was the other one that f! lew over my house.  I would guess the distance of this object ! was 8-10 miles.  Well above typical jet flight path.  Lights were VERY bright.  It wasn't until I looked at the pictures about 15 min later that the hair stood up on my neck.  When you zoom into the picture to the lights, they have a very geometric pattern.  Like I said I got 2 of the lights in the photo as the 3rd had turned off but what is very exciting is the opposite light had the opposite layout.  I thought well maybe this was a pixelating thing where the new phone would allow you to zoom way way in, but this is not the case.  I tested by taking pictures of passing jet lights and of the moon which was very bright.  I cannot zoom into the pixel level at all.  The lights had a L shape as far as the brightest portions but then they curved back in some, if you can imagine a digital 8 that you see on a calculator.  It looked like that but the L portion was very bright and got progressively dimmer on the remainder of the 8.  Also again the other light was exactly opposite or symmetri! cally flipped.  I have never witnessed a UFO in my life so I am not one to jump at anything I see and would have simply passed it off as nothing had I not had this photographic evidence that shocked me.",2013-10-23T00:00:00,34.1347,-85.1329

Then we pulled up beside it on the port side and I could almost reach out and touch it.   The Navy officers were there with 8mm cameras filming it.   It lasted for about 20 min. and dissipated.  After that there was no debriefing at all, and no scuttlebutt among crew members, which amazes me to this day.  Everyone went on about there daily duties as if nothing happened.

At the time I didn't really think anything was any more extraordinary than that except for the fact that these two lights were traveling from south/east to north/west and any satellites I've ever witnessed always traveled from south to north.  So I watched them until they became faint in the horizon then I looked overhead again and saw two more lights moving along the same flight plane as the first two but these two lights were very close together and were not moving in a straight line like the first two.  They seemed to be playing with each other, dancing around each other, and they were slightly larger than the first two.  They glowed a bit like the cherry of a cigarette, only a bit more pale.  I watched them! until they grew faint in the sky, then I looked back to where they had come from in the sky and I saw a line of these same lights moving across the sky.  I think there must have been about 25 to 30 of these lights together, very tightly spaced.  I watched for a second and then realizing that what I was seeing had to be UFO's I ran into the house to get my son.  He didn't seem to be as excited about it as I was but we stood and watched until they faded into the horizon. The line of lights behaved like the second set of lights that I saw. There were smaller and larger lights and they all seemed to be moving around each other.  I don't know much about how ball lighting behaves but if ball lightning doesn't move in basically a straight line like a formation then I don't know what these things were that I saw.

All of a sudden a huge red sphere with a orange outside came from directly out of the north in a straight line.  It looked like it came from above Lake Huron.  Anyways it was the most beautiful red I have ever seen!! It flew in a straight line from North to south.  It then make a 90 degree turn and headed east in a straight line.  It then made another 90 degree turn straight upward and went straight up and went right out of site.  It climbed right up and out of site.  Now behind it were 2 others which did the same thing and were the same size.  It was absolutely breathtaking!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Bright light flashes me followe next day by weird creatures coming out of my mirror.,Slippery Rock,PA,2013-06-06T03:30:00,light,4 minutes,"Occurred : 6/6/2013 03:30  (Entered as : 06/06/13 03:30) Reported: 12/3/2013 6:10:21 PM 18:10 Posted: 12/5/2013 Location: Slippery Rock, PA Shape: Light Duration:4 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105063.html,"Bright light flashes me followe next day by weird creatures coming out of my mirror. I walked out on the stoup with my 2 dogs at 3:30 AM and looked across to the big tree about 50 feet away and above it was a big bright light.  I thought to myself, I should get my flashlight and flash them twice.  When I thought this they flashed me twice, on the second flash it faded out slowly like an opera light.   Which tells me they could read my thoughts from a distance, which amazed me. But on the very next night I was awakened at 4:00 AM by bright blue lights coming from my full length dressing mirror on my bedroom door.  And out of it came 3 weird creatures with long arms and fingers waving at me as they came towards me.  I threw something from my night stand at them and they went back into the mirror.  Then I had an implanted thought that they were dimensional travelers.  I watched my mirror turn with clouds and blue and white bolts of lightning coming down in it.  There were mountains and clouds behind it all.  Then it dissipated.  Ever since then I have a severe case insomnia and sleepwalking and do weird things when I am sleepwalking.  I am now seeing a sleep specialist and am scheduled for a sleep study on Dec. 19, 2013.  For the last six months there are punctures and scratches appearing on my legs in the morning like I have been out in the woods.  They shouldn't be there.  I pray to God that everything will work out for me.  I am telling you the truth to the best of my knowledge. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

"2 Orangish/Red/Yellow Oval Objects hovering over a Broken Arrow, OK residential district.",Broken Arrow,OK,2013-10-24T21:00:00,oval,15 minutes,"Occurred : 10/24/2013 21:00  (Entered as : 10/24/13 21:00) Reported: 12/4/2013 2:45:05 PM 14:45 Posted: 12/5/2013 Location: Broken Arrow, OK Shape: Oval Duration:15 minutes",http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/105/S105076.html,"2 Orangish/Red/Yellow Oval Objects hovering over a Broken Arrow, OK, residential district. I was on my way home from the local Library. I observed 2 orange objects hovering over a residential neighborhood. I thought they were Halloween Kites or remote control toys because it was Halloween and reasonable weather for kids/teens to be outside, although rare to see activity at this time of night in this part of the city.  I also thought they could be Street Lights within the neighborhood, but they were too high and orange...wrong color for street lights. I was on the phone with my son and told him I was going to pull into the neighborhood to verify what I was seeing.  I was astounded!  Absolutely no noise, no movement.  The objects change color only slightly from orange to orangish-red, then back to a orange/yellow mix as if to blend in with the street lights.  I stopped my car in the middle of the street, looked for my camcorder in the car and trunk.  Had kept it in my car for 2 weeks, but remembered I left it at home to charge the battery!  As I searche! d for it, I continued to peer up at the objects to insure I wasn't seeing things, all the while, discussing this with my son on the phone.  Not 1 car pulled into the neighborhood. I attempted to flag down a few cars on the main road but few were out and none responded.  I pointed to the sky and just as I decided to knock on a house door, the objects began moving.  There was no sound whatsoever.  They were approx. 150-200feet up and approximately 50-100ft.apart from each other.  They moved in unison laterally for about 100ft.,very slowly and methodically and then began an upward ascent in the same manner. Crossing over the main road heading south, southwest.  I didn't knock on anyone's door because this area is so quiet and didn't think anyone would believe me anyway.  Actually, was concerned they'd call the police, which in hindsight would have been appropriate but as I leaned against my car, frustrated no witnesses, no one noticing them, nothing on the radio reporting this sight! , the objects had moved away to a point not real visible from ! my car. They began to blend in with the night sky and I watched them fade away and blend in as if they were just another star in the sky!! I thought of calling the Airport or local News, but felt it was too late.  I listened for the next 2 months to Coast to Coast and now reports are coming in of these same type objects in various states. I also hear that Amazon has been testing Drones, so maybe that's what these were. I took my cousin back to the same area the next night at the same time thinking if it was kids an kites they'd most likely be out again since it was a Friday night, with no school the next day.  Nothing, absolutely no sign of any activity, kids, kites, nor Drones.  I am a Retired Postal Service Clerk and my son has an MBA in Finance. I told others about this incident and it does not surprise anyone. Seems most have given up caring...just gonna live as well and peaceful and happy as they can while waiting for the End Times to Arrive. Not a bad philosophy, but I intend ! to fight on and for the side of Good, not ready to surrender to Evil just yet.  Not that UFO's are necessarily Evil, but possibly those behind these drones and/or technology may very well be operating from a Dark Side.  Thank-you for the opportunity to report this!",2013-12-05T00:00:00,36.033572323759785,-95.74454621409922

I saw a disk or saucer shaped object fly from directly over my head to the horizon in a perfectly straight path.   The altitude was hard to judge but may have been 1000 to 5000 feet.   The object appeared about the size of a small plane.  It made no noise.   It took about seven seconds to reach the horizon, a distance of several miles.  The direction and speed and altitude never varied in the slightest degree. I thought it was some sort of drone but cannot find referance to any such thing officially existing anywhere.",2013-12-05T00:00:00,38.997117102137764,-77.12709453681711

On the fourth of November at approximately 20:00 I left my house after my television spontaneously switched channels.  Outside there was a ball of blue light falling from the sky far above the clouds near the city of Albuquerque on the eastern side close to the mountain.  Once it entered into the clouds the light could be seen to be a blue and green pulsating ball of light with a trail of white smoke behind it which was so pale it looked like steam.  It moved so fast, and appeared to be so large I expected to feel the impact, but I felt nothing.   About five minutes later three to five search planes began circling the area where light crashed and remained searching for at least an hour. There was no report of this incident, and I appear to be alone in this sighting.   If anyone else saw this event please step forward and provide a report.
